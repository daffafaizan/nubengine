      has expanded in its indications. The interplay between increased indications, surgeon
      experience, and improvements in equipment have all propelled arthroscopic shoulder surgery to
      preferred treatment in managing instability, rotator cuff, and impingement pathology.
      Obtaining adequate visual clarity is paramount to performing the procedures safely,
      efficiently, and effectively.

      A variety of methods have been employed to improve visualization. This includes tighter
      control of blood pressure, regional anesthetic, pressure controlled irrigation system, sealed
      cannulas, electrocautery devices, and injecting epinephrine into irrigation fluid. The use of
      epinephrine in irrigation fluid has been studied in literature. The results of a few
      randomized controlled trials demonstrate that the vasoconstrictive properties of epinephrine
      decrease blood flow and consequently, improves surgeon visualization. However, there has been
      reports of ventricular tachycardia, lethal arrhythmias, and epinephrine induced pulmonary
      edema in literature that suggests that the addition of epinephrine in irrigation fluid may
      have caused these adverse events. Therefore, it is important to examine other alternatives,
      such as TXA, that can decrease bleeding and improve visualization without potential
      detrimental effects.

      This trial will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, GCP, and the applicable
      regulatory requirements.
