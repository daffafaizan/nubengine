      design comparing a single acute dose of intranasal insulin to a single acute dose of a saline
      placebo.

      The primary aim will consist of exploring the differences in ingestive behaviors constructs
      (i.e. hunger, satiety, and fullness) and ad libitum lunch caloric intake between acute
      administration of either a dose of intranasal insulin or saline placebo. The hypothesis is
      that acute intranasal insulin will result in the consumption of fewer calories, greater
      feelings of satiety and fullness, and less hunger compared to acute saline. A secondary aim
      of this investigation will be to analyzing differences in food intake by APOE genotype,
      adiposity, and AD family history.
