      in inflammation ,apoptosis as well as relaxation of smooth muscle of the body. Now we have a
      hypothesis to use carbon monoxide in pulmonary hypertension of the newborns, to observe
      whether it will decrease pulmonary artery hypertension on newborns. Phase 1 study is ,the
      safety and Adverse reaction study of newborn to inhaled CO , after this,we can master the
      application of carbon monoxide dose
