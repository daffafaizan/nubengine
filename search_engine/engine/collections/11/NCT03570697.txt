      (FCT), in atherosclerotic plaques associated with treatment with evolocumab and maximally
      tolerated statin therapy with or without additional lipid-modifying medication in patients
      presenting with non-ST-segment elevation (NSTE)-ACS using optical coherence tomography
      (OCT;primary, secondary, and exploratory endpoints) and intravascular ultrasound (IVUS;
      exploratory endpoints only)
