      The high death rate stems from late presentation and tumor that has spread beyond the ovary
      at the time of diagnoses.

      Ovarian cancer typically spreads throughout the peritoneal cavity. Three randomized clinical
      trial have recently demonstrated the superiority of intraperitoneal(IP) over intravenous
      platinum based chemotherapy in optimally debulked advance ovarian cancer. The success of
      Bevacizumab in metastatic colorectal cancer has led to trials evaluating its' efficacy in
      advanced ovarian cancer. Based on the mechanism of action of Bevacizumab, there may be
      benefit of extended therapy with this agent.
