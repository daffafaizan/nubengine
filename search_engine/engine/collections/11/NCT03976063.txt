      one-third of preterm births. It is a leading cause of neonatal mortality and morbidity and
      increases the risk of maternal infectious morbidity. In cases of early PPROM (22 to 33
      completed weeks' gestation), expectant management is recommended in the absence of labor,
      chorioamnionitis or fetal distress. Antenatal steroids and antibiotics administration are
      recommended by international guidelines. However, there is no recommendation regarding
      tocolysis administration in the setting of PPROM. In theory, reducing uterine contractility
      should delay delivery and reduce risks of prematurity and neonatal adverse consequences.
      Likewise, a prolongation of gestation may allow administering a corticosteroids complete
      course that is associated with a two-fold reduction of morbidity and mortality. However,
      tocolysis may prolong fetal exposure to inflammation and be associated with higher risk of
      materno-fetal infection, potentially associated with neonatal death or long-term sequelae,
      including cerebral palsy.

      The purpose of this study is to assess whether short-term (48 hr) tocolysis reduces perinatal
      morti-morbidity in cases of PPROM at 22 to 33 completed weeks' gestation.
