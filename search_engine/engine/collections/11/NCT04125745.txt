    
      This is a single-center, one-arm, open-label proof of concept safety study and a phase 2a
      proof of efficacy pre- and post-assessment study of oral CXA-10 for the treatment of
      pulmonary arterial hypertension.

      The investigators hypothesize that administration of CXA-10 for 12 weeks will improves
      exercise capacity, cardiovascular function and health related quality of life in pulmonary
      arterial hypertension patients with limited toxicity.

      Subjects who meet the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be scheduled
      within 4 weeks of screening to receive oral CXA-10 at the dose of 300 mg once daily followed
      by 12 weeks of open-label CXA-10 treatment and then a 4-week safety follow-up. Additional
      follow-up assessments by telephone will occur in between each outpatient clinic visit.
