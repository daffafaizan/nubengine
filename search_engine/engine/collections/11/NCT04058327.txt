      manifestations of liver disease, not only increasing the risks of death, but also seriously
      affecting the lives of the patients and their caregivers. CHE includes the 1st stage of HE
      and minimal encephalopathy (MHE). It has indicated in a study that the mortality rates of
      covert hepatic encephalopathy (CHE) and overt hepatic encephalopathy (OHE) were both high
      (21% and 21.8% respectively). At present, CHE, especially MHE, is not easy to diagnose in
      daily clinical work. This study aims to early diagnose MHE and find suitable treatment to
      benefit patients. The investigators analyze the diagnostic efficacy of blood ammonia,
      neurophysiological/psychological tests and blood markers on MHE; to see the progression of HE
      under the condition of the drugs intervention and no drugs intervention in clinical real
      world.
