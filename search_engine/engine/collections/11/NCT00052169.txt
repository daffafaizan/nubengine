      average life expectancy of approximately 2 years. Novel treatments designed to exploit
      biologic properties of the tumor are urgently required as a means to improve the outcome for
      the large numbers of patients who relapse after receiving optimal chemotherapy treatments.

      Overexpresssion of EGFR and/or TGF-alpha is frequent in human breast cancer and has been
      correlated in many cases with poor prognostic features. Inhibition of the EGFR pathway has
      been proposed as a potential therapeutic modality in advanced breast cancer. The
      antiproliferative activity of ZD 1839 in combination with cytotoxic drugs, such as docetaxel
      was evaluated in breast cancer cell lines ZR-75-1 and MCF-10A ras that coexpress EGFR and
      TGF-alpha. Combination treatment demonstrated dose dependent supra-additive growth inhibition
      and markedly enhanced apoptotic cell death.

      Although taxanes bind to the microtubular network in cells that is essential for mitotic and
      interphase cellular functions, the mechanism by which these agents induce cell death is not
      entirely clear. Docetaxel has also shown dose-dependent anti-angiogenic activity. Thus, the
      mechanism(s) of anti-tumor activity of docetaxel remain unclear and combinations of signal
      transduction pathway inhibition and/or anti-angiogenesis may provide potentiation of
      concurrent ZD 1839 and docetaxel therapy.

      This phase 2 trial is designed to prospectively investigate the efficacy and safetey of
      combination therapy with ZD 1839 and docetaxel in patients with metastatic breast cancer.
