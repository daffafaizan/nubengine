      cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) for the treatment of EBV lymphoproliferative diseases (LPD) in
      organ transplant recipients. II. Determine the level of in vivo expansion of allogeneic CTL
      and the period of time during which these CTL's can be detected in the blood of recipients of
      the T cell infusions.

      OUTLINE: Donors undergo leukapheresis, and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) specific cytoxic T
      lymphocytes are cultivated in vitro. Patients receive infusions of EBV specific cytotoxic T
      lymphocytes over 5 to 10 minutes on weeks 0, 2, and 4. Patients with stable disease and those
      achieving partial remission are followed weekly for signs of disease progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 10 patients will be accrued in this study.
