      personalized medicine emphasizes that patients often have additional requirements for
      prescription medicines beyond just pain relief, including ease in taking medications and
      overall satisfaction with their care. Surveys indicate that 20% of adult patients either with
      or without pain have difficulty swallowing their medications, and up to 10% refuse to take a
      specific therapy because they cannot swallow the pills [1-3]. It is likely that this issue
      compromises the quantity, quality, and satisfaction with pain relief from oral opioids.

      Xtampza ER is an opioid analgesic consisting of a microsphere-containing capsule that can be
      opened so the microspheres can be added to soft food. This drug is designed to overcome
      capsule-swallowing issues and therefore may be an important tool for personalized pain
      medicine care. This study will investigate the pharmaceutic delivery properties of Xtampza to
      determine whether it is an improved alternative to the pill-swallowing problems that are
      common with opioid drugs.
