      studies suggest that the severity of AS is also influenced to a large extent by genetic
      factors. The goal of this study is to identify genes that influence the severity of AS. We
      hypothesize that genetic markers of susceptibility, including human leukocyte antigen (HLA)
      polymorphisms, are among the genes that also influence the severity of AS. Other genes that
      could potentially influence the severity of AS include those that affect the severity of
      joint inflammation and those that influence bone formation.

      In this cross-sectional study, we will test the association of HLA markers and polymorphisms
      in several genes involved in the regulation of inflammation and bone formation with the
      severity of AS. Approximately 500 patients will be enrolled. Each patient will have had AS
      for at least 20 years. Measures of AS severity will be the extent of spinal fusion as
      measured radiographically, functional disability, time to permanent work disability, and need
      for total hip arthroplasty.

      Identifying genetic markers that are associated with differences in the severity of AS will
      greatly enhance our understanding of the pathogenesis of this disease by suggesting
      mechanisms and pathways involved in the development of long-term damage. In a separate but
      related protocol, we will assess genetic markers associated with persistent active
      inflammation in patients with AS.
