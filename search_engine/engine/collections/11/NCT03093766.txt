      still not fully understood. Sodium overload and inadequate fluid administration are generally
      considered important factors, but a previous retrospective study did not reveal differences
      in sodium or fluid balances between patients who did and did not develop IAH. Because this
      was retrospective these balances will be prospectively studied in this study to be more sure
      about the importances of these balances in the development of IAH. Previous studies indicated
      that (a lot) more factors contribute to the development of IAH. In this study these factors
      will be investigated, hoping to find differences between patients who do and do not develop
      IAH.
