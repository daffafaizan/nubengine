      major contaminants of agricultural produce such as maize. Acute aflatoxin exposure (i.e.,
      aflatoxicosis) can lead to jaundice, vomiting, abdominal pain, and liver failure, with
      documented fatality rates as high as 40%. Kenya experiences extreme aflatoxin exposure and
      fatal, recurring aflatoxicosis outbreaks. Numerous clinical trials have found heat processed
      calcium dioctahedral smectite clay [i.e., Air Classified Calcium Silicate (ACCS100)] to be
      safe and effective in binding to aflatoxin to decrease bioavailability and subsequently
      reduce toxin-induced effects. The investigators propose to pilot test the effectiveness,
      acceptability, and palatability of ACCS100 in a high-risk Kenyan population. If successful,
      ACCS100 could be scaled-up for use in Kenya to prevent aflatoxin-associated mortality during
      high-risk periods. To accomplish this objective, the investigators will recruit fifty health
      adults into a crossover study. Each participant will spend one week consuming ACCS100 and one
      week consuming a calcium carbonate placebo. Daily first morning void urine samples will
      monitor effectiveness in reducing aflatoxin bioavailability, and periodic questionnaires will
      assess acceptance and palatability.
