      transperineal prostate biopsy protocol integrating measures to reduce post procedural
      infection (Cases) to traditional transrectal prostate biopsies (Controls). Eligible subjects
      will be identified through administrative records in the Urology clinics affiliated with
      Maimonides Medical Center. Eligible patients will be counseled about the risks and benefits
      of participation and offered enrollment into the study. Demographic data including age,
      comorbidities and past medical history will be extracted from the medical record.

      Men meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria will be prospectively enrolled. The novel
      transperineal protocol will include the following: (Cases)

        1. Transperineal biopsy approach with avoidance of rectal flora

        2. MRI-ultrasound fusion-guided biopsies with reduced number of biopsy cores, where
           clinically indicated

        3. Rectal swab to identify the presence of fluoroquinolone resistant (FQR) bacteria

        4. Multi-antibiotic prophylaxis

        5. Urine culture, prostate tissue culture and rectal swab culture to define contemporary,
           region-specific antibiotic resistance patterns.

      Traditional biopsy protocol includes: (Controls)

        1. Transrectal approach

        2. Standard 12-core template

        3. Surgeon-specific antibiotic prophylaxis

        4. Urine culture, prostate tissue culture and FQR rectal swab culture to define
           contemporary, region-specific antibiotic resistance patterns.
