      potential transmission route.

      The transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus in humans is thought to be
      via at least 3 sources: 1) inhalation of liquid droplets produced by and/or 2) close contact
      with infected persons and 3) contact with surfaces contaminated with severe acute respiratory
      syndrome coronavirus. There are many respiratory diseases spread by the airborne route such
      as tuberculosis, measles and chickenpox. Several studies suggested that airborne spread may
      have played an important role in the transmission of that disease. At present, there is
      little information on the characteristics of airborne severe acute respiratory syndrome
      coronavirus containing aerosols, their concentration, or their infectivity.

      The aim was to determine airborne severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
      transmission, their infectivity in in different areas such as patient's room and in medical
      staff area.

      Methods

      Cross sectional study of samples from environmental of patientÂ´s room, and medical staff
      area. Samples will be taken of air using microbial air monitoring systems, and from different
      surfaces of patient's room and medical staff area, such as computers, mouse and personal
      protective equipment using cotton swabs. Viral RNA will be determined using
      Real-Time-Polymerase-Chain Reaction. In positive samples infectiveness will be determined by
      cell culture under biosecurity conditions.

      Statistical analysis will be performed to determine prevalence of positive samples and
      positive cell culture whit STATA version 15.1.

      informed consent will be obtained from all participants
