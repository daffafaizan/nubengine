      greater than 40 years old. Rotator cuff tears after dislocation of the shoulder are more of a
      challenge to repair particularly if there is a delay in diagnosis. Clinical experience would
      suggest that rotator cuff repair within the first month of injury allows for better results
      in acute rotator cuff tears without shoulder dislocation. There are no reported results for
      rotator cuff repairs following shoulder dislocation and timing of repair. If we find that
      early repair provides better results this will be important for Primary Care Providers and
      Emergency Department physicians to refer these patients early for evaluation and subsequently
      earlier treatment.
