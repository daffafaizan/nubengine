      (NYU LFHC) and providers at the school-based clinics in referring Hispanic children ages 9-11
      years with a BMI between the 95th and 99th percentile to the study. In addition, a list will
      be generated from NYU Lutheran's Quality Improvement department if recruitment through
      providers is low. Providers will refer patients who meet the above criteria through
      eClincialWorks (ECW). A research assistant will then randomize the referrals after acquiring
      informed consent forms to either the control group or the intervention group. The control
      group will receive standard of care by nutritionists at NYU LFHC. The intervention group will
      receive a 27-hour intervention session which will be split into a 12-session series. The
      sessions will be conducted weekly over a 3 month period. This study will include three cycles
      with three separate cohorts.

      The Healthy Families Intervention Group will include:

        1. Bilingual English and Spanish group nutrition education, behavioral social support, and
           physical activity (e.g. kickboxing, Zumba, yoga, aerobics).

        2. Monthly home visits by a nutritionist for family including specific recommendations on
           food purchasing and preparation.

      Children randomized to standard of care will attend monthly sessions with a nutritionist.
