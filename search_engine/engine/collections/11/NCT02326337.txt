      standardized off-loading device, advanced moist wound therapy (AMWT) dressings and will
      receive sharp debridement. Subjects with wounds that do not decrease more than 30% at the end
      of the 2 week run-in period and where all other eligibility criteria are met, will be
      randomized to either the TWO2 device arm, or sham (placebo) device arm.

      All subjects will use the TWO2/Sham device for 90 minutes a day at their home or nursing care
      facility 5 times a week for the treatment phase of up to 12 weeks. Monitoring of the wound
      will take place with weekly clinic visits for safety and compliance assessment and
      documentation. Weekly wound photographs and measurements will be taken. Wounds that close at,
      or before, 12 weeks will continue to use TWO2/sham device, off-loading and AMWT and have an
      additional visit two weeks later to confirm wound closure. All subjects whether healed or not
      will enter a follow up period of an additional 12 and 38 weeks.

      The maximum duration for participation in the trial is 54 weeks. During the follow-up phase,
      subjects will receive standard care according to the clinician's recommendation and will be
      asked not to participate in another wound care trial during this period.
