      who have advanced malignancies. This study determined the dose-limiting toxicity, maximum
      tolerated dose, safety and pharmacokinetics (how the drug moves through the body) for
      alisertib when given once or twice a day for 7 to 21 days. This open label study enrolled 87
      participants. Participants were enrolled in one of 3 treatment groups:

        -  Powder-in-Capsule (PIC) Dose Escalation (alisertib 5, 10, 20, 40, 80, 110 or 150 mg PIC
           , once daily (QD) for 7 days (D),or alisertib 25 mg, PIC, orally, QD 14D, or alisertib
           25, 50 or 70 mg, PIC, orally, QD 21D, or alisertib 50 or 60 mg, PIC, orally, twice daily
           (BID) 7D, alisertib 40 mg, PIC, orally, BID 14D

        -  ECT Dose Escalation (alisertib 10 or 20 mg, Enteric-coated Tablets (ECT), orally, QD for
           7 to 21 days

        -  Relative Bioavailability (alisertib 40 mg ECT or PIC, orally, BID 7D in cycle 1,
           followed by alisertib 40 mg in the opposite formulation (PIC or ECT) orally, BID 7D in
           cycle 2, followed by alisertib 50 mg PIC orally, BID 7D in each additional All
           participants received treatment until their disease progressed or they experienced
           unacceptable alisertib-related toxicity. This multi-center trial was conducted in the
           United States. The overall time to participate in this study was 1011 days. Participants
           made multiple visits to the clinic, including a final visit 30 days after receiving
           their last dose of alisertib for a follow-up assessment.
