      to take a beetroot juice supplement, which naturally contains a high concentration of
      nitrates, and a nitrate-free (placebo) beetroot supplement. In a double blind way,
      participants will be randomised to the order in which they receive the 2 treatments with
      crossover of the treatments. There will be a washout period between the two treatments.

      In order to assess cardiac and autonomic function, and risk of heart rhythm abnormalities,
      tests will be carried out before and after each treatment period

      Hypotheses:

        -  Nitrate supplementation reverses the autonomic dysfunction seen in Chronic Heart Failure
           (CHF)

        -  Markers of prognostic significance for predicting SCD, including QT variability index
           and cardiac restitution properties (R2I2, PERS), are normalised by nitrate
           supplementation in patients with CHF.

        -  Nitrate supplementation results in functional improvement in CHF patients.
