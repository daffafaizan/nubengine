    
      The main objective of this open-label Phase I / II clinical trial is to evaluate the safety
      and therapeutic efficacy of a hematopoietic gene therapy procedure with an orphan drug
      consisting of a lentiviral vector carrying the FANCA gene for patients with Fanconi's Anemia
      Subtype A.

      The drug to be administered to the patients consists of the cellular product resulting from
      the transduction of autologous CD34 + cells with the therapeutic lentiviral vector
      PGK-FANCA.Wpre *.

      The dose of cells to infuse in the patients will be that obtained from the transduction
      process of between 3x10^5 and 4x10^6 CD34 + cells / kg of patient body weight.

      The cells will be infused intravenously in a single dose, after complete the transduction
      process.

      Follow-up period: 3 years after infusion of transduced cells. However, patients will be
      monitored outside the clinical trial over a 10-year period.

      Follow-up of the grafted transduced cells will be performed on peripheral blood and bone
      marrow samples.
