      non-pulsatile blood flow measured by a special pulse oximeter. PI represents the baseline
      sympathetic tone which is assumed one of the factors contributing for hypotension. Patients
      with low PI were reported by Mahendale and Rajasekhar to show greater hypotension after
      induction of anesthesia. This was explained by the high sympathetic tone in these patients
      which is suddenly masked by propofol administration leading to profound hypotension.
      Moreover, The PI has been described as a reliable tool for vascular tone assessment and
      monitoring.

      Dicrotic Plethysmography (Dicpleth): is easily derived from the photoplethysmographic signal.
      It represents the relative height of the dicrotic wave compared with the maximum peak of the
      waveform, has been described as the amount of reflected wave, dependent on the vascular tone.
      M.Coutrot et al quantified Dicpleth variations to detect arterial hypotension and mentioned
      that Dicpleth and PI are both related to vascular tone and are easily derived from the
      photoplethysmographic signal. Moreover, Chowienczyk PJ et. al. demonstrated that the
      reduction in Dicpleth is related to the reduction of vascular tone caused by vasodilator
      drugs, such as salbutamol or glyceryl trinitrate
