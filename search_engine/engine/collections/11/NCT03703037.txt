      E. Gonzalez after the approval of Institutional ethical committee. Women with low risk late
      term or postterm pregnancy (at least 41 weeks) with confirm gestational age who will be
      referred to our Maternal-fetal unit and admitted 1 to 2 days prior to induction of labour
      according institutional protocol will be recruited and constitute the cohort.

      Cases will be patients with abnormal intrapartum cardiotocogram (category III fetal heart
      rate tracing). For each case, four controls will be matched. The primary outcome will be to
      obtain odds ratios for the Doppler parameters (middle cerebral artery pulsatility index, mean
      uterine artery pulsatility index and Middle cerebral artery pulsatility index to mean uterine
      artery pulsatility index ratio) and amniotic fluid index that would be associated with
      intrapartum category III fetal heart rate tracing.
