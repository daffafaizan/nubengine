      lead to decreased efficiency of postural control and functional activity. Clinical
      manifestations of patients with Parkinson's Disease include postural instability. Core system
      could be relevant to be included in an intervention. Thus, the objective of this study was to
      evaluate the effects of an intervention based on core stability in patients with Parkinson's
      Disease.
