      disease prevention in six general internal medicine and family medicine clinics within the
      University of Colorado Hospital system using electronic health record data.

      We will develop messages concerning the appropriate use of aspirin for cardiovascular disease
      prevention for academic detailing to clinicians, a point of care (EHR) decision support aid
      for clinicians, and a short information sheet (generated by a CDS) for patients.

      We will test the effectiveness of interventions to improve the evidence-based use of aspirin
      for primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease using a randomized trial in
      the six University of Colorado Hospital primary care practices studied. The three
      intervention arms will include:

      1.academic detailing and cessation of the primary prevention reminder within the point of
      care clinical decision support system (EHR/CDS) only 2. academic detailing with an EHR/CDS
      message asking clinicians to consider stopping aspirin therapy for primary prevention
      embedded in the point of care clinical decision support system 3. academic detailing with the
      EHR/CDS point of care message for clinicians in the second paragraph above, and a short
      information sheet to be given to patients prior to a visit to ask them to check with their
      provider concerning their use of aspirin for primary prevention
