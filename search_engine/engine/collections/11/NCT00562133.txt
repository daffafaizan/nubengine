      objective of the study is to evaluate the postprandial time course of nitrotyrosine after
      injection of insulin glulisine compared with regular human insulin. 2) Secondary objectives:
      The secondary objectives are to evaluate the postprandial time course of blood glucose,
      insulin, intact proinsulin, asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), metal matrix proteasis
      (MMP-9), free fatty acids (FFA), oxidised LDL (ox-LDL), oxidative status (per ox), IL-18 as
      well as postprandial time course of microvascular blood circulation measured with
      laserdopplerflux at 37 °C (LDF37) and 44 C (LDF44).
