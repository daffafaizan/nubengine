      of diseased lung areas, have been recently described amongst patients with COVID19. In this
      triple-blind pilot randomised trial, adult patients with high clinical suspicion of SARS-CoV2
      infection and perfusion defects in a substraction computed tomography angiography will be
      randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive sildenafil or placebo. Informed consent will be obtained
      from every included participant. Patients requiring mechanical ventilation at baseline will
      be excluded, as will those who present a contraindication to sildenafil, previous users of
      sildenafil, those requiring therapy with nitrates, patients in which an order to limit
      therapeutic efforts has been issued, pregnant or breastfeeding women and those who decline to
      participate in this study. The primary outcome for this trial wil be oxygenation changes in
      blood gas analyses. Secondary outcomes will include clinical deterioration requiring
      admission to an intensive care unit, requirement of high-flow nasal cannula or invasive
      mechanical ventilation and overall survival. Patients will be followed-up until hospital
      discharge or up to fifteen days after randomisation. Statistical analyses will be undertaken
      by a statistician unaware of treatment allocation under the intention-to-treat principle.
