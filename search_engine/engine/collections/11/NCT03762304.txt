      control at the population level in many low- and middle-income countries.

      This observational study will use a quasi-experimental regression discontinuity design to
      evaluate the effect of household-based screening for blood pressure with care encouragement
      for potentially hypertensive individuals on subsequent changes in blood pressure over time.

      Individuals had their blood pressure measured in the household as part of the National Income
      Dynamics Study data collection. If individuals had a measured blood pressure in the
      hypertensive zone, they were told that they had elevated blood pressure, that high blood
      pressure can lead to life threatening consequences, and that they should seek further care.
      The study exploits the fact that individuals were given this information based on a hard
      blood pressure cutoff. Therefore, the investigators will evaluate the causal effect of this
      household-based intervention in the absence of randomization by comparing individuals with a
      baseline blood pressure just above and below the cut off.
