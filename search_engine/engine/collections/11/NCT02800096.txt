      participants will be screened using an online survey to identify participants meeting
      criteria for problem gambling. As part of the baseline screening process, measures of current
      depression and anxiety will be assessed. Eligible participants agreeing to take part in the
      study will be randomized to one of two versions of an online intervention for gamblers - an
      intervention that just targets gambling issues (G-only) versus one that contains
      interventions for anxiety and depression in addition to an intervention for gamblers (G+MH).
      It is predicted that problem gamblers who do not have co-occurring mental health concerns
      will display no significant difference between intervention conditions at a six-month
      follow-up. However, for those with co-occurring mental health concerns, it is predicted that
      participants receiving access to G+MH website will display significantly reduced gambling
      outcomes at six-month follow-up as compared to those provided with G-only website.
