      safety and, secondarily, the efficacy of PDT using Levulan and 630 nm light in the treatment
      of benign dermal neurofibromas. This protocol represents the first two parts of a planned
      three part study including both pediatric and adult subjects. Part 1 will consist of studying
      the penetration and uptake of the PS in neurofibromas that are scheduled for excision. These
      tumors will be excised for therapeutic reasons unrelated to this study, and so this study
      will place no further burden on the subject other than a 3-24 hr incubation of the Levulan on
      the tumor prior to excision. The primary hypothesis to be tested is whether Levulan will
      accumulate, and be converted to PpIX, by the tumor tissue more than by the surrounding normal
      tissue. Secondary hypotheses are that tumors incubated with Levulan will show greater
      fluorescence than untreated tumors and tumors incubated with vehicle only (placebo
      application).

      As the Institutional Review Boards involved generally desire pilot data on adult populations
      first, we will with then proceed with the adult clinical trial portion of this protocol as
      part 2. Part 2 will use the optimum incubation time, if one has been identified in part 1,
      and add a dose escalation study of the amount of red light used to activate the Levulan. Part
      3, with pediatric subjects, will commence at a future date, pending review of the initial
      adult study results.
