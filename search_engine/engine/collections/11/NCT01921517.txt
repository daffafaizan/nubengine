      bone formation. During the past several years a number of articles have appeared
      demonstrating that low-magnitude mechanical stimulation (LMMS) is osteogenic in animals and
      also in humans. Preclinical studies have also demonstrated an effect of decrease in
      adiposity. The mechanobiology underlying these phenomena is beginning to emerge in terms of
      expression of genes stimulated by the action of the vibrations to which osteocytes and
      adipocytes are subjected.

      If successful, LMMS treatment, a non-pharmacologic intervention, could prevent bone loss and
      potentially stimulate bone formation and decreased adipocyte production resulting in
      increased bone strength and reduced fracture susceptibility in subjects at risk of developing
      osteoporosis. The proposed project focuses directly on measures of strength by evaluating the
      therapeutic response in terms of magnetic resonance (MR) image-based micro finite-element
      (FE) assessment of bone stiffness and failure strength, along with quantifying
      treatment-induced changes in marrow adiposity, as part of a single, integrated examination,
      conducted at baseline and 12 months of treatment in a double-blinded, randomized,
      placebo-controlled study of early postmenopausal women.
