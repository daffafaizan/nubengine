    
      This is a Phase 1, randomized (study medication assigned to participants by chance),
      double-blind (neither Investigator nor participant knows which treatment the participant
      receives), placebo-controlled (placebo is an inactive substance that is compared with a drug
      to test whether the drug has a real effect in a clinical trial), single-center, single-dose
      and 3-way crossover (the same medications provided to all participants but in different
      sequence) study of esketamine in healthy participants. Participants will be randomly assigned
      to 1 of 6 treatment sequences. The study will consist of 3 parts: Screening Phase (between 21
      days and 1 day prior to the first dose administration), a 3-way crossover double-blind,
      single dose treatment Phase (45 days) and follow-up Phase (7 to 10 days after last dose
      administration). The maximum study duration for each participant will not exceed 7 weeks.
      Participants will receive either Treatment A (esketamine 84 milligram (mg) intranasal and 1
      placebo capsule), Treatment B (placebo intranasal and 1 mirtazapine 30 mg capsule) or
      Treatment C (placebo intranasal and placebo capsule) in each treatment period. Driving
      performance will be assessed primarily by the mean difference of SDLP from an on road driving
      test. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.
