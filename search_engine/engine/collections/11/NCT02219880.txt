      Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD). Secondary aims of the study are to confirm the
      relationship between specific genetic variations and response to Kava, and to explore the
      effects of Kava on the expression of specific genes.

      Consenting participants will be randomly allocated to take either Kava or placebo over 18
      weeks. They will be assessed at regular interviews throughout the trial and will have four
      blood tests (liver function tests to monitor participant safety, and collection of genetic
      material providing information on neurochemistry). The design of the study is a multi-centre,
      18-week, 2-arm, double-blind randomised clinical trial (RCT) using a standardised
      pharmaceutical-grade water-soluble extract of Kava (240mg of kavalactones per day) versus
      placebo in 210 adults with GAD.
