      Hospitals CHU de Nice-Lenval. This proportion is significant and steadily increasing (2013:
      820 newborns or 1.46% of passes). The experienced team of pediatric emergency is that the
      majority of consultations respite care and child care could well be managed city. The
      bibliographic data confirms this feeling.

      birth, the HAS recommends a medical examination by a pediatrician (or a general practitioner
      with experience of pathologies of the newborn) between 6 and 10 days of life. Other
      consultations (midwife, health visitor in PMI) is not required. Moreover, in its brochure to
      mothers, prompt medical attention is recommended in certain situations (fever, vomiting ...)
      but without specifying the organization. The pediatric emergency therefore no place, except
      for emergencies, in the course of care of newborns. But the care pathway proposed by the HAS
      is it feasible? And it reduces unnecessary use of pediatric emergency?
