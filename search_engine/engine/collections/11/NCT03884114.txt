      educational institutions. Objective structural clinical examination (OSCE) and assessments in
      high-fidelity (HF) simulation settings represent interesting evaluation modalities but are
      associated with huge costs, especially when they are used for large-scale standardized
      assessments. Multiple choice questionnaires (MCQ) remain the most common evaluation tool in
      medical schools.

      Simulation games may represent an interesting compromise between the cheap but limited
      assessment allowed by MCQs, and the comprehensive but highly expensive assessment allowed by
      OSCE and HF simulation.

      This study, focusing on the management of pediatric asthma exacerbations, assesses the
      clinical skills of medical students using three different evaluation tools: (i) the
      simulation game "Effic'Asthme" developed to train individuals on the management of pediatric
      asthma exacerbations; (ii) a MCQ on the same subject developed for the purpose of the study
      and (iii) HF-simulation, considered as the gold-standard for its enhanced realism.

      Its objective is to determine which of the simulation game or the MCQ reflects the best the
      clinical competence of medical students evaluated on a HF simulator.
