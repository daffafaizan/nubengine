      III B with malignant pleural effusion or Stage IV NSCLC treated with docetaxel and
      carboplatin with or without suramin.

      The secondary objectives are to compare median overall survival rate, compare overall
      response rate of patients in both arms, assess toxicity of suramin with docetaxel and
      carboplatin, determine whether pre-treatment bFGF levels correlate with survival, to
      determine whether survival benefit from suramin is associated with M phase entry in
      peripheral blood lymphocytes, and to determine whether adding suramin to docetaxel and
      carboplatin produces greater survival benefits in African-American patients.
