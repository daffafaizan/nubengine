      people, almost all suffering from Type 2 Diabetes. It is the fourth leading cause of death in
      developed countries due to the negative impact of the disease on the cardiovascular system.
      Treatment, aimed to the reduction of this intrinsic cardiovascular risk, is based on tight
      control of glucose and all coexisting metabolic abnormalities as well as of biomarkers of
      inflammation and atherogenesis.

      Macrovascular complications account for the vast majority of morbidity and mortality in
      diabetic patients, and there is growing evidence that pathophysiologic mechanisms other than
      hyperglycemia are responsible. The condition of the vascular endothelium in particular has
      been shown to effect the health and disease of the cardiovascular system.

      The number and function of endothelial progenitor cells correlate inversely with
      cardiovascular risk factors and may be a surrogate biologic marker for vascular function and
      cumulative cardiovascular risk.

      Pioglitazone is an orally active thiazolidinedione derivative. It is a ligand for peroxisome
      proliferator-activated receptor-gamma activation that alters transcription of various genes
      regulating carbohydrate and lipid metabolism.
