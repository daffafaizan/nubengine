      show decreased levels of HIV-specific immune responses. In these patients, a prime-boost
      vaccine strategy may induce both humoral and cell-mediated immunity. The hypothesis of this
      study is that the vaccine strategy selected will be both safe and immunogenic in the patient
      population being tested.

      Patients continue antiretroviral medications throughout the course of this study. Three
      groups of patients receive dose-escalation (0.5mg, 2mg or 4mg) intramuscular injections of
      DNA vaccine (D-GPEi) respectively, the other three groups of patients receive dose-escalation
      (3×10^7pfu, 1×10^8pfu or 3×10^8pfu) intradermal injections of MVA vaccine (M-GPE), two weeks
      post immunization of lower dose, if the vaccine is safe and well tolerant, the next dose of
      immunization will begin. After the maximum tolerated dose of DNA and MVA is identified, DNA
      prime/ MVA boosting will be tested in another two groups of patients. Lower or the maximum
      tolerated dose of D-GPEi was used at week 0 and 1, lower or the maximum tolerated dose of
      M-GPE was used at week 2 and 3, patients are monitored for safety 72 hours after each
      immunization. In addition, each patient records adverse events in a diary. Patients have
      regular physical exams, pregnancy tests, and blood drawn for virologic and immunologic
      assessments. The induction of HIV-specific responses will be measured.
