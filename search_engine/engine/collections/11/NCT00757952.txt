        -  Identify patterns of exhaled compounds in breath samples from patients with newly
           diagnosed ovarian epithelial cancer that are significantly and reproducibility different
           from those of healthy volunteers using gas chromatography Fourier transform ion
           cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (GC/FT-ICR MS).

        -  Train five canines to discriminate between exhaled breath samples from patients with
           newly diagnosed ovarian epithelial cancer and healthy volunteers.

        -  Use both canine olfaction and GC/FT-ICR MS to distinguish between exhaled breath samples
           from patients with newly diagnosed ovarian epithelial cancer and patients with
           polycystic ovarian syndrome or endometriosis.

        -  Repeat breath sampling in patients with newly diagnosed ovarian epithelial cancer
           throughout the course of diagnosis and therapy.

      OUTLINE: Exhaled breath samples are collected from patients and healthy volunteers. The
      samples are analyzed by gas chromatography Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass
      spectrometry (GC/FT-ICR MS) to determine chemical compositions, identities, and predictive
      patterns of biomarkers in exhaled breath condensate. GC/FT-ICR MS and trained canine
      olfaction are used to distinguish between exhaled breath samples from patients with ovarian
      epithelial cancer, patients with polycystic ovarian syndrome or endometriosis, and healthy
      volunteers.

      Patients and healthy volunteers complete questionnaires about BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 status (if
      known), alcohol use, smoking (including duration and type of cigarettes), physical activity
      (duration and type), socioeconomic status, education, county of residence, age at menopause
      (if applicable), age at menarche, presence of first- and second-degree family history of
      breast cancer or ovarian epithelial cancer, body mass index (height and weight), and
      co-morbidities.
