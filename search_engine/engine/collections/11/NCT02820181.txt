      understand the immediate postoperative and long-term management of tracheostomy patients. To
      provide safe and competent care, tracheostomy tubes must be taken care of carefully,
      including cleaning or changing the inner cannula, caring for the stoma, suctioning at least 3
      times a day, and replacing tracheostomy ties according to facility-specific policy as needed.
      However, to avoid inadvertent dislodgement of the tracheostomy tube, the process of ties
      exchange is always risky and complicated, which request one person to hold the tube in place
      while a second person performs the tie exchange.

      The investigators designed a novel tracheostomy tie to ensure the safety during exchanging
      and conveniences of cleaning, the primary feature of which is double belts and easy to
      operate. This randomized controlled trial is to determine if the new device is better than
      the traditional one.

      Sixty tracheotomy patients without an existing neck injury will be recruited . Patients in
      experimental group wear a novel tracheostomy tie. The traditional one was used in control
      group. Difficulty level of exchanging or cleaning the tracheostomy ties, degree of comfort,
      skin breakdown and the actually frequency of exchanging will be evaluated.
