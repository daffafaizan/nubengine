      echocardiography in normal volunteers and patients with cardiovascular disease. Tissue
      Doppler ultrasound is a technology which has been validated for the analysis of global and
      regional left ventricular function and strain and SR measurements are derived from tissue
      Doppler imaging (TDI) data. Over the last few years, several improvements in echo machine
      hardware and software have facilitated the rapid acquisition and analysis of tissue Doppler
      data, and therefore, strain and strain rate information has become easily accessible. Recent
      publications have demonstrated the usefulness of these techniques in the analysis of systolic
      and diastolic function of the left ventricle, and in the detection of regional wall motion
      and ischemia. Several protocols recently initiated in the Cardiovascular Branch involve
      echocardiographic imaging and include applications of TDI as their primary or secondary
      endpoints. Therefore, the purpose of this protocol is to allow development of standardized
      acquisition and analysis methods of TDI for our cardiology protocols and to evaluate the
      reproducibility of TDI, SR, and strain measurements.
