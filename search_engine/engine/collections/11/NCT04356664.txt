      responsible for pain and infertility. Adenomyosis illustrates an invagination of endometrial
      islets within the myometrium, leading to a disturbance of its contractile activity, also
      potentiated by local hyperestrogenism.

      These two pathologies are often associated, and express an alteration of the eutopic
      endometrium by pro-inflammatory markers responsible for a lower implantation rate.

      GnRH agonists are known to decrease these pro-inflammatory markers (cytochrome P450 and Cox 2
      aromatase) in the eutopic endometrium of women with endometriosis or adenomyosis.

      Patients will received 1 or 2 injection of GnRH delay agonist (Decapeptyl 3mg) approximately
      1 month before the frozen embryo transfer.
