      used the last 15 years to treat JIA patients with unilateral TMJ arthritis. More
      specifically, the purpose is to evaluate the mandibular growth in all JIA patients with
      unilateral TMJ arthritis and an asymmetric mandibular growth pattern treated with
      non-surgical distraction splint therapy between 1994 and 2010 at the dep. of Orthodontics,
      Aarhus University, Denmark. The evaluation is based on radiological examinations at the
      beginning of their non-surgical distraction treatment as well as after the patients have
      finished their distraction-splint therapy.
