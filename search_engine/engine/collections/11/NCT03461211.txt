    
      This is a multi-center, open-label extension study of HZNP-TEP-301 (NCT03298867) examining
      the safety and efficacy of teprotumumab in the treatment of TED in adult participants.
      Participants who complete the 24-week double-masked Treatment Period in Study HZNP-TEP-301
      and are proptosis non-responders or were proptosis responders at Week 24 but meet the
      criteria for re-treatment due to relapse during the Follow-Up Period of HZNP-TEP-301 will be
      eligible for enrollment.

      All participants who choose to participate will receive 8 infusions of teprotumumab (10 mg/kg
      for the first infusion followed by 20 mg/kg for the remaining 7 infusions) in an open-label
      fashion.The Baseline (Day 1) Visit of this extension study will occur within 14 days after
      the final visit of Study HZNP-TEP-301 (Week 24 for proptosis non-responders and up to Week 72
      for participants who relapse). During the open-label Treatment Period, study drug infusions
      are scheduled for Day 1 (Baseline), and Weeks 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, and 21, (with the final
      visit at Week 24). After completion of the Treatment Period, subjects who were proptosis
      non-responders in Study HZNP-TEP-301 will enter a 24-week Follow-Up Period during which study
      drug will not be administered and clinic visits are scheduled for 1, 3, and 6 months (Visits
      Month 7, 9, and 12) after the Week 24 visit. Subjects will be contacted 6 and 12 months later
      by phone or email to enquire if any treatment for TED had been received since the last study
      contact.

      Participants who relapse during the Follow-Up Period of HZNP-TEP-301 and choose to enter this
      extension study will not participate in the Follow-Up Period of this study but will be
      contacted by phone or email 6 and 12 months after the Week 24 visit.
