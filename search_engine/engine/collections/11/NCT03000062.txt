      Many patients wish to discuss their weight problem with their family physician but many of
      these feel helpless to guide their patients in how to reduce weight. Providing useful and
      correct information should not be so difficult but many doctors choose to refer their
      patients to dietary courses or follow-up in specialist health care.In this study the
      investigators wish to implement a simple tool for treatment of overweight in primary care by
      providing the patients a detailed list for all meals that will ensure a weight loss. The
      patients will be given a close follow-up by their doctor, and the motivating conversation and
      list of meals will be the only treatment given.

      The study is a cluster randomised controlled trial where all general practices in the area of
      Moss city in Norway will be asked to participate. Half of the physicians will constitute the
      intervention group while the other half will serve as control group. Each participating
      doctor in both groups will recruit patients according to the eligibility criteria. The
      doctors in the intervention group will be provided with a course to learn the intervention
      and have a manual to follow for each patient. All participating patients of both groups will
      be asked to meet regularly for data collection.

      According to the power calculation, a number of 12 physicians in each group will be
      sufficient if they recruit 10 patients each.

      The intervention will be conducted for 12 months and thereafter data will be continued to be
      collected at 6 and 12 months after.
