      (MPA), the active immunosuppressant.

      MMF significantly decreases the episodes of acute rejection in kidney transplant patients;
      but as with any medication without adequate pharmacokinetic drug monitoring, the issue of
      under or over immunosuppression arises. For this reason, the biggest challenge lies with
      establishing a feasible mean of MPA pharmacokinetic monitoring. Thus far no study has shown
      that measuring MPA trough levels alone correlates with rejection, unlike MPA Area Under the
      concentration time Curve (AUC), due to the large incidence of inter- and intra-patient
      variability.

      This is the first prospective blinded trial set up to analyze the correlation between
      individualized MPA AUC and trough levels of kidney transplant patients in hopes of
      establishing a more efficacious way of monitoring MPA. MPA target trough levels that
      correspond to AUC greater than 30 mg x h/L could then be utilized as maintenance
      measurements.
