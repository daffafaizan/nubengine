      Clinic and the Pediatric Sleep Clinic in the DCAM as well as LaRabida Children's Hospital
      complaining of sleep problems. The questions asked are those routinely obtained in clinical
      practice of sleep medicine. Medical students, residents and faculty as part of their normal
      clinical responsibilities will administer the questionnaire. The database will be maintained
      in Filemaker Pro program for future research purposes. Collection of the data will require
      approximately 15 minutes. A database file number not related to the patient medical record
      number will be assigned to each patient. The investigator will keep a separate log linking
      patient database number and patient medical record number. The logbook will be kept under
      lock and key by the investigator.
