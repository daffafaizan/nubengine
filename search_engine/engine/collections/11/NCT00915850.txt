    
      <Phase I>

      Primary Objective:

      To establish the safety of combination chemotherapy comprising docetaxel (escalating doses:
      25,30,35,40 mg/m2,day1 and day8), cisplatin (12mg/m2,day1-5), and fluorouracil
      (600mg/m2,day1-5) (DCF) in unresectable advanced esophageal cancer.

      Secondary Objective:

      To observe the efficacy of this regimen in these patients.

      <Phase II>

      Primary Objective:

      To assess the response rate of combination chemotherapy comprising docetaxel (recommended
      dose determined in phase I study,day1 and day8), cisplatin (12 mg/m2, day1-5), and
      fluorouracil (600 mg/m2, day1-5) (DCF) in unresectable advanced esophageal cancer.

      Secondary Objectives:

      To determine the adverse reactions of this regimen in these patients. To determine TTP(Time
      to progression) of patients treated with this regimen. To determine MST(Median survival time)
      of patients treated with this regimen.
