      calcification. One study showed that agents that limit the absorption of phosphate from food
      (phosphate binders) slow the progression of vascular calcification, and as a result,
      treatments emphasize phosphate control through diet and phosphate binders. Other studies have
      shown that the use of statins, to lower LDL cholesterol levels may reduce the progression of
      coronary calcification in non-ESRD patients, but data from ESRD are lacking. While these
      treatments have been helpful, the improvements in patients' outcomes have not been
      overwhelming positive.

      This proposed study is not the first to study the use of bisphosphonates on vascular
      calcification. Repeated studies have shown impressive reduction in calcification rates in
      several animal models, which begs the question, how will bisphosphonates fare in human
      subjects? Preliminary research has begun, but clearly an expansive trial on humans is needed
      to explore the use of a promising therapy. Our study hopes to provide insight into this area
      of cardiovascular research.
