      (RP2D) and schedule of CMP-001 when given in combination with pembrolizumab in participants
      with advanced melanoma.

      The primary objective of Part 2 of the study is to assess and describe the safety profile of
      CMP-001 when administered as monotherapy.

      The primary objective of the Treatment Extension is to assess the safety profile of CMP-001
      when given in combination with pembrolizumab or as monotherapy in the Treatment Extension.

      Participants enrolled into either Part 1 or Part 2 will continue study treatment as long as
      they do not experience unacceptable toxicities and when continued treatment, is in the
      participant's best interest according to the Investigator. Participants may continue therapy
      beyond progression based upon Investigator judgement of potential benefit.
