    
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of mitoxantrone and sorafenib followed by a
      phase II study.

      INDUCTION: Patients receive mitoxantrone intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on days 1-3 and
      sorafenib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 10-19 in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive filgrastim subcutaneously (SC) once daily
      (QD) on days 0-5, cladribine IV QD over 2 hours on days 1-5, and cytarabine IV QD over 2
      hours on days 1-5 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients
      achieving partial remission (including MRD positive [pos] CR, CR with incomplete platelet
      recovery [CRp], and CR with incomplete count recovery [CRi]) or persistent AML may receive up
      to 2 cycles of induction therapy per the discretion of the treating physician.

      POST-REMISSION: Patients receive sorafenib PO BID on days 8-27 or 3 days prior to next cycle
      of treatment, whichever occurs first. Patients also receive filgrastim subcutaneously SC QD
      on days 0-5, cladribine IV QD over 2 hours on days 1-5, and cytarabine IV QD over 2 hours on
      days 1-5 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving
      MRDneg CR may receive up to 4 cycles of post-remission therapy. Patients achieving disease
      response (MRDpos CR, CRi/CRp, or persistent disease) may receive up to two induction cycles
      and 1 cycle of post-remission therapy with mitoxantrone omitted in cycle 3. If they then
      enter MRDneg CR, they can proceed with up to a total of 4 cycles of post-remission therapy.

      MAINTENANCE THERAPY: Patients achieving MRDneg CR may receive maintenance therapy of
      sorafenib PO BID for up to 1 year.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for up to 5
      years.
