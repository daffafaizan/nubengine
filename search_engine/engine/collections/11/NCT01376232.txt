    
      The purpose of this study is to assess the clinical drug-drug interaction potential of
      GSK1278863A with medications that are inhibitors of CYP2C8 enzyme in order to support
      co-administration of similar agents in later phase development. Specifically. this study will
      assess the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of GSK1278863A administered alone or
      co-administered with gemfibrozil, a potent inhibitor of CYP2C8, following steady-state oral
      administration of gemfibrozil. Finally, to support the co-administration of GSK1278863A with
      food, this study will assess the pharmacokinetics of a single oral dose of GSK1278863A under
      fasting conditions and following a standard high-calorie, high fat meal.
