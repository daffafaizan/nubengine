      injection (2:1)plays a therapeutic role by the former inhibiting bacterial cell wall
      synthesis，the latter making irreversible competitive inhibition of β-lactamase.The
      antimicrobial effect of ceftazidime can be enhanced by the two combined. The compound
      specifically aims to the mechanism of bacterial resistance, extending the life of ceftazidime
      in the treatment-resistant pathogen infections.
