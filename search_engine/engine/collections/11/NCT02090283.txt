      SD-101 dermal cream (6%) in participants with Simplex, Recessive Dystrophic, and Junctional
      non-Herlitz EB.

      SD-101 dermal cream (6%) was applied topically, once a day to the entire body for the
      duration of the study. Participants who successfully completed the entire SD-003 study
      (NCT02014376) had the option to roll over into the SD-004 study (NCT02090283). The baseline
      visit occurred at the final visit date for the SD-003 study. The body surface area (BSA)
      coverage of blisters and lesions assessment made at the final SD-003 study visit were used as
      the baseline information at the baseline visit for the SD-004 study. Participants returned to
      the study site for the following 13 visits (36 months) to have BSA assessed. BSA was assessed
      at all subsequent scheduled study center visits. Scheduled study center visits occurred every
      6 months after Month 36 (Month 42, 48, and so on). After completion of Month 36, the next
      participant visit (Month 39) was a phone call from the site to the participant. Telephone
      visits occurred every 6 months thereafter (Month 45, 51, and so on) and included assessment
      of adverse events and concomitant medications only. For female participants of childbearing
      potential, a urine pregnancy test was performed at Month 6 and every 6 months up to and
      including the final study visit.
