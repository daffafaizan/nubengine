    
      This is a feasibility prospective pilot study. Ten patients (5 males and 5 females) with a
      histologically proven locally advanced rectal cancer with the indication of neoadjuvant
      radiotherapy or radio-chemotherapy will be recruited for this study. Prior to enrollment,
      potential candidates will undergo a thorough physical and clinical examination and
      documentation on medical and surgical history. If eligible, a baseline planning computed
      tomography (CT) simulation will be performed at the Radiation Oncology Department before the
      TraceIT速 implant. Participants will undergo a transperineal injection of TraceIT速 spacer gel
      between rectum and vagina or prostate performed by a trained radiologist under transrectal
      ultrasound guidance. A CT simulation will be repeated within 3 to 5 days post injection using
      the same imaging modality and treatment position used the pre- TraceIT速 injection. Radiation
      treatment plans will be generated using scans realized pre- and post- TraceIT速 injection and
      compared using dose volume histograms (DVH) analyses. Tolerance, side effects, and adverse
      events related to the procedure will be recorded prospectively from the injection until
      week-4 after EBRT (External Beam Radiation Therapy) completion. Radiological status of the
      spacer will be evaluated on the preoperative magnetic resonance Imaging (MRI).
      Histopathological results and any serious and/or unanticipated adverse events following
      surgery procedure will be recorded retrospectively.
