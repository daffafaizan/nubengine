      (IRB) approved this study. Written consent forms were obtained from all 14 volunteers (7
      females and 7 males). The subjects were randomly recruited from twenty eight 3rd year Food
      Science and Postharvest Technology students. People volunteering to participate in the study
      were excluded if they are: overweight, dieting, smoking, a family history of diabetes,
      pregnant, metabolic disorders, suffering from any illness or food allergy and regularly
      taking medication. The participants were checked for glucose tolerance according to the WHO
      (World Health Organization) classification (fasting glucose <7 mmol/L(millimole per lite) and
      2-hour blood glucose concentration after a 25g glucose load <7.8 mmol/L). Ten (5 females and
      5 males) were selected from fourteen using lottery sampling methods. Reference glucose and
      monofloral honeys were used as experimental foods. To determine the GI value, 25 grams of
      available carbohydrate was fed for ten healthy people in the morning after they have fasted
      for 11 hours overnight. After fasting blood sample was obtained. The study participants were
      consumed each honey and reference glucose served. Additional blood samples were taken at 15,
      30, 45, 60, 90 and 120 minutes after eating commenced. Blood glucose response (Area under the
      curve, AUCt) for test food was compared to the blood glucose response of reference glucose
      (AUCr). AUC was calculated using SAS (Statistical Analysis Software), 2002. Glycemic index
      (GI) was calculated using:

      GI= AUCt/AUCr*100

      Where:

      AUCt = Area Under the Curve for honey; AUCr = Area Under the Curve for the reference glucose
