      To determine if high dose vitamin D3 given to premenopausal women who initially have
      insufficient levels of 25-hydroxy vitamin D (<30 ng/ml) will raise 25(OH)D levels above the
      50 ng/ml level considered to be required for breast health. If so, will certain risk
      biomarkers for development of breast cancer be reliably and favorably modulated? The primary
      endpoint will be a decrease in mammographic breast density (percent area considered at
      increased density). Change in proliferation (a decrease as assessed by Ki-67) will also be
      examined. Modulate of expression of genes important in breast cancer risk or reflective of
      vitamin D's mechanism of action will be studied using quantitative real time polymerase chain
      reaction (qRT-PCR).

      Study Design:

      The study is a single-arm open label clinical trial. Women who are high risk for development
      of breast cancer on the basis of family or personal history will undergo random periareolar
      fine needle aspiration (RPFNA) to acquire breast cells for assessment of gene expression by
      qRT-PCR. Women with mammographic density >10% will be eligible for enrollment. All subjects
      will receive high dose vitamin D3 (3 capsules of 10,000 IU of vitamin D3 every week for 6-8
      months). At that time, a repeat RPFNA and mammogram will be performed. Measurement of serum
      levels of 25(OH)D will be performed at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months.
