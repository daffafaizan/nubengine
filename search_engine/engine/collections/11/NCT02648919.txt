      subjects. Efficacy will be measured by the induction of favorable gene expression changes on
      Oncotype Dx Prostate Cancer Test after 12 months of intervention with Noni extract (600mg
      daily). Other efficacy endpoints include the incidence of tumor progression after 12 months
      of intervention with Noni extract and serum PSA doubling time. Safety measurements will
      include the incidence and severity of adverse events, effects on angiogenesis (CD34), cell
      proliferation (Ki-67), and apoptosis (TUNEL) in prostate tissue biopsy samples from Month 12
