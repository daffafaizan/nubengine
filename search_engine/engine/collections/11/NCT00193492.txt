    
      Upon determination of eligibility, patients will randomly be assigned to one of two treatment
      arms:

        -  Rituximab

        -  Rituximab + bevacizumab

      For every 2 patients randomized, 1 will receive treatment number 1 (rituximab), and 1 patient
      will receive treatment number 2 (rituximab + bevacizumab). This is not a blinded study, so
      both the patient and doctor will know which treatment has been assigned.
