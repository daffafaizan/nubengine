    
      A clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of the oral carbonaceous adsorbent Kremezin in
      preventing the progression of chronic kidney disease (the Carbonaceous Oral Adsorbent's
      Effects on Progression of Chronic Kidney Disease [CAP-KD] trial) in predialysis patients. In
      the trial we are comparing two treatments: conventional treatment comprising an ACEI and/or
      ARB together with a low-protein diet, and combination treatment comprising the conventional
      treatment paired with Kremezin. Furthermore, we will compare the QOL in both groups of
      patients
