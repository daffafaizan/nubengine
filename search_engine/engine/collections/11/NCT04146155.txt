      data from both animal and human studies confirmed a beneficial effect of GLP-1 on myocardium,
      endothelium and vasculature, suggesting the potential ameliorative effect of peripheral
      atherosclerosis. In our preliminary studies shown that liraglutide, a long-acting GLP-1R
      agonist (GLP1RA), stimulate endothelial proliferation and angiogenesis. The study aims to
      test the hypothesis that sustained activation of the GLP-1R enhances microvascular perfusion,
      promotes angiogenesis, leading to increased walking distance and limb perfusion in diabetes
      patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Eligible patients will be randomized 1:1 to
      with or without liraglutide treatment by a 6-month follow-up. The primary endpoints are the
      change in initial and absolute claudication distance and assessment of limb ischemia at 6
      months compared with baseline. This trial will collect important mechanistic and clinical
      information on the safety and efficacy of liraglutide in T2DM patients with PAD.
