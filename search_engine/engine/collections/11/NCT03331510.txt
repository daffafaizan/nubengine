      weeks, 6 months, 12 months and 24 months post-operatively. Next to standard radiological
      follow up, including X-ray, arthrographic computed tomography as well as arthrographic
      magnetic resonance imaging, specific shoulder scores will be utilised. Strength for general
      shoulder motion as well as specifically for the subscapularis, the pectorals minor, the
      coracobrachialis and the biceps will be measured with a shoulder dynamometer. Data will be
      analysed and published.
