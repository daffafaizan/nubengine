      examinations and investigations), from any information volunteered by the Subject and through
      active questioning. At each visit after informed consent has been signed, Subjects will be
      asked about AEs that occurred since the last visit by questioning them with regard to their
      well-being by "non-leading" questions. This includes AEs occurring during the administration
      of IMP, as well as changes in concomitant diseases (e.g. ongoing medical history). The
      general type of questions could be similar to "Do you have any health problems?" or "Have you
      had any health problems since your last clinic visit?" During blinded studies, the Subject
      and all personnel involved with the conduct and interpretation of the study, including the
      Investigators, site personnel, and the Sponsor's staff, those involved in processing and
      regulatory reporting of SUSARs, will be blinded to the treatment codes until unblinding. The
      randomisation schedule will be filed securely by the Sponsor/IRS provider in a manner such
      that blinding is properly maintained throughout the study. Treatment codes will not be
      available until unblinding, after completion of the study and data base lock, except in the
      case of emergency.

      Statistical analyses will be performed by a designated CRO. All statistical analyses will be
      performed using SAS and/or other statistical software as required.
