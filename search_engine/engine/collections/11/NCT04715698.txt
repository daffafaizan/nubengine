      output (CO) and/or systemic vascular resistance (SVR). It is hypothesized that selecting
      antihypertensive therapy based on patients' hemodynamic profile could lead to more effective
      blood pressure (BP) control than standard care in a real-world population of hypertensive
      patients in outpatient setting. A single-center, randomized trial was conducted to include
      adults with uncontrolled hypertension who seek outpatient care at Peking University People's
      Hospital between December 2018 and December 2019 in Beijing, China.

      Participants were randomly assigned to the standard care group or the hemodynamic group in a
      1:1 ratio. Impedance cardiography (ICG) was performed with all participants to measure
      hemodynamic parameters. Only physicians in the hemodynamic group were provided with patients'
      ICG findings and a computerized clinical decision support of recommended treatment choices
      based on patients' hemodynamic profiles. The primary outcomes were the reductions in systolic
      BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) levels at the follow-up visit 8(Â±4) weeks after baseline.
      Secondary outcomes included achievement of BP goal of <140/ 90 mmHg and the reductions in BP
      by baseline BP, age, sex, and BMI.

      The ICG device used (HDproTM CHM T3002/P3005, designed by Beijing Li-Heng Medical
      Technologies, Ltd, manufactured by Shandong Baolihao Medical Appliances, Ltd.) was developed
      based on improved hardware and advanced digital filtering algorithms, and has been validated
      versus both invasive thermodilution and non-invasive echocardiography in different settings.
