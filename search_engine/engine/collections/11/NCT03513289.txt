        1. To identify elements that helped survivors in their recovery, as well as potential
           obstacles

        2. To capture elements of survivorshop that are generalizable, regardless of participation
           in the THRIVE collaboratives

        3. To gain knowledge to be incorporated back into the collaboratives

      Patients, family members, and clinicians will be interviewed and their responses analyzed for
      themes of ICU recovery including elements that patients and families find helpful to
      recovery, barriers and facilitators to different models of post-ICU support, including peer
      support and post-ICU clinics, and drivers of improvement in post-ICU care. Patients, carers,
      and clinicians with a wide variety of survivorship experiences are encouraged to participate,
      including those who have participated in a THRIVE collaborative support site (peer support or
      clinic).
