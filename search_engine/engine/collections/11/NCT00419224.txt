      influenza infection. It is not whether influenza vaccination protects patients who undergo a
      type of bone marrow transplantation called "nonmyeloablative", or "reduced intensity" bone
      marrow transplantation. This study compares the response to influenza vaccination in a group
      of these patients to that in healthy people.
