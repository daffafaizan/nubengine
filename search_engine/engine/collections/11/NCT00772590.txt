      measured by the mean time weighted CD4+ T cell count change over 24 weeks of two
      interventions: (I) cART intensification with raltegravir and (II) cART combined with
      hyper-immune bovine colostrum in HIV-1 infected individuals who have failed to achieve a CD4+
      T cell count greater than 350 cells/ÂµL despite persistent HIV plasma viraemia below 50
      copies/mL on cART.

      Eligible patients will be randomised to one of four arms. I. Raltegravir + hyper-immune
      bovine colostrum placebo II. Raltegravir placebo + hyper-immune bovine colostrum III.
      Raltegravir + hyper-immune bovine colostrum IV. Raltegravir placebo + hyper-immune bovine
      colostrum placebo
