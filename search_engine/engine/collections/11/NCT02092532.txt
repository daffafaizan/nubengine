      neovascularization secondary to polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV). Twenty treatment
      na√Øve and previously treated PCV eyes will be enrolled (only one study eye per patient will
      be enrolled). A maximum of 10 previously treated eyes will be enrolled. Consented, enrolled
      patients will be followed monthly. All patients will receive monthly IAI 2.0 mg
      intravitreally for 3 months (Baseline, Months 1 and 2), followed by mandatory IAI 2.0 mg
      every 2 months (Months 4, 6, 8 and 10) for 12 months. Patients can receive additional IAI
      treatment (Months 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11) if the re-treatment criteria are met. Starting at Month
      3, patients can receive non-anti vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) rescue therapy
      (ie: Photodynamic Therapy (PDT), laser, intravitreal steroids) if the pre-defined criteria
      are met.
