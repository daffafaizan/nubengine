    
      This is a randomized effectiveness trial in which real-world providers will be given feedback
      on patient trust/respect. Approximately 40 clinicians, and up to 180 consumers will be
      enlisted participate in the randomized effectiveness trial. All enrolled patients will
      complete the BASIS-24, the Satisfaction with Care scale, and the Satisfaction with Social
      Roles and Activities Scale on handheld tablets or desktop computers at baseline. Patients
      will be randomized to one of two conditions. Patients in the first condition will attend
      therapy with clinicians who have received a standard automated outcome report, plus a report
      that contains information on the patient's trust/respect with suggestions for interventions
      if low/declining trust/respect is apparent. Patients in the second condition will attend
      therapy and complete the same measures as patients in the first condition, but their
      therapists will only receive a standard automated outcome report, without any patient
      information on trust/respect. At the time of the first therapy appointment and for all
      remaining therapy appointments, patients will complete four total measures: the new measure
      of trust/respect, the BASIS-24, the Satisfaction with Care scale, and the Satisfaction with
      Social Roles and Activities scale.
