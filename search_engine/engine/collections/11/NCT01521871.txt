      involved in developing minimally invasive techniques for living donor nephrectomy (LDN).
      Since 2009 all LDN's have been performed by laparoscopic, hand-assisted technique; by means
      of 'handport' and 3 laparoscopic ports (5/12 mm).

      The investigators consider use of tissue glue instead of suture as another small step towards
      less invasive surgery.

      Since 2000 there has been many reports, and even Cochrane reviews on the use/safety of tissue
      glue for skin closure. However, very few randomised studies have been performed with the
      latest generation tissue glue; Cyanoacrylate, with a critical mixture of
      octyl-:butyl-acrylate. And in Norway there has been no research in this field.

      On this basis, the investigators intend to examine skin closure in living donors, a very
      healthy/homogenous study population, subjected to laparoscopic, hand-assisted nephrectomy, by
      a prospective, randomised trial: Tissue glue (Cyanoacrylate (Liquiband)) versus conventional,
      intracutaneous suture and dressing (1 : 1; 30 + 30 donors).

      Primarily, the investigators will examine wound healing/complications by wound observation at
      postop. days 2 + 4 + 'at departure', with numerical scales for secretion, gaps, edema, rubor
      - as well as infection/bacteriology and complications/ reinterventions. In addition, the
      donors' self-satisfaction with the wound handling will be registered. Furthermore, the
      investigators will look at time consumption during surgery, price, stay in hospital and
      cosmesis judged at 2-3 months postoperatively.
