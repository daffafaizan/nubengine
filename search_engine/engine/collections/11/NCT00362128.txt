      atherosclerosis, in which fatty plaques develop on the inner walls of arteries. There are
      many risk factors for CVD, including inflammation, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and
      obesity. Research has shown that CVD mortality rates differ greatly between Chinese
      immigrants living in NYC and individuals living in China. Because of this difference, it is
      important to understand the impact of immigration and acculturation on health habits and
      psychosocial factors, which may influence the development of CVD. This study will gather
      information from Chinese immigrants in NYC to identify the impact of immigration and
      acculturation on behavior and CVD risk factors. In addition, results from this study may
      provide insight into the CVD risk patterns in other immigrant groups.

      This study will enroll Chinese immigrants living in NYC. Participants will attend one study
      visit and will complete questionnaires to assess their health habits (diet, physical
      activity, and smoking), stress levels, and socioeconomic status. Participants will also
      undergo a physical examination and blood collection.
