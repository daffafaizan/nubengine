      therapeutic tool for the treatment of several neuropsychiatric disorders including major
      depression and hallucinations in schizophrenia but, to date, studies exploring the effects of
      rTMS in Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) have produce negative or conflicting results,
      especially those applying the stimulation to the prefrontal cortex as for the treatment of
      depression. However, a promising result has been obtained in a study in which the rTMS was
      applied to the Supplementary Motor Area (SMA), but in a small size and heterogeneous sample.
      The SMA has connections with areas of the brain, especially motor areas and
      subcortical-limbic circuitry, implicated in OCD.

      In our study, 40 adult outpatients with OCD, who have been insufficiently responsive to at
      least two recognized drug treatments, will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment
      groups (active low frequency (1 Hz, 100% of the motor threshold) rTMS or sham-placebo)
      applied to the SMA daily for up to four weeks. An individual MRI-guided neuronavigation will
      be used to precisely define the target stimulation site in each patient. Rating scales for
      symptom change will be obtained at baseline, during the rTMS course, at the end of 4 weeks of
      treatment, and after a 2-month follow-up period. The main outcome measure will be the
      Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive scale, and secondary outcome measure will include the CGI
      scales, the LPO scale, the MOCI, and the SDS. Brain activity changes in fMRI before and after
      active/sham treatment will be compared between groups, with rest measures and provocation
      tasks.
