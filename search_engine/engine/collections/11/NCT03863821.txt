      cannula (HHHFNC) in pulmonary rehabilitation and analysis of cardiopulmonary parameters in
      adult patients.

      Background： Recently, HHHFNC has been used in both adult and neonates with post-extubation
      respiratory support. Studies indicate that HHHFNC has similar efficacy compared to
      non-invasive positive pressure ventilation and superior than conventional oxygen therapy.
      Six-minute walking test (6-MWT) is a standardized laboratory tests to evaluate the endurance
      capacity in adult patients. It helps clinician to modify the treatment plan. Cirio, et at.
      has been shown HHHFNC may improve the exercise performance in severe chronic obstructive
      pulmonary disease (COPD) patients with ventilatory limitation.

      Study Design： This is a prospective clinical trial in a pulmonary rehabilitation out-patient
      department (2018.08.01-2019.07.31).。 Methods： Patents with COPD who done pulmonary function
      test will enroll to this study. Left-side heart failure, COPD acute-exacerbation (AE) within
      3 months, diagnosed neuromuscular disease, and unable to perform 6-MWT will be exclude. The
      data will be collected for and analyzed.

      Effect： Investigators expect the exercise performance; cardiopulmonary function will be
      improve under HHHFNC support. We hope the application of HHHFNC in adult patient with
      pulmonary rehabilitation could enhance the quality of life.

      Key words： chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; heated humidified high-flow nasal cannula;
      pulmonary rehabilitation, six-minute walking test.
