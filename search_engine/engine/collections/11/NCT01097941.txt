    
      The study will be conducted as a randomized, prospective, open-label evaluation of the
      clinical tolerability, vaccine virus shedding, and serum and mucosal antibody response to
      vaccination with either live monovalent novel H1N1 influenza vaccine (LAIV) or monovalent
      inactivated novel H1N1 influenza vaccine (IIV) in healthy children between the ages of 4 and
      9 years. Children will be screened for antibody to A/Brisbane/57/07 (H1N1) and
      A/California/07/09 (H1N1) prior to randomization. Children with evidence of prior exposure to
      the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus will be excluded. Those with antibodies to A/Brisbane/57/07
      (H1N1) will be stratified by preexisting antibody. Vaccine will be administered on days 0 and
      28.

      Safety of vaccination will be assessed using symptoms collected by parents for 7 days after
      each dose of vaccine. Serum will be obtained prior to and on day 28 following each dose of
      vaccine and assessed for antibody by HAI, ELISA, B-cell ELISPOT and neutralization
      techniques. Nasal secretions will be obtained by nasal aspiration prior to and on day 28
      after each dose and assessed for HA-specific IgA antibody by ELISA. Nasal swabs will be
      obtained on days 2, 4, and 7 after each dose of live vaccine and assessed for the presence
      and magnitude of vaccine virus shedding of the live attenuated vaccine by rtRT-PCR and TCID50
      on MDCK cells.
