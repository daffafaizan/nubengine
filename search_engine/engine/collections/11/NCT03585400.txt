      and dose of NMBA reversal agent used. While on the one hand, NMBAs optimize surgical
      conditions and facilitate mechanical ventilation in patients with ventilator asynchrony, on
      the other hand, these agents have been associated with respiratory complications and
      increased risk of readmission after ambulatory surgery. A consensus in regard to guidelines
      and thresholds to define the optimal strategy to optimize surgical conditions is yet to be
      achieved. We have shown that utilization of non-depolarizing muscle relaxants and their
      reversal agents can be improved by dedicated quality improvement techniques. We have also
      recently developed the REPS, a tool that predicts postoperative rNMB.

      This is a retrospective, observational, cohort study based on on-file hospital data from Beth
      Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts.

      The primary aim is to validate the dichotomized REPS (high-risk versus low-risk for rNMB
      which corresponds to a REPS >4 and <4, respectively) for the outcome of postoperative
      respiratory complications with BIDMC data. The investigators will utilize the pre-defined
      variables identified to predict residual neuromuscular blockade (REPS) at BIDMC.

      The secondary aim is to compare the predictive values of the dichotomized REPS with
      dichotomized train-of-four (TOF)-ratio (low TOF-ratio versus high TOF ratio which corresponds
      to a TOF-ratio <0.9 and >=0.9, respectively) for respiratory complications.
