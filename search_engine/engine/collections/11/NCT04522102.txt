      spontaneous ICH. Randomisation occurs if a participant and their doctor are uncertain about
      whether to start or avoid antiplatelet monotherapy at least 24 hours after ICH symptom onset.
      The intervention is a pragmatic policy of starting antiplatelet monotherapy (one antiplatelet
      drug available in local standard clinical practice, chosen by patient's physician
      pre-randomisation). The control group adopts a policy of avoiding antiplatelet therapy.
