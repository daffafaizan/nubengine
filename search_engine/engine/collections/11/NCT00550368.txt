      enteric pathogens. Results of observational studies on the association between H. pylori and
      gastroenteritis, however, have been conflicting. Some have shown increased incidence of
      diarrhea in children with H. pylori infection, with one study attributing 11% of diarrhea
      cases to H. pylori. Other studies found no association, and still others found a protective
      effect of H. pylori against gastroenteritis. Dissecting out confounding from true
      physiological associations can be difficult in observational studies. To better elucidate the
      association between H. pylori and gastroenteritis, we performed a direct challenge experiment
      with a well-characterized gastrointestinal pathogen, enteropathogenic Escherichia coli
      (EPEC). EPEC is a leading cause of infantile gastroenteritis in the world and has a long
      history of safe use in human experiments. It is also acid sensitive: in our laboratory less
      than 0.001% of inoculated EPEC organisms survived at pH 2.5. Our goal was to test the
      hypothesis that chronic infection with H. pylori increases the risk of diarrheal illness
      after direct challenge with EPEC.
