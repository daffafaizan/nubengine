      experts regarding the duration of therapy for a febrile UTI. Depending on the recommendation,
      the duration of treatment should be between 7-14 days.

      221 patients aged 3 months to 7 years with febrile UTIs (defined as a combination of fever
      and leukocyturia in urine sediment) will be randomly assigned to receive a 7-day treatment
      arm (7 days of cefuroxime/cefuroxime axetil followed by 3 days of blinded placebo) or a
      10-day treatment arm (7 days of cefuroxime/cefuroxime axetil followed by 3 days of blinded
      cefuroxime axetil).

      The primary outcome measure will be frequencies of recurrence and reinfection of UTI during
      the 6 months after the intervention. The secondary outcome measures will be
      antibiotic-associated diarrhea and compliance.
