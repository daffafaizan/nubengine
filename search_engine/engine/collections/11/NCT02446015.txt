    
      This study consists of a 14-day Run-in Phase (between the Screening Visit and Baseline/Visit
      1) and a Treatment Phase. During the Run-in Phase, subjects will discontinue current
      artificial tears and will be dispensed SYSTANE® ULTRA to be administered 1 drop in each eye
      as needed (PRN). Subjects who meet the re-evaluation criteria after the Run-in Phase will be
      randomized in a 1:2 manner to receive treatment with SYSTANE® ULTRA 4 times per day (QID) or
      PRN, respectively, for 28 days.
