        1. unhappy: high psychopathology and low positive mental health; depression and/or anxiety
           scores above published cut -offs and positive mental health scores under published cut
           offs.

        2. symptomatic but content: high psychopathology and high positive mental health;
           depression and/or anxiety scores above published cut -offs and normal to high positive
           mental health scores

        3. vulnerable: low psychopathology and low positive mental health; depression and/or
           anxiety scores under published cut -offs and positive mental health scores under
           published cut offs

        4. Complete mental health: low psychopathology and high positive mental health; depression
           and/or anxiety scores under published cut -offs normal to high positive mental health
           scores.

      The authors will then depict the movements of patients through these groups graphically and
      use regression analyses to check for differences according to age, diagnosis and gender.

      Towards the second aim they will use regression analyses to investigate the protective effect
      of positive mental health on suicidal ideation or behavior.
