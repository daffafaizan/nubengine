      an alcohol brief intervention (SP-BI) versus an Enhanced Usual Care (EUC) condition for
      National Guard members in the State of Ohio, who are already participating in the Ohio Army
      National Guard Mental Health Initiative (OHARNG-MHI) study, titled "Resilience and Risk
      Factors Associated with Deployment Related Posttraumatic Psychopathology", who meet criteria
      for at-risk drinking in the previous 4 months. After tailoring the content of the SP-BI
      intervention for NG soldiers, the study will prescreen ~ 8,500 individuals over the three
      year enrollment period to identify 850participants with at-risk drinking. TParticipants in
      this study will be randomized to either the SP-BI (n=375) or the EUC condition (n=375) and
      followed at 4, 8 and 12 months post-enrollment. Participants who are randomized to the SP-BI
      condition will receive an informational brochure with resources available to members of the
      military related to mental health and alcohol use and will download a free app on to their
      smartphones. The app will be developed to be used on both Android and iPhone platforms and
      will be used over 12 weeks to deliver the study intervention. Those assigned to the EUC
      condition will receive the informational brochure only.

      The specific aims of the study are to compare SP-BI and EUC in: 1) Reducing the frequency and
      intensity of at-risk drinking at 4 -, 8- and 12-months; 2) Decreasing binge drinking at 4-,
      8- and 12 months. The secondary aims are to: 1) Compare the SP-BI and EUC conditions in
      reducing the frequency of illicit drug use and depressive symptoms at 4-, 8- and 12-months;
      2) Examine if deployment status moderates the effect of intervention assignment (SP-BI or
      EUC) on post-intervention drinking, depressed feelings, and other substance use.
