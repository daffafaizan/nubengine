      evaluate the efficacy of topical diclofenac sodium gel (DSG) 1% in reducing pain associated
      with delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS). Following exercise, subjects reporting significant
      DOMS received topical DSG 1% applied to 1 leg and placebo applied to the other every 6 hours
      for 48 hours.
