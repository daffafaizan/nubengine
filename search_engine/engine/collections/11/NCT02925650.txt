      orally active, experimental drug that specifically inhibits the synthesis of amyloid
      precursor protein (APP), Tau and α-Synuclein. It is distinct from other Alzheimer's disease
      drugs currently in development, because it inhibits the formation of several toxic proteins,
      rather than removing individual toxic protein after they are produced. Posiphen has potential
      utility as a disease modifying treatment for AD. The present study will confirm the
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of Posiphen and its metabolites in plasma and cerebral spinal fluid
      (CSF). It will also measure the effects of a 23-25 day treatment period with Posiphen on the
      CSF and plasma levels of a number of biomarkers, inflammatory factors and control proteins.
      It will also expand the safety data in humans by extending the treatment period from 10 days
      to a treatment period from 23-25 days. In addition, this study will measure concentrations of
      various soluble biomarkers in CSF and use the SILK™ assay methods to directly measure the
      effect of Posiphen on the fractional synthesis rate of Aβ40 in CSF, which will help guide the
      further development of Posiphen and determine the feasibility of SILK™ in a multicenter
      trial.
