    
      The objective of this clinical investigation is to demonstrate the safety and
      efficacy/performance of the Femoral Nail PF of the T2 Alpha Femur Antegrade GT/PF Nailing
      System. Efficacy/performance of the procedure will be measured by an equal or greater
      (non-inferior) Lower Extremity Measure (LEM) score result of the Femoral Nail PF of the T2
      Alpha Femur Antegrade GT/PF Nailing System compared to the T2 Femur benchmark literature at
      12 months.

      In addition, demonstration of bone consolidation in correct alignment will be measured by
      Investigator assessment by 12 months. Safety of the Femoral Nail PF of the T2 Alpha Femur
      Antegrade GT/PF Nailing System will be demonstrated through reporting of device related
      intra-operative and post-operative Adverse Events/incidents by 12 months.
