      there is still a need to develop efficient and better tolerated psychopharmacological
      approaches to this group of diseases. The endogenous cannabinoid system provides a promising
      target in the pharmacotherapy of these disorders. This approach is based upon recent findings
      indicating that the human endogenous cannabinoid system is significantly involved in the
      pathogenesis of schizophrenia and that cannabidiol is effective in treating acute psychotic
      symptoms of schizophrenic patients. We will investigate cannabidiol versus placebo in a
      randomized, double blind design with extensive safety measures.

      The primary hypothesis to be tested is that Cannabidiol is expected to be superior to placebo
      in the treatment of acute schizophrenic and schizophreniform psychoses with regard to its
      antipsychotic efficacy.
