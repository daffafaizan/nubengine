      with significant early morbidity and mortality. About half of patients die or require heart
      transplantation within 5 years of diagnosis. The survival advantage from transplantation is
      limited, particularly in DCM infants.

      The medical therapy for DCM with heart failure includes anti-congestive medications and
      antiplatelet therapy. Those who fail to improve within the first year of diagnosis usually
      deteriorated even upon aggressive anti-congestive medications. The investigators had
      conducted precision-medicine-based approach to provide strategic approach as drug repurposing
      to identify new treatments. The investigators have identified the beneficial effects from a
      statin, simvastatin, to restore the cardiac contractility in a DCM proband.The initial
      experience in the proband is promising.

      Simvastatin is effective in lowing LDL and cholesterol, thereby to improve the outcome of
      patients with coronary arterial disease, familiar hypercholesterolemia, etc. For children,
      though the dosage range and the indication remain unclear, it had been used in children with
      various diseases. Simvastatin had been given in a small cohort of adult DCM. Patients treated
      with simvastatin had a lower New York Heart Association functional class compared with those
      receiving placebo. The LVEF also improved in the simvastatin group. The investigators would
      further assess the efficacy of simvastatin to improve the cardiac function in patients with
      DCM.
