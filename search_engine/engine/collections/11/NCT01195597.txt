      approaches to smoking cessation are necessary. The electronic-cigarette (e-Cigarette), a
      battery-powered electronic nicotine delivery device (ENDD) resembling a cigarette, may help
      smokers to remain abstinent during their quit attempt or to reduce cigarette consumption. The
      efficacy of these devices in smoking cessation and/or smoking reduction studies has never
      been investigated.

      In this prospective proof-of-concept study we monitored possible modifications in smoking
      habits of 40 smokers (unwilling to quit) experimenting the 'Categoria' e-Cigarette focusing
      on smoking reduction and smoking abstinence. Study participants were invited to attend four
      study visits: at baseline, week-4, week-8, and week-12. Product use, number of cigarettes
      smoked, and exhaled carbon monoxide (eCO) levels were measured at each visit. Smoking
      reduction and abstinence rates were calculated. Adverse events and product preferences were
      also reviewed.
