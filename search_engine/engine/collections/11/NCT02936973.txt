      Provincial Hospital of TCM, Dongzhimen Hospital Beijing University of Chinese Medicine and
      the First Hospital of Hunan University of Chinese Medicine. This study includes the following
      time points: a treatment period of 16 weeks after screening and a follow-up period of 24
      weeks. The total study period will be 40 weeks. All patients will be randomized into the real
      catgut implantation at acupoints group or the sham catgut implantation at acupoints group.The
      primary outcome measurement of this study is the rate of waistline reduction compared with
      baseline. The secondary outcome measurements are the rate of reduction of weight, BMI,
      hipline, WHR and PBF, and changes in the IWQOL-Lite compared with baseline. These parameters
      will be evaluated at week 0, week 4, week 8, week 12, week 16, week 28 and week 40. Changes
      in SF-36, HAD and SES compared with baseline will be evaluated at week 0, week 16 and week
      40. SF-36 and IWQOL-Lite will be used to evaluate obese patient quality of life. HAD and SES
      will be used to evaluate psychological status. In addition, hepatorenal function, blood fat,
      liver bladder spleen colour ultrasound, FBG and insulin concentration will be used to
      evaluate whether catgut implantation at acupoints can improve the physiological function of
      obese patients.
