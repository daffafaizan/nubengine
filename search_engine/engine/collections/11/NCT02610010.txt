      alone or IMRT plus concurrent chemotherapy. IMRT is given as 2.0-2.30 Gy per fraction with
      five daily fractions per week for 6-7 weeks to a total dose of 66 Gy or greater to the
      primary tumor. Concurrent chemotherapy consisted of cisplatin 100 mg/mÂ² every 3 weeks for 3
      cycles. The primary endpoint is overall survival (OS). Secondary end points include
      failure-free survival(FFS), locoregional relapse-free survival (LRFS), distant
      metastasis-free survival (DMFS), toxic effects and quality of life. All efficacy analyses are
      conducted in the intention-to-treat population, and the safety population include only
      patients who receive their randomly assigned treatment.
