    
      Purpose: This pilot study evaluates the feasibility of implementing a moderate-intensity
      physical activity (PA) program in a sample of men age 65 or older with a prostate cancer
      diagnosis undergoing various forms of treatment or active surveillance.

      Participants: Men, 65 and older, with a prostate cancer diagnosis.

      Procedures (methods): This study will enroll subjects in a 6 week walking program called Walk
      with Ease (WWE) and see if walking can be sustained for up to three months. In addition, the
      study will perform a Geriatric Assessment and gather preliminary data on self-reported
      quality of life outcomes and self-reported physical activity as captured in a daily walking
      log.
