    
      Data sources of use for this study are: Medicare Database, Optum Database, and MarketScan
      Research Database. All data from years 2014-2020 will be included in the study.

      This study follows a sequential cohort monitoring design. The monitoring analysis will
      include 1) retrospective analysis of available data (2015-2017) at the time of first analysis
      (January 2021) and 2) prospective analysis of new data (2018-2020) as they become available
      to the researchers. Within each database, we will emulate biannual updating of data by
      creating a propensity score (PS)-matched cohort of new users every 6-month interval,
      beginning on the first marketing of ARNI (July 7, 2015-December 31, 2015, and 6-month
      intervals afterwards). Each sequential cohort will be followed for development of the
      outcomes of interest. Outcome analysis will be performed at a pre-specified 6-month interval
      (prospective analysis). The surveillance will be performed by frailty status (frail vs
      non-frail) at the time of drug initiation. The results from each database will be pooled
      using fixed-effects meta-analysis (assuming low heterogeneity across the databases).
