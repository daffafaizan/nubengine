    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To measure the level of diindolylmethane in prostate tissue after treatment with oral
           microencapsulated diindolylmethane (B-DIM) in patients with stage I or II adenocarcinoma
           of the prostate undergoing radical prostatectomy.

      Secondary

        -  To measure serum biomarkers (e.g., total PSA, serum testosterone, and diindolylmethane
           levels) pre- and post-treatment with B-DIM.

        -  To measure tissue biomarkers (e.g., androgen receptor, NF-κB, and PSA) pre- and
           post-treatment with B-DIM.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral microencapsulated diindolylmethane (B-DIM) twice daily for 14-72 days
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then undergo radical
      prostatectomy 1 day after the last dose of B-DIM.

      Patients undergo blood and tissue sample collection for correlative laboratory studies. Blood
      samples are analyzed for serum PSA, testosterone, and diindolylmethane levels by high
      performance liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Tissue samples are
      analyzed for diindolylmethane concentration by LC-MS/MS and for androgen receptor, activated
      NF-κB (p65 antibody), and PSA expression by IHC.
