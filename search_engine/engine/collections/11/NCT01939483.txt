      hydrochloride) in breast cancer patients with brain metastases who progressed after radiation
      therapy.

      II. To estimate central nervous system (CNS) objective response and clinical benefit rate in
      patients with breast cancer and brain metastases treated with irinotecan.

      III. To estimate progression free survival. IV. To estimate overall survival. V. To assess
      the toxicity of Irinotecan.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive irinotecan hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes on days 1, 8,
      15, 22, and 29. Courses repeat every 42 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for up to 24 months.
