      aneurysmal orange-red polypoidal lesions with or without branching vascular network (BVN) in
      the choroidal vasculature as observed on indocyanine angiography (ICGA), representing 13% to
      54.7% of newly diagnosed patients with neovascular AMD. Fifty percent of PCV had persistent
      leakage or recurrent bleeding with poor visual outcome, if left untreated.

      And in the EVEREST study has shown that synergistic effects of anti-VEGF and vPDT
      combination: vPDT strongly regress polyp and anti-VEGF control to up-regulation of VEGF
      induced by vPDT compared to ranibizumab monotherapy in newly diagnosed PCV patients.
      Additionally, combination offers an opportunity for individualized treatment with potentially
      fewer treatments and less costs.

      Therefore, the aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of early intervention of PDT
      combination compared with consecutive monthly treatment of intravitreal ranibizumab
      injections in PCV patients showing insufficient response with initial loading dose.
