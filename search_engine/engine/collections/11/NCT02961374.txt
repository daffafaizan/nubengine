      I. To assess the mean percent change in duodenal polyp burden (sum of diameters from all
      polyps) from baseline to 6 months post-intervention for familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP)
      subjects receiving weekly erlotinib hydrochloride (erlotinib).

      II. To assess the grade 2/3 adverse event rate in this population and compare it to
      historical data.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate all adverse events at least possibly attributed to weekly erlotinib.

      II. To assess the absolute and percent change in duodenal polyp number from baseline to 6
      months.

      III. To assess the absolute and percent changes in lower gastrointestinal polyp burden and
      number for the subset of participants with ileal pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA) or ileo-rectal
      anastomosis with rectal stump.

      IV. To assess the absolute and percent change in desmoid tumor size in participants who have
      baseline and follow up computed tomography (CT)s performed as part of their standard of care.

      V. Gene expression profiles in duodenal adenomas and uninvolved tissue will be compared
      between baseline and endpoint samples using negative binomial statistics (DESeq2).

      VI. Identify differentially expressed genes between duodenal polyps and uninvolved tissue at
      endpoint compared to baseline.

      VII. Evaluate the effect of weekly erlotinib on EGFR and Wnt target gene expression in
      duodenal adenomas.

      VIII. Evaluate the effect of weekly erlotinib on immune response signaling in duodenal
      adenomas and uninvolved tissue.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive erlotinib hydrochloride orally (PO) once weekly. Treatment continues for up
      to 6 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.
