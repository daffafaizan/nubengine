      interferon, a chemical naturally produced by the body that works to fight viruses. Interferon
      helps to stop HCV from replicating, and helps the immune system to kill HCV. The purpose of
      this trial is to determine the effectiveness of pegylated interferon in IDUs with HCV.

      This trial will last 24 weeks. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups.
      Group 1 will receive pegylated interferon while group 2 will receive an active control.
      Injection with either pegylated interferon or control will occur weekly. During each
      injection visit, participants will be asked about adverse events, including common side
      effects to interferon such as injection site reactions, headache, myalgias, arthralgias,
      insomnia, and hair loss. At Weeks 2, 4, and then every 4 weeks thereafter, participants will
      complete depression self-reports. Laboratory assessments will occur at Week 2, and then on a
      monthly basis for the remainder of the study. Follow-up assessments will occur every 4 weeks
      after Week 24.
