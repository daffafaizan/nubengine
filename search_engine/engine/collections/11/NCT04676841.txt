      contamination during different conditions is scares. A study from 1982 (Whyet et al.),
      demonstrated that the most important and consistent source of contamination of the wound
      during clean surgery (in this case hip implant surgery) was via air. The study concluded that
      approximately one third of bacteria in the wound were caused by direct air contamination
      whereas the remaining number of bacteria were transferred to the wound by indirect routes
      such as via contaminated instruments.

      The present study includes patients undergoing hemiarthroplastic surgery due to hip fracture.

      During the surgery active air sampling, for microbial analysis, will be done within 30 cm
      from the wound.

      Passive sampling of instrument tables, to measure number of depositing bacteria on the
      surface during the procedure, will be performed by placing sterile filters on the table
      surfaces before initiating the surgical procedure and collecting them at the end.

      Skin and wound sampling will be performed with sterile flocked nylon swabs. The method for
      skin and wound sampling was decided based on a literature review and discussions with the
      department of Clinical microbiology at Sahlgrenska University hospital. Both aerobe and
      anaerobe bacteria will be analyzed.

      The wound will be measured and number of personnel, door openings and clothing, at each
      procedure will be recorded.

      Patients included in the study will be interviewed after 6 weeks and 1 year, to evaluate
      incidence rate of SSI.
