    
      A Phase 3, open-label, single-group, non-randomised, observational study of the safety and
      biochemical disease control of Infacort® in neonates, infants and children with AI who had
      completed study Infacort 003 (EudraCT number 2014-002265-30). All subjects who had
      satisfactorily completed study Infacort 003 wiere offered the opportunity to participate in
      study Infacort 004 at or after their final visit of study Infacort 003. Subjects received the
      usual clinically-appropriate dose (since bioequivalence has been demonstrated with
      conventional hydrocortisone), as determined by the Investigator, which was administered
      according to usual clinical practice - generally 3 or 4 times a day. Subjects could continue
      to be treated in this study until they met the study withdrawal criteria, until Infacort® was
      commercially available locally (which has now been achieved), or until the Sponsor decided to
      discontinue the study.
