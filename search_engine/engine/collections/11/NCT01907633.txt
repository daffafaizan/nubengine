    
      This is a population-based, retrospective (a study in which the exposures and outcomes
      occurred before the study began), and nested case-control study (a study in which the
      patients with the study outcome [cases] and comparison patients without that outcome
      [controls] are observed to assess their exposure to the medication being studied
      [domperidone, PPI's and metoclopramide]). The data will come from the United Kingdom's
      Clinical Practice Research Datalink. The study will estimate the rate of SCD during periods
      of exposure to each of the study medications, and during periods of exposure to none of them;
      and the ratios of these rates. It will also use a "case-crossover" analysis (in which each
      case serves as his/her own control) to re-estimate these rate ratios in a manner that takes
      account of personal characteristics such as obesity or smoking that may affect the study
      findings and are incompletely recorded in the database.
