      cancer, is often quite challenging, due to a lack of disease-specific symptoms. Detecting TCC
      early is crucial to increase the chances of a cure. Cystoscopy, which is currently the
      standard test used for urothelial cancer diagnosis, is an invasive and relatively expensive
      procedure but, while several potential markers in urine have been studied with the goal of
      replacing cystoscopy, no urinary marker alone or in combination with others has shown
      sufficient accuracy.

      In this study, levels of tissue factor (TF) isoforms will be measured by ELISA in urine
      samples collected from patients referred to the haematuria clinic with visible or microscopic
      haematuria. These values will be linked to the subsequent diagnosis of each patient, and used
      to assess the accuracy of the ELISAs in detecting TCC when compared to standard cystoscopy.
