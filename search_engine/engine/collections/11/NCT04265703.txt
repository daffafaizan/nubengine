      to the largest study so far. However, this and other studies with similar success rate, are
      performed in patients with general anesthesia and/or neuromuscular blockade, without
      spontaneous respiratory efforts. Critical care physicians and many other specialists
      frequently need to cannulate patients in special circumstances as hypovolemia, pain, anxiety,
      and respiratory efforts that promotes respirophasic variation in cross-sectional area, and
      even complete collapse of the vessel. These changes can increase the probability of posterior
      wall or arterial puncture, hematomas, pneumothorax, etc. Supraclavicular approach for
      cannulation of the subclavian vein is a method described since 1965, also giving direct
      access to the innominate vein, a larger vessel which is rarely collapsible regardless of
      volume status or respiratory efforts. Based on a previous pilot trial, in this multi-center,
      prospective, randomized, controlled trial, the investigators aim to compare the
      successfulness and safety of ultrasound-guided central venous cannulation at 3 different
      sites: internal jugular, subclavian, and innominate veins.
