      second half of the 20th century. The lifetime prevalence of LBP is reported to be as high as
      84%, and the prevalence of chronic LBP is about 23%, with 11-12% of the population being
      disabled by LBP. Prevalence of LBP was 53.2%. It was more among female patients (62.8%) than
      among male patients (38.3%) among attendants to a Family Health Center in Egypt.

      Additionally, studies have observed relationships between chronic non-specific LBP and a
      posteriorly shifted center of gravity, impaired proprioception, and decreased muscular
      strength, activation and endurance of the trunk and hips. Balance is impaired in individuals
      with chronic low back pain when compared to healthy individuals.

      Most of these studies supposed that postural mal-alignment involves deviations in only one
      direction which is toward lordosis and anterior pelvic tilt. However, clinical experience
      suggests that some patients with back pain have the opposite problem which is a much reduced
      lordotic curve and a posterior pelvic tilt. If the true relationship between posture and low
      back pain disability is curvilinear instead, this could explain why the studies so far have
      shown weak or no relationships.
