    
      Nonclinical studies have indicated that tivantinib (parent molecule) has the potential to
      inhibit CYP3A4 ([I]/Ki=0.15, midazolam as substrate), CYP2C19 ([I]/Ki=0.98), CYP2C9
      ([I]/Ki=0.44), and CYP1A ([I]/Ki=0.37), and the efflux transporter P glycoprotein (P-gp)
      (I2/IC50=82) at the clinical concentrations being studied in the Phase 3 development program.
      In addition, tivantinib has major circulating plasma metabolite(s) which also have been shown
      in nonclinical studies to exhibit similar CYP inhibition potential. The results of this study
      will evaluate the potential of tivantinib to influence the pharmacokinetics of
      CYP3A4/CYP2C19/CYP2C9/CYP1A and/or P-gp substrates, and help to provide the guidance to
      clinicians on co-administration of tivantinib with drugs metabolized by
      CYP3A4/CYP2C19/CYP2C9/ CYP1A and/or transported by P-gp.
