      implant abutments by comparing tissue responses to a laser-ablated implant-abutment and an
      implant-abutment manufactured with a smooth surface.

      Investigators will assess the initial post-surgical peri-implant attachment-seal and will
      test whether or not the tissue-abutment interface re-forms with equal integrity when the
      abutment is removed and replaced with a new abutment.

      Data will include histological, radiographic, clinical, and subjective aesthetics to compare
      the effectiveness of two abutment designs. Both devices are supplied by the BioHorizons
      Implant Systems Inc. of Birmingham, Alabama; the abutments are analogous in design and
      material except the test device has a laser-ablated surface and the control abutment is
      smooth.
