      orally in a blind manner to bipolar disorder patients with major depressive episodes, with
      the aim of evaluating the superiority of FK949E over placebo and the dose response of two
      doses of FK949E based on changes in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total
      score. In Treatment Period II, the long-term safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of
      open-label FK949E was evaluated in patients who completed Treatment Period I. An analysis was
      performed for data in Treatment Period I and another analysis was done for data in combined
      Treatment Periods I and II.
