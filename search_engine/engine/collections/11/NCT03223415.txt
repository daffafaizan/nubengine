      a disease involving the colon and causing symptoms ranging from mild diarrhea to fulminant
      colitis. C. difficile can spread from patients to patients in acute-care hospitals.
      Transmission is believed to occur mainly from patients with active disease, but patients who
      carry the bacteria without any symptom (called C. difficile carriers) can also transmit the
      bacteria to other patients.

      Preliminary evidence that suggest that detecting C. difficile carriers to place them under
      isolation precautions can lead to a decrease in the incidence of CDI. In order to investigate
      this question, large-scale clinical trials will be ultimately required. In order to plan such
      large-scale study, there is a need to perform a preliminary feasibility trial. The current
      study will assess the feasibility, acceptability and logistical considerations of
      implementing a multicenter intervention consisting of the detection and isolation of C.
      difficile carriers on hospital admission, in order to guide the design of a definitive trial.
      This objective is essential considering the paucity of published data on this topic.
