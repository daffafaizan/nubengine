      problems with gait and balance, as well as other debilitating symptoms. There is no cure for
      SCA and a lack of an effective symptomatic treatment.

      Investigators will recruit 20 patients with genetically-confirmed SCA to use a novel approach
      - noninvasive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) - to improve balance, gait, and posture
      in patients with SCA. Half will be randomly assigned to a real intervention, and half to a
      sham (control) intervention. The TMS intervention will consist of 20 stimulation sessions
      over a four week period. At baseline and follow-up, patients will undergo comprehensive
      assessments including several SCA rating scales, along with sophisticated tests of balance
      (ie. walking, standing, and muscle coordination). Patients will also complete a series of
      neurophysiologic tests to evaluate the function of the cerebellum and its connections before
      and after the intervention.

      Investigators anticipate patients receiving real TMS will show better balance, fewer falls,
      and improved mobility, while those undergoing sham stimulation will show no benefits. If our
      prediction is correct, this study will provide evidence-based support for a new treatment to
      improve the lives of patients with SCA.
