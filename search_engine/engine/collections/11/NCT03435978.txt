      recent years. Currently, adipose tissue is considered to be a true endocrine gland that
      fulfills multiple roles in regulating different biological functions. Communication between
      adipose tissue and the rest of the systems is accomplished through bioactive mediators
      (adipokines) Adipokines control energy homeostasis and are involved in metabolic, endocrine
      and immunological processes.The prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) in young population
      continues to rise. Obesity is a chronic inflammatory disorder in which leptin, adiponectin
      and C reactive protein (CRP) play an important role. This study aimed to determine whether
      these adipokines are significant markers in defining MetS in pediatric population and to
      assess the effect of hypocaloric diet and physical activity on serum concentrations of
      adiponectine, leptin, and high sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP).

      The investigators tested the hypothesis that long-term lifestyle changes and moderate weight
      loss would reduce the plasma concentrations of adipokines involved in inflammation,
      angiogenesis, and chemotaxis and would increase adiponectin concentrations.

      Material and methods:

      A prospective study was conducted over a period of 1 year, between January 2016 and December
      2016, on 66 cases of obesity in children diagnosed at the Louis Å¢urcanu Emergency Hospital
      for Children Timisoara. The patients diagnosed with MetS were put on diet and physical
      exercise for 3 months.
