      a two-level instrumented posterolateral fusion (PLF) procedure. Prior to surgery, each
      patient will be randomized to receive MagnetOs Putty on the assigned side of the spine and
      autograft bone on the other at the diseased levels. They will be followed up at discharge,
      Week 2, Week 6, Month 3, Month 6, Month 9, and Month 12. An interim analysis will be
      performed once 15 patients have completed their Month 6 visit and have measurements for the
      endpoints available to measure effectiveness. The primary endpoint will be analyzed at Month
      12.

      In this study, MagnetOs Putty will be applied according to the latest Instructions for Use
      approved in the United States. Specifically, MagnetOs Putty will be used as a bone graft
      extender mixed with autograft in a 1:1 vol.% in patients with two-level degenerative disc
      disease with up to grade 1 spondylolisthesis requiring treatment with an instrumented
      posterolateral spine fusion procedure. The fusion procedure (PLF) will be left to the
      surgeon's discretion.

      Radiographs will be obtained at Screening, Day 0, Week 6, Month 3, and Month 9. CT scans will
      only be obtained at Month 6 and Month 12.
