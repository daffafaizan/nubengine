    
      10 Clinics within Stanford Health Care are randomized to receive or not receive provider
      alerts for 5 commonly overused tests and treatments.

      Thus there will potentially be 50 clinics enrolled across the 5 tests/treatment categories.
      However, it is expected that some clinics will meet criteria to be one of the 10 clinics in
      more than test/treatment category. Thus the total number of clinics involved will be between
      10 and 50.

      These 5 tests / treatments are taken from the Choosing Wisely list. All alerts will be
      provided using the electronic medical record and will be automated.
