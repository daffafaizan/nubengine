      each year, the participants in the experimental arm receive app-assisted CBT-I. In the first
      year, participants with primary insomnia are recruited and assigned to the experimental arm
      or the active-control arm with matched age, gender and education status. The subject number
      in each arm is 20. Participants in each arm receive a 6-week standard CBT-I. In the
      experimental arm, the participants use electronic sleep diary and message reminder to record
      sleep pattern. In the active-control group, the participants use traditional paper-pencil
      sleep diary instead. In the second year, participants with primary insomnia are recruited and
      assigned to the experimental arm or the active-control arm with matched age, gender and
      education status. The subject number in each arm is 20. Participants in each arm receive a
      6-week standard CBT-I. In the experimental arm, the participants use app with function of
      social persuasion to encourage each other. In the active-control group, no social persuasion
      is given beyond the treatment sessions. In the third year, participants with comorbid
      depressive disorder and insomnia are recruited and assigned to the experimental arm or the
      active-control arm with matched age, gender and education status. The subject number in each
      arm is 20. Participants in each arm receive a 6-week standard CBT-I. In the experimental arm,
      the participants use app module that provides a multi-media assisted Tai-Chi video to
      practice Tai-Chi. In the active-control group, a traditional Tai-CHi teaching digital video
      disc is provided to help the participants practice Tai-Chi.
