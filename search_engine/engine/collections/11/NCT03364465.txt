    
      Lung separation will be performed by DLT technique. Mechanical ventilation will be applied in
      volume-controlled mode. During two-lung ventilation, VT will be set at 8 mL/kg predicted body
      weight. During one-lung ventilation, in GroupFix VT will be decreased to 6 mL/kg PBW with 5
      cmH2O PEEP.

      In GroupVar VT will be 6 ml/kg predicted body weight Â±33% with 5 cmH2O PEEP. Respiratory rate
      will be adjusted to maintain same minute ventilation as during two-lung ventilation.
