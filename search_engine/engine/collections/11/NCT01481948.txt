      program for 8-10 year old African American girls. A pilot study with 80 girls established its
      feasibility: recruitment goals were met; attrition rates were < 10%; logon rates to the
      online program were 74.5%; and statistically significant increases in fruit and vegetable
      consumption and time spent being physically active were observed. The outcome evaluation will
      recruit 400 child-parent pairs to examine short and longer term effects of the program on
      obesity risk. It will also conduct mediation analyses to examine pathways of effect. At the
      end of the study, the web based program will be hosted on the CNRC web site. Although the use
      of the internet as a method for changing health behavior is not new, the use of an internet
      program alone, with no face to face interaction, is novel. This is one of the first programs
      to attempt this, particularly in an at-risk population.
