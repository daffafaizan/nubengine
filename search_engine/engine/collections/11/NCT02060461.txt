      astigmatism. In LASIK, the cornea is reshaped to focus images more clearly on the retina
      without the aid of glasses or contact lenses. LASIK involves two steps: creation of a corneal
      flap, which can be performed by a mechanical microkeratome or a femtosecond laser, and
      reshaping of the cornea by another laser, an excimer laser.

      The accuracy of the LASIK flap thickness is a key safety consideration to reduce the
      likelihood of complications following LASIK. Femtosecond laser technology has significantly
      improved the predictability of LASIK flap dimensions while supporting similar visual acuity
      results.

      The Alcon FS200 femtosecond laser is approved for human use by the United States Food and
      Drug Administration and was recently released in the US market. This study will directly
      compare outcomes of LASIK performed with this newer laser to those performed with the AMO
      IntraLase femtosecond laser.
