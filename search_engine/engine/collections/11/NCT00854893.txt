      demonstrated that the perception of action words activates motor representations in the
      language-dominant hemisphere. However, it is not known whether modulation of excitability has
      an effect on learning new action words. Thus, we hypothesize that transcranial direct current
      stimulation over the motor cortex of the language-dominant hemiphere modulates the
      acquisition of new action words. The results bear the potential to design new rehabilitative
      strategies in stroke patients with aphasia. The motor cortex might offer an access to the
      language network that can be used for interventional approaches such as neurostimulation.
