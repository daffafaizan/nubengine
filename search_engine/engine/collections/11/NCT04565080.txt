    
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the clinical correlates of the effects of the
      COVID-19 pandemic on patients with Functional movement disorder (FMD) and Parkinson s Disease
      (PD).

      Primary objectives:

      To evaluate the change in neurological symptoms domain of the survey between pre and
      post-COVID 19 in FMD and PD patients.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To evaluate the change in total score of the survey between pre and post COVID 19 in FMD
           and PD patients

        -  To evaluate the change in other symptom domains of the survey between pre and post COVID
           19 in FMD and PD patients. Domains include: Mood/Energy, sleep, symptoms of abnormal
           movements related or unrelated to primary disease, physical health and exercise related
           change

      Exploratory objectives:

        -  To evaluate whether there is a modifying effect of disease group in the changes in total
           score or symptom domains

        -  To evaluate whether there is a relationship between disease severity and changes in
           total score or symptom domains

        -  To evaluate whether there is a correlation between changes across symptom domains

        -  To evaluate whether there is a correlation in raw score across symptom domains within
           each period

      Research Methods:

      Data will be solely collected through the use of online instruments via CiSTAR as a designed
      questionnaire.

      Questionnaire items

      A questionnaire aimed at determining the effects of the COVID 19 pandemic and subsequent
      isolation on functional state of patients with FMD and PD.

      The questionnaire items include:

      Items investigating Mood/Energy before and after COVID 19 out break

      Items investigating Sleep habits before and after COVID 19 out break

      Items investigating Neurological symptoms before and after COVID 19 out break

      Items investigating daily functioning before and after COVID 19 out break

      Items investigating Exercise habits before and after COVID 19 out break

      No questionnaire items will be actionable , which are items that would identify an imminent
      risk for participant safety requiring urgent and immediate medical or psychiatric
