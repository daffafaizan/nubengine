      within a pharmacy context and tailor the information learned about barriers into a novel
      immunization registry training program with strategies specific to individual subsets of
      pharmacies, independent pharmacies in rural areas. Doing so will help achieve the long-term
      goal which is to increase the use of immunization registries in community pharmacies in
      Alabama.

      The specific aims are to

        1. identify barriers and best practices of immunization registry implementation,

        2. use a participatory design approach to develop an immunization registry training
           program, and

        3. disseminate and assess the impact of the immunization registry training program among
           community pharmacies' registry participation rates.

      The impact of the training program on registry participation rates will be assessed using a
      randomized controlled trial design comparing Alabama community pharmacies' registry data as
      well as intention to participate.
