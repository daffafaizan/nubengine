      treatment of various thromboembolic disorders. Predictable pharmacokinetic (PK) and
      pharmacodynamic (PD) properties, coupled with a few drug-drug and food-drug interactions,
      distinguishes DOACs from a traditionally used anticoagulant - warfarin, allowing fixed dosing
      without routine coagulation monitoring. Patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are
      living as long as their HIV-negative counterparts due to safe and efficacious antiretroviral
      therapy (ART). Persons with HIV are at higher risk for thromboembolic events and DOACs are a
      feasible option for anticoagulation in this population. However, there is a lack of drug
      interaction and safety data currently on the co-administration cobicistat (COBI)-boosted
      antiretroviral (ARV) regimens with rivaroxaban and apixaban. Rivaroxaban and apixaban are
      both metabolized by cytochrome P450 isozyme (CYP) 3A4 and their absorption is modulated by
      permeability glycoprotein (P-gp), both of which are inhibited by the PK booster COBI. It is
      therefore possible that plasma concentrations of rivaroxaban and apixaban may be
      significantly increased when co-administered together with COBI. This is of clinical concern
      as increased anticoagulant exposure may result in bleeding without the security of routine
      clinical monitoring. The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of steady state
      concentrations of COBI and darunavir (DRV)/COBI on the PK and PD of single oral doses of
      rivaroxaban and apixaban.
