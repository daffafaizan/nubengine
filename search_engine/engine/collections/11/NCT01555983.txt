      compared to placebo in human subjects with spinal cord injury (SCI). A within-subject
      crossover study of the effects of cannabis versus placebo on spontaneous and evoked pain will
      be performed. A synopsis of antinociception with mood, cognitive impairment, psychomotor
      performance, and side effects will be obtained to help evaluate the utility of vaporized
      marijuana in SCI neuropathic pain.

      This study will compare the analgesic and side effect profile of low (3.5%) to high dose
      (7.0%) delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol in subjects with spinal cord injury pain. It is
      hypothesized that a low dose will produce a lesser degree of neuropsychological impairment
      while maintaining a similar degree of pain relief to the higher dose. The use of two
      different strengths will help determine tolerable dosing for the treatment of SCI neuropathic
      pain.
