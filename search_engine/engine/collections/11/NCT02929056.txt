      Participation is anticipated to last up to 15 weeks and will include a two week screening
      period, randomization (Visit 1) and office visits at the study doctor's office once every
      week for up to 12 weeks (Visit 2 - Visit 12). All participants will receive the standard of
      care wound treatment during the 2 week screening period. The treatment plan outlined in
      treatment group 1 or treatment group 2 will be followed after randomization.

      Participants will be randomly assigned (like flipping a coin) into one of two treatment
      groups. There is an equal chance to be enrolled into either of the two treatment groups.
      Neither the participant nor the study doctor can control the group assignment.

      Treatment Group 1: participants will receive the standard of care treatment including the use
      of a multi-layer compression wrap for their VLU.

      Treatment Group 2: participants will receive the application of the biologic product
      AmnioExCel™ dressing instead of the application of an alginate dressing in addition to
      standard debridement and the use of a multi-layer compression wrap for their VLU. If
      participants have more than one VLU, only one will be enrolled in the study and will receive
      the application of the AmnioExCel™ dressing. The remaining VLUs will receive the application
      of the alginate dressing.

      AmnioExCel™ is a human cellular and tissue based product that is registered with the United
      States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It is intended for use as a wound covering and is
      made of a dehydrated human amniotic membrane (innermost layer of the placenta) that was
      obtained from donated human placenta. The use of AmnioExCel™ specifically for this study is
      not considered as standard of care.
