      placebo. Dendritic cell-based immunotherapy consists of antigen-loaded autologous DC that are
      administered to patients with the intention of inducing antigen-specific T and B cell
      responses and proved safe with minimal side effects. Natural DC (nDC) consist of plasmacytoid
      DC and myeloid DC. Subjects will be randomized 2:1 and stratified by stage of disease,
      adjuvant radiotherapy, BRAF mutation status, HLA-type and nDC production centre. The
      treatment will be continued for a maximum of 1.5 years or until recurrence of disease,
      unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal from the study.
