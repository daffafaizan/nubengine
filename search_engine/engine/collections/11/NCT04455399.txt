    
      Prospective, single-center, randomized, clinical trial (RCT) comparing the efficiency and
      safety of a single-use IIG with a traditional technique using a dual blade speculum among
      patients undergoing IVI for various indications.

      The investigators will include eyes of adult patients scheduled to undergo unilateral IVI for
      neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD), polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV),
      diabetic macular edema (DME), retinal vein occlusion (RVO), choroidal neovascular membrane
      from pathologic myopia (PM) and uveitis. The investigators will exclude eyes with a history
      of extraocular or intraocular infection within 3 months of the scheduled IVI date, scleral
      thinning, history of previous glaucoma surgery, history of pars plana vitrectomy,
      hypersensitity to the IVI drug, propracaine or povidone iodine, and inability to understand
      the informed consent form.

      The eyes will be randomly assigned in 1:1 fashion into two injection arms: intravitreal
      injection guide (IIG) and dual blade speculum (DBS). At the time of injection, a random
      number generator will be used to generate an odd or even number for each eye. Odd eyes will
      be assigned to IIG and even eyes will be assigned to DBS. For same day bilateral injection,
      once the first eye is randomized to one technique, the second eye will be automatically
      assigned to the other technique. The study will be conducted in compliance with the
      Declaration of Helsinki. All patients will provide informed consent prior to start of study
      procedures.
