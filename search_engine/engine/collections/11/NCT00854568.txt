      frequently used in patients with aggress B-cell lymphoma in out institution. According to a
      Cochrane meta-analysis, epirubicin is less cardiotoxic than doxorubicin on a mg per mg basis.
      However, compared with 50mg/m2 of doxorubicin in CHOP, epirubicin was usually used at a
      higher dose (70mg/m2) to treat non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Because of the correlation
      between cumulative dose and risk of cardiotoxicity, it is reasonable to speculate that CEOP
      (70mg/m2) has less cardiotoxicity than CHOP (50mg/m2) when both regimens are administered
      with similar cycles.
