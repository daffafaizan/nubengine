    
      This controlled clinical trial aims to compare the effects of a multicomponent program that
      includes structured personalized exercise prescription in children with obesity (study group)
      with a control group that will be enrolled in a multicomponent program without structured
      personalized exercise prescription. All children will be followed for a period of 6 months.

      The parameters that will be evaluated between groups are physical fitness (measured by
      VO2max, ECG at rest, biomechanics and dynamometry), anthropometric measurements (weight
      height, BMI, plicometry, bioimpedance, metabolic (glucose oral tolerance curve, lipids,
      HOMA-IR, ISI-MATSUDA), early cardiovascular damage (carotid intima-media thickness,
      atherogenic dyslipidemia), inflammatory biomarkers (leptin, adiponectin, IL-17, IL-10,
      INF-gamma, IL-6, IL-12, y TNF-alpha), anxiety and depression scores evaluated with Child
      Depression Inventory (CID) and -Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children (STAI-CH), and allelic
      variants related to physical fitness (ACTN, TRH2 y FTO).
