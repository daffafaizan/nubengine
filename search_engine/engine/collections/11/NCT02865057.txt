      consented individually. Each resident will complete 15 baseline exams, 20 exams with
      immediate ultrasound confirmation, and 15 exams for post-test baseline. Exams will take place
      periodically throughout the year. Both 3rd and 4th year residents will be assessed during the
      same time period by the MFM fellows. Ultrasounds will follow the vaginal exam as closely as
      possible to prepare for delivery. A picture of the fetal position (with no name or MRN) for
      documentation to be taken during the SOC ultrasound and kept in the research chart for the
      resident.

      In training feedback is not always standard. This teaching tool, consistent and standard
      feedback with regard to the correlation between vaginal exam and ultrasound, would allow the
      resident to learn to assess fetal position more accurately.

      Information from the maternal chart (history and delivery information) will be collected as
      de identified. Data will be recorded on the data collection sheet which is labeled with a
      code number linking the resident participant only.

      Data collected from the residents will be assigned a random Code numbers used to link the
      subject to their data.

      Code and identifiers will be kept separate. Paper copies will be kept in a locked cabinet, in
      a locked office, in a locked suite.
