    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To establish the safety, tolerability, and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of p97
      inhibitor CB-5339 tosylate (CB-5339) administered orally on a schedule of once daily, 4 days
      on and 3 days off, in patients with advanced solid tumors and lymphomas.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the pharmacokinetic profiles of CB-5339. II. To assess the preliminary
      antitumor activity of CB-5339 in patients with advanced solid tumors and lymphomas.

      III. To determine the effects of CB-5339 on the ubiquitin proteasome system and on markers of
      cell death in pre- and post-treatment tumor biopsies and peripheral blood mononuclear cell
      (PBMC)s.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate potential associations between CB-5339 activity and genomic alterations
      assessed in circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (ctDNA).

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive p97 inhibitor CB-5339 tosylate orally (PO) once daily (QD) 4 days on and 3
      days off. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.
