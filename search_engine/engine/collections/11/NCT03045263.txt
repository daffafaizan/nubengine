      designed specifically as a parent-training model via telemedicine, with the goal of
      increasing access to empirically validated care. The project will feature an 18-week trial of
      parent training PRT via telemedicine in 12 cognitively able 3- to 6-year-old children with
      ASD. Intervention will focus on enhancing the following developmental skills: expressive and
      receptive language, play, and social interaction. Outcome measures will address changes in
      the aforementioned domains during structured observation and standardized assessment.
