      anesthesia is recommended for most surgical procedures of the lower part of the body,
      including herniorrhaphies; operations on the urinary tract, anus, and rectum; and orthopedic
      procedures on the pelvic girdle and lower extremities. Many anesthetic agents have been used
      for caudal anesthesia in pediatric patients, with lidocaine and Bupivacaine being most
      common. The major problems associated with this technique are the limited duration of
      analgesia and unwanted motor blockade.

      Addition of medications that prolong analgesia after a single shot caudal block has been
      investigated. Several authors have mentioned a special interest in using an opioid like
      morphine in caudal block for postoperative analgesia. When low dose morphine is used, the
      side effects are lower than when higher dose of morphine are used. A larger and definitive
      study is needed to compare very low dose morphine via caudal administration and caudal block
      without Opioid with regard to duration of analgesia and frequency of side effects. We plan to
      conduct a chart review in our center on pediatric patients that went to urological,
      orthopedic, and general surgery procedures for which caudal block were given and compare the
      effectiveness and side effects of very low dose morphine and caudal block without Opioid.
