      specific elimination of circulating Lp(a) should affect plaque growth and stability, we
      evaluated the efficacy of Lp(a) apheresis on changes in coronary plaque volume and
      composition and carotid intima-media thickness in patients with CHD on the background of
      optimal medical treatment.
