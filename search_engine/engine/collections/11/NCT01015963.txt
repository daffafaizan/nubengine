    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the genotype of ATP-binding cassette, sub-family C (CFTR/MRP), member 2
      (ABCC2) and solute carrier organic anion transporter family, member 1B3 (SLCO1B3) (and other
      genes potentially relevant in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of docetaxel in the
      future) in Caucasian and African-American cancer patients enrolled on clinical trial
      CLB-9871.

      II. Explore the relationships between these genotypes and docetaxel pharmacokinetic
      parameters (e.g., area under curve [AUC], steady-state volume of distribution [Vdss]).

      OUTLINE:

      Blood samples collected on clinical trial CLB-9871 are examined via ABCC2 and SLC01B3
      genotyping using TaqMan analysis. Other genes related to the pharmacokinetics and side
      effects of docetaxel may be considered for future genotyping. In some cases, panels of drug
      response single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on high-density arrays may be genotyped.
