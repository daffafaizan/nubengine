      colorectal cancer. The patients will be randomized into two groups. The control group will
      receive standard surgical treatment. The intervention group will in addition go through a
      preoperative comprehensive geriatric assessment. The assessment will include evaluation of
      co-morbidity and medication, social status, nutritional status, cognition, depression and
      physical performance. This assessment will form basis of an individualized intervention.
      Patients in the intervention group will participate in planned exercise programs before
      surgery, perioperative and postoperative.
