      setting.

      Intubation is a procedure frequently carried out by intensivist and a great number of
      complications have been related. Serious complications can occur, including the development
      of severe hypoxemia, arrhythmias, cardiac arrest with permanent anoxic brain damage or death.
      Additionally the poor physiological reserve of critically ill patients and the variable
      operator experience, means that this technique must be considered a risk event in critical
      patients.

      In recent years, it has been taken more and more importance of preoxygenation as a strategy
      that can avoid major complications in the intubation process.

      Similarly, the use of devices that facilitate intubation such as videolaryngoscopy, has been
      included in difficult airway management protocols. If the use of videolaryngoscopy compared
      with traditional laryngoscopy is associated with a higher success rate and a lower incidence
      of complications, still remains controversial.

      The investigators want to know the prevalence and risk factors for major complications in the
      intubation process of patients admitted to Intensive Care Unit (ICU). In addition, this study
      will try to assess the use and impact of both preoxygenation and videolaryngoscope in the
      intubation process.
