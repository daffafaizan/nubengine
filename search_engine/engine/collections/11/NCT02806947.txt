    
      The study is a Phase II randomized, open label, multicenter trial designed to identify
      whether sirolimus is a potential alternative to prednisone as an up-front treatment for
      patients with standard-risk acute GVHD defined according to clinical and biomarker-based risk
      stratification.

      Patients with previously untreated, standard-risk acute GVHD, according to the refined
      Minnesota Criteria, who are in need of systemic therapy, will have a 5 mL blood sample
      collected prior to randomization to assess their biomarker Ann Arbor Risk status. Ann Arbor
      scoring results will be provided 48-72 hours after randomization. Patients will begin their
      study treatment assignments within 24 hours of randomization. Those with biomarker results of
      combined AA1/2 risk will continue on their randomized study treatment and will be included
      for primary endpoint analysis (Day 28 complete or partial response) and all planned study
      procedures and assessments. In contrast, patients with AA3 biomarker risk and those patients
      with missing biomarker results may continue on their randomized therapies or start another
      therapy at their physicians' discretion. In addition, AA3 risk patients and those with
      missing results will not be considered in primary endpoint analysis, but will be included in
      a subset analysis.
