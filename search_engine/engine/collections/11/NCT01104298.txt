      doxorubicin in the first line of treatment of advanced sarcomas obtains better results than
      doxorubicin monotherapy.

      This proposal arises from the need to bring to the first line of treatment of advanced STS
      agents that have shown activity in second line. The goal is to improve available standard
      treatments. Tumors in patients not previously exposed to chemotherapy have not been selected
      in their biological behavior and they are the best scenario to test antitumor activity of a
      new anticancer drug.

      The combination of drugs with different mechanisms of action may be a clear advantage to
      obtain better results and potential synergy. On the other hand, the toxicity profiles of both
      study drugs are different and worsening or summative of adverse effects is not expected.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of the combination of trabectedin and
      doxorubicin in comparison with doxorubicin alone in patients with advanced non operable
      and/or metastatic Soft Tissue Sarcomas (STS).
