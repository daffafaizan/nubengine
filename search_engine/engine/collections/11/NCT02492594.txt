    
      Samples from immunosuppressed patients with febrile neutropenia (NP - defined as fever ≥
      38.5ºC and <500 ANC) will be taken:

        -  at the start of neutropenic fever

        -  after 24 hours

        -  after 48 hours

        -  before the start of antimycotic therapy, if pertinent

        -  at the end of antimycotic therapy, if pertinent

      The results ot analyses by a panfungal PCR screening assay developed at our institution
      (European patent No 1960536) and methods newly developed during the FUNGITECT project will be
      compared with conventional methods for fungal diagnostics such as HR (High Resolution)-CT,
      serological testing, histology and fungal culture. Additionally, genomic approaches will be
      employed to investigate host- and pathogen-related factors of susceptibility, pathogenicity
      and antimycotic resistance.
