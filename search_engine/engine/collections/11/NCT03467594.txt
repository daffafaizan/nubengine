      programme on various markers of physical fitness, cardiometabolic health and wellbeing of
      employees. The primary outcome measures are the following: aerobic fitness, grip strength,
      leg extensor power, blood pressure, fasting blood glucose levels, lipid profiles, body mass
      index, waist and hip circumference and self-report measures of psychological wellbeing. The
      secondary outcome measure is total physical activity. The primary and secondary outcomes
      measures will be assessed in the control and intervention groups at baseline and at the end
      of the intervention (8 weeks).
