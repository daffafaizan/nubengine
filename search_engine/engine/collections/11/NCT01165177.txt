      Step 1 will include analyses of the following objectives of ZOSTER-006 (NCT01165177): all HZ
      VE objectives and all reactogenicity/safety and immunogenicity objectives. At step 2, all
      objectives of study ZOSTER-006 (NCT01165177) will be analyzed. Objectives already analyzed at
      step 1 will be re-analyzed (confirmatory descriptive in case of inferential analysis at step
