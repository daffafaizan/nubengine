      as in the most extensive types of interventions any form of regional anesthesia is
      inadequate, duration of surgery is short but requires deep level of anesthesia after which a
      quick awakening and most rapid release from hospital are expected, with a known high
      perioperative risk complications of obese patients.

      Oral surgical procedures in the oral cavity due to possible postoperative upper airway oedema
      increase the risk of postoperative hypoxia in obese patients. Therefore, it is important to
      intraoperatively mechanically ventilate obese patients with the aim of good
      ventilation-perfusion ratio without creating new atelectasis, to minimize the risk of
      postoperative respiratory decompensation and to provide rapid recovery.

      As the prevalence of obesity in the world increases as chronic diseases, the number of obese
      patients scheduled for oral surgery is growing. Studies involving different ways of
      intraoperative mechanical ventilation of obese patients are mostly processed laparoscopic
      abdominal studies that can not exclude the additional effect of intraabdominal pressure on
      the formation of pulmonary atelectasis.
