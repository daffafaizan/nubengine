      general anesthesia. There are several suggested causes of EA and pain has been considered one
      of them. Magnesium is an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist and increasingly
      used as an analgesic-adjuvant. We evaluate the Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium (PAED)
      Scale to investigate whether the intraoperative infusion of magnesium sulfate reduces the
      incidence of EA in pediatric patients who undergo ophthalmic outpatient surgery.
