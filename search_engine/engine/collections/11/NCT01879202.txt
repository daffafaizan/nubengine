      procedures, nutrition, and energy conservation programmes. These strategies should be
      considered as first-line options since they add to overall wellbeing, have no side effects
      and increase the patient's autonomy. However, in most cases these strategies will not suffice
      to keep the patient symptom free on the long term. Also, patients with overwhelming and
      severe fatigue will be unlikely to engage in exercise. In these cases adding pharmacologic
      therapy will be the next step. Until now, Amantadine, Modafinil, and Pemoline have been used
      among others, with some success. Also antidepressants like buprione, fluoxetine, and
      venlafaxine have been used although they have never been systematically studied for the
      management of MS-related fatigue. However, if a mood disorder is present, it is appropriate
      to treat it before pursuing pharmacologic therapy of fatigue. Nevertheless, the response rate
      of all pharmacologic therapies of MS-related fatigue is not totally convincing making
      alternative pharmacologic therapies furthermore desirable. Methylphenidate is an antagonist
      of dopamine and norepinephrine transporters on the presynaptic neuronal cell membrane.
      Reduced reuptake results in an increase in extracellular levels of both neurotransmitters.
      Until now, methylphenidate has been successfully used to treat fatigue in HIV and parkinsonÂ´s
      disease, data on its efficacy in MS are not available. The aim of this study is to determine
      the efficacy of methylphenidate treatment in MS-associated fatigue. The treatment phase will
      be 6 weeks and treatment efficacy will be measured by validated questionnaires (Fatigue
      Severity Scale FSS, modified Fatigue Impact Scale MFIS) and by a neuropsychological test
      (Test for Attentional Performance).
