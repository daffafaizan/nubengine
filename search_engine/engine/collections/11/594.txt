hormonal modification of the distribution of 1-amino-cyclopentanecarboxylic acid-1-c14 in the ratfour hormones have been examined for their ability to alter the distributionin the rat of the new model amino acid,1-aminocyclopentanecarboxylic acid-1-c14.  althoughthe total tissue concentrations of thisamino acid were considerably less than thosefound previously for a-aminoisobutyric acid,the changes produced by the hormones weremuch the same for both amino acids.  hydrocortisoneelevated the liver level of 1-aminocyclopentanecarboxylicacid within 2 hr.bovine growth hormone accelerated entry ofthe amino acid into both skeletal muscle andliver of hypophysectomized rats within 1 hr.testosterone propionate elevated its distributionratio in the kidney but not in skeletalmuscle, whereas b-estradiol significantly increaseduptake of the model amino acid onlyby the immature uterus.  only growth hormoneproduced a significant change in the serumlevel of 1-aminocyclopentanecarboxylic acidunder the conditions used.
