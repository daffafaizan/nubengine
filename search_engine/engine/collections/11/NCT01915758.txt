      I study to evaluate the photoallergic potential of Clindamycin-Tretinoin Gel. The design
      consisted of the following periods: screening, induction, rest, challenge, and rechallenge
      (if indicated). Induction visit 1 was to occur within 5 days of screening visit 2. The study
      expected to enroll approximately 62 healthy adult volunteers. Subjects were to receive
      repeated 24-hour study patch applications; after patch removal, the sites were irradiated
      with ultraviolet B light (UVB) and visible light (VIS) during the induction period
      (consisting of 6 consecutive induction phases), and ultraviolet A light (UVA)/ UVB and VIS
      during the challenge and rechallenge periods. Each application site was observed
      approximately 1, 24, 48, and 72 hours later for signs of inflammation.
