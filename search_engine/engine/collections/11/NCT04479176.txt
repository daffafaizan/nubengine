      results of the two recent studies were different. One study was performed by intranasal drip
      method(INDM), and the facial temperatures increased after TN-SPGB. The other study was
      performed by cotton stick method(CSM), and the facial temperatures decreased or were not
      changed after TN-SPGB. For these results, the authors hypothesize that the results will
      differ depending on the method of TN-SPGB, that is, INDM will increase the facial
      temperatures due to sympathetic block dominantly, and CSM will decrease or maintain the
      facial temperatures due to parasympathetic block dominantly.
