      using a repetition maximum (RM) exercise in which patients performed 1RM with the maximum
      bearable weight. Once the 1RM was determined, training was divided into the following
      regimen: 2 series of 8 repetitions, the first with 50% and the second with 70% of 1RM.

      The exercises were knee extension and flexion and hip abduction and adduction, all performed
      in machines. The 1RM load was reevaluated every 2 weeks.

      The control group remained on a three-month waiting list for physiotherapy. Patients were
      assessed for pain, function, quality of life, muscle strength and six-minute walk test.
