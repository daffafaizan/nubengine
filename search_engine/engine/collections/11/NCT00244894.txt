        -  Determine the impact of acupuncture therapy on the frequency and intensity of hot
           flashes and the quality of life of patients with prostate cancer undergoing androgen
           deprivation.

        -  Determine if blood serotonin and urinary 5-HIAA are increased in patients treated with
           acupuncture.

        -  Determine if plasma calcitonin gene-related peptide and MHPG are reduced in patients
           with hot flashes due to androgen deprivation treated with acupuncture.

        -  Determine the ability of tongue diagnosis, a traditional Chinese clinical assessment
           method, to predict clinical and biological changes in these patients.

        -  Determine the effect of acupuncture on insomnia and loss of vitality caused by hot
           flashes in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo acupuncture for 30 minutes twice weekly for 4 weeks and then once
      weekly for an additional 6 weeks.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, at weeks 2, 4, 6, and 10, and then at 6 weeks after
      completion of study treatment.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 6 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 25 patients will be accrued for this study.
