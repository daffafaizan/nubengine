      NIAAA criteria for high risk drinking were recruited from 14 sites nationwide (control
      group-Spring, 2004; intervention group-Summer, 2004). 26% of screened ED patients met
      inclusion criteria. All enrollees received a list of local referral resources. Intervention
      group patients also participated in a 15 minute negotiated interview and ED staff referred
      them directly for treatment if indicated. Enrollees completed 3-month follow-up surveys with
      a telephone Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system. A total of 1137 patients were enrolled
      across 14 sites (561 intervention, 576 control), with 62% male, 37% Black, and 38% White, and
      a mean age of 37. At baseline intervention-i and control-c groups were similar in demographic
      characteristics and number of drinks on a typical day (mean-i 5.00, mean-c 5.12) and maximum
      drinks on a given day in the past month (mean-i 7.51, mean-c 7.33). The 3 month follow-up
      rate was 62% (n=687); the 6 month follow-up rate was 52% (n=567). The 12 month follow up is
      currently underway.
