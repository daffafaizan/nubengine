      injury. The protective effect of preconditioning is induced by short periods (1-5 minutes) of
      non-lethal ischemia to the target tissue, which becomes resistant to a prolonged, otherwise
      lethal, period of ischemia. Despite its proven potency in experimental models, ischemic
      preconditioning has not reached widespread clinical application because of the difficulties
      in applying the stimulus to the target organ (eg Heart, Brain), and even brief ischemia to
      the target organ can cause dysfunction.

      Remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) is a more clinically relevant stimulus. It has been
      shown that preconditioning of one coronary territory induces ischemia protection in other
      parts of the heart. Subsequently, other studies have shown, in rodent models, that
      preconditioning of one organ (eg kidney) could induce protection in other organs (eg heart).
      We recently have confirmed, in a series of animal and human preclinical studies, that this
      concept can be widened; ultimately showing that four 5-minute episodes of ischemia to the
      skeletal limb muscles (induced by inflating a standard blood pressure cuff to a level higher
      than the blood pressure) protects the heart and lungs against ischemia-reperfusion injury in
      children undergoing cardiac surgery using cardiopulmonary bypass.

      The current research is designed to investigate with MRI spectroscopy techonology, the
      potential physiological mechanisms involved in the protective effects of preconditioning, and
      the effects of ischemia and exercise.
