      I. Determine the 2-year event-free survival of patients with Group B intraocular
      retinoblastoma treated with neoadjuvant chemoreduction comprising carboplatin and vincristine
      and standardized local ophthalmic therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the response rate after one course of chemoreduction (before standardized local
      ophthalmic therapy) in these patients.

      II. Correlate response rate with event-free survival in patients treated with this regimen.

      III. Determine the incidence of toxic effects in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive chemoreduction comprising carboplatin IV over 60 minutes followed by
      vincristine IV over 1-2 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 6 courses in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After the first course of
      chemoreduction, patients undergo standardized local ophthalmic therapy comprising local laser
      therapy, cryotherapy, and/or radioactive plaque comprising iodine I 125 or ruthenium Ru 106.

      Patients are followed every 3-4 weeks until there is no active tumor seen on a minimum of 3
      ophthalmic exams under anesthesia, every 6-8 weeks until 3 years of age, every 4-6 months
      until 10 years of age, and then annually thereafter.
