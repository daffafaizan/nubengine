      adenocarcinoma of the stomach or gastroesophageal junction when treated with irinotecan,
      fluorouracil, and leucovorin calcium. II. Determine the qualitative and quantitative
      toxicity, and reversibility of toxicity, of this regimen in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive irinotecan IV over 90 minutes, leucovorin calcium IV over 15
      minutes, and fluorouracil IV once weekly for 4 weeks followed by 2 weeks of rest. Treatment
      continues every 6 weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.
      Patients are followed at 30 days, and then until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-37 patients will be accrued for this study.
