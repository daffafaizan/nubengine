      common cause of cancer death in the U.S. has been compromised because only about half of
      eligible patients have been appropriately screened. Patients contribute to inadequate
      colorectal cancer screening by failing to complete ordered tests. Several studies have
      reported low rates of attendance to scheduled sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy studies. Because
      physicians offer limited counseling when ordering these tests, approaches are needed to
      address patient concerns and to promote adherence to scheduled colon studies. Therefore, we
      conducted a trial of a theory-based telephone intervention by patient 'peer coach' who was
      trained to address barriers to colonoscopy attendance versus a mailed professional brochure.
      The support was targeted to those at greatest risk of non-attendance.
