      usefulness. In addition, with long-term treatment with AZT, there is evidence of virus
      resistance to the drug. Compounds that are more effective and less toxic than those in
      present use would be beneficial, especially if they are active against AZT-resistant viruses.
      Nevirapine has shown in vitro (test tube studies) activity in inhibiting HIV replication
      (reproduction). In vitro studies have shown that nevirapine and AZT work together to inhibit
      HIV replication.

      Groups of 10 patients are studied at each of three dose levels. Five patients at each dose
      level have less than 3 months of prior AZT treatment; five patients at each dose level have
      at least 12 months of previous AZT treatment and tolerated an AZT regimen of 600 mg/day (200
      mg every 8 hours). At least 24 patient-weeks of treatment with the combination treatment must
      be completed without requiring dose interruption before the next dosage level can be started.
      All 30 patients must be enrolled at a lower dosage level before a higher dosage level is
      started. Patients begin treatment with AZT. 14 days later, patients begin treatment with
      nevirapine in addition to the AZT. After 24 weeks, patients have the option to continue
      long-term treatment with either nevirapine or standard treatment.
