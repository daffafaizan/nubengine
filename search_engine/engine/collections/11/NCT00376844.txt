        -  Compare the rate of 5-year locoregional relapse in patients undergoing external-beam
           radiotherapy or vaginal brachytherapy vs observation only after surgery for stage I
           endometrial cancer.

        -  Compare 5-year rate of distant metastases in these patients.

        -  Determine overall survival rate in these patients.

        -  Determine prognostic factors for relapse and morbidity.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment
      arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo either vaginal brachytherapy or external-beam radiotherapy.

        -  Arm II: Patients are observed and undergo no further treatment. After completion of
           study treatment, patients are followed for approximately 83 days.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 400 patients will be accrued for this study.
