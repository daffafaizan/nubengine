    
      Approximately forty-eight (48) participants will be randomized 1:1 to receive

      (a) Intramuscular (IM) administration of CYT107 at 10 μg/kg followed, after 72hrs of
      observation, by 10 μg/kg twice a week for 3 weeks (maximum 7 administrations adjusted to
      patient's length of stay in the hospital) or (b) Intramuscular (IM) placebo (normal saline)
      at the same frequency.

      The aim of the study is to test the ability of CYT107 to produce an immune reconstitution of
      these patients and observe possible association with a clinical improvement.

      This cohort is dedicated to oncology patients
