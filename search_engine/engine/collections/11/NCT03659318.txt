      improve long-term clinical results and implant durability, particularly in younger patients.
      Several comparative studies of conventional and robotic-assisted TKAs demonstrated that
      improved alignment of the components was obtained after the robotic-assisted TKAs than
      conventional TKAs.

      To date, however, no comprehensive synthesis of long-term randomized data has been conducted
      specifically for robotic-assisted TKA, particularly in younger patients. It is crucial to
      determine whether improved alignment of the TKA components obtained by using
      robotic-assistance, would improve better long-term and functional results and survivorship of
      TKAs.

      The aims of the current study were to examine the two groups of patients after long-term
      follow-up to determine whether the clinical results, radiographic and CT scan results, and
      the survivorship of TKA would be better after robotic-assisted TKA than after conventional
      TKA.
