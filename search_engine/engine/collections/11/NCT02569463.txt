      hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), is a rapidly progressing life-threatening disease.
      VP16 (Etoposide) is a well-known standard therapy, but is associated with substantial adverse
      effects, especially myelosuppression and infections , while steroids and ciclosporin (CSA)
      are not always efficient in this disease.

      The investigators hypothesized that low- dose IL-2 could be a novel therapy in MAS. This
      clinical study will test the efficacy and safety of low dose IL-2 treatment in MAS. The
      investigators perform a single-centre pilot trial with rhIL-2 in MAS. The investigators
      evaluate the effectiveness and safeness of low-dose IL-2 for MAS.
