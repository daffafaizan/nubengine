      management constitute 17% of closed claims, difficult intubation being the most common one
      with an occurrence rate of 5%. Problems like delayed intubation, misplaced tracheal tube, or
      airway trauma are frequently seen in outpatient settings and end up with either death or
      hypoxic brain damage. Therefore, preoperative visit should include detailed assessment of the
      airways according to clues of difficult intubation.Several studies compared the King Vision
      video laryngoscope with other laryngoscopes in manikins simulating difficult airway
      scenarios, and reported better glottic views. The investigators aimed to study the
      correlation between the Mallampati classification and the glottic views (Cormack-Lehane
      grade) obtained with Macintosh laryngoscopy, and the King Vision video laryngoscopy in adult
      patients scheduled for general anesthesia. Secondary outcomes will be successful intubation
      rate, time to obtain the best view, time to successful intubation, and complications related
      to laryngoscopy will be compared.
