      I. Assess the anti tumor activity and toxicity profile of pazopanib hydrochloride in patients
      with metastatic urothelial cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the pharmacokinetics of pazopanib hydrochloride in these patients. II. Evaluate
      pre- and post-treatment changes in circulating endothelial cells, monocytes and platelets,
      and angiogenesis-related factors in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive oral pazopanib hydrochloride once
      daily on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients undergo blood collection periodically for correlative studies and pharmacological
      studies. Samples are analyzed for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and soluble VEGF
      receptor II concentration via ELISA. Circulating endothelial cells are also measured.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 1 year.
