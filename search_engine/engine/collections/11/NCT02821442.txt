    
      A double blind prospective randomized controlled pilot study with cross over.

      To assess the effectiveness of EA in improving pain and function for chronic chemotherapy
      Induced Peripheral Neuropathy (CIPN) 30 participants will be recruited 6 months
      post-completion of chemotherapy. Fifteen participants will be randomized to the true EA group
      and 15 to the sham EA group. Those participants randomized to the sham group will cross over
      to receive true EA after the trial is complete.

      Treatment consists of EA or sham EA 1 x per week x 6 weeks. Re-assessment visits occur after
      the 6 week intervention and again 2 months post trial.

      Each assessment visit quantifies the sensory experience of CIPN at that moment in time using
      Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST) which includes; thermal detection and thermal pain
      thresholds, light touch detection using nylon monofilament hairs (Semmes Weinstein
      Monofilaments (SWMF)), static 2-point discrimination, pressure algometry and vibration
      thresholds. Patient reported outcome measures including the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder
      and Hand (DASH), Lower extremity functional score (LEFS), the Self report Leeds Assessment of
      Neuropathic signs and symptoms (S-LANSS) pain questionaire will also be used.
