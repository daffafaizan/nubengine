      of getting pregnant by couples undergoing such treatment. Unfortunately, the numer of live
      births after ART remains still low. Over the past three decades, physicians have tried to
      improve infertility diagnosis and increase its successful treatment. An effort aimed at
      increasing effectivenes of diagnosis resulted in hypothesis that one of probable reasons of
      infertility may be the occurrence of microclots, which worsen implantation and embryos
      development. There are currently no published studies describing the effects of different
      ovarian hyperstimulation protocols on hemostasis (coagulation and fibrinolysis).

      The parameters of thrombin generation and efficiency of fibrinolysis will be evaluated in
      women qualified for ovarian hyperstimulation. The study may improve the effectiveness of ART.
