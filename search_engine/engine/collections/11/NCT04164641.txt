      vulnerable re-ulcerative diabetic foot incorporating physical therapy evaluation as well as
      the Noraxon gait analysis to generate quantitative and qualitative gait data. Once peak foot
      pressures and gait pathology is identified, gait remedy is fabricated including either a foot
      orthotic and/or an ankle foot prosthesis. Evaluation of constructed remedy will then be
      evaluated focusing on gait analysis data to validate decreased plantar foot peak pressures
      and gait realignment towards the reduction of the diabetic foot re-ulceration and subsequent
      foot or limb loss.
