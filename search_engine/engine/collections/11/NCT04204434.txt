      eligible. Patients will sign informed consent. Ten cc of blood will be drawn before beginning
      immune checkpoint inhibitors and 10 cc of blood will be drawn 1-4 months after treatment is
      initiated. Deidentitified blood samples will be sent to the lab of Dr. Jack Elias and Dr.
      Chun Geul Lee and analyzed for biomarkers. The blood samples will be linked to the patient by
      a research number. Response to treatment will be correlated to potential biomarkers. The
      stool samples will be linked to the patient by a research number. Bacterial DNA and RNA may
      be sequenced and data used to identify bacterial taxa and genes within the stool. In
      compliance with NIH guidelines, all human DNA data would be removed computationally, and will
      not be used in any analyses. Small molecules may be profiled with metabolomics. Bacteria may
      also be isolated from the stool into in vitro culture, and efficacy of single-strains or
      communities and/or their DNA, RNA, and metabolites on disease models may be assessed.
