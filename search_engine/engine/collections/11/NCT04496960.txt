      JAK inhibition in patients with primary Sjogren's Syndrome (SS). Secondary objectives will
      include investigating the effects of tofacitinib on target tissues (e.g., salivary glands),
      systemic inflammation, and on vascular function in SS subjects. We also aim to identify
      biomarkers of response that may be useful as endpoints in future studies.
