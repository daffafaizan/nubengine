    
      DMARD-naive polyarticular JIA patients with an early disease (onset less than 6 months) are
      randomized into one of three treatment strategies: (1) biological combination, i.e., anti-TNF
      therapy with infliximab plus methotrexate; (2) Combination of DMARDs with methotrexate,
      sulfasalazine, plus hydroxychloroquine; and (3) Methotrexate alone.

      The efficacy is evaluated by American College of Rheumatology Pediatric (ACR Pedi) criteria
      based on 6 core set variables (CSVs): 1. no of active joints; 2. no. of joints with pain or
      tenderness and limitation of motion; 3. ESR (mm/hr); 4. the Childhood Health Assessment
      Questionnaire (CHAQ); 5. Physician's Visual Analogue Scale (VAS); 6. Patient/Parent VAS. To
      fulfill ACR Pedi 75 criteria, 3/6 CSVs have to improve 75% and not more than 1/6 CSV worsen
      more than 30%. All direct and indirect costs are documented.

      The first phase of the study is open-label clinical trial lasting for 54 weeks. In the second
      phase of the study the patients are followed up to 5 years, and the long-term outcome of
      early aggressive therapy is analyzed. Serum, urine, and saliva samples are collected at 3 and
      5 years for translational research.
