      children from age 4 months - 7 months with elevated genetic risk for type 1 diabetes reduces
      the cumulative incidence of beta-cell autoantibodies and diabetes in childhood. The purpose
      of the GPPAD-POInT-Study is to induce immune tolerance to beta-cell autoantigens through
      regular exposure to oral insulin for a period of 29 to 32 months. Together with the results
      of the currently ongoing Pre-POINT-Early Study, this phase IIb study aims to investigate and
      consolidate the findings from the pilot Pre-POINT Study, namely safety and immune efficacy at
      a daily dose of 67.5 mg oral insulin. Since babies and young children will be tested in the
      GPPAD-POInT-Study, the 67.5 mg dose will be reached by dose escalation starting at 7.5 mg for
      2 months, followed by exposure to 22.5 mg for 2 months, and reaching the desired 67.5 mg
      dose. The GPPAD-POInT-Study aims to recruit 1040 children into the trial.

      The active substance for oral application is human insulin. Oral Insulin will be applied as a
      capsule containing 7.5, 22.5 and 67.5 mg of the active substance together with filling
      substance microcrystalline cellulose.
