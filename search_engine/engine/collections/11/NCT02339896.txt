      proven to be immunogenic and effection when using purified vero cell vaccine (PVRV) In
      present, new chromatographically purified vero cell rabies vaccine (SPEEDA), chromatography
      purifed vero cell derived rabies vaccine, is manufactured by the Liaoning Chengda
      Biotechnology is available This study has a goal to determine the immunogenicity of speeda
      when using with post exposure rabies intradermal vaccination with or without rabies immune
