      activity during pregnancy over sedentary behavior. Uniquely, this study looks to determine an
      optimal step count for achieving goal gestational weight gain. In doing so, this will enable
      clinicians to better counsel patients on a low cost, at home activity that can aid in
      improved maternal and fetal outcomes. This optimal step count would be used in future
      randomized clinical trials to determine whether this goal step count could be used to benefit
      other maternal and fetal outcomes such as gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, preterm labor,
      cesarean section rates, and birth weight.

      Participation will begin at the patients 18-22 week clinic visit and will last until
      delivery. At the 18 - 22 week clinic visit a pedometer will be given to the patient. Patient
      will be instructed by a study team member to wear the pedometer on a hip for 7 days every 4
      weeks and will submit daily step count for the day via a link to an online submission form
      which will arrive in the email once a day for 7 days in a row. An email reminder will be
      received every four weeks to prepare the patient for the reporting of daily step count, if no
      response is received electronically via the online submission form after 14 days a second
      reminder will be received. No change in normal activity will be required, instructions will
      be given to maintain normally activity during the week. The pedometer will be returned when
      patient arrives to labor and delivery to deliver.

      The risks of this study are minimal as there will be no diversion from normal daily routine.

      The results of this research may guide the future studies in walking in pregnancy in relation
      to maternal, fetal, and neonatal morbidity.
