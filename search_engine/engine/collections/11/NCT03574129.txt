      comic book for disclosure (to be used with children over 10 years of age) and transition
      booklet "Taking Charge" developed by stakeholders in Kenya.

      The disclosure tool includes a cartoon book, readiness and tracking tools used in clinic and
      health care worker training material. The intervention progresses from incomplete to complete
      disclosure using a narrative about soldiers fighting the battle of infection as the rationale
      for taking medicine. This tool has been validated for use in Namibia.

      The adapted transition toolkit includes a transition booklet, tracking tools to be used by
      health care workers and a readiness assessment checklist to be completed by study staff. The
      booklet has 4 chapters addressing key areas to support adolescents gain the knowledge and
      skills they need in adult care. The 4 chapters are: HIV treatment literacy, self management,
      communication and support.
