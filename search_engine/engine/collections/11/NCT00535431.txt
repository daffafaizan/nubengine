      Primary Objective To investigate the effects of AER 001 on the late asthmatic response in
      mild to moderate asthmatics

      Secondary Objectives

        -  To examine the effects of AER 001 on antigen induced airway hyperactivity to adenosine
           monophosphate and blood levels of circulating IgE.

        -  To characterise the pharmacokinetics of nebulised AER 001.

      Exploratory Objectives

        -  To examine the effects of AER 001 on circulating sIL-13Rα2 and IFNgamma.

        -  To examine the results of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis of IL-4, IL-13,
           IL-4Rα and IL-13R α to determine if there is any correlation between AER 001 response
           and genotype

        -  To examine levels of anti-AER 001 following administration of AER 001

      Methodology:

        -  Single centre, double-blind, randomised, parallel group, repeated dose study in male and
           female asthmatic subjects.

        -  A sufficient number of subjects (at least 30 subjects) will be recruited to ensure that
           at least 26 completed sets of data will be obtained.

        -  Subjects will be randomised to receive either AER 001 60 mg / matched volume Placebo in
           a ratio of 1 active : 1 placebo ( block size of 6).

        -  Treatments will be administered by nebulization from a PARI LC Plus nebulizer

        -  Subjects are to receive b.i.d. administration of AER 001 / placebo for 27 days. A
           morning dose will be given on Day 28, (24 hours after Day 27 am-dose).
