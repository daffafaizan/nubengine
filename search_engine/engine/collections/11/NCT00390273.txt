    
      Study design: Physiological study, controlled, open, non randomised

      Healthy male subjects, 18 to 30 years old

      Principal objective : To evaluate the influence of metformin on lactate metabolism
      (production) following exogenous lactate overload.

        -  Objective 2: To evaluate the influence of metformin on lactate metabolism (production)
           after muscular exercise.

        -  Objective 3: To evaluate the influence of metformin on lactate metabolism (elimination)
           after exogenous lactate overload.

        -  Objective 4: To evaluate the influence of metformin on lactate metabolism (elimination)
           after muscular exercise.

      Principal outcome : Lactate production following exogenous lactate overload.

        -  Outcome 2: Production of lactate following muscular exercise test.

        -  Outcome 3 and 3': Parameters modelizing elimination of lactate following exogenous
           lactate overload (bi-exponential model).

        -  Outcome 4 and 4': Parameters modelizing elimination of lactate following muscular
           exercise test (bi-exponential model).
