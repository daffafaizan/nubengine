    
      This is a randomized, controlled clinical study in which 108 subjects with type 2 diabetes
      will be randomized into 3 different groups:

      Full fat dairy group (Group A): will receive nutritional counseling aiming to maintain body
      weight from a registered dietician and will be instructed to include at least ≥3 servings of
      full fat dairy products into their diet

      Low fat dairy group (Group B): will receive nutritional counseling aiming to maintain body
      weight from a registered dietician and will be instructed to include at least ≥3 servings of
      low fat dairy products into their diet

      Control group (Group C): will receive nutritional counseling aiming to maintain body weight
      from a registered dietician and will not be asked to include a specified amount or type of
      dairy products

      Subjects in Groups A and B will be educated about different dairy products' serving sizes and
      fat content. Subjects in all 3 groups will be asked to record their daily intake of dairy
      products in a dedicated log book. Subjects randomized to groups A and B will be asked to only
      use only dairy products with either the full fat or and low (≤1%) fat dairy (≤1% fat content)
      content respectively. Purchase of the dairy products will be the responsibility of study
      subjects for which a subsidy of $500 (about $20/week for 24 weeks) will be provided for each
      subject. All study participants will also be asked to record their food intake for 3 days
      before each study visit in a 3-day food log.
