      function test and questionnaire survey.100 cases of chronic primary tinnitus will be selected
      as the research object.This study will be developed in the form of a blind randomized
      clinical trial.The study subjects will be divided into 2 groups by randomized method, with 50
      cases in each group. Psychological acoustic test, Resting-state function magnetic resonance
      imaging（RS-fMRI) will be conducted.For 6 months, the patients will be treated with Cochleural
      Alternating Acoustic Beam Therapy（CAABT）and tinnitus masking therapy（TMT） respectively,
      followed by questionnaire survey, psychological acoustics test and RS-fMRI. The THI,VAS
      score, RS-fMRI ReHo value and low-frequency wave amplitude (ALFF) before and after the
      treatment will be compared. For those cases with poor results, the exchanged treatment will
      be performed for 6 months, followed by questionnaire survey, psychoacoustic test, RS-fMRI,
      and comparison of THI, VAS score, ReHo value and ALFF before and after treatment.All cases
      will be followed up for 1 year, and questionnaire survey will be conducted again.
