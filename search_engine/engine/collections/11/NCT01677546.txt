      insulin pump bolus calculator wirelessly connected with blood glucose meter, group B-
      subjects using insulin pump bolus calculator without wireless communication with blood
      glucose meter or group C- insulin pump, without bolus calculator function. We compared the
      glycated hemoglobin levels and post- prandial hypoglycaemia after 3 months of observation
      between the groups. We also assessed secondary endpoints (mentioned above).

      Patients were estimated at three time points: at the beginning, after 6 weeks and after 3
      months of intervention. Investigators performed computer reports at each visit, with
      Medtronic CareLink Pro software.
