      migraineurs as compared to age/gender-matched healthy controls. To demonstrate that frequency
      of the headache attacks and severity of cutaneous allodynia levels in migraineurs experienced
      over multiple attacks are correlated with levels of MOR BPND in specific brain regions. To
      investigate whether dysfunction of the pain regulatory endogenous opioid system of
      migraineurs is correlated with changes in the gray matter thickness in cortical areas
      associated with pain perception and modulation.
