      transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in non-remitters of a selective serotonin-reuptake
      inhibitor (SSRI) followed by an serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) trial with
      the capacity to identify gene variants that predict rTMS response. The study is similar in
      design to the STAR*D study in that it will be the third treatment stage for a study of
      subjects with major depressive disorder (MDD). rTMS is a novel intervention which was FDA
      approved for treatment of MDD in October 2008 and was not clinically available at the time of
      the STAR*D study.

      The primary aim of this pilot study is to provide 10 Hertz (Hz) repetitive transcranial
      magnetic stimulation (rTMS) applied to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (L-DLPFC) as
      adjuvant treatment for depression in individuals who have not had a remission of their
      depressive symptoms after an 8 week trial of an SSRI (citalopram or escitalopram) followed by
      an 8 week trial of an SNRI, duloxetine and identify gene variants associated with improvement
      of their depressive symptoms.
