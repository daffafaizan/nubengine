      best conditioning regimen for MDS and AML secondary to MDS undergoing allo-HSCT remains in
      discussion. Our previous study has showed that G-CSF+DAC+BUCY conditioning regimen could
      reduce the relapse and improve the survival compared with BUCY conditioning regimen, while
      the two conditioning regimens both have high non-relapse mortality (NRM). Several
      retrospective and prospective studies including ours have demonstrated that BF conditioning
      regimen has a lower NRM compared with BUCY conditioning regimen, while the relapse and
      survival are similar in patients undergoing BF and BUCY conditioning regimens. Based on the
      above, we design the prospective randomized controlled study to evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of G-CSF+DAC+BUCY and G-CSF+DAC+BF conditioning regimens in RAEB-1, REAB-2 and AML
      secondary to MDS undergoing allo-HSCT.
