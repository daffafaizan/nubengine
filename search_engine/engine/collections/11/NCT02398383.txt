      subjects with cystic fibrosis related diabetes along the spectrum of glucose tolerance. This
      will be a descriptive, cross-sectional and longitudinal cohort study in a sample of children
      and young adults with CF and a continuum of glucose tolerance compared to healthy age-matched
      controls.

      Cystic fibrosis patients with normal glucose tolerance as well as cystic fibrosis related
      diabetes as well as control subjects will be admitted to the research unit on three separate
      occasions to undergo an oral glucose tolerance test, mixed meal tolerance test, and one step
      hypoglycemic clamp. Cystic fibrosis patients will then return 12 months later to undergo
      repeat mixed meal tolerance test and hypoglycemic clamp test.
