      conducted at Grey's Hospital in Pietermaritzburg, South Africa. Ninety-six HIV-1-infected
      children were randomly assigned to receive 10 mg of elemental zinc as sulfate or placebo
      daily for 6 months. Baseline measurements of plasma HIV-1 viral load and the percentage of
      CD4+ T-lymphocytes were established at two study visits prior to randomization, and
      measurements were repeated 3, 6 and 9 months after starting supplementation. Plasma HIV-1
      viral load and the percentage of CD4+ T-lymphocytes were compared before and after
      supplementation.
