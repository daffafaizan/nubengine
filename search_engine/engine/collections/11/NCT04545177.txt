    
      This is a single site, interventional cohort study to assess the feasibility of the NICO
      Myriad and Tissue Preservation System (TPS) to collect and preserve biologically active
      tissue in 5 prospectively-enrolled participants with Glioblastoma (GBM) undergoing surgical
      resection.

      The primary objective of this study is to assess the viability of tumor tissue obtained by
      the NICO Myriad and Tissue Preservation System (TPS) via an automated, standardized
      methodology in participants undergoing surgery

      The exploratory objective of this study is to assess the spatial genomic and transcriptomic
      heterogeneity of GBM tumors in 3 locations via preoperative annotation and stereotactic
      guidance
