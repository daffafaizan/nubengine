      fluoride products. This study is to evaluate the effect of fluoride dentifrice containing
      1450 parts per million fluoride (ppm F) on enamel with artificial caries lesions in an in
      situ model. The study toothpaste containing sodium fluoride (NaF) and 0.4% carbopol will be
      compared to 4 other dentifrices. Comparator toothpastes include NaF toothpaste (1400 ppm F),
      NaF toothpaste (675 ppm F), sodium monofluorophosphate (NaMFP) and NaF toothpaste (1450 ppm
      F) and placebo toothpaste (0 ppm F).
