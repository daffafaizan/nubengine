    
      Patients with thyroid function abnormalities (hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism) are studied
      and treated in this protocol. Patients undergo routine history and physical examination,
      standard endocrine blood and urine tests, a standard TRH test, thyroid nuclear medicine
      scans, thyroidal radioiodine (RAI) or technetium (99mTc) uptake measurements, as well as
      X-ray, computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies or other standard
      diagnostic procedures, as clinically indicated.

      The goals of this study are:

        -  1. To understand the pathophysiology and various causes of thyroid function
           abnormalities (e.g., hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism).

        -  2. To longitudinally follow the effects of standard therapies for patients with abnormal
           thyroid functions.

        -  3. To create a repository of clinical data and biospecimens for future research of
           thyroid disorders.

      Our objective will be accomplished by obtaining clinical data and biospecimens during
      standard care procedures and tests performed on enrolled subjects being evaluated as an
      outpatient in the clinic or as an inpatient at the NIH Clinical Center.
