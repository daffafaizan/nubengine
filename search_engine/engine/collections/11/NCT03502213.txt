    
      This is a multicenter observational study that evaluates eligible patients who will submit
      prostate cancer diagnostic biopsy tissues for Oncotype DX Prostate Cancer Assay testing. A
      physician treatment recommendation will be made and the assay is ordered. The physician will
      review clinical data, the GPS report and discuss treatment options with the patient. At the
      following visit, a shared physician-patient treatment decision (immediate treatment or AS)
      will be made.

      Men selecting AS as primary treatment will be followed to assess persistence on AS.

      There is no required or standardized AS protocol for this study and the intensity of
      surveillance will be at the discretion of the investigator. Patients will not be required,
      but may undergo a standard TRUS guided surveillance biopsy at one year. In this study, the
      Oncotype DX Prostate Cancer Assay will be assessed on the diagnostic biopsy only and will not
      be assessed on subsequent biopsies.
