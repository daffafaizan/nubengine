      disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms (PTSD).

      It is currently unknown what type of interventions/ strategies to cope with postintensive
      care syndrome family would produce the best improvement. Experts suggest that symptoms in
      family members are potentially amenable to intervention by ICU staff. One intervention to
      reduce PTSD could be a liberalization of the visiting hours. However, restrictions on
      visiting hours in the intensive care unit (ICU) are usually adopted worldwide.
