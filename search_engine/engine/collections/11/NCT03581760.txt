      Resuscitation and Intensive Care (CARIM) of the University Hospital Ostrava.

      All mechanically ventilated patients are followed. At the time of weaning initiation, the
      randomization into two groups (the study (cycling) and control group) is performed. The
      physiotherapy will be carried out twice a day in both groups according to the mobility
      protocol. The cycling exercise is performed only in the study group, once a day. Before a
      patient is released from the ICU, a cycling test, dynamometry test will be performed on both
      groups.
