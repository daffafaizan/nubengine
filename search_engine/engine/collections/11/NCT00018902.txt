      adolescent depression. Adolescents ages 12 to 18, currently taking a prescribed selective
      serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) and still experiencing depression, participate in a
      12-week randomized treatment study that includes one of four conditions: (1) switching to an
      alternative SSRI, (2) switching to a different non-SSRI antidepressant, (3) switching to an
      alternative SSRI and receiving cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), or (4) switching to a
      different non-SSRI antidepressant and receiving CBT. This is a double-blind study, which
      means that neither the participant nor the clinical staff will know which of the three
      possible medications has been assigned. Participants who respond to the assigned treatment
      will receive 12 additional weeks of the same treatment. Those who do not appear to be getting
      better will be offered 12 weeks of an alternative, individualized treatment plan based on
      each participant's particular needs. All participants will receive follow-up psychiatric
      evaluations for 12 months after the 12-week continuation phase of the study, regardless of
      treatment adherence.
