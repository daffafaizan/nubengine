    
      Determine the overall response rate (ORR) defined as complete response (CR)rate plus partial
      response (PR) rate using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), as well as
      the stable disease (SD) rate in subjects with unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic
      cholangiocarcinoma or other biliary tract tumors treated with GM-CT-01 plus 5-Fluorouracil
      (DAVFU) at doses of 280 mg/m2 and 600 mg/m2, respectively, during cycles of 4 consecutive
      days of treatment followed by a 24-day follow-up period.
