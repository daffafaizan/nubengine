    
      This is an open-label, single-institution, randomized cross-over, fixed-schedule
      investigation of the effects of calcium carbonate on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of Tasigna® in
      healthy volunteers. Healthy volunteers will be recruited to participate in this study such
      that twelve subjects (6 men / 6 women) will complete the study at UPCI. Subjects will be
      compensated for participation.

      Half of the subjects will receive Tasigna® alone on Day 1 and Tasigna® and calcium carbonate
      on Day 15, and the other half will receive Tasigna® and calcium carbonate on Day 1 and
      Tasigna® alone on Day 15, determined by randomization of subjects receiving either the
      combination or Tasigna® alone during the first visit. Doses will be 400 mg Tasigna® (2 x 200
      mg tablets) and 4000 mg calcium carbonate (4 x Tums Ultra 1000® chewable tablets, equivalent
      to 4000 mg calcium carbonate or 1600 mg calcium).

      Multiple PK blood samples will be taken from Days 1-4 and Days 15-18. Tasigna® PK will be
      assessed after oral administration of 400 mg Tasigna® alone, and after oral administration of
      400 mg Tasigna® with concomitant administration of 4000 mg calcium carbonate. Two
      two-day/one-night inpatient stays and four brief outpatient visits are required to
      accommodate all study procedures.
