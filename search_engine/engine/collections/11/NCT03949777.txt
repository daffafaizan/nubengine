      will undergo a colonoscopy to the cecum with the Aer-O-Scope Colonoscope System. All
      pathologies found will be removed. No control group is necessary as the main objective is to
      reach the cecum. Either the cecum is intubated or it is not. This is true for all colonoscopy
      procedures.

      Up to the first ten (10) cases for each physician will be system operation training cases.

      The primary endpoint of cecal intubation was chosen as this measure is the first quality
      objective when evaluating colonoscopy quality indicators.
