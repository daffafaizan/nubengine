    
      This is a Phase IV, single center randomized controlled trial evaluating intra-vaginal
      culture (IVC) using INVOcell versus traditional In-Vitro Fertilization (IVF) using oral
      stimulation or minimal gonadotropin stimulation protocols. The pilot aims to includes 40
      women who will be randomized to either the intra-vaginal culture group (N=20) using INVOcell
      or to the traditional IVF group (N=20).

      Primary aim is implantation rate, which is defined by number gestational sacs seen on early
      pregnancy ultrasound divided by number of embryos transferred.

      Secondary aims are:

        -  Embryo quality, which is measured by the Gardner grading system.

        -  Fertilization rate, which is defined by the total number of fertilized oocytes divided
           by total number of mature oocytes retrieved. This comparison will take place on day-3,
           as that is when the IVC embryos will be assessed.

        -  Clinical pregnancy rate, which is defined by the number of fetal poles with heartbeat
           seen on ultrasound divided by the number of embryos transferred.

        -  Live birth rate, which is defined by the number of living babies delivered divided by
           the number of transfers
