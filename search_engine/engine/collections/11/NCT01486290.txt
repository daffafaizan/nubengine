      team to help overcome barriers to diabetes care in older adults will result in improved
      clinical, functional, and quality of life measures compared to usual care in a cost effective
      manner. In addition, we will assess whether the support network formed during intervention by
      the geriatric diabetes team will empower patients, resulting in long lasting improvement in
      parameters after intervention is completed.
