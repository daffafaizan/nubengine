    
      This is a prospective, non-randomized, comparative, single-arm, open label, multi-centre,
      post-marketing clinical investigation involving an expected 74 subjects (minimum 40, maximum
      118) suffering from paroxysmal AF. The clinical investigation will include a screening visit
      to determine subject eligibility, an inclusion visit where (additional) baseline
      characteristics will be collected and the subject will receive the investigational device
      (Cardioskin™) and comparator device (3-lead Holter recorder) (Visit 1), and 2 additional
      study visits. The subject will be wearing both the Cardioskin™ and 3-lead Holter recorder for
      a period of 24 hours, after which the subject will continue wearing the Cardioskin™ alone for
      an additional period of 13 days. The clinical investigation primarily aims to determine the
      accuracy of AF detection (≥30 seconds) of the Cardioskin™ wearable 15 lead ECG monitor as
      compared to a 3 lead Holter recorder in patients with known paroxysmal AF. Further objectives
      of the clinical investigation include detection of AF for the 13 additional days, detection
      of other arrhythmias and patient safety. A 3 lead Holter recorder was selected as the
      comparator device, because it is currently the gold standard for 24-hour home-based ECG
      monitoring.
