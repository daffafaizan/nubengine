      using an insulin pump and Dexcom CGM with minimum data requirements will initiate a run-in
      phase of 2-4 weeks that will be customized based on whether the participant is already a pump
      or CGM user. Participants who skip or successfully complete the run-in will be randomly
      assigned 3:1 to the use of closed-loop control (CLC group) using t:slim X2 with Control-IQ
      Technology vs. Control Group for 16 weeks. The Control Group will be offered to transition to
      use CLC and the experimental arm will extend their use of CLC for 12 weeks.
