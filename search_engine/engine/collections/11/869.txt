studies on hydroxyproline excretion and corticosteroid-induceddwarfism: treatment with human growth hormone.two children who had been receiving large dosesof corticosteroids for years and were growing at a retardedrate were treated with human growth hormone.growth rate increased 2.5 to 3-fold and urinary hydroxyprolineexcretion which was initially low increasedto the normal level.  when treatment was stopped, growthrate and hydroxyproline excretion decreased promptly.
