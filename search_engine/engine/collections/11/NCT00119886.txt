    
      Vulvar vestibulitis (VVS) is characterized by pain confined to the vulvar vestibule that
      occurs upon touch and attempted introitus entry ( e.g. intercourse, tampon insertion), with
      minimal associated clinical findings.

      The aetiology of VVS is not well established and many variables have been associated with the
      condition, e.g. neuropathy secondary to inflammation.

      Injection of Botulinum Toxin is tested as a therapeutic option for this condition.

      A temporary paralytic effect on the surrounding skeletal muscle hypertonicity is seen and
      earlier in cases described as a successful treatment of pelvic floor dysfunction, dyspareunia
      and interstitial cystitis.
