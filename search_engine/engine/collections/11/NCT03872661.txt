      unresectable stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), although surgery offers the chance
      of cure. With combined-modality therapy with radiation therapy and chemotherapy, the
      prognosis of stage III NSCLC remains poor. IBI308 (sintilimab) is a recombinant humanized
      anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody. This study is to studying neoadjuvant IBI308, bevacizumab,
      plus pemetrexed and carboplatin followed by surgery to see how well it works in treating
      patients with unresectable stage III non-small cell lung cancer.
