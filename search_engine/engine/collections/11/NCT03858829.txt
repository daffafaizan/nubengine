      Fear of activity after a cardiac event is associated with low levels of physical activity.
      This study aimed to develop and validate a scale to measure fear of activity in patients with
      coronary artery disease. A scale for Fear of ACTivity in patients with CAD (Fact-CAD) was
      created through semi-structured focus group interviews with patients. Face and content
      validity of Fact-CAD was verified. The scale was applied to 250 patients who had myocardial
      infarction, coronary artery bypass grafting or percutaneous coronary intervention within the
      last 12 months. Psychometric analysis included model fit, unidimensionality, reliability,
      local dependency, differential item functioning and external construct validity. Analyses
      were performed using the Rasch Analysis Model.
