        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose of flavopiridol and
           imatinib mesylate in patients with Bcr/Abl+ hematological malignancies.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the disease-related effects of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Correlate response to this regimen with mechanisms of imatinib mesylate resistance in
           patients previously treated with imatinib mesylate.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      percentage of blasts in the peripheral blood and bone marrow (less than 15% vs at least 15%)
      and recent myelosupressive treatment (no vs yes).

      Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate daily and flavopiridol IV over 1 hour on days 2, 9,
      and 16. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of imatinib mesylate and flavopiridol until
      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that
      at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 6-80 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.
