      Anderson-Fabry disease is an X-linked lysosomal storage disorder resulting from deficiency of
      the hydrolytic enzyme alfa galactosidase A. Trials of specific therapy by replacement of alfa
      galactosidase A were commenced in 1999 and subsequently two preparations of alfa
      galactosidase A received marketing approval by the EMEA in 2001. Clinical trials,
      observational studies and registry data have provided evidence for efficacy of enzyme
      replacement therapy (ERT) with alfa galactosidase A in improving symptoms of pain,
      gastrointestinal disturbance, hypohidrosis, left ventricular mass index, glomerular
      filtration rate and quality of life in men. There is currently no long-term data showing the
      impact of enzyme replacement therapy on overall survival. It has been suggested that earlier
      therapy, before the onset of end organ manifestations, would be more likely to prevent
      further damage and therefore have the biggest effect on overall survival. There is as yet
      little evidence to substantiate this hypothesis however clinical trials have recently
      demonstrated safety and therapeutic effects of enzyme replacement in children.

      So far, there are only limited data available on the clinical course of the disease and
      adverse events in patients, switching from one therapeutic alternative to the other. West and
      Lemoine (16) report clinical effects of a switch from Agalsidase beta to agalsidase alfa in 5
      patients with Fabry disease due to shortage of agalsidase beta. The patients were treated
      with ReplagalÂ® for 44 weeks at an average.
