        -  Determine the response rate in children with relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic
           leukemia or acute myelogenous leukemia treated with gemcitabine.

        -  Assess the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to disease histology
      (acute lymphoblastic leukemia vs acute myelogenous leukemia).

      Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 6 hours weekly for 3 weeks. Treatment repeats every 4
      weeks for a maximum of 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 10-20 patients will be accrued for this study.
