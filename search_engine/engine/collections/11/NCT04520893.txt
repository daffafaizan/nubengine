        1. All patients were ventilated by an anaesthesia ventilator (Zeus, Dräger, Lübeck,
           Germany) under general anesthesia.

        2. Ventilation strategy:

             -  Pressure controlled ventilation volume guaranteed (PCV-VG) mode or volume control
                ventilation (VCV) mode

             -  tidal volume 6-8 mL/kg (predicted body weight)

             -  Inspiratory/expiratory (I/E) ratio 1:1.5

             -  Inspired oxygen concentration (FIO2) 0.5 with air

             -  3.0 L/min of inspiratory fresh gas flow

             -  Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cm H2O

             -  Respiratory rate (RR) of 10 to 14 min-1

        3. After prone positioning and hemodynamic condition was stabilized, patients were
           ventilated with VCV, PCV-VG mode, VCV with pause following a randomized order,
           previously determined for each patient. Before each ventilator setting was started, lung
           recruitment maneuvers were performed to set the lungs to a defined baseline status.

             -  ventilation order : one of the following examples is taken by randomization.

      VCV 15 min -- VCV pause 15min -- PCV-VG 15min

      VCV 15 min -- PCV-VG 15min -- VCV pause 15min

      VCV pause 15min -- VCV 15 min -- PCV-VG 15min

      VCV pause 15min -- PCV-VG 15min -- VCV 15 min

      PCV-VG 15min -- VCV 15 min -- VCV pause 15min

      PCV-VG 15min -- VCV pause 15min -- VCV 15 min
