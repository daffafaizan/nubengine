    
      Sixty four female participants were under the following procedures:

        -  Screening for genu valgum via postural assessment from frontal view, then measuring the
           Q angle bilaterally.

        -  Patients with Q-angle >20 degress were under the following procedures:

      A. Full-Length AP standing X-ray,then the investigators measured the hip-knee angle (the
      angle between the mechanical axis of the femur and the tibia). It will be obtained by
      connecting the center of the femoral head to the midpoint of the tibial eminential spine in a
      line tangential to the femoral condyles, and another line from here to the centre of the
      trochlea tali.

      B-Lumbo-sacral X-ray lateral view was done at the time and the sacral angle was the measured
      by FergusonÂ´s technique in degrees using a protractor and this was the sacral angle.

      C- During the same session, trunk range of motion was measured by Modified schober test D-
      Collected data were taken for statistical analysis.
