    
      This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled crossover clinical trial
      conducted on subjects with painful peripheral diabetic neuropathy. Eligible subjects will
      include those between 22 and 80 years of age with Type 2 diabetes having persistent pain,
      numbness, tingling, and/or burning in at least one foot. Pain threshold, tolerance to thermal
      stimuli and pressure response to the induced pain stimuli will be measured at three time
      points using five standardized experimental pain measures: baseline, after a single 30 minute
      treatment with active PEMF or sham treatment and after a second 30 minute treatment with
      active PEMF or sham treatment. Eligible subjects with painful peripheral diabetic neuropathy
      will undergo Diabetic Screening (Nerve Conduction Velocity, Skin Perfusion Pressure,
      Ankle-Brachial Index, and Vibratory Testing) in the index foot prior to randomization.
      Following the Diabetic Screening tests, subjects will return to the research center for the
      Enrollment/Randomization Visit and complete measures of pain by completing the Brief Pain
      Inventory (BPI) and functional assessments. Subjects will then be randomly assigned to one of
      the two groups; control (sham) or experimental (active) device by a research assistant
      blinded to the device status. Patients will also be randomly assigned to the sequence order
      of experimental induced pain tests. The ischemic pain testing (SMET) will always be conducted
      last. Patients will return to the research center within 7 days after the
      Enrollment/Randomization Visit where they will be crossed over to the other treatment
      assignment and be randomly assigned to the sequence order of experimental induced pain tests
      on the same extremity as previously randomized.
