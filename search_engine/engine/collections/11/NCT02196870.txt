      patients, could improve hypoxemia, maintain lung volume and promote alveolar opening.
      However, because of barotrauma, volutrauma and biotrauma, MV could cause or aggravate acute
      lung injury not only in acute respiratory distress syndrome(ARDS) patients, but in patients
      with normal lung function1,2.

      Patients with chest wall elastance increasing could worsen lung function. Increasing of chest
      wall elastance plays a great role in lung mechanics, and could influence mechanical
      ventilation settings. Therefore, It could help the physicians to find appropriate indicators
      and optimize the treatments of ARF patients to explore the mechanisms of lung mechanics
      changse in the patients with high chest wall elastance.

      The present study is set out to examine the effects of high chest wall elastance on changes
      of lung mechanics and the correlation of airway pressure(Paw) stress index and transpulmonary
      pressure(PL) stress index.
