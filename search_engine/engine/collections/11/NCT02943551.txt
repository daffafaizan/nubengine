      antibiotic prescribing rates for all pediatric ARTIs and b) first-line antibiotic prescribing
      rates for bacterial ARTIs (acute otitis media, Group A Streptococcal pharyngitis, and
      sinusitis), 2) to test the DART program's effectiveness in changing providers' communication
      practices during ARTI visits, 3) to determine visit-specific satisfaction levels for parents
      of children seen by study providers and assess how satisfaction changes as a function of
      exposure to the DART program, and 4) to assess the cost of implementing the DART program and
      its impact on health care expenditures.

      To accomplish these aims, we propose a quasi-experimental study utilizing a stepped wedge
      design. In collaboration with two practice-based research networks: the electronic Pediatric
      Research in Office Settings (ePROS) network and the NorthShore Pediatric network, we will
      recruit 20 practices to participate. Over a 20 month period, the intervention will be
      sequentially deployed to 4 groups of practices (5 practices/group). Each practice will
      function as part of the control group until they receive the intervention. The DART program's
      effectiveness will be assessed by examining provider antibiotic prescribing rates for ARTIs
      (both overall and first-line), communication practices, and parent satisfaction both pre- and
      post-intervention exposure using survey and electronic health record data. If the DART
      program is effective for both reducing ARTI antibiotic prescribing to levels consistent with
      bacterial prevalence rates and increasing use of first-line antibiotics for bacterial ARTIs,
      we will have an innovative, highly disseminable QI intervention program to further address
      this critical public health problem.
