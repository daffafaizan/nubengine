      standard nasal CPAP. The patient population includes preterm newborns who require respiratory
      support but do not need to be initially intubated and preterm or term infants who are being
      extubated and will require support for the continued lung disease. After obtaining parental
      consent the patient will be randomized to one of the two treatments. Patients will be
      followed for requirement of level of oxygen and blood gases looking at acidity (pH) and PaCO2
      and Bicarbonate(HCO3). A respiratory index score will be measured. Attending physician will
      determine the need for the patient to be intubated or reintubated depending on the patient
      selected. Additionally, frequency, duration and severity of Apnea, Bradycardia and
      Desaturation events will be recorded. Also safety issues to include pulmonary airleak, nasal
      injury, facial edema and scalp edema due to straps holding the device in place will be
      recorded. Also gaseous distension of the stomach and intestines will be assessed and compared
      between treatment arms. This study is not powered to look at long term outcomes.
