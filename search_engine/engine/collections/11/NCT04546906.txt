      CD137（4-1BB） molecule, and the intracellular component of the human CD3ζ molecule. Prior to
      CAR-T cell infusion, the patients will be subjected to preconditioning treatment. After CAR-T
      cell infusion, the patients will be evaluated for adverse reactions and efficacy.

      The Main research objectives:

      To evaluate the safety and efficacy of CD22CAR-T in patients with recurrent or refractory
      B-ALL

      The Secondary research objectives:

      To investigate the cytokinetic characteristics of CD22CAR-T in patients with recurrent or
      refractory B-ALL
