      fraction. This study is a preliminary study which aims to evaluate diaphragm function after a
      stroke and its evaluation within the first months.

      Starting hypothesis is the following: after a stroke, patients with a unilateral motor
      dysfunction have a diaphragm dysfunction predominant on the same side as the motor
      dysfunction. After a few months, retrieval is insufficient and they could benefit from a
      specific reinforcement program.
