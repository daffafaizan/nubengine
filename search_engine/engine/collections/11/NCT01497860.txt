      has variable efficacy at slowing or reversing growth, and exploration continues into finding
      better-tolerated, more effective treatments.

      Vinorelbine has recently generated interest in stabilizing some pediatric low-grade gliomas.
      It has been fairly well tolerated in both adult and pediatric studies that have examined its
      use in other tumors.

      Objective: To test the efficacy of Vinorelbine in children with pediatric low-grade glioma
      that has returned or continues to grow.

      In this trial, Vinorelbine will be given intravenously once a week for 6 weeks followed by a
      2 week rest (6 of every 8 weeks) for one year. The patients will then be followed for 60
      months. Progression free survival is the primary outcome and defined as the none of the
      following: greater a 20% increase in the sun of the longest diameter of the target lesion, or
      a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions.
