      (MOs) are healthcare visits during which a patient is eligible, but does not receive a
      vaccine. MOs for vaccination contribute strongly to low HPV vaccination rates. This trial
      focuses on period 2, the addition of performance feedback in the presence of communication
      skills training. Arm-1 intervention study practices add performance feedback (period 2),
      building upon their prior training in communication skills (period 1); Arm-2 comparison study
      practices continue delivering standard of care. During this period, the investigators will be
      measuring captured opportunities - the inverse of MOs, or visits when an eligible patient
      receives a vaccine. Providers rarely receive feedback to track their captured opportunities,
      but feedback has been shown to be an effective tool. Performance feedback reports will pull
      from electronic health record (EHR) data, and will compare participants performance to their
      own previous performance and those of others. Throughout the intervention participants will
      also receive weekly text message mini-lessons that will remind participants of the project.
