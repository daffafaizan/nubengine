      and first-line chemotherapy followed by maintenance with icotinib.

      Primary endpoint:

      Progression-free survival between first-line icotinib treatment and first-line chemotherapy
      followed by maintenance with icotinib

      Secondary endpoint:

        1. Overall survival between icotinib and chemotherapy

        2. Time to Progression between icotinib and chemotherapy

        3. Objective response rate and disease control rate between icotinib and chemotherapy
