      infection is common among U.S. military veterans receiving care in the Veterans
      Administration healthcare system. The investigators propose a retrospective cohort study
      using VA administrative databases. A cohort of approximately 147,000 HCV-infected veterans
      has been identified for the period 1997-2004. Likewise, a cohort of approximately 573,000
      HCV-uninfected veterans has been identified for the same period. These subjects are being
      evaluated for the diagnosis of hematologic malignancies, thyroid cancer, and related medical
      conditions as recorded in VA databases. The comparison of the prevalence and incidence of
      these cancers in the two cohorts will provide a test of the hypothesis that HCV infection can
      cause these cancers.

      The investigators will also evaluate the association between HCV infection and several other
      medical conditions, which might be related to HCV infection, specifically: immune
      thrombocytopenic purpura, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, cholangiocarcinoma, cholangitis, and
      pancreatic cancer.
