      found in the cannabis (marijuana) plant, known as cannabinoids, and that these regions may be
      involved in anxiety disorders and OCD. More recent data shows that synthetic drugs that
      target these systems may be helpful in conditions related to OCD like anxiety disorders and
      Tourette's syndrome. Thus, these substances could also possibly be useful to treat OCD
      symptoms. However, to date there has been little research regarding the role of cannabinoids
      in OCD.

      The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of different cannabinoids on OCD symptoms
      in humans. To accomplish this in a laboratory setting, patients with OCD who are also
      occasional cannabis users will receive different combinations of two of the most well-studied
      cannabinoids, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC, the main psychoactive component in cannabis)
      and cannabidiol (CBD, another component of the cannabis plant). We will then measure acute
      effects on OCD symptoms, anxiety, intoxication, and cardiovascular outcomes (i.e. blood
      pressure and heart rate).
