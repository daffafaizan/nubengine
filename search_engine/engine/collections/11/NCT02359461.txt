    
      Patients will be screened during a visit V0. A collection of consent (informed consent form),
      clinical examination and a fasting blood test will be carried out during this visit.
      Laboratory tests run-in will be composed of: Cell Blood Count (CBC) platelets, renal function
      tests (serum electrolytes, urea and creatinine), liver function tests, fasting blood glucose
      levels and Lipid Profile). Measurement of blood Pressure (2 successive measurements at
      intervals of 5 min) and an electrocardiogram will be realized. The different information
      collected at enrollment will allow stratification of cardiovascular risk by reference
      integrators scores (ESC-SCORE (European Society of Cardiology Score) and Framingham Heart
      Study).

      The feasibility of measures for study criteria (functional measurements and assays) will be
      tested fasting during this visit as the blood test.
