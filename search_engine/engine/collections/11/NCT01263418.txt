    
      This multicenter Phase II clinical study will investigate the overall response rate (ORR)
      after 2 months of therapy with weekly ofatumumab in older (â‰¥70 years of age) patients with
      previously untreated low or intermediate risk indolent NHL (n=37). Secondary objectives
      include progression free survival (PFS) at 2 years, and an evaluation of the toxicity and
      tolerability of ofatumumab in this population.

      We will also evaluate molecular response to ofatumumab by performing PCR analysis for
      BCL2/IgH from the peripheral blood.

      We will conduct an exploratory analysis of the minimum observed serum concentration (Cmin) of
      ofatumumab prior to the last dose and correlate this level with ORR.

      This trial includes administration of a Geriatric Assessment (GA) tool which patients will be
      asked to complete serially during the trial.
