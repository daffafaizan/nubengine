        -  Determine whether longitudinal and circumferential resection margins and lymphatic
           clearances obtained during laparoscopic surgery are different from those obtained with
           conventional open surgery in patients with colorectal cancer.

        -  Compare the patterns of loco-regional or distant metastatic spread after these two
           surgical methods in these patients.

        -  Compare the morbidity and mortality rates in these patients after these two surgical
           methods, particularly in terms of the technical or thromboembolic complications that may
           develop as a consequence of prolonged pneumoperitoneum.

        -  Compare the disease-free or overall survival of these patients after these two operative
           procedures.

        -  Determine, in those patients in whom laparoscopic surgery fails, which investigatory
           modalities are appropriate for providing pre-operative indications that a patient is an
           inappropriate candidate for laparoscopic dissection.

        -  Compare the differences in quality of life between the two operative procedures,
           particularly in patients with advanced disease.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study.

      Patients undergo laparoscopic surgery or conventional open surgery.

      Patients are followed at 1 and 3 months following surgery, then every 3 months for the first
      year, every 4 months for the second year, and then every 6 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 1,200 patients will be accrued for this study within 5
      years.
