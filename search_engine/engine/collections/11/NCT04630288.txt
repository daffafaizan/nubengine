      outcomes of new antiplatelet agents, namely Ticagrelor and Prasugrel, compared to Clopidogrel
      in a real-world ACS setting.

      The ARIAM-Andalusia multicentre Registry, and the CREA-ARIAM multicentre Registry
      (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02500290; Fundación Pública Andaluza Progreso y
      SaludIdentifier: FPS-AAS-2014-01), are two Real World Evidence (RWE) studies aimed to
      investigate real-world practice on antiplatelet treatment in patients with ACS in Andalusia
      (Western Spain).

      Our group are interested in performing a retrospective observational pilot analysis using
      data from patients with ACS admitted to cardiovascular intensive care units in Andalusia
      (Spain), who were prospectively included in the ARIAM-Andalusia multicentre Registry, and the
      CREA-ARIAM multicentre Registry (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02500290; Fundación
      Pública Andaluza Progreso y Salud-Identifier: FPS-AAS-2014-01) between 2014 and March 2019.
      The main findings from the RWE study revealed a consistent net clinical benefit of Ticagrelor
      vs Clopidogrel resulted in a significant reduction of short-term all-cause mortality favored
      Ticagrelor. In this scenario, after baseline imbalance adjustment using propensity score
      matching (PSM) and IPTW (inverse probability of treatment weight) methods, the net clinical
      benefit with Ticagrelor persisted. Preliminary results of the above mentioned study have been
      presented as an oral communication at the Annual Scientific Meeting of the Spanish Society of
      Cardiology (Madrid, October 2017).

      The aim of this new pilot study suggested is to describe the efficacy and safety of
      Ticagrelor vs Clopidogrel after the first 30 days from hospital discharge and up to 1 year
      follow-up.
