      (AD-Y) have (i) less severe white matter involvement; (ii) effective reorganization of the
      functional brain networks; iii) pathologically, a different topography and lesion load.

      This project has no redundancy with the work already done in our team and in other teams at
      the international level.

      Expected benefits This study will highlight the neural mechanisms underlying resiliency in a
      group of AD patients who, although having the same disease, present with a very different
      clinical and cognitive profile. Demonstration of these specific mechanisms of resilience in
      the diseased brain is essential to better understand the pathophysiological processes of AD.
      We consider that the pharmacological approach and the functional reeducation to this disease
      depend essentially on a better knowledge of both the topographic distribution of the
      underlying histopathology (in particular, the tau protein), and the response capacity from
      the brain to these lesions (state of connection of networks, functional reorganization). In
      addition, when treatments for AD are available, a precise definition of phenotypic variants
      will be essential for the selection of patients for these therapies and for therapeutic
      follow-up. In the longer term, resilient neural circuits could be modulated and strengthened
      through transcranial stimulation. Indeed, promising results have been obtained showing that
      these techniques can improve the performance of altered cognitive functions in patients with
      dementia.
