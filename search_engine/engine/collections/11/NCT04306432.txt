      control and prolonged progression-free survival in patients with a broad range of tumour
      types. Irradiation to the normal brain may lead to cognitive impairments. Clarifying the
      nature and severity of impairment in adult RT-treated brain tumour patients, including
      region-specific effects, are important for optimal utilization of novel conformal RT
      technologies such as proton therapy.

      The study is a prospective nationwide study including approximately 300 brain tumour patients
      from the Danish Center of Particle Therapy and the four Neuro Oncology Centers in Denmark.

      The patients will be assessed with a comprehensive battery of standardized cognitive tests
      and complete a questionnaire (PRO's). They will do this prior to RT treatment and 1, 3, 5 and
      10 years afterwards. The PRO's includes measures on quality of life, fatigue, sleep,
      depression, anxiety, and socio demographics. The standardized tests are: Trail making Test
      (TMT); Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (HVLT); Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWAT) -
      Animals and S; Coding and Digit Span from WAIS-IV. The correlation between cognitive scores
      and RT dose-volume parameters to specific areas in the brain will be tested.

      This study will elucidate the dose-response relationship in radiation-induced damage to
      substructures of the brain such as hippocampus, thalamus, temporal and frontal lobes that
      will allow the clinician to prioritize these structures in planning of proton radiotherapy.
