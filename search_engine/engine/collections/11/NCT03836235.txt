      Injury in a large appropriately powered study. Aim 1 will provide data that will help narrow
      inclusion of candidate variables in the STOP Injury tool to include those that are most
      feasible to collect and most predictive. Aim 2 will help inform the possible inclusion of
      genetic factors into a predictive model. Finally, Aim 3 will help identify quality of life
      outcomes that should be considered when assessing opioid medication adverse events.

      Aim 1. Evaluate the association between prescription opioid adverse events in older adults
      and candidate risk prediction variables proposed for STOP Injury prediction score The study
      team will conduct a pilot prospective observational study of 200 patients 50 years or older
      who are initiated on opioids from the emergency department (ED). The investigators will
      analyze the association between candidate risk factors and opioid adverse events (falls and
      OD).

      Aim 2. Evaluate the association between prescription opioid adverse events and genetic
      factors.

      In the cohort from Aim 1, the study team will test subjects for 12 genetic single nucleotide
      polymorphisms related to opioid metabolism, transport, and effect.

      Aim 3. Measure the impact of opioid medications on quality of life measures in older adults
      The investigators will implement a series of quality of life measures on a subset of patients
      as a pilot study to determine which measures capture the impact prescription opioids have on
      older adults' quality of life
