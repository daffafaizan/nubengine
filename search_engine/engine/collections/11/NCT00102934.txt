      drug-resistant HIV may emerge; however, it has been observed that HIV viral loads while on
      HAART are usually lower than baseline levels. Expansion of the T cell population during early
      HAART may explain this phenomenon. It is hoped that a short but aggressive HAART regimen to
      treatment-experienced patients who have drug-resistant virus will produce immune cells that
      will better control drug-resistant virus. This study will determine if a 6-month HAART
      regimen intensified by enfuvirtide (T-20) is effective in eliciting a stronger immune
      response against drug-resistant virus.

      This study will last 48 weeks. All participants will receive T-20 as part of a HAART
      intensification regimen; HAART other than T-20 will not be provided by the study. There will
      be 17 study visits. Prior to beginning treatment intensification, participants will have
      weekly study visits for three weeks. Once treatment intensification has started, participants
      will be followed weekly for four weeks, then weekly for four weeks after treatment
      intensification, then monthly thereafter. Blood collection will occur at each visit.
