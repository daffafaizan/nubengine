      exercising, and using of biomechanical footwear device on clinically important symptoms,
      physical function and quality of life in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee. The
      hypothesis is that the groups of using knee brace and biomechanical footwear can alleviate
      pain, improve physical function and quality of life more efficiently, than the group doing
      home exercises only.

      The subjects (n = 120) will be randomized into three groups mentioned above, after which they
      will start to do exercises, or to use a knee brace and do exercises, or to use biomechanical
      footwear at home according to the instructions for 4 months. Physical function, symptoms and
      quality of life will be measured before and after 4-month intervention. In addition, at
      12-month time point follow-up surveys will be addressed with regard to symptoms and quality
      of life, as well as to cost-effectiveness of the study.
