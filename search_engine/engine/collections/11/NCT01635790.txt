    
      Objective: To compare the effectiveness and costs of 1.25 mg of bevacizumab to 0.5 mg
      ranibizumab, given as monthly intravitreal injections during 6 months. It is hypothesized
      that bevacizumab is non-inferior to ranibizumab regarding its effectiveness.

      Study design: This will be a randomized, controlled, double masked, clinical trial in 246
      patients in seven academic trial centres in The Netherlands.

      Study population: patients 18 years of age or higher with diabetic macular and a best
      corrected visual acuity BCVA score between 78 and 20 letters in the study eye.

      Outcomes: The primary outcome measure will be the change in best-corrected visual acuity
      (BCVA) in the study eye from Baseline to Month 6.

      Secondary outcomes will be amongst others the proportion of patients with a gain of 15
      letters or more and/or a BCVA of 20/40 or more at 6 months, and the costs and costs per
      quality adjusted life-year of the two treatments.
