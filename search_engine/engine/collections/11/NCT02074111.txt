           more prevalent in Asians than in Westerners, although the reason for the race-ethnic
           differences is unsettled. It is possible that patients with adult-onset MMD were
           misclassified as having ICAS, which may in part explain the high prevalence of
           intracranial atherosclerosis in Asians. It is important to differentiation between these
           two diseases because MMD and ICAS have differential therapeutic strategies (surgical
           revascularization in MMD vs. the use of antithrombotics/statins and stenting in ICAS).
           The ring finger 213 (RNF213) was recently identified as a susceptibility gene for MMD in
           East Asians. Characteristic high-resolution (HR) MRI findings of MMD and ICAS have
           recently been reported. The aim of this study is to investigate the proportion of
           patients with moyamoya disease among the patients who were diagnosed as having
           intracranial atherosclerotic stroke. To do this, biomarkers (gene and imaging) for
           moyamoya disease are tested and follow up angiography are performed during follow up (in
           selected patients).
