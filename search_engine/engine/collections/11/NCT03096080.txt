    
      This study is a phase 1 clinical trial focused on evaluating safety and tolerability of the
      Tesevatinib study drug, which is an oral solution at a 15mg/mL concentration.

      To determine safety of the tesevatinib liquid formulation in pediatric subjects (age 5-12)
      with ARPKD, all participants receive active study drug on Day 1 of the study enrollment. To
      evaluate plasma pharmacokinetics (PK) of the single dose of tesevatinib in the ARPKD
      pediatric subjects, the blood for PK sampling is drawn on Day 1, 2, and 3 of the study.
      Tesevatinib dosing will be followed by a PK and a 2-week safety evaluation. After the
      completion of the safety review subjects may continue onto the next dosing group at the
      discretion of the investigator and the medical monitor.

      There are three dosing arms in this study. Six participants will enroll into first dosing
      cohort (0.25mg/kg). Participants may be enrolled in two subsequent cohorts with increased
      dose (0.5mg/kg and 1.0mg/kg), if safety reporting is favorable.

      Medical history will be taken at Screening Visit. Echocardiogram will be performed at
      Screening and Day 14. Subjects will undergo audiology testing, as well as ocular monitoring
      at Screening and Day 14. Blood will be drawn for a panel of laboratory tests.
