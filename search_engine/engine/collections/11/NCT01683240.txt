      (ERCP), used for special issues. In the context of ERCP, a long,thin shaped device is
      introduced through the working channel of a duodenoscope and then through the papilla into
      the biliary duct.

      Inspection of the biliary duct can be used for tumor biopsies as well as for gall stone
      lithotripsy by laser or electrohydraulic technique.

      Manoeuverability of cholangioscopes is limited by the length of the scope, even more, since
      most of the device body is stuck in the working channel.

      The newly designed cholangioscope by the company of Karl Storz GmbH is introduced through a
      shortened working channel. Introduction of the cholangioscope is done by an innovative side
      port for the cholangioscope at 70 cm from the insertion tube's distal end. This leads to a
      better flexibility of the device tip. Better manoeuverability of the device tip will lead to
      both a better accuracy in taking biopsies as well as a better flexibility in lithotripsy
      manoeuvres.

      This study is designed to test the efficiency of the device in relation to this assumption.
