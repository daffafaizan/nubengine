      either a control or intervention group. All clinics have both control and intervention
      patients. In the clinic intervention, we help doctors monitor patient information about the
      risk factors of heart disease and stroke. In the patient intervention, we contact patients by
      phone to discuss these risk factors before their doctor visits.
