      1. Patients in each cohort receive either (+)-calanolide A or a placebo for 14 days, followed
      by a 14-day follow-up period. Following study treatment, patients may elect to receive an
      open-label, 6-month course of anti-HIV drugs to be selected by and administered under the
      care of the patient's physician.
