      trial evaluating a single intranasal dose of either 10^7 colony forming units (CFU) or 10^9
      CFU of BPZE1 in healthy adults. The study will evaluate a lyophilized formulation of the
      product, with the goal of testing for the optimal dose for subsequent clinical trials. Fifty
      healthy adults, 18-49 years of age will be randomized to one of the four following treatment
      groups in a 3:3:3:1 ratio: 10^7 CFU of BPZE1 administered by VaxINator device, 10^9 CFU of
      BPZE1 administered by VaxINator device, placebo administered by VaxINator device, 10^9 CFU of
      BPZE1 administered by needleless tuberculin syringe. Study duration will be approximately 12
      months with a subject participation duration of approximately 6 months. The primary objective
      of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of a single intranasal dose of either
      10^7 or 10^9 CFU of lyophilized BPZE1 vaccine. The secondary objectives of this study are: 1)
      to assess the humoral immunogenicity of lyophilized BPZE1 vaccine at Day 15, Day 29 and Day
      181 following receipt of one intranasal dose of 10^7 or 10^9 CFU of BPZE1; 2) to assess
      mucosal immunogenicity of lyophilized BPZE1 vaccine at Day 29 and Day 181 following receipt
      of one intranasal dose of 10^7 or 10^9 CFU of BPZE1; 3) to evaluate nasal clearance of BPZE1
      by culture at Day 29 (and if still positive, at Day 46) following receipt of one intranasal
      dose of lyophilized BPZE1 vaccine of 10^7 or 10^9 CFU of BPZE1.
