    
      Observational study. Healthy normal volunteers will come into the clinic and have a bruise
      induced. The bruised area will be photographed each day through Day 11. Images will be
      provided to the Validator Team to rate on a 0-5 scale of severity.

      The actual numbers of volunteers will be adjusted to ensure there are at least 15 images for
      each Grade.

      The clinical site will be provided photography equipment, and study staff will be trained on
      photography technique to standardize the image quality and resolution across the study.

      The Validator Team will review the images and categorize them in to Grades 0-5.
