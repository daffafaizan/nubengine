    
      Prospective randomized controlled trial. Assessing the influence of warmed parenteral fluids
      during delivery/cesarean section on the obstetrical and neonatal outcome. The investigators
      will randomize parturients during the active phase of labor to receive either body
      temperature warmed parenteral fluids or room temperature parenteral fluids. Both groups will
      receive the same fluid composition of 5% dextrose with normal saline. The investigators will
      compare the obstetrical and neonatal outcomes of the two groups.
