      questionable, regarding the risk-benefit assessment and the lack of evidence for this
      practice. One of the main justifications for premedication with benzodiazepines is its
      anxiolytic effect. Anxiety is associated with postoperative cognitive and behavioural
      changes, physiological reactions, increased need of anaesthetic drugs and altered perception
      of pain, mood swings, wound-healing problems and alteration of the immune system. However,
      several investigations revealed negative side-effects like dose-dependent sedation up to
      respiratory depression, prolonged extubation-time, impaired psychomotor function, paradox
      reactions, antegrade amnesia, increased pneumonia rates and postoperative delirium.

      In Germany midazolam is the most frequently administered premedication. A survey revealed
      that about one third of the German hospitals withhold a premedication in patients older than
      74 years.

      The evidence for this practice, as well as the indiscriminate preoperative premedication for
      all adult patients is low.

      The investigators aim to recruit as many as possible centers throughout Germany, to
      participate in this study. A total sample size of 4000 patients will provide reasonable and
      valid results for the study aims. The influence of premedication on the primary endpoint
      change of APAIS-score will be analysed by a multivariable analysis of covariance considering
      several baseline characteristics. In case of significant interaction terms, subgroup analysis
      will be performed.
