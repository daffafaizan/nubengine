      assessment of future violence occurring research on this concept is sparse. Research instead
      tends to focus specifically on insight into violence specifically in relation to
      schizophrenia rather than more broadly in forensic and other clinical settings. What evidence
      there is suggests that developing an individual's insight or awareness of their own risk of
      violence is a key factor in reducing the likelihood of them engaging in further acts of
      violence. Being able to appropriately assess this is key and appears to currently be
      inconsistent between professionals.

      In this study, therefore, a questionnaire will be disseminated to professionals working in
      secure care or a forensic community setting in order to gather their views on what factors
      contribute to an individual's insight or awareness into their own violent behaviours.

      All clinicians/professionals who are currently employed and qualified as an Offender Manager,
      Offender Supervisor, Psychologist, Nurse, Social Worker, Occupational Therapist,
      Psychiatrist, Prison Officer currently working in a secure care or forensic community setting
      will be eligible to participate. Individuals with the appropriate qualifications working
      within private practice in the UK will also be eligible to participate. Those working outside
      the UK will not be eligible to participate.
