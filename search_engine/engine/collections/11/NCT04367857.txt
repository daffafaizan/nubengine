      global challenge in diagnosing infection. Diagnosing infection, defining recovery and
      immunity has been challenging. Health care providers in particular are very interested in
      knowing their status as they are highly exposed, and if infectious, can potentially transmit
      infection nosocomially (in the healthcare workplace setting) and to their household. In
      addition to understanding their exposure risk, infectious period, and immunity status, health
      care workers are reporting high levels of psychosocial distress including anxiety and
      burnout. The investigators aim to assess the baseline and cumulative seroprevalence of
      SARS-CoV-2 among health care workers using both quantitative and qualitative serological
      assays; describe psychosocial well-being and coping strategies among health workers in their
      institutional settings and describe how knowledge of one's serostatus affect psychosocial
      well-being, and coping strategies. Findings from this study will inform; 1) use of
      serological assays and testing algorithms, and 2) approaches to manage psychosocial stress
      for healthcare workers.
