      changes. Both the physical and psychosocial consequences of spinal cord injury may negatively
      impact one's ability to accomplish activities of daily living, fully participate in
      occupations, and fulfill social roles. People with SCI are at a greater risk for major health
      conditions such as heart disease, high blood pressure, obesity, and diabetes than the
      population without disabilities. Approximately 30% of individuals with SCI are also at risk
      for developing negative mood states that include depression, anxiety, and anger. These
      negative mood states can also increase the risk of poor health outcomes, including increased
      medical complications, decreased independence in self-care, and decreased productivity.
      People with SCI also often require a great deal of supports and services to live
      independently within the community, such as a personal care attendant to assist with
      activities of daily living, access to accessible transportation, access to medical care, and
      access to repair services for their mobility device. Many of these supports and services are
      difficult to obtain in the community, medical institutions, and businesses when everything is
      operating in a regular capacity. With the changes in daily operations related to the COVID-19
      pandemic there are many concerns about whether vulnerable populations like persons with SCI
      will be able to access the supports and services they need, this project will give the
      investigators information about what the needs are and whether they are being met.
