      and anxiety symptoms in patients with mood disorder. However, none study so far focused on
      the elderly population to investigate the anti-depressant and anxiolytic effect in elderly
      patient with anxiety disorder. Hence, this pilot study aims to assess the safety and efficacy
      of CES on anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, sleep quality and life quality in elderly
      patient with anxiety disorder. The study was an open-label, one arm study. The study aimed to
      investigate whether cranial electrotherapy stimulation(CES) could benefit anxiety symptoms,
      depressive symptoms, quality of sleep and quality of life in elderly patients with anxiety
      disorder.
