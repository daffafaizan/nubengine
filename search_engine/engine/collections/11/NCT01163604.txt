      therefore, in the past, aspirin and clopidogrel were performed as anticoagulant therapy post
      stenting.But this treatment had limited effectiveness upon restenosis. Argatroban is a
      selective thrombin inhibitor, and previous study had suggested that argatroban use post PCI
      could potentially prevent reocclusion. But there has no study on large sample of argatroban
      treated restenosis post cranial stenting. This study will test the safety and efficacy of the
      argatroban on prevent occlusion and restenosis in patients with intracranial and extracranial
      artery stenting.
