      invasive cervical cancer in Canada. While regular Pap screening can give up to 90% protection
      against cervical cancer, about 30% of Canadian women do not participate in regular screening.

      Pap screening in Ontario is opportunistic. There are women who have family doctors and
      regularly present for other medical issues at their physician's office but forego Pap smear
      testing.

      Numerous studies have shown that women are able to self collect vaginal samples, and that
      these samples can be tested for the presence of oncogenic human papillomavirus. A recent
      meta-analysis showed that HPV testing through physician collected samples had a sensitivity
      of 80%-90% for detection of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2 or worse, and a
      specificity of 86%-95%. In comparison, a meta-analysis of self collected vaginal samples
      tested for HPV showed a sensitivity of 74% and a specificity of 88%.

      Studies have reported that women find self collection acceptable. However, we have found that
      many women are more comfortable if a health care professional is available to help if needed,
      and so this option should be provided for self-testing.

      We are proposing a randomized controlled trial to see whether (a) the offer of a vaginal self
      collection kit together with a second reminder for Pap testing will increase cervical
      screening participation amongst "never-screened" and "hard to reach" women, as compared to
      (b) a second reminder letter alone.
