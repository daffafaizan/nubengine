      ATCC PTA 6475 (10E10 colony-forming units (CFU)) was able to reduce bone loss over 12 months
      in 76-year-old women compared to placebo.

      It is not known if the probiotic is effective over longer time periods or if the effect is
      dose-dependent. The aim of this study is to investigate if two different doses of
      Lactobacillus reuteri ATCC PTA 6475 (total daily dose of either 1x10E9 or 1x10E10 CFU/day)
      can prevent or reduce bone loss, compared to placebo, in early (1-4 years since last menses)
      postmenopausal women over 24 months. All women will receive 400 IU of vitamin D
      (cholecalciferol) per day. Changes in bone mineral density, bone geometry and microstructure
      will be measured using dual x-ray absorptiometry and high resolution peripheral computed
      tomography.
