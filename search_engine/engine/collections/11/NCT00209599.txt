    
      This is a randomized, open-label study designed to assess the safety and efficacy of AQUAVAN
      ® Injection versus midazolam HCl following pretreatment with an analgesic, fentanyl citrate
      injection, in producing sedation in elderly patients undergoing colonoscopy.

      Following completion of preprocedure sedation assessments, patients will be randomly assigned
      to 1 of the 2 i.v. treatment groups at a 4:1 (AQUAVAN®. Injection: midazolam HCl) allocation
      ratio. To ensure that a distribution of ages is obtained, enrollment will be stratified into
      2 equal-size groups by age (>65 to <72 years of age and >72 years of age). Randomization will
      be stratified by site within each age group. All patients will receive fentanyl citrate
      injection as an analgesic pretreatment. Supplemental doses of fentanyl citrate injection may
      be administered if the patient reports pain or if inadequate analgesia is present as
      demonstrated by increased heart rate and/or blood pressure in the presence of adequate
      sedation.

      At no time should fentanyl citrate injection be administered to increase sedation levels.

      AQUAVAN®. Injection and midazolam HCl will be administered to induce a state of adequate
      sedation, defined as a Modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (OAA/S) score of
      4 or less. Supplemental doses will be administered to increase depth or duration of sedation.
      Supplemental doses will not be administered if the Modified OAA/S score is 2 or less or if
      there is no purposeful response to stimulation. The depth of sedation will be measured by the
      Modified OAA/S scale, a validated measure. Patient and Investigator assessments will be used
      to confirm the depth of sedation provided met the goals of sedation, reduction of anxiety and
      reduced awareness.
