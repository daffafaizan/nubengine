      lumbar interbody fusion (MIS TLIF). It has been found that up to 40% of lumbar spinal
      patients will have either recurrent or persistent postoperative pain. Several studies have
      demonstrated reduced patient reported pain scores following steroid administration. However,
      few studies have investigated intraoperative local injection of corticosteroid at the
      surgical site in an effort to reduce the incidence and duration of postoperative pain for MIS
      TLIF patients.

      The purpose of this study is to determine if the incidence and duration of postoperative pain
      is improved in participants receiving a local injection of methylprednisolone with systemic
      dexamethasone when compared to those receiving the usual systemic dexamethasone undergoing
      MIS TLIF.

      The investigators hypothesize that participants undergoing MIS TLIF who receive local
      methylprednisolone along with the systemic dexamethasone will have:

        1. Reduced incidence and duration of postoperative pain compared to participants receiving
           only systemic dexamethasone.

        2. Shorter hospital stay compared to participants receiving only systemic dexamethasone.

        3. Better short- and long-term outcomes compared to participants receiving only systemic
           dexamethasone
