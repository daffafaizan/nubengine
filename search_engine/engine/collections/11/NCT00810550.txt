      common cause of left ventricular systolic dysfunction (weakening of the heart muscle). The
      standard test to find coronary artery disease is coronary angiography. This test is highly
      accurate but is invasive and carries a small risk of complications. This study investigates
      ultrasound of the carotid (neck) arteries as a screening test for severe coronary artery
      disease as a cause of left ventricular systolic dysfunction. It is hypothesized that carotid
      ultrasound will have excellent negative predictive value for severe CAD.
