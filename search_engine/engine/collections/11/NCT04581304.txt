      a result of tooth extraction and the following bone remodeling process, and maxillary sinus
      pneumatization. Lack of alveolar bone volume may compromise dental implant installation.
      Maxillary sinus augmentation is considered a very predictable solution for implant
      installation in limited amount of bone in the posterior maxilla. In general, there are two
      main maxillary sinus augmentation methods: the lateral approach and the transcrestal. In both
      methods, the idea is to expend the alveolar ridge in vertical direction on the expense of the
      maxillary sinus. Sinus augmentation using the transcrestal approach is a well known procedure
      which is being use for over 40 years. As time goes by, implant dentistry is evolving and
      improving, there is a constant progress in this field including new bone substitutes
      materials.

      Geistlich Bio-OssÂ® Collagen - can improve the results obtained by sinus augmentation using
      the transcrestal approach, by better ease of use for the operator which makes it easier for
      the operator and the patient.

      Study hypothesis: The vertical bone height gained by using Geistlich Bio-Oss Collagen in
      transcrestal approach sinus augmentation will be comparable to using Bio-Oss Collagen, with
      greater operator satisfaction and less intra-operative complications.
