    
      A total of 60 subjects will be randomised to achieve approximately 46 completed and evaluable
      subjects. Subjects will be randomised 1:1 to one single dose of either active treatment or
      placebo.

      All potential study subjects will be contacted and invited to a screening video-call with the
      Investigator. Full verbal information will be given and the consent for participation in the
      study will be signed electronically.

      Eligible subjects will be visited twice at home by a study nurse on Day 1. During the first
      visit, one standard deep nose swab (one nostril) and one from the anterior part of the nose
      (both nostrils) will be collected. Symptom score will be assessed by the subject before
      dosing. The investigational medicinal product (IMP) will then be applied topically to both
      nostrils by the study nurse.

      The study nurse will come back to collect nasal swab samples 2 hours after administration of
      the IMP, using the same sampling procedure as for the baseline samples.

      Subjects will use an electronic diary for daily registrations of adverse events, concomitant
      medications and symptom score until Day 7.

      A follow-up phone contact will be performed 7 days after IMP administration.
