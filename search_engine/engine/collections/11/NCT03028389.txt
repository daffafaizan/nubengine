      hypothesized that limb remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) would safely decrease the
      incidence of delirium in elderly patients after non-cardiac surgery.The primary outcomes
      included the incidence of delirium in the first 7 days after surgery using the Confusion
      Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) scale.The quality of recovery over a
      6-month period was evaluated as well.Secondary endpoints included length of stay in the
      hospital after surgery (from day of surgery to hospital discharge), occurrence of
      non-delirium postoperative complications, and all-cause 6-month mortality.
