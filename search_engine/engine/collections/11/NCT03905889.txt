    
      Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) accounted for about 64, 000 new cancer diagnoses in the USA in
      2018. Up to 30% of those diagnoses will be patients with metastatic disease. Additionally, up
      to 50% of patients who undergo partial or radical nephrectomy will develop metastatic
      disease.. There is no cure for metastatic RCC, thus, metastatic RCC represents a significant
      cancer burden. Numerous directed therapies are available to improve overall survival but
      these do not result in durable complete responses. However, recent pre-clinical studies of
      RCC have demonstrated that Abemaciclib, a CDK4/6 and PIM1 kinase inhibitor, induces rapid,
      dramatic, and sustained tumor regression when used in combination with Sunitinib.

      Our objectives for this study are as follows:

      Primary Objectives:

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of
           the combination of Abemaciclib with Sunitinib for patients with metastatic renal cell
           carcinoma. Additionally, determine pharmacokinetics (serum trough levels) of Abemaciclib
           and Sunitinib at steady state.

        -  Continued safety assessment of the combination of Abemaciclib and Sunitinib at the
           established maximum tolerated dose (i.e. the recommended Phase II dose)

      Secondary Objectives:

      Determine any anti-tumor activity in the dose expansion phase of the study. Tumor related
      activity will be assessed by:

        -  Length of progression free survival

        -  Disease response rate

        -  Time to disease response

        -  Disease control rate

        -  Duration of response

        -  Overall survival and progression free survival
