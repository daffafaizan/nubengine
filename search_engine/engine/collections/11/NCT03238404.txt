      in areas with a high prevalence of gastric cancer, such as China and Japan, confirming that
      ERAS programs accelerate the postoperative rehabilitation of gastric cancer patients without
      increasing the occurrence rate of postoperative complications. However, in most studies on
      ERAS for gastric cancer, patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy were excluded.
      Investigators designed this study aimed to evaluate whether patients who receive neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy can enrolled into enhanced recovery after surgery programs for locally advanced
      gastric cancer.
