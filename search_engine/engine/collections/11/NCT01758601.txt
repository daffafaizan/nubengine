      participating centers from the CIBER de Fisiopatología de la Obesidad y Nutrición (CIBERobn),
      coordinated by the Hospital Universitario Ramón y Cajal, Madrid. The investigators included
      adult patients with the metabolic syndrome as defined by the Third Report of the National
      Cholesterol Education Program, Adult Treatment Panel III. All the subjects were Caucasian
      from European ancestry. Patients were randomized after the screening visit to one of two
      sequences: 1) Sequence 1 to receive fish consumption first and then no fish. The individuals
      randomized to this arm continued with their previous alimentary habits, avoiding any
      significant nutritional imbalance, and with an ingestion of 7 serves of hake (each serve
      consisted of 100g of frozen Namibia hake, Pescanova S.A., Pontevedra, Spain) per week for a
      period of 8 weeks. Afterwards they continued for another 8 weeks with the same diet except
      for the avoidance of fish and any other seafood; 2) Sequence 2 for which they started with
      their previous alimentary habits, avoiding any significant nutritional imbalance, as well as
      any fish or seafood for the first 8 weeks. Afterwards they were changed to the same diet but
      with 7 serves of hake per week.
