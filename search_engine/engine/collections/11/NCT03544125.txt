    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To assess the feasibility of completing Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act (CLIA)
      analytics on pre-treatment biopsy within a planned 4-week window for enrolled participants.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess safety and tolerability of the proposed therapy. II. Assess response to treatment.
      III. Determine the time to disease progression following study therapy. IV. Determine
      survival of participants enrolled on the study.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Examine response rates depending on tumor characteristics. II. Identify predictive
      biomarkers of sensitivity to therapy. III. Identify emerging mechanism of resistance to
      therapy tumor markers of emergence.

      IV. Determine changes in tumor cells induced by PARP inhibitors. V. Identify tumor markers
      suggestive of combinatorial therapy that could r overcome resistance to therapy.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants receive olaparib orally (PO) twice a day (BID) for 28 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Participants then receive olaparib PO BID on
      days 1-28 and durvalumab intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment repeats every 28
      days for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Participants may continue on therapy beyond disease progression at the discretion of the
      investigator.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up every 6 months for 1 year.
