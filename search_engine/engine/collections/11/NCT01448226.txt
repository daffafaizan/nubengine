      patients (pts) with hematologic malignancies. As culture-based methods only yield results in
      a minority of patients, using non-culture-based methods for detection of aspergillosis in
      clinical specimens becomes increasingly important. Analyzing bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)
      samples with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is promising, however, the influence of current
      antifungal drugs on the performance of this diagnostic tool remains controversial.

      The aim of the trial is to elucidate on the performance of BAL PCR under antifungal
      treatment.

      Patients with high risk of invasive aspergillosis and lung infiltrates are sampled via BAL,
      the sample is analyzed for fungal DNA by Apsergillus specific PCR. Clinical data including
      treatment data is assessed and evaluated.
