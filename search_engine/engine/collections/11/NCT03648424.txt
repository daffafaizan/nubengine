    
      The CARdiovascular Outcome Trial of LINAgliptin Versus Glimepiride in Type 2 Diabetes
      (CAROLINA) is an ongoing randomized controlled trial (RCT) designed to assess whether
      linagliptin is non-inferior, and if so, superior compared with glimepiride 1-4 mg once daily
      with respect to cardiovascular (CV) events in adults with relatively early Type 2 Diabetes at
      increased risk of CV events and with less than optimized glycaemic control. Given that
      medications of both classes are currently advocated as second-line therapy after metformin,
      and since sulfonylureas have been associated with concerns regarding their CV safety, while
      dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors have been suggested to exhibit CV benefits in preclinical
      and mechanistic trials, the results of this trial will provide answers to several clinically
      relevant questions and have a significant impact on clinical practice.

      This cohort study was initiated to predict the findings of CAROLINA trial in a real world
      setting using electronic claims data from insurance databases with results anticipated prior
      to the completion of CAROLINA. Trial eligibility criteria were adapted in claims data to
      generate a comparable study cohort (of linagliptin and glimepiride initiators) to that of the
      trial population. Using 1:1 propensity score-matching was used to control for >120 baseline
      characteristics. Patients were followed up for a composite cardiovascular outcome adapted
      from the primary end-point of the CAROLINA trial.
