      assess the Immunogenicity and safety of NBP608 compared to varivax which are indicated for
      active immunization for the prevention of varicella. Total of 488 subjects of 12 months to 12
      years of age are enrolled, and each subject is administered with single dose of vaccine which
      is randomly assigned in 1:1 ratio. Stratified randomization for age group is used to achieve
      the balance of treatment assignment within age strata.

      Total of four visits are scheduled including two visits via telephone contact. Blood sampling
      is conducted for immunogenicity assessment before and 6 weeks after vaccination at Visit 1
      and Visit 3 respectively. Safety is monitored 1 week, 6 weeks and 26 weeks after vaccination
      through Visit 2*, Visit 3 and Visit 4* (* telephone contact)
