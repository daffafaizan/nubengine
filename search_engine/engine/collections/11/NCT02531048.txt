      pathway) or peripherally (small caliber sensory fibers A delta and C). The laser thermal
      stimulation selectively stimulates the pain pathways and generates nociceptive signals
      conveyed to the cortex. Registering these cortical responses constitute the technical laser
      nociceptive evoked potentials. If these tests are routinely used, their interpretation must
      remain cautious especially in the elderly. Normal values that are available have been
      obtained in young subjects. However, various studies have shown that the integration of
      nociceptive messages depended on age. The aim of this study was to establish normal values of
      nociceptive evoked potentials for each age group of 18 to 75 years.
