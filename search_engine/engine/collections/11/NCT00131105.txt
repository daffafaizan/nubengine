      Caregivers (TLC2) and Counseling Advice for Lifestyle Management (CALM)--to compare exercise
      and diet interventions in caregivers and non-caregivers. Two hundred and forty healthy men
      and women ages 50 and older, half caregivers and half non-caregivers, will be randomly
      assigned to one of four conditions:

        -  a 12-month physical activity intervention and a 12-month dietary counseling intervention
           delivered simultaneously;

        -  a 12-month counseling intervention first focusing on physical activity followed by the
           addition of dietary counseling;

        -  a 12-month counseling intervention first focusing on dietary counseling followed by the
           addition of physical activity counseling; or

        -  a 12-month attention-control condition focusing on stress-management skills training.

      Data on physical activity participation, saturated fat consumption, and related quality of
      life indicators (e.g., improved physical functioning, fitness, sleep, and psychological
      well-being) will be collected at baseline, 4 months, 8 months, and 12 months post-test. The
      primary hypotheses are:

        -  participants assigned to the physical activity and dietary counseling conditions will
           show greater improvements in physical activity participation and saturated fat
           consumption at 12 months compared to the attention-control condition; and

        -  participants in the sequentially-delivered counseling interventions will show greater
           improvements in physical activity and saturated fat consumption compared to participants
           in the simultaneously-delivered interventions.
