      obstruction of the small airways. This results in a largely elevated flow resistance and work
      of breathing. The lungs develop enlarged air spaces (emphysema) with a reduction of alveoli
      and respiratory surface. Consequences are flattening of the diaphragm and alterations in the
      thoracic skeleton. COPD patients in advanced stages develop insufficiency of the muscular
      ventilatory pump. The ventilatory pump may decompensate, if the load of the muscles overruns
      their capacities. Besides that, an unphysiologically high proportion of the cardiac pump
      volume must be spent for the demands of the ventilatory muscles. Hypercapnia, and later
      hypoxaemia, are indicators of a decompensated ventilatory pump.

      Theoretically, non-invasive ventilation (NIV) could be a treatment option for patients with
      advanced COPD and insufficiency of their ventilatory pump. Mechanical non-invasive
      ventilation provides support for the ventilatory muscles and might counterbalance the
      elevated intrinsic PEEP.

      The physiologic and quality of life aspects of long term application on non-invasive
      ventilation (over at least one year) will be assessed in this study.
