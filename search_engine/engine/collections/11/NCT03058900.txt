      shaping the immune system and its potential effects for health and disease. In particular,
      the gut bacteria composition has been associated with the pathogenesis of autoimmune and
      inflammatory diseases. Intriguingly, presence of intestinal inflammation in psoriatic
      arthritis (PsA) patients has been documented in several studies. Also, in genetically
      predisposed patients reactive arthritis, which share some of the clinical manifestations of
      PsA, can be triggered by certain types of bacterial gut infections. Furthermore, a recent
      study has reported that several intestinal bacteria including Akkermansia and Ruminoccocus,
      which are known to play an important role in maintaining gut homeostasis, were practically
      absent in PsA patients. Mechanisms through which the microbiota may be involved in the
      pathogenesis of PsA include an abnormal activation of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue
      (GALT) and/or an altered mucosal permeability thus compromising the capacity of the intestine
      to provide adequate containment of luminal microorganisms and molecules.

      By conducting a double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of a non-related donor
      fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) infused into the small intestine, this study will
      reveal whether FMT is more effective than an identically appearing placebo (saline) in
      reducing disease activity in psoriatic arthritis patients presenting with a minimum of three
      swollen joints despite at least three months of methotrexate treatment (maximal tolerable
      dosis â‰¥ 15 mg/week). All patients will throughout the study continue their individual
      treatment with weekly methotrexate.
