           RGNB clinical isolates as a proxy for gut colonising RGNB and residential Lower Layer
           Super Output Area (LSOA) data retrieved from laboratory information systems of a
           hospital cohort, to describe the geographical distribution of RGNB in South East London
           in relation to demographic, cultural and socioeconomic indicators and to investigate
           whether geographical clustering of resistance, compatible with the occurrence of
           community based transmission hotspots, occurs in our local community.

        2. Study B. Tracking gut colonisation with carbapenem resistant Klebsiella spp. or
           Klebsiella spp. resistant to third generation cephalosporins (3GC), herein referred to
           as 'Resistant Klebsiella' (RK):

      To investigate the duration of gut colonisation with Klebsiella spp. in a small cohort of
      discharged hospital patients with resistance to the carbapenems (eg. meropenem), defined by
      presence of either blaKPC, blaNDM, blaIMP , blaVIM or blaOXA48 genes, or Klebsiella spp. with
      resistance to the 3GC (eg. ceftazidime), defined by presence of blaCTX_M or AmpC Î²lactamase
      genes. To determine the occurrence of participant to participant RK transmission events
      within a household, in relation to gut bacterial load and the gut microbiota profile. To
      characterise over time, the gut microbiota profile of participants colonised with RK as
      compared to participants who only carry antibiotic susceptible enterobacteria in the gut. It
      is beyond the scope of our feasibility study to enrol a sample of persons that is
      representative of the wider population, or to account for sample size and power calculations
      that would allow for characterisation of statistically meaningful associations.
