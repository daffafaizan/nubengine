      neoadjuvant treatment with ixabepilone and cyclophosphamide given every three weeks for a
      total of six cycles. Following surgery patients with hormone receptor-positive tumors will
      receive anti-estrogen treatment. Patients may receive local regional radiation therapy after
      surgery per institutional guidelines at the investigator's discretion. Baseline tumor tissue
      and tumor tissue removed at the time of surgery will be tested by Oncotype Detailed
      Description (DX) assay to determine whether it is predictive of response to this neoadjuvant
      treatment regimen. This study will be one of the first investigations of the combination of
      ixabepilone and cyclophosphamide as neoadjuvant treatment for HER2-negative breast cancer. It
      will examine this treatment regimen for potential advantages gained from substitution of
      ixabepilone for a taxane and use of non-anthracycline agents.
