      multiplanar humeral nail systems after 2-part proximal humeral fractures, the decision of
      surgical method currently depends only on surgeons favour. Because only a randomized clinical
      trial (RCT) can sufficiently answer the question if one treatment option provides advantages
      compared to the other method we are planning to perform a RCT.

      Investigators hypothesis: The cement augmented angle stable plate fixation system PhilosTM
      with augmentation (Depuy-Synthes) achieves significant differences concerning intra- and
      postoperative complication and revision rate, functional outcome and patient satisfaction
      compared to the multiplanar proximal MultiLocÂ®-Nail (Depuy-Synthes) in terms of Disabilities
      of the Shoulder, Arm and Hand-Score (DASH) Constant Score (CS), American Shoulder and Elbow
      Score (ASES), Oxford Shoulder Score (OSS), Range of motion (ROM) and Short Form 36 (SF-36).
