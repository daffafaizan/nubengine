the ultrastructure, histopathology, andhistochemistry of the parathyroid glands of pregnantand nonpregnant cows fed a high level of vitamin d.the parathyroid glands of pregnant andnonpregnant cows were studied by light andelectron microscopy following the dailyfeeding of 30 million units of vit d for 30days and compared to untreated controls.in both the pregnant and nonpregnant cowsthe parathyroid glands became markedlyatrophic with a diminution in the amount ofparenchyma compared to the untreated controls.after vit d feeding the number ofactively secreting dark and intermediatechief cells was reduced and the percentageof inactive (light) and atrophic chief cellswas increased.  the parathyroid glandsof the vit d-fed, nonpregnant cows weredominated by severely atrophic chief cells.these cells were characterized by theirhighly irregular shape, shrunken nucleusand cytoplasm, widened intercellular spacestraversed by numerous cytoplasmicprocesses, increased electron density, fewsecretory granules, inactive ergastoplasmand golgi complexes.  atrophic chiefcells were not present in the untreatedcontrols.  the predominating cell type inthe parathyroids of the vit d-fed pregnantcows were the inactive chief cells.  in contrastto the atrophic chief cells, they werelarger and more regular in shape withrelatively straight cell membranes.  theywere comparatively electron-transparent,containing more glycogen and fewersecretory granules.  organelles concernedwith protein synthesis and packaging intosecretory units were poorly developed.inactive chief cells were observed onlyoccasionally in the parathyroid glands ofuntreated pregnant cows where the activelysecreting dark and intermediate chief cellspredominated.
