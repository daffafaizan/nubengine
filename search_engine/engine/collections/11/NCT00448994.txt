    
      This study is a multi-center observational study to determine the usefulness of real time PCR
      in the detection of adenovirus and fungal infections in patients following HSCT. Quantitative
      viral load monitoring will be evaluated to establish correlation with clinical symptoms and
      to measure the effectiveness of the therapeutic interventions. Samples will be collected
      prior to HSCT and on a scheduled weekly basis for 100 days post-HSCT and after that when
      patients show signs of infection. Patients' signs and symptoms and outcomes will be recorded
      for correlation with viral load. In addition, viral cultures will be performed on the same
      schedule as PCR assay using 3 samples (throat swab, stool, and urine). The study will be
      conducted at approximately 6 centers in the United States.
