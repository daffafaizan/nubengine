    
      Specific Aim: To characterize subjective analgesia (behavioral effect) of different
      expectancy levels on verum and sham acupuncture treatment and the relative contribution of
      acupuncture treatment and expectancy to the resultant analgesia in healthy normals and in
      those with low back pain, controlling for psychiatric comorbidity.

      Hypothesis 1: Patients with low back pain, low psychiatric comorbidity, and high expectations
      for acupuncture treatment will experience the same magnitude of acupuncture analgesia to
      thermal pain stimuli as healthy volunteers with high expectations for treatment.

      Hypothesis 2: Patients with low back pain and high psychiatric comorbidity will experience
      less acupuncture analgesia compared to patients with low back pain and low psychiatric
      comorbidity, regardless of the level of expectations for acupuncture treatment.

      Hypothesis 3: Patients with low back pain and high psychiatric comorbidity will have
      increased acupuncture placebo analgesia to thermal pain stimuli than both other groups.
