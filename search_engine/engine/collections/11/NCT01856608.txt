      events, practitioners from multiple disciplines meet at a pre-specified time to discuss
      current medical condition and plans of care. At the conclusion of these discussions, all
      practitioners are expected to understand the plan of care well enough to execute defined
      tasks, but also coordinate as circumstances change. In order to coordinate under changing
      circumstances practitioners must have a broader understanding of the current state of the
      patient and how likely certain deteriorations are. This synthetic understanding of patient
      risks across multi-provider groups has been described as anticipatory team situational
      awareness (Team SA). One instrument has been validated in the ICU as feasible and
      informative. This Team SA survey successfully identified that the time spent in "training"
      discussions improved Team SA across physician groups. The investigators' goal is to implement
      this survey across the investigators' medical ICU service to obtain a baseline estimate of
      how effective current communication patterns are for achieving concordant Team SA. If gaps in
      communication are encountered future interventions will be developed
