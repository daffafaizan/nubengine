    
      Primary outcomes:

      â€¢ Anaesthetic requirements: based on entropy monitoring(state and response entropy monitoring
      and the difference as a measure for adequacy of analgesia) and haemodynamic parameters (
      heart rate and mean arterial blood pressure) at the following time intervals: before
      induction, after induction, after giving either ESP block or multimodal analgesia and
      starting surgical stimulus, at 30 min intervals, at end of anaesthesia, at eye opening.

      Secondary outcomes:

        -  Stress response measurement based on serum cortisol and blood glucose levels

        -  Controlled hypotensive anaesthesia: various drugs required and doses given

        -  Intraoperative and postoperative analgesia.

        -  Postanaesthesia care unit data concerning recovery.
