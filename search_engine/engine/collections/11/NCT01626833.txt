      start of the trial. This evaluation will include a clinical evaluation and a biological
      (IGF-I, IGFBP-3, leptin, ghrelin, adiponectin, mineral metabolism, thyroid function, 24 hours
      urinary cortisol, as well as conventional electrolyte tolerance parameters), psychological
      and nutritional study body composition by absorptiometry at 0, 12 and 24 months. Evaluations
      will be conducted at the Center for Clinical Investigation at Hospital Robert Debre. The
      primary endpoint will be the linear growth rate 1 year after the start of the trial expressed
      in cm/1 year in the group with hGH compared to the placebo group. The secondary endpoints
      will be the height velocity expressed in SDS (standard deviation score), the data of body
      composition and psychological changes that will be assessed between the 2 arms at the end of
      the two years of the clinical trial. The data of body composition obtained by dual photon
      absorptiometry and biological data of mineral metabolism and growth factors are expressed in
      Z score compared to normal references that we have established in France, in healthy subjects
      according to age, gender and pubertal stage.
