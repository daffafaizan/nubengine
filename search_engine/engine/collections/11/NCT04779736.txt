      toward anal sex during healthcare encounters, in order to develop and pilot a strategy that
      responds to these determinants and thereby improves the quality of care and HIV services
      engagement among men who have sex with men (MSM). The study team will collect data during
      in-depth interviews with 30 adult MSM as well as 30 adult healthcare workers (HCWs) to
      identify strategies that could be readily used in health services to reduce stigma. Analysis
      of this data will then inform consultation with an advisory board of 4 adult MSM and 4 adult
      HCWs to develop the content of a set of implementation strategies to mitigate stigma and
      thereby improve health service delivery. Evaluation of a set of implementation strategies
      will be performed in two high incidence regions in the United States, by pilot testing with
      120 adult HCWs who do not specialize in MSM health and who work in clinical sites where MSM
      are under-engaged in HIV services.
