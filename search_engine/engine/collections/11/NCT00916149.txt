      medication for prevention of recurrent seizures. Those with focal seizures will be treated
      with levetiracetam, and those with generalized seizures will be treated with lamotrigine.
      Subjects will undergo repeated EEG with concurrent cognitive testing before and after
      initiation of treatment. The proposed study tests 3 hypotheses: 1. that treatment with
      levetiracetam will reduce focal interictal epileptiform activity, 2. that treatment with
      lamotrigine will reduce generalized interictal epileptiform activity, and 3. that the extent
      of interictal epileptiform activity is inversely associated with performance on
      neuropsychological batteries and computerized cognitive testing. Repeated
      cognitive/neuropsychological testing obtained at steady state of the study drug and again
      after approximately 2 months on the final dosage will serve to evaluate the timecourse of
      potential cognitive benefits.
