      permits disease palliation at relatively low doses and thus decreases some of the
      dose-limiting toxicity. Multi-agent therapy is considered to be more effective than
      single-agent therapy; therefore, DOX-SL will be combined with bleomycin and vincristine.

      Patients are randomized to receive intravenous DOX-SL alone or in combination with
      vincristine/bleomycin every 2 weeks. Filgrastim ( granulocyte colony-stimulating factor;
      G-CSF ) may be given as needed for neutropenia.

      AS PER AMENDMENT 11/7/96: Based on interim review data, it is recommended that subjects
      receiving DOX-SL plus vincristine/bleomycin have vincristine/bleomycin discontinued and
      receive DOX-SL alone unless, in the opinion of the treating physician, they are benefitting
      from the DOX-SL plus vincristine/bleomycin regimen.
