      the TAVI procedure. The Cardiac computed tomography (CT) shows the exact geometry of the
      aortic annulus and help the physician to find the right position of the prosthesis during the
      procedure. The hypothesis is that performing a cardiac CT before the TAVI could reduce the
      number of vascular peripheral complication, the number of stroke and can minimize the aortic
      regurgitation during the follow up.
