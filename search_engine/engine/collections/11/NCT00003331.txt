      combination with fluorouracil for patients with advanced malignancy and establish a
      recommended phase II dose based on the MTD. II. Evaluate the dose limiting toxicity of this
      combination in these patients. II. Obtain pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data for
      topoisomerase-1 depletion in patients receiving this treatment. IV. Identify any objective
      tumor responses arising from this treatment in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of topotecan in combination with fluorouracil.
      Patients receive topotecan as a 24-hour continuous infusion on days 1-14 in combination with
      fluorouracil IV and leucovorin calcium IV on days 1-5; course repeats every 4 weeks.
      Treatment continues in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. In the
      absence of dose limiting toxicity (DLT) in the first cohort of 3 patients treated, subsequent
      cohorts each receive escalating doses on the same schedule. If DLT is observed in 2 of 3
      patients or 2 of 6 patients at a given dose level, then dose escalation ceases and the next
      lower dose is declared the maximum tolerated dose.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 6-30 patients will be accrued for this study.
