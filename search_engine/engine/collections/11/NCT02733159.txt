      studies which demonstrate a role for the immune system in fighting lung cancer. However,
      there are multiple mechanisms by which cancer dampens this response. The PD-1 receptor-ligand
      interaction is one of the major pathways hijacked by tumours to help evade detection and
      elimination by the cells of the immune system. A number of compounds which block this
      pathway, including the drug pembrolizumab, have shown impressive results in some patients.

      At present all of the trials with pembrolizumab reported thus far have been in patients with
      a good Performance Status of 0-1, a measure of daily activity. Unfortunately many patients
      with lung cancer have impaired performance status, making them ineligible for trials of new
      therapies including anti PD-1. Clinical trials of standard-of-care therapy have been
      successfully performed in the PS=2 only population demonstrating the feasibility of
      performing clinical trials in this population.

      In this trial, the investigators would like to determine whether this drug can be used to
      treat Performance status 2 patients with a lower general daily activity. The purpose of this
      trial is to determine that pembrolizumab is safe and tolerable. The investigators would also
      like to see how well the treatment works, find out more information about tumour shrinkage,
      and learn more about the disease and how it changes over time.
