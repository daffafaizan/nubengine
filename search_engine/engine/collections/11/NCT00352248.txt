      (ASD) is a holistic one. The objective is to study the efficacy of a short intensive course
      of Acupuncture versus sham acupuncture in improving the overall functional status of children
      with autism. A single-blind randomized control trial was conducted in 50 children. These
      children were randomly assigned to Treatment group with Tongue Acupuncture (40 sessions over
      8 weeks) or Control group (Sham Tongue Acupuncture to non-acupoints in the tongue).
