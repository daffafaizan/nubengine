      results will be concluded by the Principal Investigators (MDs and DOs) of the study at each
      site authorized to participate by the AASEM, within the highest of scientific mathematical
      standards, using Pain DX Neural Scan and/or AXON II testing systems, which include amplitude
      testing certified with Promethius potentiometers, for Small Pain Fiber (SpF) Nerve Conduction
      Testing, CMS Carrier CPT codes 95904 now 95909 through 95913 units, as needed.

      It is expected that, at a later date, other products used for therapy and/or rehabilitation
      purposes will be added to the comparison protocol for the National Trial Number (NCT# TBA)
      assigned by the National Library of Medicine (NLM). Other products and/or DME equipment may
      include: infrared light therapy CPT code 97026, TENS therapy and home units CPT therapy code
      # 97032, as well as montmorillonite minerals for physical applications (montmorillonite is a
      natural mineral and has no CPT code - is not a CMS ordinarily payable event).
