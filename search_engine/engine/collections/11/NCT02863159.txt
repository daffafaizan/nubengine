      groups. One hundred (100) qualified study patients will receive a +2.75D (ZKB00) Tecnis
      Multifocal 1-Piece IOL in their dominant eye. Of these study patients, 50 patients will
      receive the +3.25D (ZLB00) Tecnis Multifocal 1-Piece IOL in their non-dominant eye and the
      other 50 patients will receive the +4.00D (ZMB00) Tecnis Multifocal 1-Piece IOL in their
      non-dominant eye. each study patient will undergo the same routine cataract extraction
      procedures for each eye, with the second eye scheduled to undergo cataract extraction within
      7 to 30 days after the first eye. In addition, as is customary for the surgeon, each study
      patient will receive the same open-label pre-operative, operative and post-operative
      medications over the course of the study period.
