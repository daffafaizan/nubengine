      surgery, data showing high rates of toxicity have led to a difficult clinical dilemma, since
      there are few alternate treatment options. The option of delivering no treatment whatsoever,
      which avoids any risk of treatment-related toxicity, is associated with a high risk of death
      due to the lung cancer itself.

      Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) is a newer radiotherapy approach which uses modern
      radiotherapy planning and targeting technologies to precisely deliver larger, ablative doses
      of radiotherapy. SABR has been associated with high rates of local control. A major advantage
      of SABR is that in general, the toxicity profile is very favorable, even in patients with
      substantial co-morbid conditions.

      It is possible that currently-used doses and fractionations of SABR, when given with strict
      planning criteria to minimize the risk of lung toxicity, have only a modest risk of
      treatment-related toxicity and represent the best possible approach.

      This study will examine SABR versus a historical control of untreated stage I non-small cell
      lung cancer with Overall survival (OS) as the endpoint. OS was selected as it objectively
      reflects the potential benefits of treatment (i.e. extended survival), the harms of treatment
      (grade 5 toxicity), and the natural history of the ILD disease process itself.
