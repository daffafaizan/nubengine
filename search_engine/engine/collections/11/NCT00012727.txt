      This project�s goal is to improve the quality of care and reduce treatment costs for veterans
      with substance abuse and psychiatric problems.

      Objectives:

      This project is evaluating a patient-treatment matching strategy to improve residential
      treatment for substance abuse patients with psychiatric disorders. Its immediate objective is
      to examine whether the matching strategy results in more effective and cost-effective
      treatment in VA programs. We hypothesize that patients with severe clinical problems will
      have better outcomes when they are matched to service-intensive programs; patients with
      moderate problems will have better outcomes when they are matched to programs having a lower
      intensity of services. For both patient groups, community treatment should prove to be more
      cost-effective than hospital treatment.

      Methods:

      The project utilized a stratified randomized design. We paired each of three VA hospital
      programs that treat dual diagnosis patients and are high on intensity with a nearby
      high-intensity community residential facility (CRF) that contracts with the VA. We also
      paired four VA hospital and four CRFs that are low on intensity. Veterans who applied for
      substance abuse treatment at VA facilities were randomly assigned to either the VA hospital
      or CRF. Patient assessments have been conducted at intake (N=230), discharge, and a 4-month
      follow-up. Primary outcomes are patients� severity of substance abuse and psychiatric
      problems. Secondary outcomes are patients� functional status and their VA and non-VA health
      care utilization and its costs.

      Status:

      Completed.
