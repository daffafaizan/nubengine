      conventional ultrasound and contrasted MRI. Any patient undergoing annual imaging screening
      is eligible, but the investigators will target inclusion of at least 10 subjects who have at
      least 1 kidney lesion. Therefore, up to 5 subjects may have no current kidney lesions.
      Subject participation will be only for the day of CEUS study. There will be no follow-up
      period for this study. However, if results are encouraging, a longitudinal observational
      study may follow, and these same subjects would be eligible for enrollment. Eligible subjects
      will undergo a contrast enhanced ultrasound.

      Following completion of imaging, all CEUS, MRI (within 4 months) and B-mode (at time of CEUS)
      US studies will be de-identified. Blinded radiologists will interpret images and provide an
      overall assessment of risk of malignancy to each kidney using the Bosniak criteria for each
      kidney lesion present. The Bosniak criteria places cystic lesions into one of 5 categories
      (I, II, IIF, III and IV) based on lesion characteristics. CEUS based diagnosis will be
      compared to the diagnoses on routine B-mode US and contrast-enhanced MRI.
