      I. To assess the safety and tolerability of treatment with ipilimumab in combination with
      dasatinib in subjects with gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) and other advanced sarcomas.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Response rate (RR) by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1,
      immune-related response criteria, and Choi criteria.

      II. Progression free survival (PFS). III. Progression-free survival at 6 months (PFS6months).
      IV. Overall survival (OS). V. Immunological correlative studies.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of dasatinib.

      Patients receive dasatinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 7 days. Patients then receive
      dasatinib PO QD and ipilimumab intravenously (IV) once on weeks 1, 4, 7 and 10. Beginning on
      week 24, patients then receive dasatinib PO QD and ipilimumab IV once every 12 weeks.
      Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4 weeks and then every 3
      months.
