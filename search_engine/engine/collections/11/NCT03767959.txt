      technique and other group will use classic duct-to-mucosa technique. All patients will be
      followed up for 3 month after surgery, and primary outcome is POPF, other outcome such as
      duration of operation, grade of POPF, morbidity, mortality, length of hospital stay,
      reoperation rate, postoperative pancreatic function and postoperative incidence of chronic
      pancreatic diseases.
