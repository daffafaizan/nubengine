    
      A multi-center study to assess progression of DaTscan and [¹⁸F] AV-133 imaging in PD
      patients. Participants will be followed for at least 18 months. Approximately 50 PD
      participants will be recruited from up to 5 sites. All participants will be comprehensively
      assessed at baseline and every six months thereafter. Participants will undergo imaging
      assessments with DaTscan and [¹⁸F] AV-133, clinical (motor, neuropsychiatric and cognitive)
      assessments, as well as biospecimen collection for biomic analysis. Data will be collected by
      each site under uniformly established protocols and data will be stored and analyzed at
      designated core facilities.
