      The Netherlands] and Shanchol™ [Shantha Biotechnics; Hyderabad, India]) that are
      pre-qualified by the World Health Organization (WHO) for procurement by United Nations (UN)
      agencies. Each of these vaccines requires a two-dose regimen which is difficult to implement
      in the face of explosive outbreaks of cholera in unsettled situations in developing
      countries. For this reason there is great interest in identifying a cholera vaccine that can
      provide rapid onset of protection following the ingestion of just a single oral dose.

      This Phase 2 randomized, observer-blinded and subject-blinded clinical trial to be conducted
      in Bamako, Mali will assess the immunogenicity of the 10^8 cfu versus the 10^9 cfu
      formulation of PaxVax-manufactured CVD 103-HgR.
