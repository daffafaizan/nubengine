      when blood flow to a portion of the brain is blocked. One place this often happens is in the
      carotid artery. This blockage is called atherosclerosis or hardening of the arteries.

      The purpose of this trial is to determine the best way to prevent strokes in people who have
      a high amount of blockage of their carotid artery but no stroke symptoms related to that
      blockage. Each eligible participant will be evaluated to determine which procedure(s) is best
      for him/her. All participants will receive intensive medical treatment. In addition,
      participants will be randomized to receive the selected procedure or not.

      The trial will be conducted in the United States and Canada by physicians carefully selected
      on their ability to perform the procedures at low risk. Another key component of the trial is
      that important stroke risk factors, including hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol,
      cigarette smoking, physical activity, and diet will be managed intensively. Participants will
      remain in the study for 4 years.
