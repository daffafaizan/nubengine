      system regulates digestion and absorption of nutrients and it also has a very important
      function as a barrier between internal and external environment. The penetration of harmful
      substances and microbiota of the GI lumen (external environment) to the systemic circulation
      (internal environment) depends on this barrier. Previous studies have shown that exercise in
      healthy subjects provides hypoperfusion of the splanchnic area, resulting in intestinal
      damage, increased small intestinal permeability and liver damage. Similar splanchnic
      hypoperfusion occurs in patients with compromised circulation.

      During episodes of splanchnic hypoperfusion, the de novo synthesis of nitric oxide (nitric
      oxide, NO) from arginine is compromised. This impaired NO synthesis may play a role in the
      development of organ dysfunction during exercise. L-citrulline administration, a precursor of
      arginine and NO, may result in improved NO availability and organ perfusion, thereby
      preventing organ damage.
