      and qualitative tests, before and after the daily administration of 300mcg K2 vitamin/placebo
      for a period of one year.Clinical examination,extensive blood laboratory tests,direct
      measurement of Dephosphorylated-uncarboxylated MGP(dp-ucMGP), Echocardiogram and ECS,carotid
      ultrasound,ophthalmologic exam,further imaging methods with MSCT Calcium Score(Agatston
      score) will take place.Correlations with their medical and pharmacological therapy history.

      Before and after the administration of VK2/placebo, the following measurements will take
      place i)Quantitative and percentile rate determination of Aortic Valve, Mitral Valve and
      Ascending Aorta calcification via MSCT Calcium score without contrast.

      ii)Echocardiogram and calcification evaluation via Echocardiographic Calcium Score (ECS),
      iii)Determination of changes in carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) and Carotid stenosis
      iv)Standard ophthalmologic examination v)Direct measurement of
      Dephosphorylated-uncarboxylated MGP(dp-ucMGP) vi)Correlation with blood biomarkers
