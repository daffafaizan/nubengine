      he/she can be assigned to the group with normal glucose tolerance (NGT), impaired glucose
      tolerance (IGT) which is between normal and diabetic, or type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
      Each study subject will then be administered a meal tolerance test (MTT) on 4 separate
      occasions. For the MTT, a liquid meal (Boost Plus) will be ingested following an overnight
      fast. A placebo or Bethanechol (25 mg, 50 mg, or 100 mg) will taken by mouth 1 hour before
      ingestion of the meal. Blood samples will be collected before and during the MTT for the
      measurement of glucose, insulin, C-peptide, and glucagon levels.
