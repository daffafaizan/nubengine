      million people, more than 300 000 are cancer survivors. Given the range of physical,
      psychological and social late effects of cancer and its primary treatment many survivors need
      tailored rehabilitation interventions. This randomized study evaluates the effect of a
      multi-focused, psychosocial 6-day residential rehabilitation course at the Dallund
      Rehabilitation Centre in Denmark. We hypothesize that individuals in the intervention group
      will experience better psychosocial well-being and more adaptive health behaviour changes as
      compared to individuals in the control group.
