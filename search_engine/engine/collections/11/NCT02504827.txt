      obstruction, and inflammation leading to progressive loss of lung function and eventual
      respiratory failure. The principal pathogen is Pseudomonas aeruginosa which is present in the
      airways of 70% of adult patients with CF. Of particular concern is the increasing resistance
      observed to existing agents.

      While ceftazidime has been the mainstay of treatment for many years, its efficacy is limited
      by reduced susceptibility. Ceftazidime/avibactam offers a potential advancement in the
      management of infections involving P. aeruginosa in CF due to its excellent activity,
      penetration into pulmonary secretions, and reduced potential for development of resistance.
