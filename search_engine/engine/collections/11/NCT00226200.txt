      or non-allergic) who are controlled by medication.

      Skin testing will be done to determine the allergic status, as well as a base line IgE done.
      The Omalizumab is administered by injection based on weight and IgE level, (once or twice a
      month).

      At several times during the year pulmonary function test will be done, as well blood drawn
      for immunological assays (CD23 and FcER1 expression, TH1/TH2 cytokines, CD23 production). A
      battery of questionnaires will also determine quality of life(with asthma), psychological
      stress measures and parameters of clinical response.
