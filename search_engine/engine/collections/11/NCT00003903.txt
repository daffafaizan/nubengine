        -  Evaluate the effect of androgen ablation on bone resorption in patients with or without
           bone metastases secondary to prostate cancer.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to prior androgen ablation therapy (yes vs no) and
      metastatic disease (yes vs no).

      Patients undergo blood work and 24 hour urine collection on day 1 and at week 6-8. Patients
      who have received androgen ablation therapy and are found to have increased bone resorption
      undergo a dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan.

      A comparison is made between androgen ablation therapy and bone resorption and if metastases
      are associated with the two.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 150 patients will be accrued for this study within 9 months.
