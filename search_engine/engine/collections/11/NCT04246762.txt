    
      Olokizumab (OKZ) has been shown to reverse the inhibitory effect of IL-6 on the activity of
      Cytochrome P450 (CYP450) isozymes CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4/5 in vitro.

      The goal of this study is to examine whether olokizumab alters metabolism of following
      substrates selective for specific CYP450 activity: caffeine (CYP1A2), S warfarin (CYP2C9),
      omeprazole (CYP2C19), and midazolam (CYP3A4) in patients with RA.

      After 35-day screening period, 15 subjects who meet the study eligibility criteria will be
      administered a cocktail of 4 substrates alone during 7-day PK-sampling Period 1. A single
      subcutaneous dose of 128 mg OKZ will be administered (Period 2) approximately 2 weeks prior
      to the second administration of the cocktail in 7-day PK-sampling Period 3. After completion
      of the Period 3 patients will be followed for 19 weeks for safety evaluations.

      The duration of the study will be approximately 6.5 months.

      Approximately 3 Investigators and study centers are expected to participate in this study.

      12 evaluable subjects will be required to complete the study. It is estimated that 15
      subjects who meet the study eligibility criteria will need be dosed in order to achieve this
      number. However, if necessary, additional subjects may be dosed to obtain the 12 evaluable
      subjects required.
