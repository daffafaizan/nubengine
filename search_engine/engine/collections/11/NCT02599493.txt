    
      Primary objective :

      To demonstrate that a daily weight-based low dose of rifampicin is non-inferior to a high
      dose in the treatment of susceptible Staphylococcus spp. osteo-articular infections.

      Secondary objectives :

      To compare, in the two treatment groups (weight-based low dose rifampicin versus weight-based
      high dose):

        -  Possible failure rates (when no bacteriological samples are available or when clinical
           manifestations are not straightforward),

        -  AEs distribution:

             -  Those self-patient reported,

             -  Those medical or biological reported,

        -  - Rifampicin dose modifications:

             -  Dosage decrease,

             -  Treatment interruption (temporary or definitive),

        -  Failure risk factors analysis,

        -  Health costs related to the osteo-articular infection care: number and length of
           hospitalizations, number of follow-up visits, nature and number of all biological
           samples prescribed in both groups.

        -  Comparison of the planned rifampicin exposure in each randomization group

        -  Differences in rifampicin duration (planned versus effective duration) according to
           allocated group,

        -  Rifampicin pharmacokinetics sub-study in a small sample of 60 patients,

        -  Rifampicin resistance bacteriological study in patients with proven failure.

      Methodology :

      Non-inferiority prospective, multicentre, randomized, open-label, controlled phase IV trial
      evaluating two different rifampicin dosages (high versus low dose) in the treatment of
      staphylococcal bone and joint infections.

      Treatment :

      Patients will be randomly assigned to low dosage (10 mg/kg/j) rifampicin group or high dosage
      (20 mg/kg/j) rifampicin group. Rifampicin treatment will be prescribed in association with
      another antibiotic chosen by investigator according to the antibiogram results. Association
      with fluoroquinolones is the first choice combination, if it is possible. The global
      antibiotic treatment duration depends on the investigator's choice.
