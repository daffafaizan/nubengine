      fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) are two standard approaches for HER2 status
      determination and selection of patients who will undergo the anti-HER2 therapy. However, the
      intra- and intratumor heterogeneity over space and time make them even more challenging to
      assess HER2 status. HER2-specific nuclear molecular imaging is a potential tool, which has
      ability to detect HER2 receptor in primary and metastatic lesions noninvasively and address
      the problems encountered by biopsy dependent tests. VHH, also referred to as nanobody, is a
      distinct type of antibody fragment derived from camelid heavy chain-only antibody. Compared
      with classical antibodies, VHHs have smaller size (about 15 kDa), greater thermal and
      chemical stability, which promoting their application in field of cancer theranostic.

      In our recent preclinical studies, we developed a novel VHH-based radiotracer, 99mTc-MIRC208,
      for the SPECT/CT imaging of HER2 status in tumors. In this clinical study, we aim to
      investigate whether 99mTc-MIRC208 could be used for HER2 measurement in cancer patients.
      99mTc-MIRC208 SPECT/CT examination will be performed in patients with HER2-positive tumors.
      The SUV of 99mTc-MIRC208 in tumors will be calculated. Meanwhile, we will investigate the
      ability of 99mTc-MIRC208 for the patients selection for anti-HER2 therapy.
