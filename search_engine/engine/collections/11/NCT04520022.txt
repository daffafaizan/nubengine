      examined the potential of bone marrow-derived MSCs. However, umbilical cord blood (UCB) is
      another important source of stem cells, since its non-invasive collection procedure and rapid
      availability from cord blood banking. Human UCB-derived MSCs (hUCB-MSCs) exhibit high
      proliferation capacity and low immunogenicity. A few data support that UCB-MSCs may have
      significantly greater immunosuppressive potential than other sources of MSCs. A preclinical
      study has demonstrated that systemic infusions of human UCB-derived unrestricted somatic stem
      cells, a subpopulation of non-hematopoietic stromal stem cells, significantly extended the
      life span and reduced blistering of RDEB mice model. Given the promising results of the
      preclinical study, we conducted a first-in-human, phase 1/2a clinical trial of intravenous
      administrations of allogeneic hUCB-MSCs in patients with RDEB to determine the safety,
      tolerability, and potential efficacy.
