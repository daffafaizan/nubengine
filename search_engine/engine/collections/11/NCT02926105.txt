      falling and risk of death and to improve balance, leg strength, function, physical activity
      and balance confidence in older adults living in the community.

      The Test-and-Exercise home-based programme (T&E) contains 50 tests and 50 exercises to
      improve balance, strength and ability in older adults. It is especially built for older
      adults and is based on the concept of self-efficacy and empowerment. The originality of this
      programme is the evaluation of the difficulty perceived of the balance-exercises. It is
      delivered on a booklet which investigators had good experience with in our pilot study, with
      pictures and descriptions of each test and each exercise. Investigators also developed a
      mobile application. This application will be transmitted on a tablet-computer. In addition,
      the participants will receive cards with pictures of the exercises, to put into a plastic
      sheet to have an overview of their own exercise programme. This programme will be implemented
      from especially trained physiotherapists.

      The Otago home-based exercise programme was developed in New-Zeeland in the 2000's to prevent
      falls in older adults. It proposes 22 exercises and walk training. The physiotherapists give
      an exercise prescription at each home visit. It shows good results for decrease falls in
      older adults, but the exercise adherence decrease also with the time.
