      diabetes (HbA1c> 6%). The target parameters are determined in the blood. Blood sampling takes
      place at confinement, after 6 weeks and at the end of the study (week 12). In addition, blood
      pressure is determined and general health condition of each subject is recorded by a
      standardized questionnaire (SF-36).
