      collected at study entry, during follow up and at disease progression (or after 36 months
      after registration) Biological markers will be evaluated at centralized laboratory, at study
      entry and at time of disease progression (or after 24 months of follow-up for non progressed
      patients) Using the scoring system, patients can be separated into 3 risk groups: low-risk
      (score 0), intermediate-risk (score 1) and high-risk (score 2-3), with significantly
      different clinical courses.
