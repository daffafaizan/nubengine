      performance of healthy young adult and older adult drivers. Past research indicates that
      specific scented odors (i.e., peppermint and cinnamon) enhance motivation, performance and
      alertness, decrease fatigue and stimulate the central nervous system in a variety of
      contexts. The current study will examine the effect of three different odors on simulated
      driving as participants perform navigation and braking scenarios. This study will be the
      first of its kind to elucidate the association between specific scents and performance gains
      in simulated driving. The data will serve as proof-of-concept for eventual patient focused
      interventions relative to sensory stimulation and driving.
