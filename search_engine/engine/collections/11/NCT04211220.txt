      However, this system contributes to the complexity of insulin adjustment by the diversity of
      the data delivered by CGM system.

      Insulin Real-Time Advisor (IRTA©), a decision support software, has been developed in order
      to guide patients in the adaptation of their treatment according to CGM data. IRTA© provides
      advice applicable to thousand situations according to six parameters: glucose level, trend
      arrows, meals, physical activity, before bedtime, time since the previous bolus.

      Type of advice :

        -  Insulin injection (carb and correction)

        -  To continue treatment without modification

        -  To lower the insulin dose (temporary basal rate)

        -  Sugar intake advice

        -  Glucose level control with CGM, self-monitor blood glucose, blood ketones monitor

        -  To change catheter for patients treated by insulin pump.
