      evidence from functional magnetic resonance imaging-based analysis (fMRI) of neural
      activation during dissociative symptom provocation in patients with PTSD or DID has
      implicated certain key structures involved in the generation of dissociative symptoms. Given
      the presumed region-to-region neural interplay implicit within this model, the investigators
      believe the use of intrinsic functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI) represents a valuable next
      line of investigation into the neurobiology of traumatic dissociation. The investigators also
      believe that a genetic approach holds promise as another converging line of inquiry into our
      understanding of traumatic dissociation.

      To evaluate the neurobiological basis of traumatic dissociation, this study will recruit
      patients with PTSD or DID, and recruit matched controls to identify neurobiological
      correlates of traumatic dissociation.The study will compare the phenomenology of traumatic
      dissociation in patients with different PTSD subtypes and DID using standardized measures to
      look at the neurological and genetic correlates.

      This study will also include a follow up visit that includes neuroimaging and genetic
      assessments.
