      beginning of the procedure soon after radial sheath placement. The operators will be blinded
      to both assignment. The primary outcome is the incidence of moderate to severe RAS evaluated
      by the operators during the radial procedure.

      Both NTG and placebo will be administered using an identical syringe to keep the operators
      blinded to the treatment allocation. Radial angiogram is mandatory to measure the diameter of
      both radial and ulnar arteries. Doppler ultrasound of the radial artery will be examined at
      the day after the procedure.
