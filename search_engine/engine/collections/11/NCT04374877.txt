    
      This is a Phase 1, open-label, first-in-human (FIH), dose-escalation, monotherapy, safety,
      and expansion study of SRF388, a monoclonal antibody targeting IL-27, that will be conducted
      in 2 parts:

        -  Part A: SRF388 monotherapy dose-escalation portion of the study will evaluate the
           safety, tolerability, PK, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary efficacy of SRF388 as
           monotherapy in patients with advanced solid tumors.

        -  Part B: SRF388 monotherapy expansion cohorts will evaluate the safety, efficacy,
           tolerability, PK, and pharmacodynamics of SRF388 monotherapy in patients with advanced
           or metastatic ccRCC (any clear cell component in the histologic definition) and advanced
           or metastatic HCC in indication specific cohorts.
