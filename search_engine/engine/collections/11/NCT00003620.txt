    
      OBJECTIVES: Determine the complete and partial response rate to flavopiridol in patients with
      fludarabine-refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

      Assess the toxicity profile of this treatment in these patients. Examine progression-free
      survival and overall survival following this treatment in these patients.

      Determine the effects of flavopiridol on normal T-cell subsets and immunoglobulin levels in
      these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open label, multicenter study.

      Patients registered before 9/15/2000 receive flavopiridol IV continuously on days 1-3.
      Treatment repeats every 14 days for a total of 12 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients registered after 9/15/2000 receive flavopiridol IV over 1 hour daily on days 1-3.
      Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for a total of 8 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for the first year and then every 6 months for 5 years.
