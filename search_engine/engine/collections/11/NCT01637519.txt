      stone lodged in the ureter. This stent would be placed when a patient presents with pain in
      the Emergency Room or clinic in a patient that has no signs of infection. It is designed to
      continue drainage of the kidney and unlike other ureteral stents, is also designed to help
      dilate the ureter to facilitate spontaneous stone passage. This means the stent may also be
      therapeutic and the patient would be less likely to undergo another procedure to have the
      stone removed. Research performed at the Stone Centre at VGH shows that in ex vivo pig
      kidneys, this stent provides very good urinary drainage of the kidney. This has been
      published in a peer-reviewed journal (Lange D, Hoag NA, Poh BK, Chew BH. Drainage
      characteristics of the 3F MicroStent using a novel film occlusion anchoring mechanism. J
      Endourol. 2011 Jun;25(6):1051-6.).
