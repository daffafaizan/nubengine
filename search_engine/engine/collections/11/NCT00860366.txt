      Uric acid (UA) is an endogenous product derived from the metabolism of purins which in man is
      responsable of the 60% of the total antioxidant capacity of the organism. Recent experimental
      evidences gathered by our and other research groups have shown that the exogenous
      administration of UA is neuroprotective both in cortical and subcortical brain areas as the
      result of its antioxidant properties. In these studies, animals treated with UA disclosed
      smaller brain infarction after transient focal ischemia, both using the intraluminal model or
      after the injection of autologous clots. Moreover, our group first described greater
      neuroprotection in animals pretreated with rtPA (alteplase). Likewise, we have recently shown
      that the administration of UA was free of serious adverse effects in stroke patients
      receiving rtPA within 3 hours of stroke onset. Yet, preliminary data suggested that this
      intervention might translate into clinical benefits at 3 months follow-up. Based on these
      data, we aim to conduct a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, controlled trial assessing the
      clinical efficacy of UA administration in acute ischemic stroke patients. Currently, rtPA is
      the only approved therapy for stroke patients within the first hours of clinical onset, and
      oxidative stress is thought particularly relevant following ischemia/reperfusion. Based on
      this ground, we aim to conduct this phase 3 clinical trial in ischemic stroke patients which
      are currently treated with rtPA within the 4'5 hour window.
