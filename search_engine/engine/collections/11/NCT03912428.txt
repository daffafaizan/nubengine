      18-kDa translocator protein (TSPO) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) are both implicated in the
      pathophysiology of various inflammatory disorders, suggesting that both may serve as
      potential biomarkers of inflammation in brain as well as periphery. Our laboratory recently
      developed two new radioligands: [11C]ER176 to image TSPO and [11C]MC1 to image COX-2. Using
      wholebody imaging, this study seeks to determine whether PET imaging using these new
      radioligands can differentiate two inflammatory conditions-rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and
      idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM)-from healthy conditions. To determine if [11C]MC1
      uptake is specific to COX-2, we will also conduct a blocking study with a selective COX-2
      inhibitor (celecoxib) in both [11C]MC1 and [11C]ER176 scans; celecoxib is expected to block
      uptake of [11C]MC1 but not [11C]ER176. Using brain-dedicated imaging, this seeks to determine
      whether RA patients and healthy volunteers have specific binding in brain - i.e., uptake that
      can be blocked celecoxib.

      II. Study population

      Healthy volunteers (n = 17), patients with RA (n = 15), and patients with IIM (n = 15) will
      undergo whole-body PET/CT. In addition, healthy volunteers (n = 12) and patients with RA (n
      =12) will have brain-dedicated imaging using [11C]MC1 concurrent with arterial blood
      sampling. Finally, 15 patients with RA will be imaged during a period of moderate to severe
      symptoms and after clinically-indicated treatment for two to four months.Thus, the entire
      population will be healthy volunteers (n = 29), patients with RA (n = 42), and patients with
      IIM (n = 15).

      III. Design

        1. Phase 1: We will begin by injecting up to 10 mCi of [11C]MC1 in one healthy male and one
           healthy female and then conducting a whole body PET scan. Uptake will be measured in the
           ovaries and testes, and the dose of radioactivity will be calculated. We will proceed
           only if the dose to these organs with the higher injected activity proposed for Phase 2
           will not exceed the limits specified by the Radioactive Drug Research Committee (RDRC).

        2. Phase 2: Fifteen RA patients, 15 IIM patients, and 15 age-, sex-, and genotypematched
           healthy subjects will undergo two whole-body PET/CT scans using 15 mCi of [11C]ER176 on
           one day and two whole-body PET/CT scans using 15 mCi of [11C]MC1 on another day. The
           first scan on each day will serve as the baseline scan for comparison; the second scan
           on each day will be a blocking study using celecoxib. The [11C]ER176 scans are not
           mandatory and will be requested at the discretion of the PI.

        3. Phase 3: Twelve RA patients and 12 age- and sex-matched healthy subjects will undergo
           two brain-dedicated PET/CT scans, each using 20 mCi [11C]MC1, and concurrent with
           arterial blood sampling. The first scan will be a baseline scan, and the second will be
           after blockade by celecoxib.

        4. Phase 4: Fifteen RA participantstients will be imaged twice with [11C]MC: while having
           moderate to severe symptoms and after clinically-indicated therapy for about two to four
           months. Participants will have can after injection of 15 mCi of [11C]MC1.

      IV. Outcome measures

      For whole body imaging, radioligand uptake in a selected region of interest will be
      quantified as a Standardized Uptake Value (SUV), which normalizes for injected activity and
      body weight. Possible differences in actual blood radioligand level will be adjusted by
      venous blood data obtained during the PET scan. Regional uptake after blockade with celecoxib
      will be expressed as a percentage of the baseline value. The baseline uptake and the
      percentage blockade by celecoxib of each radioligand will be compared between patients and
      healthy subjects as well as between inflamed and non-inflamed regions of the body in RA and
      IIM patients.

      For brain-dedicated imaging, the density of COX-2 will be measured with pharmacokinetic
      modeling and expressed as distribution volume (VT).
