      approved regimens, which include the standard of care (topical steroids, NSAIDs and
      antibiotics) or Intracameral Dexamethasone (Dexycuâ„¢) along with topical NSAIDs and
      antibiotics.

      The hypothesis of the current study is that topical steroids or intracamerally injected
      steroids as slow release vehicles, demonstrate the same efficacy of controlling post cataract
      pain and inflammation. We will assess one objective outcome measure, anterior chamber
      inflammation. This will provide a direct index of the efficacy of the steroidal agents used.
      Furthermore, a subjective outcome measure, ocular pain, will also be assessed. In cases where
      a patient in either of the two groups has sever inflammation, rescue medications will be
      applied, increasing the dosage of topical steroidal agents and the patient will be followed
      closely until resolved.

      The study will include 50 consecutive patients, men and women ages 40 to 90 years old, with
      visually significant cataract that received bilateral cataract surgery using either the
      manual technique or femtosecond assisted cataract surgery. Bilateral surgery is common
      practice and is not performed on the same day. There is a one week time interval between the
      eyes receiving cataract extraction. The patients that we will enroll in the suggested study
      will require and will receive bilateral cataract surgery with one week time interval between
      the two eyes. There are no restrictions on racial or ethnic origin. Employees of The Eye
      Institute of West Florida will not be enrolled into this study.
