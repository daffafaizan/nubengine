      malignancies treated with vinorelbine. II. Assess the toxic effects of this drug in these
      children.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive vinorelbine IV over 6-10 minutes weekly on weeks 1-6. Treatment
      repeats every 8 weeks for a total of 10 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 4 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 1
      year, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 100 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
