      exists specifically in France. Hypoparathyroidism could led to complications: e.g.
      symptomatic hypocalcemia, calcifications (brain, eye and other soft tissues),
      nephrolithiasis/nephrocalcinosis, renal insufficiency. Here,the investigators plan to collect
      data about both epidemiology, medication and complication of hypoparathyroidism in France.
