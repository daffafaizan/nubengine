      characterized by ataxic gait and cerebellar dysarthria that progresses over time with loss of
      ambulation and speech. The mutations by expansions of CAG triplets in the genes ATXN1 (SCA1),
      ATXN 2 (SCA2), 3 (SCA3), CACNA1A (SCA6), ATXN 7 (SCA7), and TBP (SCA17) are responsible for
      50% of hereditary forms There is no curative or preventive treatment. This phase III study is
      a multi-centric, double-blind randomized, two-arm controlled study (one group with 50 mg
      Riluzole twice a day versus one group with placebo), to measure the efficacy of treatment
      with riluzole in SCA2 patients during 12 months. Amelioration is defined by a 1 point
      decrease of the SARA score.
