      to the vagina while minimizing patient discomfort and neurological injury. The data on
      appropriate patient positioning for gynecological vaginal surgery is limited with most
      providers basing the choice between candy cane and boot stirrups on personal preference. This
      study has the following aims:

        -  Aim 1: To perform a randomized controlled trial comparing candy cane stirrups to boot
           stirrups in patients undergoing vaginal surgery with the primary outcome of change in
           physical function at 6 weeks post-op as measured by the Patient-Reported Outcomes
           Measurement and Information System (PROMISÂ®) 20-Item Physical Functioning Short-Form.

        -  Aim 2: The investigators aim to measure the angles at the level of hip, knee and foot
           joints during the surgery in both the candy cane and boot stirrups to assess any
           association between angles and physical function
