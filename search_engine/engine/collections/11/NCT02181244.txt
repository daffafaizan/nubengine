      oatmeal in a crossover design. The investigators hypothesis is that eggs will not increase
      the risk for heart disease in this population when compared to oatmeal but they will more
      likely reduce inflammation due to the presence of the carotenoids, lutein and zeaxanthin that
      are highly available in eggs.

      In this study, the investigators are evaluating three main things

        -  Atherogenic dyslipidemia by measuring plasma lipids and lipoprotein mean size and
           subfractions by nuclear magnetic resonance.

        -  Glucose metabolism by measuring plasma glucose, insulin, insulin resistance and
           glycosylated hemoglobin.

        -  Inflammation by measuring liver enzymes, C reactive protein, tumor necrosis
           factor-alpha, interleukin-6.

      All these measurements were done 24 weeks after completion of the study All data will be
      presented 1 year after completion of the study
