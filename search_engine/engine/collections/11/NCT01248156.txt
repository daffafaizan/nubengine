      AF, so that ablation at these drivers may eliminate AF on long-term followup. The
      investigators will study atrial fibrillation in patients undergoing ablation, to identify
      regions that may be sustaining AF, then ablate at them.

      The study design will be to identify sites that may be maintaining AF, using mapping of AF
      prior to ablation. Once identified, these sites will be targeted for ablated using
      traditional methods. This process will be repeated up to six times. The locations of these
      sites will be recorded, and compared to traditional sites for AF ablation, including the
      pulmonary veins and left atrial roof. They will also be studied for the presence of complex
      fractionated electrograms and high dominant frequency.

      Patients with persistent, long standing persistent, and paroxysmal AF will be included, and
      patients will then be followed for 6-12 months.
