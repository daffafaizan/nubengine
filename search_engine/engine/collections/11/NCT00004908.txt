    
      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the toxicity of autologous peripheral blood stem cell
      transplantation following involved field radiotherapy, high dose cyclophosphamide, and total
      body irradiation in patients with recurrent or refractory Hodgkin's disease or non-Hodgkin's
      lymphoma. II. Determine the response in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo involved field radiotherapy on days -16 to -7. Patients receive
      cyclophosphamide IV over 2 hours on days -6 and -5. Patients undergo total body irradiation
      twice daily on days -4 to -1. Autologous peripheral blood stem cells are reinfused on day 0.
      Patients are followed every month for 1 year.
