      respiratory muscle strength and the ventilator weaning rate. Investigators use the DEMMI and
      FSS-ICU to evaluation the physical functional performance. And MRC score and hand dynamometer
      to record the muscle strength. The weaning parameters include Pi, PE, RSI,minute ventilation,
      tidal volume and cuff leak will be recorded. After the participant enters the Respiration
      Care Center, Doctor and physical therapist evaluate the consciousness and meet the inclusion
      criteria and the participant will received the first evaluation. The second evaluation will
      be held before the ventilator weaning timing.
