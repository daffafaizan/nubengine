    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To demonstrate that the immunogenicity (as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
      [ELISA]) of a single dose of recombinant human papillomavirus bivalent vaccine (Cervarix) in
      9-14 year old girls is non-inferior to the immunogenicity of three doses of quadrivalent
      human papillomavirus (types 6, 11, 16, 18) recombinant vaccine (Gardasil), administered at 0,
      2, and 6 months, in 18-25 year old women 36 months after initial vaccination, with an interim
      analysis at 24 months after initial vaccination.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the distribution of HPV -16 and HPV-18 antibodies levels, assessed at 24 and 36
      months after initial vaccination, following a single dose of Cervarix in 9-14 year old girls
      and three doses of Gardasil, administered at 0, 2, and 6 months, in 18-25 year old women.

      II. To compare rates of seroconversion based on HPV-16 and HPV-18 antibody levels, assessed
      at 24 and 36 months after initial vaccination, following a single dose of Cervarix in 9-14
      year old girls and three doses of Gardasil, administered at 0, 2, and 6 months, in 18-25 year
      old women.

      III. To compare geometric mean titers (GMTs), distributions, and seroconversion rates for
      HPV-16 and HPV-18 antibodies, assessed at 24 and 36 months after initial vaccination,
      following a single dose of Cervarix in 9-11 year old girls and three doses of Gardasil,
      administered at 0, 2, and 6 months, in 18-25 year old women; to perform a similar comparison
      restricting to 12-14 year old girls.

      IV. To compare GMTs, distributions, and seroconversion rates for HPV-16 and HPV-18
      antibodies, assessed at 1-month after vaccination and 1-year after vaccination, following a
      single dose of Cervarix in 9-10 year old girls and a single dose of Cervarix in 11-14 year
      old girls.

      V. To evaluate whether baseline variables (e.g. geographic district, initial antibody levels,
      date of vaccination) are associated with GMTs, distributions, and seroconversion rates for
      HPV16 and HPV-18 antibodies, assessed at 24 and 36 months after initial vaccination.

      OUTLINE: Participants are assigned to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I: Participants 9-14 years old receive Cervarix intramuscularly (IM) at baseline.

      GROUP II: Participants 18-25 years old receive Gardasil IM at baseline and at 2 and 6 months
      in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of trial vaccine dose(s), participants are followed up at 1, 12, 24, and 36
      months.
