      model. This method allows correct quantification of extracellular fluid overload or
      deficiency (normal limits:-1.1 to +1.1L). Patients were assigned to normo and hypervolemic
      groups according to BCM results. Also, normalized calf resistivity (nRho) was calculated from
      resistance at 5 Khz using c-BI and the levels of NT-proBNP were measured in all study
      patients. The analyses of arterial stiffness were performed by using the pulse wave velocity
      (PWV) technique on the patients. All patients underwent conventional echocardiography and
      their left ventricular diastolic functions were evaluated.
