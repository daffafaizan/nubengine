      non-severe IDA. The foods that are rich in Iron include meat and poultry products, egg, green
      leafy vegetables, jaggery, dry fruits etc. Iron in food is of two types viz. haem iron and
      non haem iron. Haem Iron has excellent bioavailability but the bioavailability of the
      non-haem Iron in the food stuffs is considerably affected by the presence of substances like
      phosphates, phytates, tannins and fibres. On the other hand, Ascorbic acid, sugars and other
      acidic substances in the food enhance the iron absorption. The bulk of food consumed by a
      child is too less to provide him with therapeutic amounts of iron form diet alone. In the
      developing countries, the child is quite unlikely to get poultry products and meat as a
      source of haem Iron. If in this situation, the child is provided with food cooked in Iron
      utensil, then it provides additional Iron to meet the increased demand. This will not only be
      cost effective but it will also alter the cooking practices and thereby have a long term
      effect on the iron status of the entire family. Thus it will treat the IDA in the index case
      and will also benefit other family members who may be having borderline or overt iron
      deficiency. This cost effective measure if incorporated in the health policy of the country
      will certainly have widespread positive implications on the health of the general population.
