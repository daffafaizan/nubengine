    
      We will conduct an open label, multi-center study of na√Øve AMD patients that are identified
      early upon disease progression (had a normal VA, FA or OCT within 4 months prior to entry) to
      assess if treating with ranibizumab monthly can restore all patients to their baseline vision
      pre-AMD. Recent randomized clinical trials (MARINA, ANCHOR) have conclusively demonstrated
      that continued intravitreal therapy with ranibizumab in patients with subfoveal CNV from AMD
      leads to stabilization of vision in over 90% of patients and improvement in vision in at
      least a third of the patients and has led to the approval of ranibizumab (0.5 mg) for the
      treatment of neovascular AMD.

      Patients will receive monthly intravitreal ranibizumab injections for 12 months (with dose
      holding for return to baseline/ 20/20 or better and no evidence of fluid on SD-OCT or FA).
      All patients will have ETDRS vision and SD-OCT, and complete exam at each monthly visit.
      Patients will each have a blood analysis for genetics (either during the GALLEY study in
      which they converted to wet AMD and entered COMPASS or during this study).
