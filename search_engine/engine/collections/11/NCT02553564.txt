      patients in the U.S. (35.2%). Investigators recent research has found that approximately 2/3
      of these readmissions are potentially avoidable. Investigators believe that among the causes
      for the excessive number of readmissions, the most important may be that patients usually do
      not receive a clinical assessment upon return to dialysis after a hospitalization. An all too
      common practice in the U.S. is for the nephrologist to not see the patient but to give verbal
      orders to the dialysis nurse to resume previous orders. This increases readmission risk in
      that there are a number of key clinical processes that if completed on return to dialysis
      might greatly reduce rehospitalization risk. Nephrologists are often not available to see
      patients in the peri-discharge period, but there is a trend towards an increasing number of
      U.S. dialysis facilities now having nurse practitioners (NP) working in the units.
      Investigators believe that NPs using a checklist can conduct a post-discharge clinical
      encounter that would allow for key care processes to be carried out and to direct telephone
      communication with the treating nephrologist. Our objective is to reduce the risk of dialysis
      patient readmissions within 30 days through the use of this intervention. Our research
      question is whether this intervention would be effective for reducing 30 day readmission
      risk. Our hypothesis is that the intervention will prove to be more effective then usual care
      for reducing 30 day readmission risk.
