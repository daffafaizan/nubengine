      assisted reproductive technology outcomes. We seek to test, standardize and implement better
      methods for the freezing of oocytes and sperm prior to these techniques being used in the
      clinical setting. We seek to develop new methods to optimize the determination of genes and
      chromosomes in gametes. We hope to develop new cell surgery or micromanipulation techniques
      (e.g. use of cell drills and lasers in order to enhance the efficiency of procedures such as
      ICSI, assisted hatching, biopsy) as well as other manipulations. We will test the safety and
      efficiency of micro fluidics and automation in the Embryology lab. This has the potential to
      reduce cost, human errors, temperature and physical changes. We hope to develop new methods
      and media and media supplements normally found in the reproductive tract that allow for
      higher survival of gametes in vitro. We will also test the proficiency of laboratory staff
      members on techniques and/or procedures performed in the in-vitro fertilization laboratory.
      We will perform Quality Control to review how changes in temperature and setting can effect
      specimens
