      I. Assess the treatment success rate of Bevacizumab in patients with relapsed or refractory
      B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).

      II. Assess the toxicity associated with this regimen in patients with relapsed or refractory
      CLL

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess sensitivity to apoptosis/cell death of residual B-cell clone during therapy (e.g.
      is treatment selecting out a resistant clone).

      II. Evaluate if the risk stratification parameters (ie immunoglobulin mutational, ZAP-70,
      FISH defects and /or CD38 status) corresponds to both baseline apoptosis/cell death and the
      rates of apoptosis of CLL B-cells when cultured with Bevacizumab.

      III. Examine if Bevacizumab can be synergistic with other chemotherapeutic drugs such as
      chlorambucil or fludarabine.

      IV. Assess if marrow vascularity is increased at entry to study and if it is modulated
      following therapy with Bevacizumab.

      V. Examine the association of VEGF plasma levels at baseline with clinical responses to
      Bevacizumab.

      VI. Examine the levels of VCAM at entry to the study and during treatment with Bevacizumab.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on
      days 1 and 15.

      Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 5 years.
