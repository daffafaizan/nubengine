      and anti-inflammatory effects of the NK-R1 coadministered with ritonavir-containing
      antiretroviral therapy in individuals with well-controlled viral replication.

      Our hypothesis is that Aprepitant will be safe, well tolerated, and will have
      anti-inflammatory properties when administered concomitantly with the protease inhibitor
      ritonavir. The study will recruit 12 participants receiving either darunavir/ritonavir or
      atazanavir/ritonavir
