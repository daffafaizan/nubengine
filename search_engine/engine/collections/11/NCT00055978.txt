        -  Determine the feasibility of chemoprevention of lung cancer with celecoxib in former
           heavy smokers at risk for developing primary or second primary lung cancer.

        -  Determine the safety and side effects of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the quality of life of patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the role of COX-2-specific inhibitors (e.g., celecoxib) on antitumor immunity
           within the lung microenvironment of these patients.

        -  Determine the effects of COX-2 inhibition on angiogenesis in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Patients are
      stratified according to presence of preinvasive lesions (yes vs no). Patients are randomized
      to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral placebo twice daily for 6 months.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral celecoxib twice daily for 6 months. Treatment in both arms
           continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed every 6 months during treatment and then annually for up to 4
      years.

      Patients are followed annually for up to 4 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 180 patients (90 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
