    
      AV7909 is a new vaccine which is a combination of BioThrax (also called anthrax vaccine,
      adsorbed or AVA), a FDA-licensed vaccine, and CPG 7909. CPG 7909 is a synthetic short DNA
      sequence that has been shown to be an effective vaccine adjuvant, and one which increases the
      speed and the degree of the immune response to Protective Antigen (PA), the major vaccine
      antigen. In the current study, the safety, tolerability, and antibody response to PA will be
      studied for four different combinations of AVA and CPG 7909, and compared to both AVA and a
      saline placebo. All formulations of AV7909 have the same or less AVA than the licensed AVA
      vaccine and all have less CPG 7909 per dose than the formulation used in the first Phase I
      volunteer study of CPG 7909 combined with AVA.
