      Primary

        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose of vorinostat when added to the standard regimen
           of bortezomib and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride in patients with
           relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.

        -  To identify the dose-limiting toxicities of this regimen in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  To gain preliminary evidence of antitumor activity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  To assess the degree of proteasome inhibition achieved with this regimen in these
           patients.

        -  To evaluate the accumulation of acetylated alpha-tubulin after treatment with
           vorinostat.

        -  To evaluate overall survival, time to progression, and progression-free survival of
           patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose escalation study of vorinostat.

      Patients receive oral vorinostat once daily on days 1,2; 4,5; 8, 9; 11, 12; bortezomib IV on
      days 1, 4, 8, and 11, and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride IV on day 4. Courses
      repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Blood samples are collected periodically for proteasome inhibition assays and acetylated
      alpha-tubulin studies.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 1 and 3 months.
