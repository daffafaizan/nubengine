    
      This is a multicenter, prospective, randomized study to be conducted in 18 centers in Europe.
      A total of 200 subjects will be entered into the study and will be randomized on a 1:1 basis
      to either balloon angioplasty or the CYPHER SELECTTM + Coronary and Infrapopliteal Stent for
      infrapopliteal use in subjects with symptomatic peripheral artery disease (Rutherford 3, 4,
      or 5).

      All subjects will undergo a repeat angiography at 12 months to assess the primary endpoint of
      In-Segment Binary Restenosis. Follow-up visits are scheduled at 6 weeks, 6 and 12 months.
