      age groups. The Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) is now 800 IU for older adults over the age
      of 70, and the Tolerable Upper Level (UL) is 4000 IU daily. Canadians are known to have an
      inadequate vitamin D status, and older institutionalized adults are particularly susceptible
      to this. One strategy to correct this is to fortify more kinds of foods with vitamin D. We
      have already demonstrated that we can get vitamin D into cheddar cheese and it is as
      biologically available as vitamin D in the liquid supplement.

      This new project aims to optimize the fortification process and deliver all of the vitamin D
      into cheddar cheese, and to measure its bioavailability and related changes in well-being
      during winter. We will assess the well being of the older institutionalized adults by
      administering the SF-36v2 health survey.
