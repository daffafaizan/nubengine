      that informs patients about their colonoscopy procedure, alerts them when to take their
      medications throughout the hours-long colonoscopy prep process and tells them when to arrive
      to the endoscopy suite. The investigators designed a study to determine if this app will
      yield improved colonoscopy cleanouts, better patient understanding of the procedure, fewer
      calls to the GI service and more punctual arrival times to the endoscopy suite compared to
      patients who receive written instructions that do not actively interact with the patient
      before, during or after their colonoscopy prep.
