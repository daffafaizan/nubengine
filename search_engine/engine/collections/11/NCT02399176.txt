      given an entry DEXA scan and a DVD with instructions to advance from beginner versions of 12
      Iyengar-style yoga poses to more advanced levels in daily practice for 2 years. fter two
      years or more, subsequent DEXA scans are recorded. Interested participants are also
      encouraged to have hip and spine X-rays, and bone quality studies on study entry and two
      years later. Actual subject participation, intercurrent illnesses, fractures and changes in
      medication are self-monitored with an on line scorecard, supplemented by emails and/or
      telephone calls when judged necessary by the PI. Results are calculated by change in bone
      mineral density in the lumbar spine, hips and femurs by the DEXA scan, changes in
      osteoarthritis according to the X-rays, and changes in bone quality before and two or more
      years after beginning the ten minutes of daily yoga. Dose-response relationships between the
      amount and intensity of yoga practice and bone mineral density and quality are sought.
      Yoga-related fractures and other adverse effects are also noted.
