      Indeed, people who suffer knee pain, mostly due to osteoarthritis, require analgesic
      treatment, often with some secondary effects. Therefore, the research to find a natural and
      efficient product to reduce knee pain in a short period of time, facilitating recovery after
      exercise and without side effects have an interest both for industry and for the general
      population.

      B-turmactive is an extract of Curcuma longa mixing two fractions in a single product: a)
      soluble fraction free-curcuminoids but rich in polysaccharides and b) curcuminoids fraction
      with cyclodextrin. Both fractions plus vitamin C are B-turmactive.

      Previous preclinical studies suggest that B-turmactive could exert an acute effect in healthy
      people that suffer mild or moderate knee pain and, furthermore could reduce inflammation
      process.

      Therefore, the goal of this study is to assess the short (acute) effect of B-Turmactive (one
      week treatment) both on mild/moderate knee pain
