      tAN in newborns with NOWS receiving oral morphine allows for faster weaning of morphine and
      decrease morphine use altogether. After obtaining parental consent, tAN is delivered to the
      left ear in NOWS newborns who are on a stable morphine dose for >12h (control dose), using a
      disposable, multi-channel (Channel1: auricular branch of the vagus nerve (ABVN); Channel2:
      ATN) earpiece electrode (Spark Biomedical, Inc). 30-minutes of tAN is delivered one hour
      prior to scheduled morphine dose, up to four times daily for up to 12 days. The device is
      programmed to a pulse width of 250ms; channel 1: 5 Hz, mean intensity 0.3±0.2 milliamps (mA);
      channel 2: 100 Hz, mean intensity 0.6±0.2 mA. Nurses score the Finnegan Neonatal Abstinence
      Scoring Tool (FNAST) every 3h after feeding and morphine is weaned every 12h if FNAST scores
      <8.
