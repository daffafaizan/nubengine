    
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, fixed-dosed study evaluating
      the efficacy and safety of two doses of SEP-363856 (50 and 75 mg/day) versus placebo over a
      6-week Treatment Period in acutely psychotic subjects with schizophrenia. This study is
      projected to randomize approximately 435 subjects (18-65 years) to 3 treatment groups
      (SEP-363856 50 mg/day, SEP-363856 75 mg/day, or placebo) in a 1:1:1 ratio. In addition, the
      study will randomize approximately 90 adolescent subjects (13-17 years) in a 1:1:1 ratio to
      the 3 treatment groups (with approximately 30 subjects per group) in a separate cohort.
      Treatment assignment will be stratified by country. Study drug will be taken once a day and
      may be taken with or without food.

      This study is designed to test the hypothesis that, treatment with SEP-363856 in adult
      subjects with schizophrenia will result in significantly greater reduction (i.e. improvement)
      in PANSS total score and CGI-S score at Week 6 from Baseline when compared to placebo. The
      overall Type I error is controlled for two hierarchical families of hypotheses. The first
      family includes hypotheses about the testing of change from Baseline in PANSS total score at
      Week 6 between each of the SEP-363856 dose levels vs. placebo. The second family of
      hypotheses are about the testing of change from Baseline in CGI-S score at Week 6 between
      each of the SEP-363856 dose levels vs. placebo.
