    
      Schizophrenia is a disabling mental disorder that affects approximately 1% of the population
      worldwide. People with schizophrenia frequently experience hallucinations, delusions,
      disordered thinking, movement disorders, emotional numbness, social withdrawal, and cognitive
      deficits. These symptoms can hinder a person's ability to perform everyday functions, such as
      hold a job and maintain normal social relationships. When combined with medication,
      family-oriented therapy interventions have been beneficial for people with schizophrenia.
      There are few programs, however, that are tailored to the needs of minorities. With the
      rising number of minority populations in the U.S., it is important to develop psychotherapy
      interventions that are designed specifically for these groups. This study will evaluate the
      effectiveness of a culturally based family therapy intervention in improving treatment
      outcome in people with schizophrenia.

      Participants in this 12-month, open label study will first attend a 2-hour screening visit,
      at which information will be gathered regarding coping styles, spirituality, and expressed
      emotion. Participants will then be randomly assigned to receive either culturally based
      therapy or treatment as usual. Although the culturally based therapy will be tailored to the
      needs and values of Hispanics, people who are not Hispanic will not be excluded. The
      culturally based therapy will entail 15 weekly therapy sessions, which will focus on family
      unity, psychoeducation, spirituality, communication skills, and problem-solving. The group
      receiving treatment as usual will attend 3 weekly psychoeducation sessions that will focus on
      informing participants about schizophrenia. Outcomes for both groups will be assessed upon
      completion of treatment and at follow-up visits at Months 6 and 12.
