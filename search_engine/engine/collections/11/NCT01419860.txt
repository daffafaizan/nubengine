      elective surgical operation. All types of colon resection were carried out according to
      standard procedures. Guidelines for preoperative examination according to NGICG (Norwegian
      Gastro-Intestinal Cancer Group) to grade the disease, select the most suitable patients and
      plan further treatment.

      Microcirculation of colon wall was assessed by dynamic
      laser-induced-fluorescence-videoangiography (IC-VIEW, PULSION Medical Systems AG, Munich,
      Germany) of indocyanine green (ICG). ICG is a water-soluble tricarbocyanine dye that binds
      strongly to plasma proteins after intravenous injection and is exclusively distributed in
      intravascular space. Additionally this system houses a laser (energy Pi = 0.16 W, wavelength
      = 780 nm) that causes excitation/illumination of the fluorescence light from intravascular
      plasma bound ICG. This light has a spectral range near-infrared energy (NIR) with a maximum
      at 805 nm and emits fluorescence at 835 nm. It passes through infrared filter on a digital
      video camera and results in recording of real time fluorescent image from perfusion of plasma
      bound ICG within small plexus of blood vessels in the bowel wall. Besides that it also
      demonstrates perfusion from surrounding structures such as appendix epiploic and pericolic
      fat. The maximum penetration of the laser into tissue is 3-5 mm and general normal thickness
      of colon wall is 3-5 mm. This method makes it a presentable tracer for tissue perfusion of
      anterior bowel wall.
