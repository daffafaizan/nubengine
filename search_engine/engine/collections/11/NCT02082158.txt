      comparing scores on a survey tool which measures comfort and tolerability of respiratory
      protective devices. Study participants will be clinical healthcare workers who have
      experience wearing respiratory protective devices in their workplace. We will enroll up to
      400 participants in the study, made up of physicians, nurses, nursing assistants and other
      healthcare employees who have previously been fit-tested to a N95 respirator. Subjects will
      be screened to determine eligibility and must pass fit-testing on the respirator he/she is
      randomized to. Participants will wear the respirator while performing a series of motions
      that simulate movements made by healthcare workers when performing patient care tasks. There
      will be no contact with patients during participation. Feedback via validated survey tool
      will be collected from all study participants on the comfort and tolerability of the
      respirator worn.
