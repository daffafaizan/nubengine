      recalcitrant wounds, improve flap and graft survival, and even reduce the likelihood of
      ulceration. Electrical stimulation has been suggested to reduce infection, improve cellular
      immunity, increase perfusion, relieve pain, improve plantar sensation, and accelerate wound
      healing.

      Electrical stimulation could have positive effect on not only increasing skin perfusion in
      patients with diabetes but also could improve mobility and balance via enhancing plantar
      sensation as demonstrated in our recent study. Thus, plantar stimulation not only may be
      beneficial to accelerate wound healing in diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) patients but also may
      assist to improve mobility and reduce the likelihood of recurrence of ulcers.

      This study is proposed to examine the effectiveness of an innovative portable electrical
      stimulation platform (Tennant Biomodulator by AVAZZIA) to accelerate wound healing in DFU
      patients. It is hypothesized that 1) electrical stimulation will have an immediate effect on
      increasing skin perfusion (immediate benefit) and 2) daily use of the Tennant Biomodulator
      for 4 consecutive weeks is effective to speed up wound healing, increase skin perfusion,
      reduce pain, and improve balance and mobility in DFU patients (long term benefit)
