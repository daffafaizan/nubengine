      two different schedules: once every 3 weeks (Q3) and then once weekly for 3 weeks.

      The dose escalation follows a 3 + 3 design.

      The Data Review Team may expand any dose level or intermediate dose level that has been
      deemed safe and resulted in at least one subject with a Composite Complete Remission (CRc).
      An expansion cohort may enroll up to 15 subjects.
