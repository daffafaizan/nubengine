      physiotherapy and in the field of sports. In the bibliography we find a multitude of
      stretches and procedures described, some of them being similar to neurodynamic tests, which
      could direct their effect to a neural and not a musculoskeletal structure. The structural
      differentiation manoeuvre has been shown to be able to discriminate the increase in tension
      on the nerve.

      Objective: To evaluate the short-term efficacy on ischiosural muscle elongation of three
      modalities of ischiosural stretching according to neural or muscular involvement, in subjects
      without previous pathology.

      Design: Cross sectional study.
