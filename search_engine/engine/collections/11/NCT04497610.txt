    
      BioSafety Technologies has developed a rapid detection test to clear people of COVID-19.

      A person can undergo an easy non-invasive test, to determine if they are: COVID-19 Clear
      (Negative) or Infected (Positive). The user-friendly process does not involve medically
      trained personnel.

      The study will compare TeraSystem test results against PCR test results. Persons
      participating will be persons having a PCR test as part of the Health System and consenting
      to participate.
