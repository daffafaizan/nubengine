      The first phase assesses single ascending doses for EDP-514 (active drug or placebo) in
      healthy subjects. A "fasted" and "fed" two-part cohort will also assess food effect.

      The second phase assesses multiple ascending doses (active drug or placebo) for 14 days in
      healthy subjects.

      Each cohort within each phase will enroll a total of 8 subjects who will be randomized to
      receive EDP-514 or placebo. The cohort assessing food effect will enroll 10 subjects
      randomized to receive EDP-514 or placebo.

      Part 2 assesses multiple ascending doses EDP-514 (active drug or placebo) for 28 days in
      nucleos(t)ide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NUC)-Suppressed Patients with Chronic
      Hepatitis B Virus Infection.

      Each cohort in Part 2 will enroll a total of 8 subjects who will be randomized to receive
      EDP-514 or placebo.
