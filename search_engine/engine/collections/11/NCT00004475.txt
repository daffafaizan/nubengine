      recurrent in nature and occurs in blood-related persons over two or more generations. It is
      an autosomal dominant trait with complete penetrance by variable expression. Symptoms are
      usually present during childhood and it is the second most common cause of chronic or
      recurrent pancreatitis in children. HP is a primary disorder and can therefore be
      differentiated from other inherited disorders that cause secondary pancreatitis. The purpose
      of this study is to establish linkage in families with HP between the phenotype and a
      chromosomal locus (loci) which contains the responsible gene. Affected families are recruited
      to donate a blood sample through referral from their primary physician or self-referral. The
      potential significance lies in the identification of the genetic defect causing HP and
      understanding the pathophysiologic mechanism of the disease. Typically families with HP have
      a high incidence of adenocarcinoma of the pancreas and identification of the cause of this
      disease may provide critical insights into the cause of pancreatic cancer.

      Blood samples are collected from patients and family members. DNA is extracted from the blood
      and used for genotypic analysis and linkage analysis. Patients do not necessarily receive the
      results of the genetic testing and the results do not influence the type or duration of
      treatment.
