      I. Percent change in number of rectal aberrant cryptic foci (ACF) as measured by
      magnification chromoendoscopy

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Screening for possible phase III testing II. Effects on proliferation (Ki67 expression)
      and apoptosis (caspase-3 expression) as measured by biopsy samples obtained from
      normal-appearing rectal mucosa at baseline and after completion of study treatment III.
      Correlation of endoscopic features with histologic characteristics of rectal ACF IV.
      Observation of the natural history of rectal ACF in patients receiving placebo V. Adverse
      events VI. Utilization of a biospecimen repository archive

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, prospective, randomized, partially blinded,
      placebo-controlled study. Patients are stratified according to history of prior surgical
      resection of the colon (yes vs no) and number of rectal aberrant cryptic foci (ACF) (5-9 vs
      >= 10). Patients are randomized to 1 of 4 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive oral atorvastatin calcium once daily.

      ARM II: Patients receive oral sulindac twice daily.

      ARM III (blinded arm): Patients receive oral oligofructose-enriched inulin (Raftilose Synergy
      1) twice daily.

      ARM IV (blinded arm): Patients receive an oral placebo twice daily.

      In all arms, treatment continues for 6 months in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      Tissue samples are collected at baseline and at the completion of study treatment. Tissue is
      examined by immunohistochemistry for proliferation (Ki67) and apoptosis (cleaved caspase-3).

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at approximately 30 days.
