      admitted into a Level I trauma center, between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2016.
      According to the femoral fracture locations, 3859 adult patients with 4011 fracture sites
      were grouped into five subgroups: proximal type A (n = 1,359), proximal type B (n= 1,487),
      proximal type C (n = 59), femoral shaft (n = 640), and distal femur (n = 466) groups. A
      multivariate logistic regression analysis was applied to identify independent effects of the
      univariate predictive variables on the occurrence of fracture at a specific site. The
      propensity score accounts for the risk of a fracture at a specific femoral site was
      calculated and presented visually with age in a two-dimensional plot.
