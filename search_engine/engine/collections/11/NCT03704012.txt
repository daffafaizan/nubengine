      intrauterine development and of the continuous contact with their parents. It has and adverse
      effect on both psychological and biological development of the child.

      Knowledge of these factors has led many neonatal units to begin to introduce therapeutic
      massage protocols to facilitating satisfactory neuromotor and anthropometric development of
      preterm infants.

      In this study, premature newborns were assigned to one of two groups:

      A: Control Group. B: Massage and kinesiotherapy Group, 15 minutes twice a day.
