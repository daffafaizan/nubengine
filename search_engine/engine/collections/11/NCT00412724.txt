      Washington DC area. Participants will be asked to rate their impression on the foods that
      they were eating in the past two weeks. Fifty participants will be chosen at random and asked
      to complete the questionnaire a second time, three weeks later, to assess reliability.
      Ratings will be used to assess the validity and reliability of the Food Acceptability
      Questionnaire (FAQ).
