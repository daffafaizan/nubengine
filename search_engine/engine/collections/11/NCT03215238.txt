      mechanical ventilation it reflect fluid responsiveness which is a surrogate endpoint of
      intravascular volume.

      PVI signal appears to have significant baseline variability which can not be explained by
      rapid changes in intravascular fluid volume. The baseline PVI changes also appear to
      oscillate at a very low frequency, much below any previously identified spontaneous vascular
      oscillations.

      The aim of this study is to investigate weather the PVI variability originates from changes
      in the infrared photoplethysmography signal or if they are possibly due to the algorithm
      calculating PVI.
