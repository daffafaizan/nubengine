      the estimated mortality rate by 2030 will be in the fourth place. Estimated global prevalence
      of COPD in the population over age 40 is about 9-10% of the population. In Taiwan, the
      prevalence is about 16%. COPD is characteristic of irreversible airflow obstruction due to
      the pathological changes in the small airways, lung parenchyma and pulmonary vessels with
      chronic inflammation of the specific immune cells, as well as structural changes.

      Although studies have suggested that exercise training in patients with COPD benefit the
      physical activity, but the anti-inflammatory benefits is unknown.Consider individual needs,
      this study will use the home mobile coach from Dr. Liu domestic development program to
      further investigate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients after receiving this
      training program,performance and analysis in the clinical laboratory to explore
      anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory between relevance and mechanisms in patients with COPD
      under real-time wearable devices monitoring
