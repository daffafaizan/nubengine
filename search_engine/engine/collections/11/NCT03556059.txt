    
      All patients in Germany, who underwent Sleeve Gastrectomy, Roux-en Y Gastric Bypass and
      Mini/One anastomosis Gastric Bypass as a primary procedure for severe obesity, are
      prospectively registered in the German register StuDoQ MBE.

      Preoperative EOSS by Sharma et al. will be applied to all patients, who were operated between
      Februar 2015 and July 2017 by two different evaluators. Data collection will include the
      following: gender, age, body mass index, mobility, comorbidities, ASA score (American Society
      of Anesthesiologists score) perioperative complications next to Clavien Dindo, readmission
      rates and 30 - day mortality. Follow-up will be investigated in all patients up to 1 month
      after surgery.

      Complications, readmission rates and 30 day mortality will be investigated in relation to
      EOSS and the surgical procedure performed, to determine whether EOSS could be an indicator
      for procedure selection in obesity and metabolic surgery.
