      to failure of heart to deliver oxygen at a rate commensurate with the requirements of the
      metabolizing tissues, despite normal filling pressures (or only at the expense of increased
      filling pressures). And according to the nature of the clinical presentation, HF is divided
      into acute or chronic HF.

      In 2003, a random sample survey of 15,518 urban or rural residents between 35 and 74 years
      old was made in China: the prevalence rate of heart failure was 0.9%, and according to the
      result, there was about 4,000,000 HF subjects in China.

      In China, the integrative treatment of western and traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) for HF
      is common and has been developed as a treatment model. TCM has been used in China and other
      south and east Asia countries for thousands of years. Syndrome differentiation and treatment
      variation are the basic principles in understanding and treatment of diseases. Investigators
      would like to test the hypothesis that it is efficacy and safety for patients to take TCM
      granules according to syndrome differentiation.

      The specific aims for the study were to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TCM in treating
      chronic heart failure (CHF).
