    
      This is an open-label, non-randomized, multicenter Phase II study designed to evaluate tumor
      response rates in patients with surgically unresectable and/or metastatic esophageal,
      esophagogastric, and gastric adenocarcinoma or squamous carcinoma. Study schema is as
      follows. Patients will receive Irinotecan and Cisplatin on days 1 and 8 every 21 days for a
      maximum of 6 cycles of therapy. This is then followed by ZD 1839 (Iressa), which is an oral
      pill taken once daily. During the Iressa phase, patients will be evaluated every 6 weeks.
      This includes labs, CT scans and physical examination. The exploratory objective of the study
      is to examine the correlation between epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression and
      radiographic response to treatment.
