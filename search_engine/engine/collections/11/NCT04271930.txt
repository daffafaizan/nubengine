    
      This randomized controlled study will evaluate the feasibility of implementing a mindfulness
      intervention targeting inpatient autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT)
      recipients (first HCT) with multiple myeloma (MM) and the preliminary efficacy of Mindfulness
      Awareness Practices for Insomnia (MAP-I) vs. sleep health education (SHE) to improve insomnia
      outcomes, cellular and transcriptomic markers of inflammation, and insomnia associated
      behavioral symptoms (depression, fatigue).

      Patients enrolled in this study will be randomized to either receive MAP-I or SHE starting
      2-4 weeks prior to HCT. Patients will receive two sessions prior to inpatient admission for
      HCT, and four sessions in the two weeks of hospitalization following HCT, for a total of six
      intervention (or control) sessions.

      Primary Objective: Determine the feasibility of implementing MAP-I among HCT recipients under
      first autologous HCT for MM.
