    
      If you agree to take part in this study, you will take part in a face-to-face interview with
      the study staff. It should take about 1 hour to complete. You will also be asked to complete
      a questionnaire about your demographic information such as age and ethnicity. The interview
      will be done in a private research area and will be audio-recorded.

      The researchers are interested in learning more about your experience of adjusting to the
      changes in your appearance after your surgery for head and neck cancer. You may be asked to
      look in a mirror and describe what you see.

      If you ask for another interview, or if the interviewer would like your information made more
      clear, you will be scheduled for a second interview. You will be provided with an early
      summary of your interview, and you will be able to provide feedback over the phone or in
      writing on the accuracy of the information and the conclusions.

      Identifying information will be removed from all data collected using participant numbers
      kept separately from consent forms and shared only among approved research staff. Names and
      other identifying information will be deleted from transcripts (write-ups of the interviews)
      after the first review for accuracy. Interview transcripts will be kept in locked file
      cabinets at MD Anderson for 3 years and can be looked at only by the study chair and staff.
      Recorded interviews will be destroyed 3 years after the study results are published.

      This is an investigational study.

      Up to 20 patients and 15 healthcare providers will take part in this study. All will be
      enrolled at MD Anderson.
