    
      The primary objective of this study is to investigate the maximum tolerated dose of ABI-009,
      an mTOR inhibitor, when given sequentially with nivolumab in advanced Ewing's sarcoma,
      PEComa, epithelioid sarcoma, desmoid tumor, chordoma, non-small cell lung cancer, small cell
      lung cancer, urethelial carcinoma, melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma of
      head and neck, hepatocellular carcinoma, classical Hodgkin's lymphoma, MSI-H/dMMR metastatic
      colorectal cancer, and tumors with genetic mutations sensitive to mTOR inhibitors

      The secondary objectives are to investigate the disease control rate (DCR) and progression
      free survival (PFS) using nivolumab/ABI-009 combination therapy in advanced Ewing's sarcoma,
      PEComa, epithelioid sarcoma, desmoid tumor, chordoma, non-small cell lung cancer, small cell
      lung cancer, urethelial carcinoma, melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma of
      head and neck, hepatocellular carcinoma, classical Hodgkin's lymphoma, MSI-H/dMMR metastatic
      colorectal cancer, and tumors with genetic mutations sensitive to mTOR inhibitors

      The exploratory objectives are (1) To correlate progression free survival (PFS) based on
      Immune-related Response Criteria (irRECIST) with that based on RECIST v1.1, and (2) To
      correlate PFS with PD-1 and PD-L1 expression in patients' tumors.
