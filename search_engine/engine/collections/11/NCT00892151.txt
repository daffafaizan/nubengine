      information at home to lay people with diabetes and their healthcare professionals to manage
      their diabetes. The study evaluated the subjects' success using the software program with a
      blood glucose meter to perform specific tasks, such as uploading the meter results, changing
      program and meter settings, and displaying reports. The study also evaluated the system's
      ease of use and the acceptability of product labeling.
