      Center for Women's Health and Planned Parenthood Columbia Willamette in Portland, OR. Every
      participant will still receive the standard oral medication for pain (ibuprofen) and anxiety
      (lorazepam). Eligible subjects will be at least 18 years of age, less than 11 weeks pregnant
      and have already decided to have a surgical abortion.

      The primary outcome evaluated will be pain reported at time of cervical dilation. The
      investigators will assess pain at various time points (including secondary outcomes)
      immediately upon completion of the respective step and pain and satisfaction 30 minutes
      postoperatively.
