      Spanning Kit and Damage Control Kit)

      Sponsor: Zimmer Biomet

      Study Design: Prospective enrollment, prospective follow-up, single cohort study

      Clinical Phase: Postmarket

      Number of Sites: Up to three sites

      Study Duration per Subject: Subjects will be enrolled in the study until the time of exchange
      of their FastFrame Kit to another device. Typically, this exchange occurs 2-4 weeks after
      injury.

      Primary Objective: The objective of this observational, prospective study is to confirm
      safety and performance of the FastFrame External Fixation System and corresponding
      instrumentation.

      Primary Endpoint: Frequency and incidence of device-related adverse events and device
      deficiencies before the FastFrame External Fixation System is exchanged by another device
      (i.e. plates, screws, etc.).

      Secondary Endpoint: Adverse events that occur between application of the FastFrame External
      Fixation System and exchange with another device that do not fall within the primary
      endpoint.
