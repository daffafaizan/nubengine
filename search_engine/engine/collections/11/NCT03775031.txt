      chemical peels to wound skin, and thereby elicit a change in IGF-1. Our hypothesis is that
      fractional non ablative laser and a TCA chemical peel can induce similar effects as the
      fractional ablative laser at three months. In other words, our theory is that these
      approaches can stimulate the production of IGF-1 in older skin and restore UV damage repair
      and response mechanisms.
