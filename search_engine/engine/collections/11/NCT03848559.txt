      microgravity during spaceflight is obtained by using a submerged model. Full-torso manikins
      is going to be used for performing airway management. Each diver attempted airway management
      with each device (laryngeal mask, laryngeal tube, orotracheal intubation with video-assisted
      laryngoscope. The time for airway protection will be measured as well as the success rate.
