    
      Rationale:

      Cardiovascular events are the leading cause of death among patients with diabetes. Early
      identification of high-risk diabetic (DM) patients for intensification of preventive therapy
      may prevent cardiovascular events.

      Aims:

      Among biomarker (N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, NT-proBNP)-identified high-risk
      type 2 DM patients without pre-existing cardiovascular disease, to test if intensive
      preventive therapy (high dose renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors [RAASi],
      beta-blockade, sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors [SGLT2i]) may be associated with
      reduced cardiovascular events compared to standard of care.

      Design:

      Prospective multinational randomized open-label, parallel group, active-controlled, two-arm,
      long-term morbidity and mortality trial involving 5 Asian regions (Singapore, Malaysia,
      China, Taiwan, India; estimated 6 sites each) with patients followed for 2 years.

      Population:

      Adults with type 2 DM without known cardiovascular disease (defined as known coronary
      stenosis > 70%, reduced left ventricular ejection fraction < 40%, or a history of myocardial
      infarction/coronary revascularization/heart failure hospitalization/stroke/prior
      non-traumatic lower limb amputation or angioplasty) and with NT-proBNP > 125 pg/mL

      Duration:

      The goal is to include approximately 2,400 patients. It is estimated that about 3,000
      patients with NT-proBNP > 125pg/mL have to be screened. The screen failure rate, for reasons
      other than NT-proBNP, is anticipated to be approximately 20%. The observation period is
      planned to last for two years. However, the trial is event driven and will continue until
      predefined event rate is reached (see sample size calculation). The total trial duration is
      expected to last for four years (two years of recruitment and a two-year observation period
      after last patient in). Every patient will remain in the study for two years after
      randomization.

      Visits:

      Visit 1:

      Pre- Screening

      Patients who fulfil the first three pre-screening criteria will proceed for NT-proBNP
      Point-of-Care (POC) testing:

        -  Type 2 diabetes for at least 6 months (ADA definition)

        -  Informed consent

        -  Check Inclusion/exclusion criteria

        -  NT-proBNP (assessed through local point of care device) *If the results for NT-proBNP
           fall > 125pg/mL, the patients will proceed for Full-Screening.
