      (Arsenol Â®) (5-10mg per day, from days 1-7 per cycle), ascorbic acid (1g per day, from days 1
      - 7 per cycle) plus azacitidine (75mg/m2 per day subcutaneously, from days 1 to 3 per cycle).
      Each cycle of oral-As2O3 plus azacitidine will be given once every 28 days. The total
      duration of treatment is 12 months (12 cycles). Treatment will be day-care and outpatient
      based. Reduction in the dosage and duration of oral-As2O3 is required if the subject is
      experiencing adverse events (AEs). In case of grade 3 or above toxicity, the dosage of
      oral-As2O3 will be reduced to 5mg per day. Changes or interruption in dosages, their dates
      and time points will be recorded on the dosage administration record and the electronic case
      report form (eCRF).
