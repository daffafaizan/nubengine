    
      A comparative study of structural and functional arterial properties after an ischaemic
      stroke or an acute coronary syndrome

      Objectives:

      Primary:

        -  To determine whether there is a difference in the biomechanical properties of the
           carotid arteries, assessed by studying their stiffness, after an acute vascular event,
           depending on whether the event is an ischaemic stroke (either a full stroke or a
           transitory ischaemic attack (TIA)) or an acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

      Secondary:

        -  To determine whether there is a difference in aortic stiffness and brachial endothelial
           function after an acute vascular event, depending on whether the event is an ischaemic
           stroke (full stroke or TIA) or an ACS.

        -  To compare the blood pressure (BP) levels and the vascular parameters of the two patient
           groups (the ischaemic stroke group and the ACS group).

        -  To determine whether there is a difference between the respiratory parameters recorded
           during sleep after an acute vascular event, depending on whether the event is an
           ischaemic stroke (full stroke or TIA) or an ACS.
