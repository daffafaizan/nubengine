      Primary

        -  Estimate the proportion of patients with previously treated metastatic or unresectable
           clear cell carcinoma of the kidney who are progression free (complete response [CR],
           partial response [PR], or stable disease [SD]) at 3 months after treatment with
           everolimus and imatinib mesylate.

      Secondary

        -  Estimate median time to progression in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the proportion of patients whose best overall response are CR, PR, SD, or
           progressive disease.

        -  Evaluate the mean and range of the maximum percent reduction in tumor size.

        -  Describe the toxicities of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate and oral everolimus once daily beginning on day 1 and
      continuing in the absence of disease progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 43 patients will be accrued for this study.
