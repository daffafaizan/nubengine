      long-standing period of extremely low blood supply to the retina caused by atherosclerosis of
      the carotid arteries. In this study we will analyze why OIS is developed in some patients and
      not developed in others. The patients with OIS will be thorough examined and will be compared
      with 1) a control group of healthy people and 2) with control group of patients with diabetic
      retinopathy. Furthermore the impact of vascular surgery on OIS will be analyzed.
