    
      SNDX-275-0130 is a Phase 1, two-cohort, open-label, drug-drug interaction study of entinostat
      and exemestane. All patients will be enrolled into one of two cohorts to receive either
      entinostat monotherapy followed by entinostat plus exemestane (Cohort 1), or exemestane
      monotherapy followed by exemestane plus entinostat (Cohort 2).

      The cohorts will enroll sequentially, meaning that Cohort 1 will enroll prior to Cohort 2.
      Cohort 1 will evaluate exemestane's effect on the PK of entinostat. Cohort 2 will evaluate
      entinostat's effect on the PK of exemestane. In both Cohorts, each treatment cycle will be 28
      days. Patients will participate in only one cohort.

      All patients will be assessed at Screening and at specified times during the conduct of the
      study using standard clinical and laboratory assessment. Patients will also be assessed for
      tumor response per standard of care after the Screening Period. Response to treatment will be
      assessed by computerized tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and bone scans as
      appropriate. Patients will continue receiving their appropriate cycles of study treatment
      until tumor progression or adverse events (AEs) occur which necessitate discontinuing therapy
      as determined by the Investigator.
