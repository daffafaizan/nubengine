      of Mahidol University, Siriraj hospital, and community at Phuttamonthon area (n = 39).

      They will be diagnosed as a MCI, using core clinical criteria of the National Institute on
      Aging and the Alzheimer's Association by a physiotherapist. Prior to participate in the
      study, participants will be informed the details of the study and sign the informed consent.
      All participants will be recorded the demographic data and will be assessed visual acuity,
      hearing, sensation and muscle strength of lower extremity, balance, gait variables, and
      global cognitive function.

      Participants who pass the criteria will be randomly assigned to either the AOT with gait
      training group (n = 13), the gait training group (n = 13), and the control group (n = 13) by
      stratified randomization.

      Gait variables will be collected by the Force Distribution Measurement platform during
      walking at comfortable speed (single task) and during counting backwards from 100 by sevens
      (dual tasks). Global cognitive function will be assessed by the Montral Cognitve Assessment
      (MoCA).

      All varaibles will be assessed 3 times which will be at before training, after 4-week of
      training, and 4-week follow-up.
