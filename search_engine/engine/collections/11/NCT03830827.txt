      Vortioxetine (BrintellixÂ®), a novel antidepressant for the treatment of adult with major
      depressive disorder, has been approved by the Chinese Food and Drug Administration in the use
      of China in 2018.

      The MBRP intervention is composed of 8 weekly, 2-hour sessions delivered in small group
      format (10-14 participants) by two therapists to prevent MA relapse. In MBRP, therapists
      facilitate discussions and exercises and introduce the meditation practice component. Group
      sessions include discussions of mindfulness as a means of coping with MA craving, negative
      affect and painful cognitions/sensations that precipitate relapse, role-playing exercises,
      meditation practice and implement practice into high-risk situations and in daily life, as
      well as homework assignments.

      Participants from both groups will also receive 10 visits: visit 1 (week 0): medical and
      psychiatric screening; visit 2-9 (week 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8): depressive symptoms and
      cognitive function, MA use, and MA craving; visit 10 (week 24): MA use (assessment of relapse
      rates), assessment of depressive symptoms, improvement in cognition and MA craving.
