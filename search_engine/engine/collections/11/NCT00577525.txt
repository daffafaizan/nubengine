      biological check-up for the initial disease and viral genome of EBV, CMV, HHV6, HHV7 as well
      as adenovirus will be searched for using PCR reaction in total blood DNA extract. The
      frequency of a latent hybridization of virus genome within human genome will be compared
      between patients with steroid sensitive nephrotic syndrome and controls matched for age and
      sex. Secondary studies will include a comparison of steroid dependency in nephrotic patients
      according to the occurence of a latent viral hybridization, the epidemiology of idiopathic
      nephrotic syndrome in the Parisian area and a pharmacogenetic analysis of steroid sensitivity
      and dependency. If necessary, the chromosomal localization of viral hybridization will be
      studied with fluorescence in situ hybridization using specific probes.
