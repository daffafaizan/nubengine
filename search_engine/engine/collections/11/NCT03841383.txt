      relationship between coronary flow reserve (CFR) and platelet/plasma BH2 and BH4 levels in
      patients with hypertension and concomitant cardiovascular risk factors.

      Secondary parameter:

      Levels of cGMP in platelets.

      4. Study design

      Three parallel groups of patients (n=15 per group):

        -  Group 1 with normal coronary flow reserve (CFR ≥2.5)

        -  Group 2 with reduced coronary flow reserve (CFR≤2.0)

           o Group 3 control subjects (without a high risk profile according to ESC score chart
           http://www.heartscore.org. ) matched for age (between 40 and 80 years of age)

        -  and gender. 1/3 enrolled patients must be diabetic (Type2 diabetes)
