      treatment of participants with mood disorders and may also benefit the treatment of
      participants with epilepsy. However, this therapeutic tool has been little explored in the
      treatment of mood disorders in participants with epilepsy. Considering these aspects, the
      main objective of this project is to study the safety and possible therapeutic effects of
      tDCS in depressive symptoms of participants with temporal lobe epilepsy. As secondary
      objectives, stands out the evaluation of the effects of this stimulation on the frequency of
      epileptic seizures and on electrophysiological and biochemical parameters in these
      participants. To do this, after performing semi-structured interviews to evaluate depressive
      symptoms, quality of life and sleep, participants with Temporal Lobe Epilepsy will be
      randomized into two groups: 1) intervention with tDCS in participants with Temporal Lobe
      Epilepsy and depressive symptoms (T) and 2) sham intervention in participants with Temporal
      Lobe Epilepsy and depressive symptoms (S). After studying and characterizing the behavioral,
      biochemical and electroencephalic patterns (EEG), the T group will be submitted to tDCS. The
      control group will perform the same assessments and the same preparatory procedures, but will
      not receive the electrical stimulus. Finally, in addition to the analysis of the
      electroencephalographic patterns of the two groups at the end of each session, the analysis
      of the brain-derived Neurotrophic Factor Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) will also be performed,
      as well as a new clinical evaluation regarding the frequency of seizures and patterns of
      these participants through the same semi-structured interviews conducted initially.
