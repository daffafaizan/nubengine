      disease. On a consensual basis, the detection of those lesions in done on FLAIR (FLuid
      Attenuated Inversion Recovery) sequences, weighted T2 with cancelling of fluid signal,
      leading to a much better contrast between the lesion and the environment. The environment is
      displayed as a iso-signal for the surrounding healthy brain's white matter and as a
      hypo-signal for the fluids. Keys parameters indicative of the sequence's contrast are the
      echo time, the reversal time, and the repetition time, wich seems to be crucial to detect the
      lesions, according to relatively discordant results of publications using different
      technologies of FLAIR. Although 3D FLAIR sequences play an essential role for diagnosis and
      evaluation (evolution under treatment, prognosis) of demyelinating pathologies there is no
      consensus on parameters used on routine basis.

      The aim of the trial is to discover the optimal combination of theses parameters so as to
      well detect the lesions.
