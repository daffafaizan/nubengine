      20 years the interaction between periodontal infections and systemic conditions has been
      largely studied, suggesting that the inflammation caused in the periodontal tissues could
      cause a response in other parts of the body.

      Recent studies suggest that there could be an association between periodontal disease and
      chronic kidney disease.
