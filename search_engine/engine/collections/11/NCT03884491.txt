    
      Apart from the first two doses, the study design is flexible in terms of doses and
      pharmaceutical formulations and will be decided upon based on an evaluation of the safety and
      tolerability as well as plasma exposure obtained during the study.

        -  The study consists of 5 periods. Single-doses of vortioxetine will be administered in
           all periods.

        -  All subjects will receive the same pharmaceutical formulations of the same dose strength
           in the same period and sequence.

        -  In Period 1, each subject will receive an intravenous (IV) 10 mg dose of vortioxetine
           infused over 2 hours. The exposure obtained after IV administration will serve as the
           reference for the sublingually administered dosage forms.

        -  In Period 2, each subject will receive 5 mg of formulation A (SLA) of vortioxetine in a
           sublingual (SL) formulation with a holding time of 90 seconds. The holding time is the
           time where swallowing of saliva should be avoided.

        -  For the 3 remaining dosing periods, one or more of the following options in
           pharmaceutical formulation, dose, and dosing condition apply to this study:

             -  Increases or decreases in dose (â‰¤25mg) using same formulation

             -  Change from formulation SLA to formulation SLB

             -  Change in the holding time

             -  Change to formulation SLC

             -  Change in swallowing technique of the sublingual dosage forms
