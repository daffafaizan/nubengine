      for delivering a therapeutic gene to patients with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID)
      due to a defective adenosine deaminase (ADA) gene. This gene encodes for the adenosine
      deaminase enzyme, which is essential for the proper growth and function of infection-fighting
      white blood cells called T and B lymphocytes. Patients who lack this enzyme are vulnerable to
      frequent and severe infections.

      ADA-SCID patients are normally rescued by a bone marrow transplant (BMT) from a matched
      healthy donor. However, matched donors are difficult to find and donor BMT is associated with
      high risk. This trial aims to treat ADA-SCID using a safety and efficiency improved
      self-inactivating lentiviral vector carrying a functional ADA gene to correct the genetic
      defect. By collecting an individual's stem cells and modifying them with a lentivirus, the
      gene-corrected cells can be returned to the patient to help produce normal healthy immune
      cells.The primary objectives are to evaluate the safety of the improved self-inactivating
      lentiviral vector TYF-ADA, the ex vivo gene transfer clinical protocol and the efficacy of
      immune reconstitution in patients overcoming frequent infections present at the time of
      treatment. We will assess the lentiviral gene integration sites and the long-term effect of
      this gene transfer procedure.
