      PMX-20R (PMX cartridge), in subjects with endotoxemia and septic shock. Subjects in ICUs will
      be assessed for septic shock using known or suspected infection and hypotension requiring
      vasopressor support as primary criteria. Endotoxemia will be assessed using the Endotoxin
      Activity Assay. Consented eligible subjects will receive two interventions with the PMX
      cartridge approximately 24 hours apart.The status of all subjects will be followed for 28
      days, and long term follow-ups completed at 3 months, 6 months and 12 months.

      This is a continued access study subsequent to the EUPHRATES clinical trial NCT01046669.
