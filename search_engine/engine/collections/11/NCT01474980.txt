      presumably incriminated for the fluctuation of the disease. The investigators would also like
      to better adress the issues of women with Congenital Myasthenic Syndrome, who desire a
      pregnancy : the possibility of decompensation, the problems that can arise during the course
      of the childbearing, the risk of foetal malformations.
