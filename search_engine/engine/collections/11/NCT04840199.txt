      the anti-inflammatory efficacy of letermovir, administered once daily for 48 weeks in adults
      with HIV and asymptomatic CMV, who are on ART-mediated suppression. Participants will be
      randomized 1:1 to receive either letermovir or placebo. A futility analysis will be performed
      after the first 40 participants, who have started study treatment, reach their 8-week study
      visit. Study enrollment will be paused after the 40th participant starts treatment until the
      results of the futility analysis have been considered.
