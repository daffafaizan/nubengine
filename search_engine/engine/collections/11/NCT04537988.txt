      loss, an alarmingly large percentage of people struggle to maintain the lost weight. In the
      face of obesity, weight maintenance is therefore arising as a major obstacle and new
      innovative approaches are called for. Despite the fact that a substantial number of web-based
      diets, health and fitness focused interventions or "apps" already exist, few focus on weight
      maintenance, are research based or available post study. In addition, most have yet to show
      short- or long-term effect and few, if any, are developed together with users (e.g.,
      patients, health care professionals). eHealth solutions may therefore be a "missing link" in
      supporting self-regulation and motivation for sustainable health behavior change and weight
      loss maintenance. The aim of this study is to evaluate a person-centered, evidence based
      interactive eHealth intervention facilitating weight maintenance following initial weight
      loss during a 3- month feasibility pilot trial.
