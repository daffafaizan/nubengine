      through a six days heat acclimation period in a heat chamber according to a valid protocol.
      After heat acclimation the participant will be randomly exposed to 4 conditions during four
      separate consecutive days: 1) walking on a treadmill for two hours in hot-wet conditions
      (30OC, 70% RH) while wearing military uniforms and a vest (control group); 2) walking on a
      treadmill for two hours in hot-dry conditions (40OC, 30% RH) while wearing military uniforms
      and a vest (control group); 3) walking on a treadmill for two hours in hot-wet conditions
      (30OC, 70% RH) while wearing military uniforms and a vest with a ventilator (experimental
      group); 4) walking on a treadmill for two hours in hot-dry conditions (40OC, 30% RH) while
      wearing military uniforms and a vest with a ventilator (experimental group). During the heat
      exposures, rectal temperature, skin temperature and heart rate will be continuously
      monitored. Subjective comfort measures, heat strain indices, sweat rate and sweat evaporation
      will be also measured/calculated. The differences in the above measures, during exposure to
      exercise in the heat between ventilator and no ventilator will be then analyzed.
