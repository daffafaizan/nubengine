      young age and last forever. It is not yet clearly known the origin of crohn's disease.
      However, crohn's disease therapy is getting developed by using immunosuppressant and
      TNF-alpha inhibitor. Nonetheless, some patients still don't react to TNF-alpha inhibitor
      which is most effective treatment. Also, Even though some other patients reacted to the
      treatment at first, the effect of treatment decreases over time. Plus, long-term use of
      TNF-alpha inhibitor can lead to complication of infection and occurrence of malignant tumor
      like lymphoma. Recently, treatment of intractable crohn's disease is attempted by using stem
      cell. Especially, Mesenchymal stem cell is well-known for immunosuppression,
      anti-inflammatory ability and cell differentiation ability to various lineage cell as non
      hematopoietic stromal cell.

      When the body get infected by the pathogens, innate immune response operate as the primary
      defence mechanism. at this time, there are some receptors reacting first such as
      TLR(toll-like receptor) and NLR(nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain) which is located
      in the cytoplasm of a cell. It is reported that the activities of TLR which is expressed by
      Mesenchymal stem cells play an important roles about immunomodulatory ability of Mesenchymal
      stem cells. Furthermore, human Umbilical Cord Blood derived-Universal Stem Cells( hUCB-USCs)
      manifest TLR and NLR of Mesenchymal Stem cells at the same time. when those receptors become
      activation, it maximize ability of immunomodulatory. Therefore, hUCB-USCs can be utilized to
      cure intractable autoimmune disease like Crohn's disease. Further, It has huge possibility as
      cell therapy products for autoimmune disease.
