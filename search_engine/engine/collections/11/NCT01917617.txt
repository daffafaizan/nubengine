      by Cisplatin in combination of GC therapy. There is a problem infusion time is take a long
      time for this. In many institutions in Japan, GC therapy is performed over 3 hours or more,
      longer than original method in the ABC-002 trial. Oral rehydration therapy is a therapy that
      performs prevention or treatment of dehydration by the ingestion of oral rehydration
      solution, which is adjusted the concentration of the electrolyte and glucose to absorb good
      efficiency from the gastrointestinal tract. Oral rehydration therapy (ORT) is a therapy that
      performs prevention or treatment of dehydration by the ingestion of oral rehydration
      solution, which is adjusted the concentration of the electrolyte and glucose to absorb good
      efficiency from the gastrointestinal tract. Many reports suggest ORT may substitute for
      infusion therapy. Herein, the investigators planned the study to examine the safety of
      replacing the fluid infusion by oral rehydration expecting to shorten the time to drip.
