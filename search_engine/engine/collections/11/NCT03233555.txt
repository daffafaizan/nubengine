      I. Develop the EXCELS intervention to facilitate engaged self-management of cancer follow-up
      for cancer survivors.

      II. Evaluate the efficacy of EXCELS intervention in a small randomized controlled trial.

      III. Assess/refine intervention usability and acceptability for primary care patients.

      OUTLINE:

      PHASE I: EXCELS intervention is developed and assessed.

      PHASE II: Participants are randomized into 1 of 4 arms.

      ARM I: Participants receive National Cancer Institute's Facing Forward brochure.

      ARM II: Participants have untimed access to the EXCELS mobile web application.

      ARM III: Participants also receive 4 calls of 15-20 minutes each over 3 months focusing on
      assisting survivors with addressing challenges to receiving preventive service and health
      care.

      ARM IV: Participants have access to EXCELS website as in Arm II. Participants also receive 4
      health coaching calls as in Arm III.
