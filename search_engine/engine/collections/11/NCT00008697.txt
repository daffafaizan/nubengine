    
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive arsenic trioxide IV over 2 hours daily for 28 days followed by a 14 day rest
      period. Patients may receive up to 3 courses of treatment.

      Dose escalation continues in cohorts of 3-6 patients until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)
      or minimum effective dose (MED) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that
      at which 2 or more patients experience dose limiting toxicity. The MED is defined as the dose
      at which 4 of 6 patients achieve a complete cytogenetic or molecular response. After the MTD
      or MED is determined, an additional 20 patients are enrolled at this dose level.

      Patients are followed monthly for 6 months and every three months for an additional 1.5
      years.
