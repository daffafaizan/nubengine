      evidence for patients with severe asthma in Russia. The RSAR initiative is realized under the
      efforts of the Interregional Public Organization "Russian Respiratory Society" and LLC "RSMI"
      with the sponsorship of "AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals" LLC.

      The developed RSAR electronic database is a Russian software product that meets the current
      requirements of the Russian legislation in the field of working with personal data and the
      implementation of similar observational studies.

      level as part of the work to implement the RSAR initiative. Participants will provide
      high-quality data for the development of data sets for research, approved by the Russian
      Respiratory Society (RPO), which has priority in owning and implementation in scientific
      field of the gained data. Based on ethical, legal and regulatory authorizations, anonymous
      data will be collected in the Central Database (CDB) on respiratory diseases (referred to
      here as the RSAR database) to create sets of important data and the necessary analysis. CDB
