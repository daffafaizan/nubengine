      Pompe disease is an autosomal recessive disease, enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) and new
      born screen (NBS) had been initiated in Taiwan since 2008. However, residual muscle weakness
      were noted. Decrease in amplitude of nerve compound muscle action potential (CMAP) and
      increase spontaneous activity were reported before the imitation of ERT. However, the motor
      development, motor function and electrodiagnostic presentation which were important in
      further direction of treatment and rehabilitation program arrangement in infantile Pompe
      disease (IOPD) under ERT is lacking.

      Aim

      To investigate the motor development, motor function and electrodiagnostic presentation in
      IOPD under ERT.

      Method

      This is an observational, prospective, longitudinal, follow-up study. Motor development was
      assessed by Alberta Infant Motor Scale (AIMS) and Peabody Developmental Motor Scales, Second
      Edition (PDMS II); motor function was assessed by Pediatric Evaluation of Disability
      Inventory (PEDI) and Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM). Electrodiagnosis studies include
      nerve conduction study (NCS) and electromyography (EMG).

      Expect Effects

      Obtain the characteristics of motor development, motor function and electrodiagnosis
      presentation of IOPD under ERT, and the relation between motor development, motor function
      and electrodiagnosis presentation.
