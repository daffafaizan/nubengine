      anesthesiologist performing their labor epidural. One script will contain the wording "Poke
      and a burn" prior to subcutaneous local anesthetic administration for the epidural placement
      and one will contain "this is numbing medication, which will make the rest of the procedure
      go easier". There will be no difference in the epidural placement, medications, or the rest
      of the script.
