    
      This study is a randomized control, non-inferiority trial which compare the proportion of
      ovulation between two oral combined pills when delay starting the first tablet at
      mid-follicular phase of menstrual cycle in 18 - 40 year old, healthy women with prior normal
      and regular periods. Participations will be undergone trans-vaginal or trans-rectal
      ultrasonography between day 1 - 3 of menstrual period for evaluation of ovarian follicle/cyst
      (if present). Only women who have normal looking of ovaries without dominant ovarian follicle
      will be included in study-protocol. Immediately after trans-vaginal/trans-rectal ultrasound
      between day 7 - 9 of menstrual period, all participants will be randomly assigned to receive
      one pack of investigated pills (1.5 mg estradiol hemihydrate/2.5 mg nomegestrol acetate or 20
      mcg ethinyl estradiol/75 mcg gestodene) and to take the first tablet under direct observation
      by research-nurse. Participants will take one consecutive tablet at about the same time each
      day until complete pack. The next appointments will be every 2 - 3 days to monitor ovarian
      function by using Hoogland score until ovulation or follicular quiescence will be presented.
      The last visit will be about 1 week after complete pack to monitor adverse effect and safety
      through out the protocol.
