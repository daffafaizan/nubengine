      world's population. There are a number of antipsychotic drugs in use but none is ideal, in
      particular because their safety profile is complex and their effectiveness is limited. In
      particular, after having overcome acute exacerbations many patients continue to experience
      significant symptoms that prevent an adequate functioning. In the current study, patients
      suffering from schizophrenia and currently in a post-acute maintenance phase of the disease
      will be included. Non-treatment resistant patients will be included in the study, since they
      have partially responded to their current antipsychotic treatment but still have clinically
      significant symptoms and/or impairment of functioning in their daily life. The study is a
      12-month study with an initial 12-week placebo-controlled, quetiapine-referenced phase. After
      this initial 12-week phase, the patients allocated to placebo will be switched to bifeprunox.
      In the final non-inferiority analysis of the 12-month data, the results from this study will
      be combined with the data from a similar study (11916A).
