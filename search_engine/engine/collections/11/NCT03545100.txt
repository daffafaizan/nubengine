      Advanced treatment of oral cancer increases survival rates; however, it also increases the
      risk of developing shoulder dysfunction, dysphagia, oral dysfunction, donor site morbidity
      and psychological issues. The probability of shoulder dysfunction after neck dissection is as
      high as 70%. Rehabilitation effects on shoulder function for head and neck survivors are
      needed for further studied.

      The purpose of this randomized clinical trial is to explore the effects of rehabilitation for
      shoulder function in oral cancer survivors. We will recruit 60 newly diagnosed oral cancer
      subjects through the plastic surgeon's referral from April 2018 to March 2020. The
      participants will be randomized separated into experimental or control group. Each group
      would receive regular physical therapy for shoulder function (i.e., transcutaneous electrical
      stimulation, shoulder joint range of motion exercise, scapular muscle strengthening
      training). Experimental group would be supplemented by motor control therapy targeting the
      scapular muscle progressive resistance exercise (exercise plus manual therapy).
