    
      This is a non-randomized, single-center, prospective investigation on exercise capacities of
      LVAD recipients.

      LVAD patients already have in our unit the following regular monitoring:

        -  clinical examination

        -  Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire (MLHFQ)

        -  SF-36 Health Survey

        -  Six-Minute Walk Test

        -  resting echocardiography

        -  routine blood tests.

      The REVADE pilot study consists in adding 2 cardiopulmonary exercise testings to their
      existing follow-up : peak oxygen consumption (VO2 max) and stress echocardiography.

      We plan to do 1 stress echocardiography on a supine bicycle over the follow-up, and 1 peak
      oxygen consumption recorded while breathing through a gas analyzer.

      Total study length of time will be 1 year. Expected number of enrolled patients is 18.
