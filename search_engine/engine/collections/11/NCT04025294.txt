      For this project, the play2PREVENT Lab aims to assess the acceptability and preliminary
      efficacy of a videogame intervention designed to teach teens the skills in restructuring
      thoughts and then empowering them to take action and improve their school climate. Program
      and school staff will enroll participants between the ages of 14-19 years old to play our
      videogame during their after school programs. Before and after gameplay, participants will
      answer assessment questions related to self-efficacy, cognitive reappraisal, and dimensions
      of school climate. Questions will also assess participants' feedback on the videogame.
      Students not randomly assigned to the videogame intervention will only respond to assessment
      questions. The data will be transmitted electronically via Qualtrics data collection platform
      to the Lab for further analysis.
