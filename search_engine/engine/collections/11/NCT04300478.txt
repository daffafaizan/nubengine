      REE, body composition, and subjective questionnaires to assess energy balance. Eligible and
      interested individuals will attend an exercise familiarization session in the two weeks
      before the initial study visit. Individuals will then be randomized to either sedentary
      control/REx or REx/sedentary control in a 1:1. A washout period of approximately 7-14 days
      will separate testing sessions.

      A randomized cross-over short-term study design was chosen to assessment to profile appetite,
      energy intake, and physical activity in controlled and free-living settings while also
      reducing participant burden (as opposed to a long-term intervention). Participants will serve
      as their own controls, thereby circumventing inter-individual variation in physiology that
      may confound results. It is anticipated that responses to acute exercise will be amplified in
      chronic interventions and may therefore be used as a basis for generating hypotheses on the
      regulation of certain energy balance components. The study will end after the completion of 3
      days of dietary intake recall and physical activity measurement for the last participant.
