      efficacy of medication treatment and to reduce the risk of adverse effects. Inclusion of
      pharmacogenetic testing as part of medication reviews reveals more serious drug related
      problems and leads to more changes in medication treatment than medication review alone.

      The use of pharmacogenetic testing as part of medication reviews has not earlier been
      systematically investigated in hospital patients in Norway. There is little documentation of
      what is needed to implement the use of pharmacogenetic testing in a hospital ward.

      The investigators are conducting a descriptive study in two internal medicine wards at
      Akershus University Hospital. 50 patients using minimum 5 regular drugs including at least
      one relevant for pharmacogenetic testing will be enrolled in the study.
