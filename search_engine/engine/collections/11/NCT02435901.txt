      treatment related mortality and morbidity (TRM). Preparative regimens that are not
      myeloablative are associated with a greatly decreased incidence of TRM. In addition to
      providing a less toxic regimen, the reduced intensity chemotherapy preparative regimen also
      remains immunosuppressive enough to allow donor engraftment. Recent report of
      non-myeloablative regimens which resulted in engraftment of allogeneic stem cell in
      hematological malignancies raises the possibility that this conditioning regimen might be
      useful in achieving engraftment in non hematological disorder.

      In an effort to achieve stable engraftment with any suitable donor stem cell source and to
      minimize toxicity the investigators have developed a new reduced intensity conditioning
      regimen for high risk hemoglobinopathies with the main aim of significantly suppressing the
      recipient's immune system and facilitate engraftment.

      Non-myeloablative or reduced-intensity immunosuppressive preparative regimens have achieved a
      stable, mixed chimerism engraftment and successful allogeneic bone marrow transplants.
