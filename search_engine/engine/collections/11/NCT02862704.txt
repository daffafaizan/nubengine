      activated and re-engineered to express chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) specific for MG7,
      which is a glycosylated protein of CEA. Cells are expanded in culture and returned to the
      participant by intra-tumor injection at the dose of (1-6)Ã—108 CAR positive T cells. The cells
      perfusion process would last for 1min to 2min. The dose of 1.5 grams/m2 of cyclophosphamide
      will be given two days before CART cell infusion.
