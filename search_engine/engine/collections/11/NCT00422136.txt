      effusion (MEE), number of episodes of MEE and numbers of episodes of acute otitis media (AOM)
      have a strong genetic component. The point estimate of heritability of time with MEE was
      0.73. While there is significant evidence that susceptibility to recurrent/persistent OM is
      largely genetically determined, the specific genes which confer susceptibility are unknown.
      The overall research strategy to identify genes underlying OM is to apply a three-stage study
      design that will allow the investigators to balance cost efficiency with statistical power.
      Five hundred evaluable pairs of siblings with a history of tympanostomy tube insertion
      (affected), their parent(s) and available non-affected full siblings will be recruited. A
      blood sample will be obtained from each subject for genotyping.
