      deterioration of left ventricular diastolic function . It may lead to atrial myocardium
      stretching and enlargement which may be associated to increased risk of cardiovascular
      events. We hypothesized that morphological and functional LA changes might be found using
      three dimensional echo, and that such alterations are related to obstructive sleep apnea
      presence.
