      I. Utilize CBPR methods to develop specific county-level media campaigns and a clinic-based
      chart reminder for 12 Ohio Appalachia counties focused on CRC screening or an attention
      control message.

      II. Implement and test, using a group-randomized design, a staggered county-wide intervention
      program that consists of county-specific media campaigns, clinic-specific chart reminder
      systems, and a combination of both strategies in 6 randomly selected intervention counties
      vs. an attention control condition in 6 randomly selected control counties.

      III. Utilize process and outcome evaluation strategies to assess the efficacy of each
      strategy.

      IV. Utilize the results to plan the dissemination of the intervention into 36 Appalachian
      counties in 6 additional states of the Appalachia Community Cancer Network (ACCN) in a
      subsequent study.

      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      Arm I: Participants are exposed to the "Get Behind Your Health!" media campaign intervention
      comprising 3 phases: the media campaign, the medical chart reminder, and a combination of
      media campaign and chart reminder. Participants also undergo telephone interviews during
      years 2-4.

      Arm II: Participants are exposed to a media campaign, patient education material in clinics,
      and a combination related to healthy eating, "PEACHES" (Promoting Education in Appalachia on
      Cancer and Healthy Eating Styles). Participants also undergo telephone interviews during
      years 2-4.
