    
      Patients will received 4 p-IGEV courses repeated every 3 weeks in the absence of unacceptable
      toxicity, whenever an objective response is observed at disease evaluation performed after II
      cycle.

      Eligible patients will be accrued in cohorts of 3 patients at each dose level and dose
      escalation will be performed following the standard 3+3 rule.

      Three patients will be treated for each dose-level, starting from level 1, for one cycle: if
      no dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) will be recorded after the first cycle, treatment will be
      continued in those patients until study completion or unacceptable toxicity and three new
      patients will be treated at the next dose level. However, if one out of 3 patients will
      develop a DLT, the same dose-level will be administered to three additional patients for one
      cycle. If no one of those additional patients will experience a DLT, dose escalation will
      continue. If more than one over 3 or 6 patients will develop a DLT after the first cycle in
      any cohort, MTD will be reached. Six further patients will be treated at the lower dose in
      order to obtain more information about the optimal dose for phase II trials and to
      characterize pharmacokinetic profiles of this combination. If DLT will be found at level 1
      (20 mg), 3 patients will be treated at dose -1 (10 mg). If no more than 1 patient experience
      toxicity, other 3 patients will be treated to assess more information about pharmacokinetic
      profiles and safety.
