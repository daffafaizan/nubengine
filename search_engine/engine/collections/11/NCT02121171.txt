    
      "Ologen Â® CM" is a biodegradable collagen matrix. To prevent episcleral fibrosis and
      subconjunctival scarring thay may result in the surgical failure in filtration surgery, its
      sporous matrix modulates the migrations and proliferations of fibroblasts to create a
      vascular and long-lasting bleb without the adverse effects.

      Results of ologen CM studies have been published at conferences and published in
      peer-reviewed journals; ologen CM is approved in Europe as an aid for tissue repair, and by
      the FDA in the US as an adjunct in wound management(K080868). In general, over 7,000 ologen
      CM have been implanted worldwide during the past two years with good results and excellent
      safety profile.
