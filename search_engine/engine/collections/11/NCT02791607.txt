    
      1. Establish a protocol and a practical platform to longitudinally isolate, enumerate CTCs
           in patients with HPV+-head and neck cancer during the treatment course.

        2. Elucidate the clinical significance of P16 INK4A -expressing CTCs to cancer status and
           treatment response.

        3. Verify that dynamically monitoring P16 status and changes during anti-cancer treatment
           is feasible and clinically meaningful to survival or treatment responses.

        4. Analyze different habitual conditions, i.e. alcohol, cigarette and betel nut use to
           P16-expressing CTCs.

        5. Establish a good model to follow-up a specific surface marker on CTCs, which could be
           possibly utilized in other cancers with their particular markers (i.e. CEA on gastric
           cancer, Her2 on breast cancer)
