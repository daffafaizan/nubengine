      and effectiveness of an investigational agent to learn whether it works in treating a
      specific disease. "Investigational" means that the drug is being studied.

      Pembrolizumab (MK-3475 or KEYTRUDA) is a humanized monoclonal antibody. An antibody is a
      common type of protein made in the body in response to a foreign substance (particles not
      typically found in your body such as bacteria or viruses). Antibodies attack foreign
      substances and protect against infection. Antibodies can also be produced in the laboratory
      for use in treating patients. Pembrolizumab is designed to restore the natural ability of the
      immune system to recognize and target cancer cells.

      The FDA recently granted approval to pembrolizumab as a treatment for patients with recurrent
      or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Pembrolizumab has not been approved for
      treatment against adenoid cystic carcinoma.

      This study is testing whether pembrolizumab with or without radiation is useful for patients
      with adenoid cystic carcinoma. Radiation therapy may be used to treat some ACC tumors that
      have spread to other parts of the body or recurred after surgery. Radiation therapy may
      affect the immune system to improve the efficacy of pembrolizumab
