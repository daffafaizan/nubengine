      standardized patient (SP) visits during the 12-24 months after enrollment. SPs are trained
      actors who will pose as patients to assess physician behavior and communication. Each SP will
      present just like a real patient, and will have a standardized fabricated scenario and
      identity. The SP visit will be unannounced; the physician will not be informed at the time of
      the visit that they are seeing an SP. The visits will be covertly audio-recorded. This is
      being conducted at 3 sites: University of Rochester, Rochester, NY; Purdue, IN; and
      University of Michigan.
