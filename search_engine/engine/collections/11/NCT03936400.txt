      with the couple, will be conducted and assessed on how it affects the couple's general
      well-being and recovery of the sexual and intimate relationship.

      The intervention consists of three therapeutic conversations, based on the Illness Beliefs
      model in family nursing, and an optional web-based evidence based information. The aim of the
      intervention is to support the facilitating beliefs of the couple in adapting to changes in
      intimacy and identify constraining beliefs. In the first session an emphasis is on creating
      an optimal context for changing beliefs by building good therapeutic relationship and to
      invite them to share their experience, giving them the opportunity to voice their own
      concerns and reflect on how their situation effects their intimate relationship. In the
      second session, the couple take a closer look at what they themselves deem important in
      adjusting to changes in their intimate relationship. In both sessions information about the
      possible sexual side effects of treatment will be offered as needed and evidence based,
      optional web-based information on practical solutions will be provided. In the
      booster-session, the couple will assess how they have been adjusting in their intimate
      relationship and any positive changes that have occurred will be accentuated.
