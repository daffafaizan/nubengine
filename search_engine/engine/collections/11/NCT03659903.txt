      includes patients of 18 registries in the USA from 1973-2013, encompassing approxi-mately 28%
      of the USA population. All the malignant cases were followed-up annu-ally to determine vital
      status.

      Patient Population All the variables' definitions are encoded in the SEER database. To
      identify the PDAC cases, site codes (C25 pancreas, C25.0-C25.9) and histology codes (8140
      adenocarcinoma, 8500 infiltrating duct carcinoma) based on the International Classification
      of Diseases for Oncology, Third Edition (ICD-O-3) were used.11 Only cases that underwent PD
      and microscopically confirmed were included.

      Outcome Variables We only included those PDAC patients that underwent PD with precise data
      available for the following variables: age at diagnosis, year of diagnosis, gender, race,
      tumor site, tumor size, regional nodes positive, regional nodes examined, grade, stage, vital
      status, and survival months.

      To clearly differentiate the difference of long-term survival between young and elderly
      patients, all cases were divided into two group age < 80 years and age ≥ 80 years. Since
      2004, the AJCC 6th stage has been used in the SEER database. Thus, the diagnosis years of the
      cases included in our study ranged from 2004-2013. To analyze the median OS between different
      time periods, we divided the year of diagnosis into two groups: 2004-2008 year and 2009-2013.
      Furthermore, we also divided the tumor size into three groups: ≤ 2 cm, 2-4 cm, and > 4 cm.
      The lymph node ratio (LNR) is considered a robust prognostic factor after resection of
      pancreatic cancer and was es-timated using regional nodes positive divided by regional nodes
      examined.15 LNR was then categorized into three groups: 0%, 1-50%, > 50%.
