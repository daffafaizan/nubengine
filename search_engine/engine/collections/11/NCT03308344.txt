      face, military deployment is known to have deleterious effects on the entire family unit. The
      January 2010 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine reported medical data from over
      250,000 wives of deployed soldiers. These women suffered from clinically significant levels
      of anxiety, depression, sleep disturbances, and adjustment disorders. Thus, the psychological
      profile of military spouses sadly parallels that of the military servicemembers.
      Unfortunately, the effect of deployment on the psychological health in military spouses is
      largely unstudied, and very few resilience-building programs are available for military
      families.

      Prior research showed that mindfulness training (MT), as a resilience-building program in
      civilian and military servicemembers, can effectively protect against degradation in of
      executive functions (i.e., attention, working memory) and benefit psychological well-being
      over high-demand intervals. While research evidence mounts that MT is beneficial for service
      members, there is almost no research examining the impact of MT on military spouses'
      cognitive functioning and psychological well-being.

      The present study aims to investigate if MT may successfully benefit cognitive functioning
      and psychological well-being in military spouses.
