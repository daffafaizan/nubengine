      steroid injection (ESI). Two techniques of steroid delivery into the cervical epidural space
      include the transforaminal and interlaminar approaches. We aimed to determine if the CIESI
      with versus without a catheter is associated with superior clinical outcomes at follow-up. We
      hypothesized that the use of a targeted epidural catheter technique would result in superior
      pain control, function, decreased analgesic use, and lower surgical incidence as compared to
      standard CIESI at C7-T1.
