    
      This pilot, multi-centre, pragmatic randomized controlled trial is planned to simulate all
      aspects of a larger definitive trial comparing conventional versus supramarginal tumor
      resection at the time of the first surgical resection of HGG in appropriately selected
      patients. This pilot will help determine the ability to meet pre-specified criteria in
      identification, recruitment, and patient allocation, allow for refinement of eligibility
      criteria for optimal recruitment, confirm safety of procedure and ability to retain
      participants for the duration of the trial. Preliminary efficacy data will inform sample size
      calculations and estimation of resources required for the envisioned larger definitive trial.
