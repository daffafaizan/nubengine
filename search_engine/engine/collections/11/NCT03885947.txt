      hematological malignancies undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplantation. The primary
      endpoint of the study is safety as defined by the incidence of infusion reactions and graft
      failure, lack of neutrophil engraftment by day +42. The trial will consist of two cohorts.
      First cohort of 5-7 patients, will undergo double umbilical cord blood (UCB) transplantation.
      One UCB unit will undergo CD34 selection followed VPA based expansion. CD34 negative portion
      of that unit will be cryopreserved to be infused later following infusion of the expanded
      portion. Infusion of the second unmanipulated UCB will follow it. Preparative regimen is
      Fludarabine 150 mg/m2/Cytoxan 50 mg/m2/Thiotepa 10 mg/m2/TBI 400cGy.

      Following successful engraftment in the first cohort, second cohort (10 patients) will only
      receive single manipulated unit.

      Otherwise, patients will receive standard allogeneic stem cell transplantation care.
