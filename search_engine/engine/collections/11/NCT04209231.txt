      clinic, for routine periodontal examinations. Individuals who had been using
      immunosuppressive drugs and antibiotics for the past three months, smokers, individuals who
      had periodontal treatment within the past six months, and individuals with additional or
      supplementary vitamin D and systemic diseases were excluded from the study. In addition,
      since the region's level of sunlight exposure may have an effect on the level of vitamin D,
      participants were required to live in the region for the last five years.

      A total of 82 subjects, including 25 as a periodontally healthy control group, 28 with
      chronic gingivitis and 29 with chronic periodontitis, were included in the study. Clinical
      criteria for chronic periodontitis are the formation of plaque and calculus and â‰¥ 5 milimeter
      (mm) pocket depth or attachment loss in more than 30% of the teeth. Diagnosis criteria for
      chronic gingivitis are the formation of plaque and/or calculus in the mouth, bleeding, and no
      loss of pocket or attachment. The diagnosis criteria for periodontally healthy individuals
      are having clinically healthy periodontal tissues or minimal periodontal inflammation, with
      no loss of pocket or attachment.
