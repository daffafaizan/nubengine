      systemic diseases like rheumatoid arthritis. Pentraxin3 is a newly discovered inflammatory
      biomarker. It is a member of acute phase proteins and it has been observed from previous
      studies that plasma pentraxin3 levels have increased with increasing severity of cardiac and
      renal problems.

      Porphyromonas gingivalis proteinase is responsible for the epitope development in RF-Fc
      region These proteinases are important virulence factors which lead to degradation of host
      tissue. Porphyromonas gingivalis is also a key periodonto pathogen. Thus the aim of this
      study is to compare the plasma pentraxin3 and p.gingivalis levels in patients with
      periodontitis and rheumatoid arthritis.
