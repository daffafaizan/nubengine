      seriously affects patients' lives and leads to major financial losses, causes serious
      deficiencies in both developing and developed countries. Health professionals' perception of
      pain, factors associated with pain and fear avoidance attitudes of patients affect the
      success of treatment. The aim of this study is to determine the Turkish version, validity and
      reliability of ''Health Care Providers and Impairment Relationship Scale (HC-PAIRS)''. 165
      physiotherapist working with chronic low back pain were included in the study. In order to
      determine the reliability of the scale, the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) will be
      used to determine the level of the relationship between the results of the first and second
      measurements. Cronbach's alpha coefficient will be used for homogeneity of the questions in
      the scale. For concurrent validity, correlation coefficient will be used to determine the
      agreement between the previously validated scales and the Turkish version of HC PAIRS.
