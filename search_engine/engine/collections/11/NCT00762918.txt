      doses of ergocalciferol, vitamin D2. Replacement has traditionally been focused upon
      maintenance of calcium and phosphorus homeostasis and bone health. However, non-classic roles
      of vitamin D have become increasingly recognized and the contribution of vitamin D deficiency
      to non-bone disorders has become apparent. Vitamin D deficiency has been associated with
      increased risk of a variety of cancers, autoimmune diseases such as Type 1 diabetes and
      multiple sclerosis, Type 2 diabetes, tuberculosis, and myopathy. The connection between
      vitamin D and these disease states likely reflects vitamin D's role as a transcriptional
      regulator: it participates in cell cycle regulation and in the innate immune system mediates
      cathelicidin production following activation of toll-like receptors.One hallmark of CF is
      pulmonary hyper-inflammation with recurrent infections. Additionally, malnutrition and
      decreased lean muscle mass threaten pulmonary function in CF. While vitamin D and its
      relation to bone has been explored in CF, the role of vitamin D in inflammation, lean body
      mass and strength, and pulmonary muscle strength has not been investigated. Moreover, vitamin
      D replacement has traditionally been with ergocalciferol, vitamin D2. Vitamin D3,
      cholecalciferol, has a longer half-life and is considered more potent. Thus, cholecalciferol
      treatment of children and young adults with CF and vitamin D deficiency may be useful for
      attaining normal vitamin D status and for exploring the impact of vitamin D upon lean body
      mass, pulmonary muscle strength, and inflammation.
