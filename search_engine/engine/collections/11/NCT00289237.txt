      morbidity and mortality. Many years of epidemiological research have identified several risk
      factors for CHD. The main causes are physical inactivity and inappropriate diet (mediated
      through high blood pressure, high cholesterol and fatness) and smoking. So far intervention
      studies on lifestyle factors have shown disappointing results.

      Inter99 is a randomized non-pharmacological intervention study comprising 61,301 persons
      representing a well-defined population. About 13,000 are invited for a health examination and
      assessment of risk for CHD. Those at high risk are offered lifestyle intervention in three
      waves over a five year period. A priori the group is divided into a high intensive and low
      intensive intervention group. The remaining 48.285 individuals serve as control.

      After five years all individuals who attended the base-line examination are re-invited to
      assess the effect of the intervention on intermediate end-points as lifestyle, absolute risk
      of CHD and biological risk factors. The total cohort (61.301) is followed through central
      registers to evaluate the effect of the intervention on use of the health care system and the
      long term effect on incidence of CHD.
