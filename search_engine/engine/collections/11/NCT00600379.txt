      virtual environment; i.e., one in which the different components (constraints) of the
      environment can be displayed, graded, changed and monitored in a quantitative manner.

      Small preliminary studies suggest that VR may be used to augment chronic stroke
      rehabilitation and may enhance cortical reorganization. Our aim is to examine the feasibility
      and efficacy of a virtual reality program for ambulatory patients with mild-to-moderate
      chronic gait deficits after stroke. Study design-a single center randomized controlled trial
      of an experimental group and a usual care group.
