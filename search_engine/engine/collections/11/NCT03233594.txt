      use functional brain imaging to study in vivo neurophysiologic processes. It is important to
      understand the brain and body mechanisms of chronic pain in order to better determine
      therapeutic interventions to reduce pain. Part of the difficulty in treating chronic pain is
      to determine how better to diagnose what specific issues are affecting the brain and body
      that result in chronic pain. Participants will undergo a small battery of diagnostic tests
      that include magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET). A
      secondary goal of this study is to determine if undergoing chiropractic care alters body or
      brain physiology in patients with chronic pain.
