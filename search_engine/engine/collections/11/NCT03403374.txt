    
      An open-label, multicentre, phase 4 study to describe the safety and tolerability of
      evolocumab in 30 Indian participants with HoFH. Subjects who meet the inclusion/exclusion
      criteria and laboratory assessments at screening will be enrolled and will be required to
      maintain their current lipid-lowering drug therapy throughout the duration of the trial.
      Participants will receive evolocumab 420 mg subcutaneous (SC) once monthly (QM) and study
      visits will occur approximately every 4 weeks. Apheresis participants will receive evolocumab
      420 mg SC every 2 weeks to correspond with their apheresis schedule. Final administration of
      evolocumab (for all participants) will occur at week 8. The end of study (EOS) visit will
      occur at week 12 for all participants.
