      I. To estimate the 1-year disease stabilization rate associated with the use of Sylatron
      (peginterferon alfa-2b) in patients with progressive unresectable or recurrent
      craniopharyngiomas following surgery alone who have not received radiation therapy.

      II. To estimate the sustained objective response rate (partial response (PR) + complete
      response (CR)) to Sylatron in patients with craniopharyngiomas which progress or recur
      following radiation therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the response rate in patients with progressive unresectable or recurrent
      craniopharyngioma treated with Sylatron by study stratum.

      II. To estimate the progression-free survival distribution for patients with unresectable or
      recurrent craniopharyngiomas treated with Sylatron by study stratum.

      III. To evaluate the toxicity profile of Sylatron in children with unresectable or recurrent
      craniopharyngiomas.

      IV. To compare the protocol specific disease assessment criteria to MacDonald criteria during
      the first year of treatment in stratum I and at the time of objective response and
      progressive disease in both strata.

      V. To characterize evidence of WNT pathway activation by immunohistochemistry and MAPK
      pathway activation by pyrosequencing in resected tumor tissue in patients with
      craniopharyngiomas, and correlate these results with outcome and response data.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive peginterferon alfa-2b subcutaneously (SC) weekly for 6 weeks. Treatment may
      repeat every 6 weeks for up to 18 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.
