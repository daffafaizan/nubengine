      Allergan botulinum toxin type A (Botox). Patients will be randomized to receive their typical
      Botox injection alone, or with physical therapy.

      At Baseline, disease characteristics (as measured by the Toronto Western Spasmodic
      Torticollis Rating Scale, or TWSTRS, and the Clinical Global Impression of Severity, or CGIS)
      will be measured, along with quality of life (from the Short Health 36 Survey Form 36, or
      SF-36). One subscale of the TWSTRS will be videotaped to be later evaluated by blinded
      movement disorder specialists. A pain scale will also be completed and range of head motion
      will be measured using a device similar to a protractor (called a goniometer). An
      individualized Botox injection will be administered, as well as transcranial magnetic
      stimulation (TMS) to measure neuroplasticity, or the ability of the brain to make new
      connections. If randomized to receive physical therapy, participants will also receive
      instructions to perform physical therapy exercises five times per week by a physical
      therapist who specializes in movement disorders. The investigator will call weekly to check
      how the participant is doing with the exercise program.

      The same procedures outlined above will also be performed at 5 weeks past baseline, and at 12
      weeks (except for the Botox injection, which will only be given at baseline and 12 weeks).
