      and depression, which can reach up to 45% and 35% respectively in this patient population.
      Several studies have reported that psychological accompaniment for these patients can
      alleviate the symptoms of anxiety and/or depression. Therefore, we aim to investigate the
      utility of psychological follow-up for a period of 1 year after first implantation of an ICD
      for primary prevention.
