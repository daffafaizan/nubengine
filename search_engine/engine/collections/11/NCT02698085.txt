      electroneurogram, if they meet the inclusion criteria are offered to take part in this study.

      When the patient agree to participate and signed informed consent, the investigators
      collected dependent variables considered (symptoms, mechanosensitivity, functional capacity
      with upper limb, tractor speed of neural conduction ...) and the patient is assigned to an
      intervention group: real or placebo. Each patient receives treatment 5 sessions trascurriendo
      intersessional 2- 5 days. After 5 sessions the investigators remeasured the same variables.
      In addition, a month later they remeasured again symptoms and functional capacity with upper
      limb. Finally, they were shown the technique they have received. If the patient has received
      the technical placebo he/she is given the opportunity to receive 5 sessions of the actual
      technique.
