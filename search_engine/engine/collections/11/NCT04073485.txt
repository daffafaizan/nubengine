      used for the treatment of uterine fibroids. Although RFA is more invasive when compared to
      High-Intensity-Focused-Ultrasound (HIFU), the treatment is less limited by the location of
      the lesions, and the treatment procedure is more time efficient. To further improve the
      technology of thermal ablation for uterine fibroid, percutaneous microwave ablation (MWA)
      could be a promising option because it allows increased efficiency of energy transmission and
      reduction in procedure time, and may allow effective treatment of large lesions.
