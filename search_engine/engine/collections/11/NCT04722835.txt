    
      This is a pilot observational study of 20 subjects â‰¥40 years of age with smoking history of
      at least 20 pack-years (former or current) who have preserved spirometry, as defined by
      normal Forced Expiratory Volume (FEV1) / Forced Vital Capacity (FVC). Of the 20 subjects, 10
      with and 10 without air trapping as determined by high and abnormal versus low and normal
      Residual Volume (RV) / Total Lung Capacity (TLC) measured by plethysmography. The cohort will
      undergo extensive clinical characterization including full Pulmonary Function Testing (PFT)
      and medical, symptom, activity, and quality of life questionnaires assessment including
      modified Medical Council Research (mMRC), COPD Assessment Test (CAT), Short Form-12 (SF12),
      and St. George's Respiratory (SGRQ) questionnaires. Subjects will undergo bronchoscopy with
      bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) to obtain luminal macrophages and BAL fluid (BALF). Live BAL
      cells, BALF, and BAL cell RNA will be collected and stored in our biorepository for proposed
      studies. Molecular, functional, and transcriptomics analyses of luminal (alveolar)
      macrophages obtained by BAL (Aim 2) and protease activity measurement in serum and BALF will
      be performed (Aim 2) and will be examined against the clinical phenotype of the subjects, in
      particular air trapping-phenotype, to see if an underlying biological signature for
      susceptibility to develop COPD could be identified.

      To perform a more comprehensive molecular and functional phenotype examination of lung
      macrophages, additional methodologies will be developed including a second mass cytometry
      (CyTOF) panel for single-cell proteomics and CyTOF-based phagocytosis and efferocytosis
      assays to allow for performance of truly single-cell functional phenotyping of myeloid cells
      from BAL and lung tissue (Aim 1).
