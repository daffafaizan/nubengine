      sites (Cochin Hospital, Pitie-Salpetriere Hospital, France) where the patient selection will
      be conducted during a Multidisciplinary Collaborative Meeting.

      The patients will be enrolled after collecting their informed consent. As soon as the patient
      is included, arrangements will be made for the organization of the liver resection according
      to the usual procedure of the hospital department.

      The biological samples for the research (blood and liver) will be taken at the time of the
      surgery and sent to the Research Unit (Institut Pasteur) where immunological analyses will be
      carried out.
