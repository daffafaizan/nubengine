      treatment of femoral shaft fractures in adult population. Clinical outcomes after operative
      treatment of proximal femur fracture have been shown to be dependent on achieving optimal
      mechanical alignment and union. Patient independent risk factors associated with nonunion
      after intramedullary fixation includes: open fracture, undreamed intramedullary nailing,
      fracture comminution, non-isthmal and particularly infra-isthma fracture location and
      infection. Patient dependent risk factors include smoking, diabetes, nonsteroidal
      anti-inflammatory medications, closed head injury and delayed weight. Unreamed nailing allows
      for better maintenance of the endosteal circulation at the expense of smaller diameter
      implants; in contrast, reamed applications permit a larger diameter nail, resulting in
      stronger fixation constructs and earlier fracture union. After reaming, a larger diameter
      intramedullary nail is placed. When initially reported, this treatment resulted in high
      success rates.
