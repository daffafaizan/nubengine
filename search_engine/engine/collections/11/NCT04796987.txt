    
      Cervical myelopathy (CM) is a frequent degenerative disease of the cervical spine that occurs
      as a result of compression of the spinal cord. In evaluating of this disease and determining
      treatment options, the patient's clinic and radiological modalities should be evaluated
      together.

      The current imaging procedures for CM are plain roentgenograms, computed tomography and
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, MRI in CM is more valuable in evaluating of the
      disc, spinal cord and other soft tissues compared to other imaging methods. Artificial
      intelligence technologies also used in many health applications such as medical image
      analysis, biological signal analysis, etc. In this study, we aimed to demonstrate the
      effectiveness of the deep learning algorithm in the diagnosis of cervical myelomalacia
      compared to conventional diagnostic methods.
