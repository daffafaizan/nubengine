      joint replacement remains the definitive management for refractory, end-stage disease. The
      Mayo Clinic has a large, ongoing experience using autologous adipose derived mesenchymal
      stromal cells (AMSCs) for the treatment of a variety of other diseases under INDs. Thus far,
      the treatments have been well tolerated. These data along with the investigators'
      pre-clinical animal studies and published experiences using related approaches lead the
      investigators to believe that this approach provides a reasonable safety profile to treat
      patients with refractory painful knee OA. The purpose of the current study is to investigate
      the safety and feasibility of single and multiple injections of autologous, culture expanded
      AMSCs in subjects with painful, refractory knee OA. Subjects with unilaterally symptomatic
      mild to severe knee OA will be enrolled based on satisfaction of inclusion and exclusion
      criteria.
