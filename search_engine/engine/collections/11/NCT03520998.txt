    
      This is a randomized, double-blind, dose-comparison concurrent control study to assess the
      safety, tolerability, and feasibility of GRF6019, a plasma-derived product, administered by
      intravenous (IV) infusion to subjects with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease.

      Subjects will be randomized 1:1 to a low dose or a high dose of active treatment in a
      double-blind manner. All subjects will receive one infusion per day at the randomized dose
      for 5 consecutive days during Week 1 and, again, during Week 13 (for a total of 10 doses per
      subject). All IV infusions will take place at an inpatient research unit while the follow-up
      visits after each treatment period will be on an outpatient basis. Subjects will participate
      for a total of 6 months in this study.
