      hours from onset are included. The experimental group receive basic treatment and remote
      ischemic conditioning for 200mmHg, 2 times within 6 hours to 24 hours from thrombolysis. The
      control group receive basic treatment and remote ischemic conditioning control for 60mmHg, 2
      times within 6 hours to 24 hours from thrombolysis . Two groups will be followed up for 90
      days to evaluate the efficacy and safety of remote ischemic conditioning combined with
      intravenous thrombolysis in treating acute ischemic stroke.
