      patients with ALS. Eligible patients were randomized (1:1:1:1) to receive placebo or one of
      three doses of reldesemtiv (150, 300, or 450 mg twice daily) for 12 weeks. Randomization was
      stratified by riluzole concomitant use/non-use and edaravone concomitant use/non-use.
      Concomitant riluzole and edaravone were allowed as long as the riluzole dose had been stable
      for at least 30 days prior to screening and edaravone had been taken for 2 cycles prior to
      screening; these drugs could not be initiated during the study.

      A total of 7 study visits were planned: screening, Day 1 (first dosing day), Weeks 2, 4, 8,
      and 12, and follow-up (4 weeks after the last dose of study drug). Study drug (placebo or
      reldesemtiv) was to be taken twice daily, approximately 12 hours (Â± 2 hours) apart and within
      2 hours following a meal.
