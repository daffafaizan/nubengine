      clinically significant (A2142G, A2142C, A2143G, A2143C), while all the other mutations were
      considered clinically insignificant.

      Participants who did not have point mutations related to clarithromycin resistance and/or had
      clinically insignificant point mutations were treated with PAC (proton pump inhibitor,
      amoxicillin, clarithromycin) for 7 days, while participants with clinically significant point
      mutations were treated with PAM (proton pump inhibitor, amoxicillin, metronidazole) for 7
      days. H. pylori eradication rates were compared between the two groups.
