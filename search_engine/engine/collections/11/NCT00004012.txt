      recurrent ovarian epithelial, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal carcinoma treated with
      oral capecitabine. II. Determine the tolerability and safety of this regimen in these
      patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral capecitabine twice daily for 14 days. Treatment continues
      every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-35 patients will be accrued for this study.
