      be performed after standard chemotherapy or hormone-directed treatment. This will allow
      evaluation of how the NaF PET scans change with the chemotherapy or hormone-directed therapy.
      In addition, NaF PET scans will be compared with standard computed tomography (CT) and bone
      scans, as well as prostate specific antigen (PSA). This information could be used to develop
      better ways to measure prostate cancer bone lesions. In turn, this could be used to better
      evaluate treatment effects of standard chemotherapy and other new drugs being developed to
      treat prostate cancer.
