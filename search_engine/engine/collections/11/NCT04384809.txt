    
      This is a randomized control trial comparing the use of leukocyte rich platelet rich plasma
      injections to percutaneous tenotomy for the treatment of chronic common extensor
      tendinopathy. Patients with a history of common extensor tendinopathy for greater than 3
      months, refractory to conservative treatments, are randomized into one of two groups:
      injection with leukocyte rich platelet rich plasma or percutaneous tenotomy with the Tenex
      system. Both groups of patients are followed up in clinic at 1 week, 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3
      months, 6 months, and 1 year following the procedure to examine levels of pain or
      complications following both procedures.
