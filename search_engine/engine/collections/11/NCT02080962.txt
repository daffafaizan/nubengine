        -  Gross tumor volume (GTV): disease clinically visible / palpable

        -  clinical target volume (CTV): equal to GTV

        -  planned treatment volume (PTV):

        -  tumors ≤ 2 cm in diameter, with 5-10 mm CTV margin

        -  tumors> 2-5 cm in diameter, with 15-20 mm CTV margin

        -  Marking the GTV and PTV pen back projection

        -  photograph of the treatment area

        -  protections of the normal structures with blocks of lead, if necessary
