      evaluated in this pilot study consists of 3 basic components: a surgeon's console,
      articulated mechanical arms and sterilizable instruments. The console includes a computer,
      video monitor and instrument controls, and is located in the operating room adjacent to the
      operating room table. The console is connected via computer to the mechanical arms holding
      the endoscope (surgical TV camera) and sterile surgical tools (e.g., forceps, scissors,
      electrocautery, etc.). These arms are located immediately adjacent to the patient on the
      operating room table. The surgeon sits at the console and controls the position and movement
      of the arms and surgical tools. The design of these tools is based upon well-established,
      commonly used surgical instruments. The da Vinci® Robotic Surgical System (Intuitive
      Surgical, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) is a "manual image-guided surgery" system that is computer
      enhanced rather than "computer guided robotic surgery" in which the surgeon programs the
      computer to do the surgery and the robot does the surgery (also known as a "milling"
      device).22 Use of the da Vinci® Robotic Surgical System (Intuitive Surgical, Inc., Sunnyvale,
      CA) in the aforementioned configuration in fact facilitates an exact translation of the
      surgeon's hand and finger movements at the console to precise and tremor-free movements of
      the arms and instruments.
