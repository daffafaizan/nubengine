      Gy, can limit the rate and the severity of complications degrading the quality of life by
      complications (pain, diminished visual acuity) and treatments (intra-ocular injections...).

      In this study, patients will receive a total dose of 52 Gy in four 13 Gy sessions for the
      standard arm and in eight 6.5 Gy sessions for the experimental arm.

      The investigators expect an identical local control rate within 2 year's time with a decrease
      in rate and severity of severe complications due to adapted fractionation (eight sessions
      with lower doses instead of four fractions with very high doses as it is usually recommended
      in the guidelines for small to medium melanomas).
