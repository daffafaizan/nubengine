      complicated parapneumonic effusion who are felt to require fibrinolytic therapy will be
      considered for study enrollment. Enrolled patients will be randomized to one of five
      potential treatment arms (saline placebo, 4 mg once daily, 4 mg twice daily, 10 mg once
      daily, or 10 mg twice daily) in a double-blinded manner.
