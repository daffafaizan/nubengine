      (especially in memory and executive functions) that may last from a few days to a few weeks
      after surgery. It is a common and impactful outcome of surgical procedures in older adults.
      The pathophysiology and causative mechanisms for POCD are poorly understood. It is supposed
      to be associated with numerous factors such as ages, trauma, inflammation, surgical stress,
      position, fluid, MBP, artificial pneumoperitoneum , PCO2, FiO2.

      The robot-assisted radical cystectomy (RARC) is increasingly utilized. In patients undergoing
      RARC, Although prolonged Trendelenburg position and pneumoperitoneum can increase the
      cerebral blood flow, there were studies showed that the excessive cerebral perfusion can lead
      to encephalemia, which reduce the oxygen uptake of brain tissue and cause insufficient
      oxygenation of brain tissue at the cellular level. POCD may take place due to cerebral
      hemodynamic changes. Contemporary, intraoperative fluid restriction, a relatively long time
      of operation and surgical stress may also contribute to POCD.

      The goal of the current study is to investigate the combined effect of this position and CO2
      pneumoperitoneum on POCD during RARC with the monitor of cerebral oxygen.
