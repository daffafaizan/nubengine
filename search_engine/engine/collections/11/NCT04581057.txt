      particular the role of inflammation in the development of atherosclerosis), predicting their
      occurrence remains largely difficult. Aging remains the most powerful factor for predicting
      the occurrence of myocardial infarction, independently from other identified risk factors.
      Few years ago, acquired mutations were described in the hematopoietic system of apparently
      healthy subjects. This phenomenon, now described as CHIP (Clonal Hematopoiesis of
      Indeterminate Potential) is more frequently observed in elderly people, and has been recently
      linked to an increased risk of cardio-vascular events. Experiments in mice demonstrated that
      these CHIPs are responsible for an inflammation that supports the development of
      atherosclerosis. However the link between CHIP, inflammation and atherosclerosis has never
      been demonstrated in humans.

      In this study, the investigators will search for an increased frequency of CHIP in patients
      with a first cardio-vascular event (CVE). Seven months after the CVE, a blood sample will be
      taken. Mutations in the 9 most frequently mutated genes in CHIP will be evaluated by Next
      Generation Sequencing. Systemic inflammation will be evaluated by measurement of circulating
      levels of CRP, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-α. Atherosclerosis will be evaluated via the volume
      of atherosclerotic plaques as assessed by 3D ultrasound analysis. The presence of CHIP will
      be correlated to traditional cardiovascular risk factors, systemic inflammation markers and
      the level of atherosclerosis. The investigators will also assess the relationship between the
      presence of CHIP and the risk of CVE reoccurrence.
