      training, biofeedback, genograms, and self-expression through words, drawings, and movement
      in a small group setting. These groups have been used in war-traumatize populations in
      Kosovo, Gaza and the United States. This study will be investigating the effect of the
      mind-body skills groups on boys with behavioral and emotional problem at a high school in
      Gaza to determine if there is improvement in behavioral and emotional problems, aggression,
      and posttraumatic stress disorder. The results will be compared to a control high school with
      boys who will not be attending mind-body skills groups and who have experienced similar
      levels of trauma and also have behavioral and emotional problems.

      The mind-body skills groups will be held for 2 hours once a week for 10 weeks and then once a
      month for 10 months. Measures will be taken at baseline, after the 10 week mind-body skills
      group program and again at 10 month follow-up.
