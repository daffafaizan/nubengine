    
      The GuardianTM is a new extraglottic airway device which brings together features of both the
      LMA ProSealTM (high seal cuff, gastric access and bite block - to facilitate ventilation,
      airway protection and airway obstruction, respectively) and the LMA UniqueTM (single use -
      prevention of disease transmission). In the following randomized, non-crossover study, the
      investigators test the hypothesis that ease of insertion, oropharyngeal leak pressure,
      fiberoptic position and ease of gastric tube placement differ between the GuardianTM and the
      LMA SupremeTM in paralyzed, anesthetized patients.
