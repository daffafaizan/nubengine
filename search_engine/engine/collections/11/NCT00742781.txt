      developed countries over the last 50 years. We propose that decreased outdoor activity and
      increased pollution and diets that lack adequate vitamin D have combined to create large
      fluctuations in vitamin D status in developed countries and especially in populations that
      experience winter. Experimentally we've shown that changes in vitamin D status results in
      more severe forms of experimental IBD. In addition, active vitamin D (1,25(OH)2D3) completely
      blocks the development of experimental IBD. The vitamin D hypothesis proposes that vitamin D
      regulates the development and function of the immune system and that changes in vitamin D
      status affect the development of the resultant immune response and the development of
      diseases like IBD. Our hypothesis is that because of low dietary vitamin D intakes and
      malabsorption of many nutrients, Crohn's patients will have low circulating vitamin D levels
      that are detrimental for their health. We plan to give Crohn's patients 1000 IU of vitamin
      D/d and determine whether this dose is well tolerated, induces an increase in circulating
      vitamin D levels and has any additional health benefits (improved bone markers, Crohn's
      disease activity scores, inflammatory markers).
