      pneumonia result in hospitalization. It is the leading cause of community-acquired infection
      requiring ICU admission.1 Especially elderly patients may have a severe illness with a high
      morbidity and mortality rate. In pulmonary infections, the release of cytokines and other
      inflammatory mediators from alveolar macrophages serves as a useful mechanism in the
      elimination of invading pathogens. However, this natural reaction can be potentially harmful
      when excessive release of circulating inflammatory cytokines causes damage to the patient,
      particularly the lung.

      Interest in the role of corticosteroids in the pathophysiology of critical illness has
      existed since the early part of the 20th century. On ICU, early treatment with
      corticosteroids to attenuate systemic inflammation is widespread. At the same time, outside
      the ICU little evidence is available on the effect of treatment with corticosteroids in
      patients diagnosed with CAP. Hypothetically, early initiated administration of
      corticosteroids in the course of a CAP can lower systemic and pulmonary inflammation. This
      may lead to earlier resolution of pneumonia and a reduction of complications (sepsis,
      mortality).
