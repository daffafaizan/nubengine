      deprivation therapy (ADT) with or without chemotherapy or hormone therapy. Additionally, for
      some patients with specific disease features, standard treatment may also include ablative
      treatment (radiation or surgery) of the prostate gland if this was not completed prior to
      enrolling into this study.

      Ablative Therapy is a procedure used to destroy cancer cells and tissue. In this study
      Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) or surgery will be used to destroy prostate cancer
      metastases. It is not clear if ablative therapy (SBRT or surgery) to all sites of disease
      used in combination with standard systemic therapy can offer better results than standard
      treatment alone.
