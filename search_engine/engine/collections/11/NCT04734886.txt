      assess their eligibility for the study (Visit 1). Participants deemed suitable for the study
      will be randomized into two study arms (placebo, probiotic) before undergoing a baseline
      visit (Visit 2) before the start of the intervention period. During the 6-month intervention
      period, the participants will attend study visits at 3 months (Visit 3) into the intervention
      as well as at the end of intervention (at 6 months, Visit 4). Blood, saliva, and faecal
      samples will be collected at visits 2-4. In addition to sampling, during the whole
      intervention period, the participants will fill out a weekly questionnaire in which they are
      asked to record any possible symptoms of COVID-19. The participants' dietary habits are
      assessed via a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) before the start of the intervention
      period. Also, the participants are asked to maintain their habitual diet and lifestyle as
      well as not to consume any other probiotic or prebiotic supplements.
