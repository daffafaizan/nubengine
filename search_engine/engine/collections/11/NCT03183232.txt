      patient will be separated from peripheral blood. After making them potential cancer killer γδ
      T Cell and DC-CIK, they will be infused to the patients as an immunotherapy treatment.

      NOTE: Originally, our designed proposal was to use autologous PBMCs from cancer patients to
      ex vivo expand Vγ9Vδ2-T cells, and then perform adoptive transfer therapy. However, PBMCs of
      majority of cancer patients could not be effectively expanded, including cell number, cell
      purity and cell function could not meet the requirements of reinfusion. Meanwhile, those
      patients could not tolerate 100ml of blood drawing for culture every 2 ~ 3 weeks.

      Therefore, we submitted new clinical study application to the ethical committee of the Fuda
      Hospital affiliated with Jinan University (Guangzhou, PR. China) by changing the autologous
      protocol with the allogeneic protocol. After the allogeneic protocol was approved, we adapted
      allogeneic cells instead of autologous in our subsequentially clinical study.
