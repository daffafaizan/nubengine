      high cost. Sometimes patients do not make it to laboratory testing if a lab is not available
      on site. Delays in testing can affect medical outcomes or patients can be lost to follow up.

      Group K developed a paper microfluidic platform with an accompanying mobile application(app).
      The paper microfluidic device is a simple, inexpensive wax backed device with three testing
      areas. These areas have a mix of dried proprietary reagents that when combined with a
      patients drop of blood, or in the future, saliva or urine, will produce results in a color
      change. An app is then used to interpret the color change and output results to a doctor. The
      target population is adults who have an indication to collect a liver function panel that
      will be drawn on the same day as their clinic visit or during their inpatient hospital
