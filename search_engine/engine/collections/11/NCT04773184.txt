      respiratory muscles in order to establish normal parameters. It will take approximately
      90-120 minutes to complete. During this examination, you will have respiratory testing, cough
      testing, lingual testing, voice testing, and will be asked to fill out some surveys. We will
      then complete the swallowing test that uses both a moving x-ray and a small camera will be
      inserted into the open passage of your nose to the back of your throat to watch your swallow
      and look at your vocal folds (voice box). This will allow us to compare normal physiology and
      function of swallowing and breathing muscles to people with a medical history that would put
      them at risk for a swallowing problem. Our goal is to identify the best tests that can be
      quickly and easily administered to accurately detect swallowing impairment in adults. Your
      involvement is limited to a single 2-hour evaluation.
