      treatments for the first Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) episode among hospitalized
      patients. From each patient, a fecal sample was obtained at days 0, 3, and 7 after treatment.
      Specimens are cultured to isolate C. difficile, and C. difficile are assessed for the
      presence of genes encoding enterotoxin (tcdB), cytotoxin (tcdA), the binary toxin A (cdtA),
      binary toxin B (cdtB), and deletions within the negative regulator of toxin A and B
      production (tcdC) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The minimum inhibitory concentrations
      (MICs) of ciprofloxacin, moxifloxacin, erythromycin, clindamycin, vancomycin, metronidazole,
      linezolid, fidaxomicin, and tetracycline against C. difficile are measured using the agar
      dilution method. Fecal samples and FMT-FURM are analyzed by 16 subunit ribosomal ribonucleic
      acid (16S rRNA) metagenomic sequencing.
