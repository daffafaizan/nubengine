      cancer has evolved and continues to evolve. The exact role of locoregional radiation,
      including axillary, supraclavicular and internal mammary nodes is, however, not clear.
      Radiation-induced toxicity remains a limiting factor to expanding the indications for
      radiation therapy to axillary and internal mammary nodes in the treatment of stage IIB and
      III breast cancer. Excellent target coverage and normal tissue sparing of IMRT has been
      previously demonstrated dosimetrically and clinically. In this feasibility study, patients
      will receive 50 Gy of radiation therapy in 25 fractions to the chest wall and
      supraclavicular, axillary and IM nodal areas using HT-IMRT following breast conserving
      surgery or mastectomy and chemotherapy. Patients will also be eligible for a radiation boost
      to 12 Gy by HT-IMRT or HDR brachytherapy. It is expected that treatment with HT-IMRT will
      result in appreciably fewer side-effects following locoregional irradiation due to a
      reduction in normal tissue irradiation, as compared to conventional radiation therapy.
