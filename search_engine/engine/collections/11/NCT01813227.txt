    
      Waldenstr√∂m's macroglobulinemia (WM) is a rare low-grade B-cell lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma.
      Overall reported incidences approximately 3 cases per million persons per year with about
      1500 and cases diagnosed annually in United States. There is a higher incidence in males
      compared to females (3.4 vs 1.7 cases per 1 million person-years at risk) and WM is nearly
      twice as common among whites compared to blacks.[1] A familial form of the disease is also
      recognized. WM is an indolent disease with an overall median survival of 5 years although
      more recent data suggest a disease-specific median survival of 11.2 years, given the
      frequently older age (median 63 years) and accompanying co-morbidities at diagnosis(1). WM is
      characterized by infiltration of lymphoplasmacytic cells and bone marrow and by serum
      immunoglobulin M (IgM) monoclonal gammopathy. B-cell origin and some clinical cellular and
      epidemiological features are shared among WM arises from intermediately mature B cells
      (somatically mutated post germinal center the lymphocytes that have not yet undergone isotype
      switching), as opposed to immature B cells from which chronic lymphocytic leukemia arises in
      the fully mature, somatically mutated, from which cells multiple myeloma arises.

      There is no standard of care for WM (2). Therefore, involving the patient's in clinical
      trials is strongly recommended whenever possible.
