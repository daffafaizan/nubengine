      Effect on coronary artery atherosclerosis / the progression of atherosclerosis Effect on
      inflammatory and oxidation biomarkers Cholesterol lowering effect Effect on microcirculation

      Type of study:

      Randomized double blind controlled trial

      Number of patients: 80 patients

      Duration of the study:

      The patients will be studied for one year after they have entered the study. The total time
      of the study duration from the including date of the first patient to the analysis of the
      last patient entering the study estimated to be 2-3 years. An inclusion rate off 1 to 2
      patients per week.

      Treatment:

      Dose: Treated with a placebo capsule or a capsule containing a total of AGE 2400 mg daily for
      1 year (2 Kyolic capsule (600 mg) twice daily).

      Methods:

      Placebo-controlled double blind randomized trial to determine whether AGE can influence the
      rate of atherosclerosis plaque burden measured by coronary artery calcium, improve vascular
      function and microcirculation and favorably change biomarkers of oxidative stress.

      Randomization:

      The participants are assigned to AGE or placebo in a double-blinded manner, using numbered
      containers assigned to a computer-generated randomization chart by a nurse coordinator.
