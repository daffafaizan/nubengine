      2014 to February 10, 2016，patients with STEMI who prepared to accept PCI were screened
      according to the inclusion criteria. All patients for eligibility for the study received
      orally a 300 mg loading dose (LD) of plain aspirin and a 180mg loading dose (LD) of plain
      ticagrelor and then signed a written informed consent to participate in the study.Then,the
      patients were randomly assigned to four treatment groups.The patients in group A would be
      administrated intravenous morphine 5mg and metoclopramide 10mg,the patients in group B would
      be administrated intravenous morphine 5mg and 0.9%normal saline 2ml,the patients in group C
      would be administrated intravenous metoclopramide 10mg and 0.9%normal saline 2ml, the
      patients in group D would be administrated intravenous 0.9%normal saline 2mland 0.9%normal
      saline 2ml. Subsequently，all patients would received orally plain aspirin 100mg once a day
      and plain ticagrelor 90mg twice a day and 1 month of follow-up.The investigators would
      calculate the platelet response index before LD and 0.5h,2h,8h after LD by platelet
      vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein phosphorylation assay with flow cytometry instrument(BD
      FACS Calibur). The primary study end-point was platelet response index by PRI VASP 2 hours
      after LD. Secondary end-points were (1) The platelet response index by PRI VASP half an hour
      and 8 hours after LD.(2)Record the electrocardiogram changes(the incidence of a 70% reduction
      after PCI ,TIMI flow of crime vessels(TIMI flow frames),the incidence of acute/subacute
      thrombotic events,the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular
      events,the incidence of primary and secondary bleeding.
