      treatment of individuals in an outpatient settings with mild SARS-CoV-2 infection. The
      primary outcome is focused on the evaluation of efficacy of the proposed experimental drugs
      in reducing upper respiratory viral shedding, defined as viral clearance (i.e., negative
      swab) on Day 7. Key secondary outcomes focus on other measures of viral shedding, safety
      evaluation, progression to LRTI (defined by resting blood oxygen saturation level [SpO2] <93%
      sustained for two readings two hours apart and presence of subjective dyspnoea or cough),
      disease severity, clinical resolution rate, and cumulative incidence of hospitalization or
      mortality at Day 28.
