      renal disease in Germany, approximately 35% of the patients starting on dialysis are affected
      by diabetes-induced nephropathy. This can be seen in countries all over the world. This
      situation has been known for years. To date, neither structured intervention methods nor
      educational programs have been designed for and targeting those affected, which would
      consequently allow for structured, multifactorial intervention at an early stage of diabetic
      nephropathy. Multifactorial interventions, as published in the Steno-2 trial, appear to be
      highly effective with regard to long-term complications of diabetes. In order to realize this
      approach for the affected as well as the medical staff caring for patients with
      diabetes-induced nephropathy we developed DiaNeÂ®, a consultation and support program, which
      is designed to give detailed information to the affected in order to induce behavioral
      changes. We were able to show a clinically significant reduction of microalbuminuria within a
      first monocenter evaluation trial. We wanted to verify this effect by means of a prospective
      multicenter randomized cohort trial according to GCP-ICH guidelines.
