    
      The study is an interventional triple-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group design with 2
      arms (placebo, dietary fiber). Healthy male participants adhere to their normal eating habits
      for the duration of the study (32 days). At the baseline study visit, measurements are taken
      in the lab, including biological samples and psychophysiological measurements. Participants
      then consume placebo or dietary fiber for 4 weeks and revisit the lab on day 32 for a second
      measurement of the outcomes of interest. Specifically, we investigate the effect of dietary
      fiber on affective processing, including stress sensitivity and fear-related processes (e.g.
      extinction learning). Volunteers also respond to questionnaires in relation to mood and GI
      symptoms, and provide biological samples (saliva, blood, faecal, and urine samples) for
      analysis of cortisol levels, circulating short chain fatty acids and serum BDNF, faecal SCFA
      and microbiota composition, and intestinal permeability, respectively.
