    
      The study is divided into 5 parts: a 4-week dose escalation period, a 4-week stable dosing
      period, a 5-week stable dosing period, a 59-week long-term exposure period, and an optional
      follow-up treatment period for eligible participants who continue treatment with LUM001.
      Participants in the optional follow-up treatment period will continue to receive study drug
      until they are eligible to enter another LUM001 study or until LUM001 is available
      commercially, whichever occurs first.
