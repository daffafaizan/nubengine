      dialysis for at least 1 year, by self-administered questionnaires using standardized
      instruments and passed among a representative sample of subjects included in the nine
      participating regions kidney system. The first study in 2005, it is required to be repeated
      during the plan period (theoretically in 2007, 2009 and 2011).

      Three studies will be carried out between 2005 and 2010. The progress of each study is the
      same.

      The random draw of eligible patients, according to a stratification by region and age group
      is carried out by the Biostatistics and Medical Informatics Service of the Necker Hospital in
      Paris, responsible for basic SIMS-REIN, for data center in the regions Champagne-Ardenne,
      Languedoc-Roussillon, Limousin and Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur. For Auvergne, Bretagne,
      Lorraine and Rhône-Alpes, which operate independently for the collection of data REIN, the
      random draw of patients is done by each epidemiological center responsible for this
      collection.

      The Biostatistics and Medical Informatics Service of the Necker Hospital, and epidemiological
      centers of Auvergne, Bretagne, Lorraine and Rhône Alpes must submit the list of selected
      patients Clinical Research Associate (CRA) national.
