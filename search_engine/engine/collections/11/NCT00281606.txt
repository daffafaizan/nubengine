    
      This study is designed to assess the tolerability of different forms (liquid, capsules or
      tablets) of lopinavir/ritonavir given once-daily as part of combination therapy for HIV
      infection. Study subjects will be those tolerating a stable regimen of HIV medications with
      undetectable levels of HIV in their blood. They will be assigned by chance to receive once
      daily liquid or soft gel capsules of lopinavir/ritonavir for up to four weeks. At that time
      they will receive the alternative formulation for up to four weeks. They will then be given
      once daily lopinavir/ritonavir in the recently released tablet formulation. After up to four
      weeks of each of these formulations several assessments will be made of the overall
      tolerability of the drug. After four weeks of tablets they will be allowed to take whatever
      regimen they want and will be followed for an additional 36 weeks for a total duration of
      study of up to 48 weeks. The pharmacokinetics of each formulation of lopinavir/ritonavir
      given once daily will also be assessed in a subset of study subjects.
