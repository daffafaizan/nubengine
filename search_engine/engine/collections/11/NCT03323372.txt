      and G2-experimental) were selected for this study. Both gels act in the same way, the
      difference between them is the concentration. In both groups, the different desensitizing
      gels were applied to the vestibular surface of the anterior superior teeth with the aid of a
      tray, remaining in position according to the time specified by the manufacturers. In the
      control group, a gel based on 5% potassium nitrate and 2% sodium fluoride was used, while in
      the experimental group, the gel was based on 3% potassium nitrate and 0.25% sodium fluoride.
      After removal of the desensitizing gel, both groups were subjected to bleaching with 40%
      hydrogen peroxide gel for 40 minutes. Patients recorded an occurrence or not of dental
      sensitivity (SD) in a sensitivity diary for 48 hours. A Verbal Evaluation Scale (VRS) and a
      Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) were used for pain assessment. The values were organized into two
      categories: percentage of patients who presented SD at some time of treatment (absolute risk
      of sensitivity) and SD intensity. To evaluate the color before the first bleaching session,
      and after 7, 14 and 28 days, two methods were used: objective evaluation using the
      spectrophotometer and subjective evaluation using two color scales: Vita Classical and Vita
      Bleachedguide 3D-MASTER. An analysis of the data followed the intent-to-treat protocol and
      involved all randomly allocated participants. The absolute risk of SD was compared using
      Fisher's exact test (Î± = 5%). The Mann-Whitney test was used to compare the intensity of SD.

      Student's t test was used to compare the color change. The level of significance adopted in
      all tests was 5%.
