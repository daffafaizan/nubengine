    
      Outpatient Veterans age 50 years and older at the West Los Angeles VA Medical Center who have
      chronic musculoskeletal pain complete baseline questionnaires and are randomized into one of
      two forms of psychotherapy: Emotional Awareness and Expression Therapy (EAET), which helps
      patients make connections between avoided or conflicted emotions and pain, or Cognitive
      Behavior Therapy (CBT), which teaches pain coping skills. Each treatment is delivered by an
      experienced therapist and includes one 90-minute individual session and eight 90-minute group
      sessions (in small groups of 8 Veterans). Patients in both conditions complete post-treatment
      and 3-month follow-up questionnaires. Outcomes of each type of psychotherapy are compared and
      mediators of treatment response are evaluated.
