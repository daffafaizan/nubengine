    
      There are three aims outlined as part of this research study.

      Aim 1 is to study the natural history of a carefully characterized cohort of patients with WD
      followed longitudinally at Centers of Excellence for WD in the United States and in the
      United Kingdom.

      Aim 2 seeks to evaluate parameters for diagnosis and treatment monitoring for patients on
      chelation therapy and zinc treatment for their WD. Data gathered in Specific aim 1 will be
      used for analyzing the components of the diagnostic scores for patients.

      Aim 3 is intended to determine whether a composite index or a biomarker can be used as
      surrogate marker for treatment monitoring for current patients on therapy that can be used
      for future patient treatment trials.
