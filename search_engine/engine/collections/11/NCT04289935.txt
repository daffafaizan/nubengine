      of breast conserving surgery, has lately become common practice in the primary treatment of
      breast cancer. The use of modern NAC regimens lead to a complete pathologic remission (pCR)
      of the tumor in more than 50% in aggressive tumor types.

      In general, it is difficult to predict pCR in the absence of invasive surgical techniques, as
      it depends on several factors such as biological subtype, the used chemotherapy regimen and
      anatomic stage. The most common imaging methods beside clinical examination are breast
      ultrasound, mammography and breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). As NAC induces different
      response patterns, radiologic imaging is not sufficiently accurate in predicting residual
      disease. Because of this uncertainty, surgery (and the standardized assessment of resected
      tissue) is so far the only valid option to either ascertain complete response or to remove
      the complete residual disease.

      Vacuum-assisted biopsy (VAB) with the possibility of obtaining tissue of the former tumor
      center could contribute more reliably to detect any residual tumor or respectively, rule out
      residual disease. Ultrasound (US) or mammographically (MG) guided VAB will be used in this
      trial in order to detect residual tumor lesions in patients with radiological complete
      response (rCR) after NAC. The investigators will evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the
      post-NAC VAB sample in comparison to the sample obtained in open surgery.

      The main objective of the trial is to determine the diagnostic accuracy of the post-NAC VAB
      in determining pCR compared to open surgery.
