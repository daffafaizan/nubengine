    
      Alice PDx is a portable, diagnostic recording device. It may be used for obstructive sleep
      screening as well as follow-up and diagnostic assessment. The device may be used in a sleep
      lab or clinical setting by trained professionals and it may be used at home by patients as
      directed by their health care provider. The Alice PDx device is not currently approved by the
      Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

      The Alice PDx device is capable of recording various physiological inputs and storing the
      data locally on a removable storage card. The device may also be connected directly to a PC
      (personal computer) running the Alice Sleepware software application. Sleepware can display
      live or pre-recorded data in a resolution consistent with the computer hardware
      specifications.
