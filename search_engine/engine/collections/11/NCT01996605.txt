      route for analgesia in humans. Oxytocin containing cells in the dorsal parvocellular division
      of the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) project to the spinal cord (1). Noxious stimulation
      activates these cells via the A1 noradrenergic relay in the pons (2) and produces analgesia
      by spinal release of oxytocin, since intrathecal injection of an oxytocin receptor antagonist
      worsens pain behaviors from peripheral inflammation (3). Direct electrical stimulation of the
      PVN reduces dorsal horn neuronal responses to noxious stimulation, and this is blocked by
      administration of sequestering antibody for oxytocin (4). Similarly, direct electrical
      stimulation of the PVN reduces behavioral sensitivity in a model of chronic neuropathic pain,
      and this effect is blocked by an oxytocin receptor antagonist (5). Intrathecal injection of
      oxytocin in normal rats reduces dorsal horn neuronal responses to noxious stimuli (6) as well
      as behavioral responses to noxious thermal (3), mechanical (3), and chemical (7) stimuli.
      Finally, intrathecal injection of oxytocin in rat models of chronic pain also reduces dorsal
      horn neuronal responses to sensory stimulation (6) as well as behavioral responses to thermal
      (5) and mechanical (7) stimuli.

      Rationale: We anticipate that oxytocin will be effective after spinal injection in humans
      against chemical induced hypersensitivity states.

      Objectives: Determine the effect of intrathecal oxytocin on areas and intensity of
      hyperalgesia and allodynia induced by topical capsaicin.
