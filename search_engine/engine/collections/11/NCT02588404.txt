      prostate patients who have been treated with hormonal and radiation treatment after
      biochemical failure

      Original biopsy slides of 65 patients will be collected and reviewed. A tissue used to test
      and map DNA fragments will be constructed from patients who underwent radiation therapy. RNA
      and DNA will be extracted from each slide. This study, if positive, will establish the
      predictive value of TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion in prostate cancer patients. It can lead to
      believe that high-risk prostate cancer patients will benefit from a more aggressive
      treatment.

      An endpoint of this study is to evaluate the relation between the Gleason score and the
      TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion. Another is to evaluate the relation between the T-stage and
      TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion.
