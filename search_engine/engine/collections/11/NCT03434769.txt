    
      Primary Objective: To determine the safety of the treatment of relapsed or refractory B cell
      lymphomas with chimeric antigen receptor T cells targeting cluster of differentiation antigen
      19 (CD19) and to find the recommended phase II dose for this cellular therapy

      Secondary Objectives

        -  To describe the safety profile of the infusion of CAR-T cells targeting CD19.

        -  To describe the toxicities related to infusion of CAR-T cells targeting CD19.

        -  To describe the overall response rate and complete response rate of relapsed B cell
           malignancies treated with CAR-T cells targeting CD19.
