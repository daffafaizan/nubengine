      hypothyroidism and hypophosphatasia in patients diagnosed with calcium pyrophosphate
      dihydrate (CPPD) deposition disease is uncertain.

      Patients diagnosed with CPPD deposition disease were compared to patients with rheumatoid
      arthritis and psoriatic arthritis over a 9-year period. All patients were prospectively
      followed for at least 12 months. Serum calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase,
      thyroid-stimulating hormone, ferritin, iron, and total iron binding capacity were determined
      in all patients.
