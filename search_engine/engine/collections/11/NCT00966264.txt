      in the treatment of menorrhagia.Overall, 236 women aged 35 to 49 years who were menstruating,
      had completed their family size, and were eligible for both treatments were randomized to
      either receive a LNG-IUS (n=119) or undergo hysterectomy (n=117). The follow-up visits took
      place six months and 12 months after the treatment, and again five and ten years after the
      randomization. The primary outcome measures were health related quality of life (HRQoL),
      other measures of psychosocial well-being (anxiety, depression, sexual functioning), and
      costs. The amount of menstrual blood loss was objectively measured before treatment and after
      one and five years. The one year the results were published in 2001 (Lancet 2001;357:273) and
      the five year results in 2004 (JAMA 2004; 291:1456).
