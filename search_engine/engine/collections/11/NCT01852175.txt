      treatment for prevention of thrombotic events in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD)
      undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). However, there are a considerable number
      of patients who continue to have recurrent ischemic events despite this treatment regimen.
      These observations underscore the need for more potent antiplatelet therapies. Recently, two
      P2Y12 receptor inhibitors have been approved for clinical use: prasugrel and ticagrelor. Both
      prasugrel and ticagrelor have shown to be associated with more potent antiplatelet effects
      compared with clopidogrel. These more favorable pharmacodynamic effects translate into
      reduced ischemic event rates, at the expense of an increased risk of bleeding in patients
      with acute coronary syndromes. Overall, these drugs are associated with an improved net
      clinical benefit. These findings from large-scale clinical investigations have led to
      approval of prasugrel and ticagrelor. However, to date there are limited head-to-head
      comparisons of these two new agents.
