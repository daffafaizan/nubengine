      determining the presence of an intracranial hematoma that may require neurosurgical
      intervention. An expanding hematoma can lead to significant neurological morbidity or death
      due to brainstem compression or further ischemic injury. Unfortunately, no single physical
      sign, symptom, or score reliably indicates the presence of an intracranial hematoma. A
      computerized tomography (CT) scan of the head is the gold standard for emergent
      identification and localization of acute intracranial hematomas. However, the ionizing
      radiation from CT scans is associated with an increased risk of developing malignancies. Near
      infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a non-invasive technology that may be useful as an adjunctive
      modality to CT scanning for early identification of intracranial hematomas. A hand-held NIRS
      device called the Infrascanner has shown about 90% sensitivity and specificity for detecting
      intracranial hematomas in adults and a few small studies have shown similar results in
      children. The present study will aim to validate this device in a wide age range of pediatric
      subjects and in multiple hospital settings where this device may serve as a valuable
      screening tool.
