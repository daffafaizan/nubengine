      Primary

        -  Determine the activity and safety of brostallicin vs doxorubicin hydrochloride as
           first-line therapy in patients with relapsed, refractory, or metastatic soft tissue
           sarcoma.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      participating and age(younger than 60 years vs 60 years and over). Patients are randomized to
      1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive brostallicin IV over 10 minutes on day 1.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive doxorubicin hydrochloride IV over 10 minutes on day 1. In both
           arms, treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease
           progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 30 days and then every 12 weeks
      thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 108 patients will be accrued for this study.
