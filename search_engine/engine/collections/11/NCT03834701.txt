      increased in the last decades. The mainstay treatment of PanNENs is surgery, which is
      associated with a significant benefit in term of survival but also with significant short-
      and long-term adverse events.

      Based on the above data, less invasive alternative therapeutic interventions to avoid short-
      and long-term adverse events of surgery are needed.

      In this context radiofrequency ablation has been reported to be effective in the treatment of
      these tumors in absence of major adverse events. However, the available studies on the matter
      are limited by small sample size and lack of standardized criteria for patient selection.
