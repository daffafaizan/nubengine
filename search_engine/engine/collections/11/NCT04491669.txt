           < 60 ml/min/ 1.73 m2 and/or evidence of kidney damage (usually indicated by albuminuria
           or proteinuria) for > 3 months or more irrespective of cause (Kiapidou et al., 2019).

        -  Chronic Renal Failure stages are classified according to the National Kidney Foundation
           in to five stages according to estimated GFR (Ikizler 2009).

        -  The prevalence of Chronic Renal Failure is continuously rising in concert with the
           rising epidemic of its risk factors including ageing, diabetes, obesity, metabolic
           syndrome, smoking, and hypertension (Stevens and Levin 2013).

        -  Gastrointestinal bleeding, is all forms of bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract, from
           the mouth to the rectum. When there is significant blood loss over a short time,
           symptoms may include vomiting red blood, vomiting black blood, bloody stool, or black
           stool. Small amounts of bleeding over a long time may cause iron-deficiency anemia
           resulting in feeling tired or heart-related chest pain.

      Other symptoms may include abdominal pain, shortness of breath, pale skin, or passing out.
      Sometimes in those with small amounts of bleeding no symptoms may be present. (Bong Sik

      â€¢ Preliminary data suggest an association between Chronic Renal Failure and Gastrointestinal
      Bleeding. Individuals with even mild to moderate Chronic Renal Failure warrant clinical
      attention regarding the risk of hospitalization with Gastrointestinal bleeding. (Kunihiro
      Matsushita, 2016 Oct 7) reported that the prevalence of Gastrointestinal bleeding was
      significantly higher in patients with Chronic Renal Failure compared to patients without
      Chronic Renal Failure.
