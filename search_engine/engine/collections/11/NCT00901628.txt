      protocol. Recently, periarticular multimodal drug injection (PMDI) has been considered to be
      one of the most effective and important component in multimodal approaches. Because the
      contemporary pain management protocol using the regional anesthesia, continuous femoral nerve
      block (FNB) and intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) has been proved significantly
      improved analgesic effects itself, little information whether the PMDI would provide
      additional pain relief under this pain management protocol is available. Also, because the
      safety of the high dose local anesthetics and narcotics has not been clarified, a selective
      application should be considered to patients who were expected to show better analgesia if
      there were certain patient related factors to predict the additional pain relief effect of
      the PMDI. Thus, this prospective double-blind randomized study was conducted to determine
      whether PMDI would provide additional benefits in patients after total knee arthroplasty
      (TKA) for whom contemporary pain control protocols using the continuous femoral nerve block,
      IV-PCA and preemptive oral medications in terms of pain relief, consumption of PCA and acute
      pain rescuer, patients satisfaction, functional recovery, side effects and complications.
