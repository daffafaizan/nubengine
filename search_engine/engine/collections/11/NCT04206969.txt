    
      Mixed method study using a multicenter, Bayesian randomized clinical trial with blinded
      evaluation of the primary outcome. Two parallel groups of 40 children or adolescents from 6
      to 20 years-old and their family will be included. In the experimental group, patients will
      attend six sessions of transcultural therapy in addition to usual care. The improved Clinical
      Global Impression scale scores at 6 months will be compared across groups. Qualitative
      analysis of families and therapists' interviews will allow to specify the therapeutic
      processes and acceptability of the therapy.
