    
      Advanced urothelial carcinoma (UC) (locally advanced/unresectable or metastatic UC) is a
      fatal disease with 5-year survival rate of 5%. The most frequently studied diagnostic for
      advanced UC is the programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) protein expression in tumor tissue. A
      better understanding of PD-L1 expression in a "real world" setting could help understand its
      clinical utility in the management and decision making in advanced UC and clinical trial
      design
