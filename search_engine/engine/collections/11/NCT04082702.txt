      lifestyle programs, such as the diabetes prevention program (DPP), show reduced effectiveness
      in African American (AA) women. In addition to an attenuated response to lifestyle programs,
      AA women also demonstrate high rates of obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. To
      address these disparities, enhancements to evidence-based lifestyle programs for AA women
      need to be developed and evaluated with culturally relevant and rigorous study designs. This
      study describes a community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach to design a novel
      faith-enhancement to the DPP for AA women. A long-standing CBPR partnership designed the
      faith-enhancement from focus group data (N=64 AA adults) integrating five components: a brief
      pastor led sermon, memory verse, in class or take-home faith activity, promises to remember,
      and scripture and prayer integrated into participant curriculum and facilitator materials.
      The faith components were specifically linked to weekly DPP learning objectives to
      strategically emphasize behavioral skills with religious principles. Using a CBPR approach,
      the Better Me Within trial was able to enroll 12 churches, screen 333 AA women, and randomize
      221 (Mean age =48.8 ±11.2; Mean BMI =36.7 ±8.4; 52% technical or high school) after
      collection of objective eligibility measures. A prospective, randomized, nested by church,
      design was used to evaluate the faith-enhanced DPP as compared to a standard DPP on weight,
      diabetes and cardiovascular risk, over a 16-week intervention and 10-month follow up. This
      study provides essential data to guide enhancements to evidence-based lifestyle programs for
      AA women who are at high risk for chronic disease.
