      shows a thickening of the endometrium of 10mm or more ( thickening described in 10% of
      ulipristalacetate users and is completely benign), a saline infusion can help to exclude
      pathology in the uterine cavity. Saline infusion helps to better delineate the uterine cavity
      and endometrium. If fibroids or polyps are present in the uterine cavity they will clearly be
      seen.

      This study was set up to describe how the endometrial changes after Esmya use appear on
      saline infusion sonography. This study can help to recognize ultrasonographic images in women
      presenting with thickened endometrium after Ulipristalacetate use.
