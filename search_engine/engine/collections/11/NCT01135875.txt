      increasingly recognized for occasionally metastasizing through the peripheral blood to
      distant locations. This research study involves the detection and novel characterization of
      human GBM (hGBM) circulating tumor cells (CTCs) within the peripheral blood of brain tumor
      patients by identifying their unique cell surface antigen profile, determining an optimal
      isolation protocol, and quantitatively and qualitatively reporting the yield and
      characteristics.
