      disease treated with bryostatin 1. II. Determine qualitative and quantitative toxicities of
      bryostatin 1 in these patients. III. Determine duration of response and survival in these
      patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive bryostatin 1 by continuous IV infusion over 72 hours. Courses
      repeat every 14 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity for at
      least 4 courses. Patients who achieve complete response (CR) are treated with 4 additional
      courses beyond CR.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-27 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
