    
      This is a Phase II, randomized, open-label trial to evaluate the clinical and immunologic
      activity of pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy when combined with various immunotherapy
      induction regimens as neoadjuvant therapy for triple negative breast cancer (TNBC).

      A commonly used standard neoadjuvant regimen for TNBC is a weekly taxane (e.g., paclitaxel
      80mg/m2) for 12 weeks followed by an anthracycline (e.g., doxorubicin 60 mg/m2 plus
      cyclophosphamide at 600 mg/m2 [AC]) every 3 weeks (Q3W) for 4 cycles.

      The chemotherapy regimen included in this study is built upon the aforementioned regimen.
      Pembrolizumab in combination with this regimen will be studied as part of a multi-arm study
      that randomizes subjects to receive:

        -  Control Arm: (Pembro + ACT): Pembrolizumab induction (single-dose 200mg IV), followed by
           pembrolizumab Q3W + paclitaxel (T) weekly x 4 cycles, followed by pembrolizumab +
           doxorubicin + cyclophosphamide (AC) Q3W x 4 cycles as neoadjuvant therapy prior to
           surgery.

        -  Arm A: (Pembro + IRX-2 + ACT): Pembrolizumab (single-dose 200mg IV) + cyclophosphamide
           (single-dose 300 mg/m2 IV) + IRX-2 induction (1mL SQ x 2 daily, x 10 days), followed by
           pembrolizumab Q3W + paclitaxel (T) weekly x 4 cycles, followed by IRX-2 re-induction
           (1mL SQ x 2 daily, x 10 days), followed by pembrolizumab + doxorubicin +
           cyclophosphamide (AC) Q3W x 4 cycles as neoadjuvant therapy prior to surgery.

        -  Subsequent induction therapy arms are to be included in protocol amendments. Note: 1
           cycle = 21 days
