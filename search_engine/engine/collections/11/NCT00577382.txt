      Primary

        -  To determine the proportion of participants with metastatic mucosal or acral/lentiginous
           melanoma who are alive and without disease progression at two months after beginning
           treatment with sunitinib.

        -  To determine the best overall response rate.

      Secondary

        -  To determine the time to progression and overall survival.

        -  To correlate c-kit mutational status with response to therapy.

        -  To evaluate the use of FDG-PET scanning in determining early biologic response to
           therapy.

        -  To assess amplification of c-kit status through quantitative PCR and/or FISH and other
           related molecular pathway targets.
