      individuals without heart disease and the reasons for their palpitations are unknown.
      Together with heart palpitations silent arrhythmia may be present that could lead to serious
      complications (eg. stroke). In others, palpitations result from heart rhythm disturbances,
      sometimes life threatening. Standard diagnostic methods such as 24 hours Holter
      electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring or Event Holter do not guarantee early diagnosis of the
      arrhythmia. Prolonged heart rhythm recording and analysis using an automatic full disclosure
      telemetric device can increase probability of arrhythmia diagnosis and early administration
      of applicable treatment. Study patients will be diagnosed using standard Holter ECG
      monitoring, Event Holter or 30 days telemetric ECG monitoring. Efficacy of telemetric
      monitoring in diagnosis of cardiac arrhythmia will be assessed in comparison with the
      standard Holter monitoring and Event Holter
