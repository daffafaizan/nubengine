      in elderly and hypertensive patients. Currently, Phenylephrine (PE) and Norepinephrine (NE)
      are commonly used in clinical practice to address this arterial pressure drop. Their
      cardiovascular effects are not exactly the same, even though they both increase mean blood
      pressure.

      Maintenance of mean arterial pressure is not the only hemodynamic goal during general
      anesthesia in the elderly. Cognitive disorders have been demonstrated during post-anesthetic
      awakening.

      Cerebral hemodynamics is assessed by analyzing the speed of blood flow in the middle cerebral
      artery using transcranial Doppler (DTC). It measures the systolic and diastolic speed as well
      as the pulsatility index, which are predictive factors for lowering cerebral blood flow.
