        -  Evaluate the sensitivity of lymphoscintigraphy and isosulfan blue in localization of
           sentinel lymph nodes in patients with previously untreated squamous cell carcinoma of
           the oral cavity or oropharynx.

        -  Determine evidence of micrometastases in histologically normal sentinel lymph nodes
           resected from these patients.

        -  Assess the clinical significance of micrometastases in lymph nodes resected from these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo preoperative lymphoscintigraphy utilizing technetium Tc 99m sulfur
      colloid followed by intraoperative injections of isosulfan blue at 3-4 locations into the
      primary tumor periphery. Once the afferent lymphatic channel and sentinel node have been
      identified, patients undergo cervical lymphadenectomy followed by resection of the primary
      tumor.

      Resected primary tumor, radioactive lymph nodes, and blue-stained sentinel nodes are then
      subjected to molecular (polymerase chain reaction) and histocytochemical
      (immunohistochemistry for cytokeratin and micrometastases, light microscopy) analyses.

      Patients are followed at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 25 patients will be accrued for this study.
