      haemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn. It can be avoided by anti D immunoglobulin
      administration (RhIg). At the end of year 2005, new recommendations about anti-D prophylaxis
      in France proposed that all RhD negative pregnant women should be given anti-D immunoglobulin
      at 28 weeks' gestation. However, about one third of these women would be carrying an RhD
      negative fetus and would receive the treatment unnecessarily. A non-invasive fetal RHD typing
      kit, CE labelled since June 2007, is available and could be proposed to all RhD negative
      pregnant women. Applicable from the end of the first trimester of pregnancy on fetal DNA
      isolated from maternal plasma, this assay allows RhIg to be specifically injected to
      unsensitized pregnancies with RhD positive fetus only, and to promote the use of antenatal
      RhIg prophylaxis in a rational approach with economical and ethical impact.The study is
      divided in two sub-studies. The first one is an economical and performance comparison between
      two antenatal management strategies of RhD negative pregnant women: the first one will
      comprise non invasive RhD fetal typing during the second trimester of pregnancy (GENIFERH 1
      RhD typing group), and the second will be a conventional management, i.e. without RHD fetal
      typing (GENIFERH 1 control group). The two groups will consist of 13 maternity wards spread
      over French territory. The second study (GENIFERH 2) is an evaluation of RhD fetal typing
      diagnostic performance and biological feasibility in routine antenatal practice with
      development of knew technical support; it will be based on more than 3500 fetal genotypings
      performed during one year by the five laboratories participating at the two studies.
