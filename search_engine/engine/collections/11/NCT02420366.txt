    
      This multi-center, retrospective study of cases of serious bacterial infections (including
      cUTI or AP, HABP, VABP, and/or bacteremia caused by CRE) will consist of a chart review over
      a 6 month period from September 1, 2013 to March 1, 2014. De-identified data will be
      collected from the chart review of at least 150 cases of selected infections due to CRE at
      approximately 20 sites.

      The study itself is strictly observational and retrospective, with no direct study-related
      patient interaction, treatment, or testing. There will be no patient identifying data
      collected as part of this study.

      Charts of patients who meet study-defined criteria for cUTI or AP, HABP, VABP, and/or
      bacteremia and have a culture from the site of infection or the blood that is positive for a
      Carbapenem-Resistant Enterobacteriaceae will be reviewed.
