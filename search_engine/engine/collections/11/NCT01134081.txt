      soft and hard tissue engineering of the periodontium, the subjects provided gingival
      crevicular fluid (GCF) or periodontal wound fluid (WF) and the results demonstrated
      contrasting inducible expression patterns of PDGF-AB, VEGF, and ICTP during periodontal
      healing [17, 24, 25]. However, little is known regarding the release of these molecules into
      local periodontal wound fluid during tissue-engineered grafts.

      The aim of this study is to determine the presence and influence of angiogenic biomarkers,
      such as PDGF, VEGF, and FGF, involved in the wound healing process of tissue engineered
      grafts in the treatment of subjects (with recession-type defects) who have an insufficient
      zone of attached gingival associated with at least two nonadjacent teeth.

      STUDY OBJECTIVES The purpose of this pilot study is to compare the expression of angiogenic
      biomarkers involved in the wound healing process of 2 different periodontal surgical
      approaches: 1) CelTxâ„¢ (living bilayered cell therapy product) and 2) free gingival grafts
