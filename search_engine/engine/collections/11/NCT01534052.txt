      completed MDV3100 treatment study to assess the long-term safety of continued administration
      of MDV3100, when judged by the investigator to be in the best interest of the participant.
      For the study duration, all participants with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC)
      maintained androgen deprivation with a Luteinizing Hormone Releasing Hormone (LHRH)
      agonist/antagonist unless they underwent bilateral orchiectomy. Participants were
      discontinued from study drug when the continued administration of study drug was deemed to be
      not in the participants' best interest by the investigator based on clinical assessment.
      Throughout the study, safety and tolerability were assessed by the recording of adverse
      events, monitoring of vital signs and physical examinations, safety laboratory evaluations,
      and 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs). Participants had a safety follow-up visit 30 days
      after their last dose of study drug. Participants that did not meet any of the
      discontinuation criteria were eligible to continue to receive treatment with enzalutamide in
      study 9785-CL-0123 [NCT02960022] upon approval and activation of the study at the
      participating institution. Participants who enrolled in study 9785-CL-0123 [NCT02960022] were
      not required to have a safety follow-up visit.
