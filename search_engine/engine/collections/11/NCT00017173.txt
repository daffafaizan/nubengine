        -  Determine the feasibility of treating patients with newly diagnosed resectable stage III
           or IV squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, or larynx
           with surgery and Ad5CMV-p53 gene followed by cisplatin and radiotherapy.

        -  Determine the progression-free survival, local control, and overall survival of patients
           treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients undergo surgical resection and receive an intraoperative Ad5CMV-p53 gene injection
      into the resection bed and into the deep soft tissue bed of the cervical level with nodal
      metastasis. Patients also receive a third intraoperative Ad5CMV-p53 gene injection into the
      neck dissection bed, where it is allowed to sit in place for 10 minutes.

      Within 48-72 hours after surgery, patients receive a postoperative Ad5CMV-p53 gene injection
      into each of two drainage catheters next to the mucosal suture line and neck dissection bed,
      where it is allowed to sit in place for 2 hours.

      Within 56 days after surgery, patients receive cisplatin IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1, 22,
      and 43 and radiotherapy on days 1-5, 8-12, 15-19, 22-26, 29-33, and 36-40. Patients may
      receive 3 additional days of radiotherapy to high-risk areas on days 43-45.

      Patients are followed every 2-6 months for 2 years and then annually for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.
