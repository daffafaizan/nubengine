      (pathogen-associated molecular patterns, PAMPs), widely present in the cell walls of plants,
      bacteria, yeasts, fungi, mushrooms and algae. Modern has been reported in the literature that
      β-glucan can enhance the immune system of animals, and to enhance the function of the animal
      against bacterial, fungal and viral infections, and cancer.In this study, the use of β-glucan
      to enhance the biological characteristics of the non-specific immunity, to explore the impact
      of postoperative patients with wound healing and infection rates.The observation of the
      healing process to take the Leather District wounds (5 ~ 200 cm2). The experiments were
      carried out for 18 months, were observed record the following three: (1) the rate of wound
      healing, (2) The rate of infection assessment: record length of time and the point in time at
      all levels of antibiotic use also observe the wound change (redness, swelling, heat,
      pain).(3) days of hospitalization, and spend statistics. Using unpaired student's t-test
      analysis, group data whether the differences between groups of experimental data. represents
      a statistically significant when p <0.05.
