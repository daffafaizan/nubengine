      I. To assess the safety, the maximum tolerated dose, and the dose limiting toxicity of
      sunitinib malate when administered in combination with cetuximab and radiotherapy in patients
      with locally advanced, recurrent, or second primary poor prognosis, high-risk squamous cell
      carcinoma of the head and neck.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the toxicity profile of this regimen. II. To explore the tolerability and
      feasibility of sunitinib malate when administered in combination with cetuximab and
      radiotherapy in these patients.

      III. To assess the best overall response rate (complete and partial response) after
      completion of treatment.

      IV. To assess the locoregional control rate. V. To assess the distant control rate. VI. To
      assess the pharmacokinetics of sunitinib malate delivered by percutaneous gastrostomy tube.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of sunitinib malate.

      Patients receive sunitinib malate orally or by percutaneous gastrostomy tube once daily,
      cetuximab IV over 60-120 minutes once weekly, and undergo concurrent radiotherapy once or
      twice daily, 5 days a week, for 7-9 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients with persistent disease undergo surgical resection.

      *NOTE: *Patients may have resection prior to enrollment on protocol provided they have
      high-risk features for recurrence.

      Some patients undergo blood sample collection at baseline and periodically during study for
      pharmacokinetic analysis of sunitinib malate and metabolites.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for up to 6 years.
