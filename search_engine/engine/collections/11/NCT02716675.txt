      preventing HIV-1 infection in men and transgender (TG) persons who have sex with men, in
      North America, South America, and Switzerland.

      Participants will be randomized to receive VRC01 mAb by intravenous (IV) infusion at a dose
      of 10 mg/kg or 30 mg/kg every 8 weeks, or to receive control infusions every 8 weeks. All
      participants will receive the VRC01 antibody or placebo by IV infusion at Weeks 0 (study
      entry), 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, and 72. For 3 days following each infusion,
      participants will be asked to record and report any symptoms to study researchers.

      In addition to the infusion visits, participants will attend study visits at Weeks 4, 8 + 5
      days, 12, 20, 28, 36, 44, 52, 60, 68, 76, 80, 88, 96, and 104. All study visits will include
      blood collection and HIV testing and counseling. Select study visits will include a medical
      history review, physical exam, urine collection, pregnancy testing for participants capable
      of becoming pregnant, risk reduction counseling, and an interview/questionnaire.
