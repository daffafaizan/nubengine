    
      This is a multicentric randomized phase III trial comparing intensity-modulated radiotherapy
      plus concomitant cisplatin versus conventional radiotherapy plus concomitant cisplatin in
      patients with stage III-IV squamous cell carcinoma of oral cavity, oropharynx or hypopharynx.
      The main end points are the rate of locoregional control and the rate of xerostomia at 2
      years.

      The IMRT total dose is 75 Gy (50 Gy to PTV1 and T0 + 25 Gy (10 fractions) to PTV2). The
      conventional radiotherapy total dose is 70 Gy (50 Gy to PTV1 + 20 Gy (10 fractions) to PTV2).
      In both arms, the cervical nodes will receive 50 Gy (65 Gy in case of Np) by conventional
      radiotherapy (IMRT is allowed in the IRMT arm). In the two arms, patients will receive
      concomitant cisplatin (100 mg/mÂ² D1, D21, D42).
