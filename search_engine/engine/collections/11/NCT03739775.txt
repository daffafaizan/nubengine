    
      Patients with previously treated, HPV-induced, stage II or III invasive pelvic cancer and who
      are currently in post-treatment follow-up will be included.

      These patients will be followed up during 30 months (2.5 years) (if no relapse occurred
      before) with ctDNA detection performed at each hospital visit. At each visit, clinical,
      biological (squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) serum marker will be done systematically) and
      radiological/pathology (if any) results will be prospectively collected in the study.

      For the patients who have a relapse before 30 months, the follow-up will be discontinued at
      the date of the relapse.

      For the patients who will have completed their follow-up for the study (2.5 years) with no
      relapse, they will be followed up for 6 months (+ 14 days), to collect any late relapse (if
      any). None specific study procedure will be performed during this period.
