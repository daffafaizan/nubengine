      leading to sustained weight loss are needed to improve the public health and reverse the
      alarming rise in diabetes, its cardiovascular complications and other obesity-related
      illnesses. The Diabetes Prevention Program is identified as a model for a successful weight
      loss intervention. The proposed study is a randomized controlled trial of 2 active
      telephone-based interventions based on the Diabetes Prevention Model that will be delivered
      at primary care sites.
