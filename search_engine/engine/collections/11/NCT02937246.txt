      GB cancer, and pancreatic cancer. In biliary stricture by malignancy, biliary drainage with
      placement of self-expanding metal stent (SEMS) for palliation is the therapy of choice in
      these patients. When compared to plastic stents, SEMS present a significantly decreased risk
      of recurrent biliary obstruction. SEMS are also more cost-effective than plastic stents in
      patients with a life expectancy of longer than 4 months. However, despite their numerous
      benefits, SEMS become occluded in up to 50 % of patients in the first 6-8 months. In order to
      minimize the occurrence of this issue, covered stents were developed. Previous studies
      indicated that covered stents are less likely to become occluded in comparison to bare
      stents. While the probability of occlusions caused by tumor in-growth is less in covered
      stents, they are more likely to spontaneously migrate to a position that is distal to the
      original deployment site. However, newer covered stents with improved designs, such as the
      partially covered double bare metallic stent used for this study, include features to
      mitigate the migration issue. The purpose of this study is to confirm whether the difference
      in patency rate between regular covered stents and bare stents, which has already been well
      established by existing studies, is also reproducible when double covered stents are compared
      against double bare stents.
