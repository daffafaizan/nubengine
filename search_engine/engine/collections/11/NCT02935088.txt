    
      The purpose of this study is to understand routine use of FFR and alternate indices in
      clinical practice. This study will determine the use and clinical outcome of FFR-guided PCI
      in patients presenting with either stable coronary artery disease, or in patients presenting
      with Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) on culprit and non-culprit lesions as well as during index
      and secondary procedures.

      The study will also collect data on the routine use of coronary physiologic measurements such
      as adenosine-induced hyperemia FFR, FFR by contrast-induced hyperemia,
