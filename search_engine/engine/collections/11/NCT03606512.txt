    
      RSV is considered the most important cause of serious acute respiratory illness in children
      under 5 years of age. Ad26.RSV.preF (JNJ-64400141) investigational vaccine is a
      replication-incompetent serotype 26 adenoviral vector (Ad26) containing a deoxyribonucleic
      acid (DNA) transgene that encodes for the F protein derived from the respiratory syncytial
      virus (RSV) A2 strain stabilized in the pre-fusion conformation (Ad26.RSV.preF). The study
      will evaluate whether Ad26.RSV.preF is safe, well-tolerated, and immunogenic in
      RSV-seronegative toddlers. The study will have 3 phases: a screening phase (up to 6 weeks
      before the first dose), a vaccination phase (34 weeks), and a safety follow-up phase through
      2 RSV seasons after the first dose. RSV infection will be monitored by active and passive
      surveillance. The total duration of the study will be approximately 26 months.
