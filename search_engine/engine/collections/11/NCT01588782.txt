      open-label (individuals will know the identity of study treatments), 2-period,
      sequential-design, drug-drug interaction study of abiraterone acetate and ketoconazole in
      approximately 20 healthy adult men. This study will consist of a screening period followed by
      an open-label treatment phase consisting of 2 treatment periods. Successive drug
      administration will be separated by a washout period of at least 10 days. All individuals
      will receive study treatment in the same sequence. Period 1 (Days 1 to 4) consists of a
      single oral dose of 1000 mg abiraterone acetate tablets on Day 1 only. Period 2 (Days 11 to
      17) consists of a daily oral dose of 400 mg ketoconazole tablets on Days 11 to 16 and
      administration of a single dose of 1000 mg abiraterone acetate on Day 14. Serial
      pharmacokinetic (study of what the body does to a drug) samples will be collected at each
      treatment period as detailed in the protocol. Safety will be monitored continuously from the
      time of informed consent signing until the end of the study.
