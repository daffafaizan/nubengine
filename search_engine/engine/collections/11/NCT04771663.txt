      the placement of a pulse oximeter sensor on the results of measuring peripheral blood oxygen
      saturation (SpO2) in a healthy person with short-term hypoxia and hypercapnia. This is an
      intervention prospective study that will take place at the Faculty of Biomedical Engineering,
      especially on FBMI students. The experiment consists of two phases, in which in the first
      phase, the volunteers will inhale the hypoxic mixture for five minutes after the
      stabilization phase. In the second phase, volunteers inhale a hypoxic and hypercapnic
      mixture. During the experiment, non-invasive SpO2 measurements will be performed continuously
      on individual fingers of both volunteer hands.
