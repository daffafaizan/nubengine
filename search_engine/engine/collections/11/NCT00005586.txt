        -  Compare all-cause mortality in patients with resected colorectal cancer treated with
           adjuvant chemotherapy with L-leucovorin and fluorouracil vs observation.

        -  Compare the recurrence rates in patients treated with this regimen vs observation.

        -  Compare the effectiveness of a monthly 5-day schedule vs a once weekly schedule of
           L-leucovorin and fluorouracil in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to
      receive adjuvant chemotherapy (arm I) or undergo observation only (arm II).

        -  Arm I: Within 12 weeks of surgery, patients receive L-leucovorin IV followed by
           fluorouracil IV on days 1-5 every 4 weeks for 6 courses. Alternatively, patients may
           receive L-leucovorin IV followed by fluorouracil IV on day 1 weekly for 30 weeks.

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo observation. Patients are followed annually.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 2,500 patients (1,250 per arm) will be accrued for this study.
