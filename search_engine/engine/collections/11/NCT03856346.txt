      cataract surgery alone. In patients who undergo combined phaco-vitrectomy, deviations in
      refractive outcomes may be observed because of possible errors in measurement of axial
      length, changes in the properties of the vitreous cavity after removal of the vitreous, or
      intraocular tamponade. Most of the previous studies have reported variable degrees of myopic
      shift after phaco-vitrectomy for diabetic retinopathy, epiretinal membrane, and macular hole.
      Furthermore, use of intraoperative gas may increase further the risk of anterior displacement
      of the intraocular lens which may induce a higher myopic shift. However, these publications
      did not provide any quantification of the spherical deviations nor calculate any specific
      constant in order to improve currents state of art biometry calculations.
