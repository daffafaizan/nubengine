      session enhances the learning of social information in the context of a social cognitive
      skills training (SCST) program, and it will test a possible mediator of this effect. Subjects
      with psychotic disorders will be randomized to one of four groups in a 2 by 2 factorial
      design: OT with SCST; Placebo with SCST; OT with training control condition; placebo with
      training control condition. Target engagement will be measured in an OT challenge (placebo
      versus OT one week apart) prior to baseline assessment. The measure of target engagement will
      be EEG mu suppression while observing biological motion. A social cognition battery will be
      administered at baseline, at midpoint after 6 weeks of SCST, and at completion of training at
      12 weeks. The battery will include measures of social cue identification and mentalizing.
