      simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplantation in patients receiving either a regimen combining
      sirolimus (SRL) plus mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) following an antibody induction (rATG) or a
      regimen combining tacrolimus (TAC) plus mycophenolate mofetil following an antibody induction
      (rATG). In both regimens corticosteroids (CS) will be withdrawn three months after
      transplantation.

      In addition, the two treatment groups will be compared for acute rejection, renal and
      pancreas functions and patient survival after transplantation at 12 months and for a total
      period of 5 years of follow-up.
