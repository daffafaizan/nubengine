    
      This Continued Access IDE Study is a prospective, non-randomized, multi-center (up to 25
      sites) study designed to provide performance assessment of a refined Guardian implantable
      medical device (AMSG3-E) through controlled access of a replacement Guardian System to a
      subset of former ALERTS patients while waiting for FDA approval of the AMSG3-E. The AMSG3-E
      contains a drop-in replacement battery designed to extend the life of the implant to
      potentially exceed the previous 3-years implant life. Eligible patients will include those
      that exited the ALERTS study and chose to leave the device and/or lead in place. Eligible
      patients must also continue to meet ALERTS inclusion criteria and not have developed any
      exclusion criteria since exiting the ALERTS study.
