      individual subjects in each group was not less than 1/3 of the total number).Participants
      begin to receive the first dose of SPH3127 100mg. Then Participants begin to receive the
      second dose of SPH3127 200mg,after the researchers confirmed that the 100mg dose group was
      safe and well tolerated.Then the third dose of SPH3127 400mg must wait for the result of the
      second dose's safety and tolerability. If the subjects during escalating dose to the biggest
      tolerate dose group were not well tolerated, the study must adjust the maximum dose group and
      fall to a low dose group to conduct another test.
