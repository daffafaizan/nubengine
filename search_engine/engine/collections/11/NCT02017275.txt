      sirolimus-eluting stent (SES), with design of adding an electro-grafting (eG) base layer
      between the polymer and the stainless steel stent strut.The eG layer can secure adhesion of
      the biodegradable PLGA coating as a result of the interdigitation, and the PLGA coating
      ensures 100% drug release within 30 days.The initial investigation showed a high strut
      coverage rate in both the BuMA stent and the Xience V stent at 3 months follow-up. Moreover,
      earlier vascular healing after drug-eluting stent implantation may reduce the incidence of
      stent thrombosis at follow-up and potentially shorten dual antiplatelet therapy duration.
      Therefore, we performed this randomized trial to investigate 12 months target lesion failure
      between the BuMA and the EXCEL stent, both with same eluted drug sirolimus, however different
      biodegradable polymer carriers.
