      beneficial in several experimental models but has not been pharmacologically activated in
      humans. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effects of hemin on HO-1 activity
      in healthy subjects. Hemin is the most powerful inducer of HO-1. Hemin is FDA-approved to
      treat acute intermittent porphyria. In addition, hemin has also been used to treat
      thalassemia intermedia, myelodysplastic syndrome, and to control liver allograft failure due
      to recurrence of erythropoietic prototheria. Our hypothesis is that compared to placebo,
      hemin will increase HO-1 in humans. Ten healthy subjects will be randomized to hemin (n = 5,
      PanhematinÂ®, Ovation Pharmaceuticals, 3 mg/kg i.v. in 25% albumin) or placebo (n = 5, 25%
      albumin) infusion. HO-1 activity will be assessed before and after (4, 6, 24, and 48 hours)
      infusions.
