      to increase testing and case detection is to distribute home test kits to close contacts of
      individuals with COVID-19. This approach decreases logistic barriers to testing, potential
      exposures to COVID-19, and reduces potential stigma and fear associated with facility-based
      COVID-19 testing.

      The investigators will conduct a cohort study of individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 in the
      C-STRAND trial (NCT04797858), in order to determine if distribution of self-test kits to
      close contacts of of individuals with COVID-19 can increase case detection compared with a
      standard contact referral strategy among. Individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 who were
      randomized to the self-test (intervention) arm or received self-test kits will be assigned to
      receive additional self-test kits to distribute to close contacts. Individuals diagnosed with
      COVID-19 who were randomized to the test referral (control) arm or received test referrals
      will be assigned to receive text message referrals to give their close contacts to seek
      testing if needed. COVID-19 case detection and test uptake will be measured in both arms.
