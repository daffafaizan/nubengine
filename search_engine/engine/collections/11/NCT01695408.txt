    
      INSIGHTS-IPF will report current and comprehensive data on Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis
      (IPF) in the long-term.

      Baseline (cross-sectional part): Description of characteristics of IPF patients in terms of

        -  key (socio-) demographic data

        -  IPF risk factors, comorbidities

        -  methods used for IPF diagnosis

        -  IPF disease severity and manifestation (including lung function, cardiopulmonary
           exercise testing and/or exercise capacity if available, laboratory values, biomarkers)

        -  IPF treatment (detailed information on prescribed drugs and doses; non-pharmacological
           treatment; listing and score for lung transplantation)

        -  assessment of patient-related outcomes (PRO) such as quality of life

      Follow-up (prospectively up to at least 2 years after inclusion):

        -  Clinical course of IPF (e.g. in terms of symptoms, lung function, exercise capacity if
           available)

        -  Documentation of treatment pathways (switch/add-on/discontinuation of medication), and
           of non-pharmacological treatment (e.g. start of long term oxygen therapy; new listing
           for lung transplantation)Outcomes/events (such as acute respiratory worsening,
           exacerbations, hospitalisation due to any cause and due to IPF, other complications,
           survival)

        -  Patient-related outcomes such as quality of life, assessed once a year(for comparison
           with baseline)

        -  Resource use for pharmacoeconomic analyses.
