      administration of adenovirus p53 gene (Ad-p53) in patients with malignant primary glioma. II.
      Determine the maximum tolerated dose of intratumoral Ad-p53 in these patients. III. Evaluate
      the qualitative and quantitative toxicity of intratumoral Ad-p53 in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study. Patients receive an initial
      intratumoral stereotactic injection of adenovirus p53 (Ad-p53) over 10 minutes on day 1. In
      the absence of unacceptable toxicity resulting from this initial injection, patients then
      undergo tumor resection and receive a series of 1-minute injections of Ad-p53 into the
      resected tumor cavity wall on day 4. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of
      Ad-p53. If 2 of 3 or 3 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity (DLT) at a particular
      dose level, escalation ceases and the maximum tolerated dose is defined as the previous dose
      level. Patients are followed closely for 12 weeks, then every 2 weeks for 8 weeks, then every
      4 weeks for 8 weeks, and then every 8 weeks until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.
