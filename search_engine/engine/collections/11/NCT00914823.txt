      reproductive function. People with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH), hyperprolactinemia,
      and polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) do not secrete or respond to GnRH in a normal way. In
      this study, investigators will give participants kisspeptin- a hormone that is naturally
      found in the human body and is known to be a powerful stimulus of GnRH secretion. They may
      also give participants GnRH to determine if participants will be able to fully respond to
      kisspeptin.

      The goal of this study is to use kisspeptin administration to probe the condition of GnRH
      neurons in people with various reproductive disorders to better understand the underlying
      reasons for the disorders. Investigators hope to gain new insights into GnRH neuronal
      function (or dysfunction) that will lead to better diagnostics in the future.
