      One will be standard of care using 2% Chlorhexidine Gluconate wipes night before surgery and
      morning if surgery. The second group will be randomized into the study arm using 2%
      Chlorhexidine Gluconate clothes from jaw line to toes night before surgery, morning of
      surgery and daily post operative. Skin cultures will be obtained at time of consent, prior to
      surgical procedure before surgical scrub and draping, post operative day 4 and at 30 day
      follow up visit. Incision lines will be assessed daily by study staff for signs of surgical
      site infection utilizing the CDC's 3 definitions of surgical site infections, superficial
      incisional SSI, deep incisional SSI, and organ space SSI.
