      been reported.

      Hypothesis: Practice with mechanical simulator improves clinical ERCP performance of novice
      trainees.

      Design: A prospective randomized controlled trial.

      Method: 8 trainees without prior ERCP experience from 2 hospitals attended didactic lectures
      on ERCP. They were randomized in pairs (per hospital) to receive simulator practice and usual
      training (S) versus usual training only as control (C). Simulator practice included selective
      bile and pancreatic duct cannulation using a catheter and/or guide wire with different
      artificial papillae (flat, standard, dual channels) and settings (standard, rotated papilla
      or duodenum), and exchange of guide wire/accessories and biliary stenting. Local trainers
      tracked trainees' subsequent clinical ERCP performance for 3 months. Evaluation of trainee
      skills included success of diagnostic CBD and deep CBD cannulation. Trainer blinded to the
      randomization provided assessment (1=poor, 5=excellent) of each trainee performed ERCP.

      Statistics: Fisher exact test and Mann-Whitney U test.
