      illicit drug use account for 5.4% of the total burden of disease and the peak has been found
      in early adulthood (between ages 20 and 30 years). Substance use is one of the leading
      problems among Chilean adolescents. One out of four 8 th to 12 th graders have smoked
      cigarettes in the last month. A 35.6% of students (37%, girls; 34.2%, boys) between Year 8
      and Year 12 have reported any alcohol use during the last month. It is worrying that a third
      of 14 years old students report using alcohol in the last month in Chile. Furthermore, two
      out of three who are using alcohol, report regularly using 5 or more drinks in a row during
      the last month. Cannabis use among young Chileans has increased in recent years. Today, one
      out of five students between Year 8 and Year 12 referred cannabis use during the last 30
      days. Almost a 20% of students in Year 8 have used cannabis in the last year.

      Therefore, is urgent to provide evidence-based drug preventive interventions to the Chilean
      population, specifically to school students, to tackle this problem and reduce the risk for a
      more dramatic future health scenario.

      The aim of this study was to assess the acceptability and feasibility of the cultural
      adaptation of "Yo Sé Lo Que Quiero" program. This is a pilot randomized controlled trial. The
      participants of this pilot were students attending six low-income primary schools in
      Santiago, Chile.

      This pilot study is part of a larger research project with the final aim of testing the
      effectiveness of "Yo Sé Lo Que Quiero" program to reduce substance use among adolescents in
      Chile.
