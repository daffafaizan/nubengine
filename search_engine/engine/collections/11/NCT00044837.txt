      include the abatement of menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes, insomnia, mood changes,
      vaginal dryness, urogenital and skin changes, and memory loss. HRT may also decrease risk for
      primary cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, colon cancer, and possibly Alzheimer's disease
      and age-related macular degeneration. There may also be an overall survival benefit for
      HIV-negative postmenopausal women taking hormone replacement therapy. Despite the potential
      benefits of postmenopausal hormone replacement, it is seldom used in HIV-infected
      postmenopausal women. One concern about HRT in HIV-infected women is the potential for
      interaction with antiretroviral (ARV) drugs. Although the effect of HRT on ARV drug levels is
      likely to be small, it is important to evaluate the safety of administering HRT concurrently
      with ARVs. The information obtained from this study will help shape recommendations for
      postmenopausal HRT in HIV-infected women.

      Patients are enrolled into 1 of 4 study arms based on their current oral ARV regimens. Arm A
      takes NFV plus nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). Arm B takes LPV/r plus
      NRTIs. Arm C takes EFV plus NRTIs. Arm D enrolls HIV-infected patients not on current ARVs,
      or who are taking NRTIs only (no protease inhibitors [PIs] or nonnucleoside reverse
      transcriptase inhibitors [NNRTIs]). All arms receive HRT with oral estradiol and
      medroxyprogesterone acetate for 12 weeks. Arms A, B, and C have intensive PI or NNRTI
      pharmacokinetic (PK) sampling at entry and Week 4. All arms have estradiol PK sampling at
      Week 4. Clinical and laboratory evaluations are done at entry, Week 4, and Week 12.

      ARVs are not provided by this study. Only HRT is provided.
