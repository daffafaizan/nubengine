      found to inhibit c-Met kinase at the enzyme and cell levels with IC50s of 4 nM for both
      enzyme and Met phosphorylation in the cell. Consistent with its potent enzyme and cell
      activity, volitinib was found to inhibit cell growth in vitro against tumors with c-Met gene
      amplification in the absence of HGF stimulation with IC50s generally below 10 nM. It also
      potently inhibited HGF-stimulated cell proliferation against tumors with c-Met overexpression
      or carrying a HGF/c-Met autocrine loop.

      In a xenograft model Hs746T with c-Met gene amplification, suboptimal doses 0.6 mg/kg
      volitinib and 3 mg/kg docetaxel induced TGI(expand) of 55.8% and 80.8%, respectively, whereas
      combination resulted in a TGI by 101.1%, and statistical significance was seen between
      combination group and either of mono-therapy group. Plasma exposures of volitinib and
      docetaxel were determined after last dose at the end of study, and there was no significant
      difference between combination and single agent on exposures of either volitinib or
      docetaxel. More importantly, combination was well tolerant and no body weight loss was found
      in the animals. These results suggested that it would be worthwhile to study the combination
      use of volitinib and docetaxel in clinic.
