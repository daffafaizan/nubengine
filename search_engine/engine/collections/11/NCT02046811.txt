      adolescent cancer. While these groups have greatly benefited from recent medical advances,
      primarily increasing overall survival rates, treatment advances have come at a cost. It is
      now clear that childhood radiation therapy has caused survivors to be at extremely high risk
      for non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) and increased risk of melanoma. Early detection is
      crucial to reduce the morbidity caused by NMSCs and the morbidity and mortality incurred due
      to melanoma. Both patient and provider action are needed to detect and treat early skin
      cancers and to find new solutions to ensure expedited follow-up care and treatment,
      especially among those who live where they have little access to dermatologists.

      The objective of this study is to determine the impact of a 12-month patient activation and
      education intervention on skin cancer early detection practices among childhood cancer
      survivors treated with radiation. All participants will receive text messages encouraging
      them to examine their skin and request physician examinations while concurrently driving them
      to a study website that provides education related to the associated skills, and reinforces
      and expands the text messages. To reduce skin cancers among this young and dispersed patient
      population, this study will address several key issues: (1) how to provide patients with the
      skills needed to conduct effective skin self-examinations; 2) how to prompt action from
      patient's physicians when worrisome moles and lesions are found; and 3) how to ensure rapid
      access to dermatologic exams, which in some parts of the US can take weeks or months to
      schedule.
