    
      This is a two-arm, open-label, Phase 1b/2 trial designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy
      of duvelisib in combination with rituximab and duvelisib in combination with obinutuzumab in
      subjects with previously untreated CD20+ FL.

      The study will be conducted in two parts, a Safety Lead-in (Part 1) followed by a randomized,
      2-Stage Design in Part 2. Each treatment arm will be assessed independently for dose limiting
      toxicity (DLT) within Part 1.
