    
      Pemetrexed-pretreated patients with MPM expressing PDGFR-beta and/or C-kit by IHC will
      receive chemotherapy as follow :

        -  Gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2, i.v., days 3 and 10 of a 21-days schedule;

        -  Imatinib mesylate 400 mg/die orally on days 1-5 and 8-12 of a 21-days schedule.

      Treatment repeats every 21 days in the absence of disease progression, patient refusal or
      withdrawal of patient consent, or unacceptable toxicity.

      The molecular profile of patients enrolled will be evaluated with Ion Personal Genome Machine
      (PGM) Torrent Next-generation Sequencing platform in order to individuate potential
      predictive biomarkers and to improve the understanding of the molecular biology of these rare
      tumors. A correlation among the molecular profiles identified, clinical characteristics, and
      survival data of patients will be done
