      present with limitations in activity and restrictions in their abilities to participate in
      society. Even after a standard course of cardiac rehabilitation, some individuals will still
      present with deficits. One area this is seen is the ability to stand up from a chair. A new
      device, the Biodex Sit2Stand Trainer, has been designed to help improve the standing movement
      in those with lower extremity weakness. The trainer provides a graded lift or push through
      the seat to help the participant reach a standing posture. This study will whether a six week
      training program using the trainer will lead to improvements in strength, function and
      quality of life for those individuals who have recently completed a cardiac rehabilitation
      program. This study is a pilot study to help determine the ideal dosage of training and
      identify any limitations in using the device with this population. Based on the results of
      this pilot work, a larger intervention study will be conducted to examine the effectiveness
      of the trainer in a cardiac rehabilitation program.
