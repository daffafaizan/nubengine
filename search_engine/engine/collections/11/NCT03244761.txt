      ventilation, who are usually required oxygen therapy after discontinuation of mechanical
      ventilation.The high-flow tracheal (HFT) oxygen therapy in tracheostomized patients has been
      shown that can improve oxygenation,but can not induce positive end-expiratory pressure and
      elevation of end-expiratory lung volume. A modified HFT system by increasing expiratory
      resistance might induce PEEP and consequently elevate EELV.
