      for an endometrial thickness â‰¤ 7 mm was significantly lower compared with cases with
      endometrial thickness > 7 mm. It has been reported the granulocyte colony stimulating factor
      (G-CSF) increased the endometrial thickness and pregnancy rate of infertile women with thin
      endometrium during IVF cycle. However, most of the researches were retrospective and small
      sample size, and the results were conflicted among them. GM-CSF is another member of CSF
      superfamily, recalling more macrophage than G-CSF, which could be more effective in local
      homeostasis maintain and wound repair. GM-CSF has been widely used in skin repair after burn.
      It was also found the GM-CSF and its receptor in endometrium. In the past year, the
      investigators tried GM-CSF irrigation in 21 women with thin endometrium and most of them
      received GM-CSF after hysteroscopic examination or slight adhesion relaxing, and the
      preliminary data suggested that the GM-CSF may promote the endometrial growth. Does the
      GM-CSF gel can improve the endometrial thickness? Therefore, this study was conducted.
