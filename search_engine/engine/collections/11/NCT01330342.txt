      chemotherapy. The total amount of blood required for this research project is 64mL
      (approximately 4 tablespoons).

      This will allow better understanding of the changes that take place in the blood and the HIV
      virus itself. It is hoped that this will provide new insights that may aid the understanding
      and treatment of HIV patients with lymphoma.
