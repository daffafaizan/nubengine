      long surgeries in older patients. Age is a risk factor for perioperative myocardial ischemia
      and Postoperative Cognitive Dysfunction (POCD) The suggested study will deal with the
      above-mentioned complication in patients older then 65 years undergoing major non-cardiac
      surgeries.

      It has been shown that Isoflurane and sevoflurane may have a cardio-protective effect after
      cardiac surgery involving cardio-pulmonary bypass, and it was recommended that isoflurane
      should be used in these cases. A question was raised but haven't been answered yet, whether
      this cardio-protective effect exists also in non-cardiac major surgery.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate whether there is a difference in the occurrence of
      postoperative cognitive dysfunction and perioperative myocardial ischemia between total
      intravenous anesthesia using propofol and isoflurane based anesthesia.

      The suggested study is a randomized controlled study. 500 patients older then 65 years
      undergoing elective non-cardiac major surgeries will be studied.

      On the day prior to surgery the patient will take a series computerized cognitive tests
      (Mindstream® cognitive health assessment, neurotrax®, Modiin, Israel). At the holding area
      before entering the operating room (OR) the patients will be randomly assigned to one of two
      study groups.

      Group 1 -IA: anesthesia will be maintained using Isoflurane carried by O2/air. Group 2 - TIVA
      : anesthesia will be maintained with propofol. The patients will be followed for 3 months
      post-operatively. Cognitive function will be assessed 7 days and 3 months postoperatively
      using computerized tests and telephone interview.
