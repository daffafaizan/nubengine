      Primary

        -  To evaluate the progression-free survival when bevacizumab is administered to patients
           with unresectable and/or metastatic papillary renal cell carcinoma.

        -  To further evaluate the safety of bevacizumab in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  To examine, in a preliminary manner, the response rate to bevacizumab in these patients.

        -  To collect and store blood and urine samples for future analysis.

        -  To evaluate overall survival when bevacizumab is administered to these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every
      3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then
      every 6 months for 3 years.
