      intensity program, for preventing Early Childhood Caries. A four-year randomized clinical
      trial will be conducted specifically to: 1) Assess demographic and behavioral factors as
      predictors of ECC and the relationship between three-year post-intervention behavioral
      changes from baseline measures with disease outcomes; 2) Compare the efficacy for the
      prevention of ECC in two groups - the minimal intervention group (Group 1) receiving
      counseling alone, with the moderate intensity group (Group 2) receiving a) counseling and a
      therapeutic four-month regimen of Chlorhexidine rinse for new mothers and b) fluoride varnish
      applications for their infants and toddlers starting at twelve months of age and continuing
      to age 30 months; 3) Assess baseline salivary microbiological markers as predictors of ECC in
      the infants of women in both groups and the relationship between three-year post-intervention
      salivary markers and changes from baseline measures with disease outcomes; 4) Assess the
      impact of a caries-preventive model in lowering the salivary mutans streptococci level in
      post-partum women, and subsequently, in inhibiting the growth of these bacteria in their
      young children, delaying the infectious process.

      The long term objectives are to build upon our understanding of caries risk factors, to
      assess the effectiveness of a prevention management model, to improve access to preventive
      oral health services and information for low-income pregnant women and their young children,
      and to reduce oral health disparities in a border population (U.S. - Mexico Border near San
      Diego Bay Area) at high risk for dental disease.
