      at the time of pelvic reconstructive surgery for pelvic organ prolapse (POP). Despite being a
      well established durable option for patients, there is little research detailing ligament
      suspension suture location in the living model. The available literature is limited to
      cadaveric studies, which suggest suture placement is in close proximity to vital structures
      such as the ureter, blood vessels, rectum and nerves.

      This study seeks to describe suture location in relation to the surrounding anatomy in
      postoperative patients following high uterosacral ligament suspension. The secondary aim is
      to determine safe zones for suture placement.

      Seventeen women (aged 18-85) under the care of Cincinnati Urogynecology Associates, a
      physician group of TriHealth, who have chosen vaginal hysterectomy with uterosacral ligament
      suspension (USLS) as the treatment choice for pelvic organ prolapse (POP) will be enrolled.

      At the time of surgery, a titanium vascular clip (size small) will be applied to the base of
      each delayed absorbable suture placed at the vaginal apex on the internal vaginal side to
      help in identification by imaging.

      On postoperative day (POD) 1, patients will undergo CT pelvis scans. The CT scan will involve
      administration of IV contrast for imaging of the ureters and vascular structures. The clip
      will fall off when the sutures dissolve at 12 weeks postoperatively. All patients will be
      asked to complete a lower extremity neurological questionnaire preoperatively and
      postoperatively.
