      SNCA is the first gene implicated in monogenic parkinsonism. However, some polymorphisms of
      SNCA gene such as rs894278 and rs11931074 can affect the risk of sporadic PD. The
      investigators aim to establish a database of PD with SNCA variants and characterize the
      clinical manifestation of these patients in mainland China.

      Method:

        1. Peripheral blood from patients has been tested to have SNCA gene variants.

        2. Clinical manifestation will be measured by scales and neurological tests. Standard
           scales include: Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale(UPDRS), Hoehn-Yahr stages,
           Non-Motor Symptoms Scale (NMSS), mini-mental state examination (MMSE), Parkinson disease
           sleep scales (PDSS), Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Behaviour Disorder Questionnaire(RBDQ-HK),
           Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Rome III functional constipation scale, the Scale for
           Outcomes in PD for Autonomic Symptoms (SCOPA-AUT), Parkinson Fatigue Scale (PFS),
           Cambridge-Hopkins Restless Legs Syndrome questionnaire (CHRLSq), Hyposmia rating
           scale(HRS), Hamilton depression scale, the 39-item Parkinson's Disease
           Questionnaire(PDQ-39), Freezing of gait scale(FOG), dyskinesia related scales,
           Wearing-off scale(WO).

        3. The investigators will also exam the blood biomarkers of PD such as uric acid and
           peripheral inflammatory markers.
