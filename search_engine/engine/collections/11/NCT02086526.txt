      identify pathways associated with metformin's effect on insulin sensitivity, weight,
      androgens and endothelial function. This project will be the foundation for developing
      tailored therapeutic approaches to Polycystic Ovary Syndrome and identifying novel drug
      targets. This pilot project is intended to inform the development of hypothesis and specific
      aims for a future grant application to National Institutes of Health (NIH).
