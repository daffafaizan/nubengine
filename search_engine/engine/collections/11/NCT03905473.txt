      number) (each resident of Denmark has a permanent unique civil registration number that is
      provided at birth or immigration to Denmark). The mail contains a link for the software
      REDCap (Â© 2018 Vanderbilt University), recommended by Rigshospitalet. REDcap is a secure web
      application for building and managing online surveys and databases. Patients are, in REDcap,
      informed about the project, and if interested, asked to sign the included informed content
      and answer six validated and translated questionnaires.
