      fibrosis (CF). Infants who have a positive newborn screen require follow-up with a sweat
      test. Gibson-Cooke Quantitative Pilocarpine Iontophoresis (GCQPIT) requires collecting sweat
      in microbore tubing or on gauze/filter paper and analyzing sweat using a chloridometer. This
      test has many difficulties including specimens that are quantity not sufficient (QNS), many
      steps of pipetting solutions in the laboratory, and the need for a chloridometer to analyze
      sweat chloride concentration. The only manufacturer of a chloridometer has ceased production
      of this instrument. The CF QuantumÂ® Sweat Test System (CFQT) overcomes all of the
      difficulties of GCQPIT. This pilot study will determine if the CFQT provides results that are
      equivalent to GCQPIT.
