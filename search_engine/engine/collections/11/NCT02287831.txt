      devastating complication of diabetes is peripheral arterial disease (PAD), which may result
      in limb loss.In our study,patients were divided into 3 dose treatment groups (6.29 × 107,9.43
      × 107 and 14.15 × 107 cells/m2)。After 4 and 8 weeks, patients were injected the same number
      of cells. Follow-up index include: efficacy (pain,cold, numbness, Intermittent claudication
      distance, skin temperature，limb cyanosis area， area and depth of ulcers, gangrene
      range，ankle-brachial index, Transcutaneous partial pressure of oxygen ,lower limb amputation
      rate and , blood perfusion, Digital subtraction angiography) and safety (infection of the
      injection site, and tumour generation).
