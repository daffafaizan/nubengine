      randomized in parallel to a 1:1:1:1:1 ratio in five (5) groups of 20 subjects to receive one
      intramuscular injection at Days 0 and 21 of either a low, medium or high dose of H7 VLP
      vaccine mixed with AlhydrogelÂ® 0.4% (0.5 mg Aluminum per dose) or a high dose of H7 VLP alone
      or the placebo preparation (100 millimolar (mM) phosphate buffer + 150 mM sodium chloride
      (NaCl) + 0.01% Tween 80). Twenty-one (21) days after each immunization, key safety and
      immunogenicity data will be collected and analysed. All subjects will be followed for safety
      until Day 228.
