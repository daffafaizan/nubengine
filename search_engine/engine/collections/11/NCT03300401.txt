      I. Investigate the relationship between hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tumor perfusion on
      pre-procedural contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) time intensity curve (TIC) and
      post-procedural Yttrium-90 (90Y) microsphere distribution after 90Y radioembolization (RE).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Study the potential of serial CEUS TIC examinations as a marker of tumor treatment
      response as assessed at 20 - 24 week computed tomography (CT) follow-up.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive perflutren or sulfur hexafluoride lipid microspheres and undergo CEUS at
      baseline, 2 and 4 weeks, and 3 and 6 months. Patients also undergo positron emission
      tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) after standard of care 90Y radioembolization at
      baseline.
