      inadequately managed post-mastectomy pain in breast cancer patients can have detrimental
      physiological, psycho-behavioural, recovery and healthcare utilization consequences. Most
      significantly, acute postoperative pain appears to be a substantial risk factor for
      progression to chronic post-surgical pain (CPSP), occurring in up to 68% of patients,, with
      higher severity of acute pain being linked with a greater progression to CPSP. A multimodal
      analgesic approach is the optimal method of reducing the risk of progression to CPSP, and
      there are a number of analgesic techniques that can be used to reduce the incidence of acute
      postoperative pain. Of the analgesic techniques used, the most common are multimodal systemic
      analgesia, thoracic paravertebral blockade, thoracic epidural analgesia, local anesthetic
      wound infiltration, and more recently pecs blocks and serratus plane blocks. The former three
      techniques are all associated with drawbacks including technical challenges, high risk of
      adverse effects, and limited evidence to minimize the progression to CPSP states, whilst
      local anesthetic wound infiltration has highly variable pain outcomes. Therefore, an
      alternative, safer, and more effective technique would be ideal.

      Local infiltration analgesia (LIA) techniques have been demonstrated to be efficacious in
      joint surgery, whilst injection of local anesthesia in the serratus plane to target some of
      the intercostal and pectoral nerves may have some benefit in mastectomy surgery. However,
      nobody has yet performed LIA around these nerves in breast surgery, and the investigators
      feel that this has enormous potential.
