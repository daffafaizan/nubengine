      2-3 times as many gunshot injuries that require hospitalization. Firearm homicides
      overwhelmingly affect African American men aged 15-35. Building on prior efforts in violence
      prevention, the investigators propose to launch a hospital trauma service intervention that
      will take advantage of a "teachable moment" in the emergency room. All four hospitals
      providing Level I Trauma services in Allegheny County have agreed to host the program, an
      evidence-based effort developed by the National Network of Hospital Violence Intervention
      (NNHVI). Adaptation of the NNHVI model will focus on the social networks of gunshot victims
      as well as the victims themselves. Intervention efforts will range from job training and
      mentoring to relocation to different communities. The investigators will offer the
      opportunity to participate in the research and receive the intervention to all gunshot
      victims identified in county Level I trauma services. Participants in the research protocol
      will be asked to recruit their high-risk social network members for the intervention.
