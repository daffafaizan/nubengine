      therapy in localized aggressive periodontitis (LAP) patients.

      Method: 30 subjects were randomly and equally assigned to receive scaling and root planing;
      either with placebo pills (Group I) or β-glucan (100 mg/once a day) (Group II), for 40 days.
      Subjects were clinically monitored on day 0 and day 91. Gingival samples were harvested from
      hopeless teeth sites to be investigated histologically and immunohistochemically using matrix
      metalloproteinase (MMP)-1 and 9 antibodies form each patient; at the same time intervals.
