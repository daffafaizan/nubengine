      tape compared to 3M Micropore tape, a gold standard tape recognized for its gentleness and
      used as a mainstay in cosmetic surgery and neonatal care. A three-prong multidimensional
      evaluation consisting of laboratory assessments, expert skin grader and subject discomfort
      assessment will be used.
