      using gutta percha.

      The ten human dry mandibles will be submitted for:

        1. Digital Panoramic Radiography. Panoramic radiographs will be obtained using the SOREDEX
           CRANEX™ 3Dx unit. The exposure parameters will be 8Ma, 63kVp and 16.4 sec exposure time.

        2. Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT). SOREDEX CRANEX™ 3Dx unit will be used in this
           study. Images will be acquired at a single rotation. SOREDEX® MiniDose parameters will
           be used. The exposure parameters will be 3.2 Ma, 90kVp and 2.3 sec exposure time to take
           the advantage of 3D data in dose sensitive cases like children, or reduce the radiation
           dose for the patient.

      The real linear measurements will be measured in millimeter on dry mandibles using digital
      caliper and will be compared with measurements obtained from both techniques.

      Images will be evaluated by two experienced radiologists of ten years of experience. Each one
      will evaluate the images separately twice with a period of two weeks in-between the two
      reading sessions. The researcher will measure out the real linear measurements on the dry
      mandibles using digital caliper.
