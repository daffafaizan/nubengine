    
      This is a prospective case collection study for the purpose of collecting cases for the
      subsequent Reader Studies at a minimum of two clinical sites.

      Potential subjects will be recruited from a group of women who have undergone diagnostic
      mammography and demonstrate a mammographic lesion in at least one view. Approximately 300
      women will be enrolled. Subjects will undergo QTUS following a diagnostic XRM with a
      mammographically-detected lesion(s) in at least one mammographic view and will have a lesion
      seen on HHUS corresponding to the XRM lesion(s). Potential Subjects will be eligible for
      enrollment at the time the corresponding lesion is identified on HHUS. All subjects will
      undergo an ultrasound guided aspiration/biopsy with cytology to determine whether the lesion
      is a cyst or solid.

      Each study site is projected to collect approximately 75 cyst cases and 75 solid cases for a
      total of 150 cases, stratified across the four (4) recognized breast tissue density
      categories with at least 50% of cases from subjects with heterogeneous and extremely dense
      breast compositions. The composition of the cyst cases at each site is projected to consist
      of 25 simple cysts and 50 complicated and complex cysts for a total of 75 cyst cases. All
      enrolled subjects will undergo ultrasound guided aspiration or biopsy or surgical excision,
      as applicable for the index lesion. Cytologic or histologic results for all lesions will be
      performed and collected.
