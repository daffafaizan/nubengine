        -  To determine the quit-smoking rate of the KOTAK programme

        -  To determine the factors associated with quitting smoking with the KOTAK programme

      Important aspects of the KOTAK programme evaluation will involve assessing its impacts on
      preventing smoking initiation and promoting smoking cessation among the adolescents. This
      form of assessment is vital in achieving the KOTAK's objectives to reduce the prevalence of
      smokers in Malaysian schools. An average of 8 hours of training were required for dental
      officers and dental nurses to deliver the modules in the KOTAK programme. This programme has
      an important financial implication as it involved almost 4 thousand dental officers and 3
      thousand dental nurses to screen almost 4.6 million Malaysian schoolchildren in 2018.

      Factors yielding promising results for adolescents to quit smoking are important to be
      researched. This will provide us with valuable insights from the perspectives of the
      stakeholders pertaining on areas that needed improvement. Despite the existence of various
      tobacco-prevention program in public schools, KOTAK is deemed significant as it is a yearly
      collaboration of School Dental Services with the schools. This study will compare the quit
      smoking rate between Intervention (with KOTAK Programme) and Control (without KOTAK programme
      ) schools. The sampling unit was the school.
