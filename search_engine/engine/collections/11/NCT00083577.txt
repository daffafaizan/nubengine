    
      Patients will receive thalidomide in the oral form (by mouth). Then the dose of thalidomide
      will be increased each week until week 7 as long as there are no significant side effects.
      After week 7, patients will continue to receive thalidomide as long as there is no toxicity
      requiring the treatment to be stopped and as long as there is no evidence of rapid tumor
      growth during the treatment with thalidomide.

      Routine physical examinations and blood tests will be done to monitor the effect of treatment
      and the toxicities encountered, if any, and provide the available treatments for side effects
      accordingly. Blood tests will be done once a month for the first six months of receiving
      thalidomide.
