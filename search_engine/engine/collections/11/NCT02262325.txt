      I. To estimate the primary tumor control rate at 12 months.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To further establish safety and tolerability of this regimen. II. To estimate the rates of
      regional, distant control as well as progression-free survival and overall survival.

      III. To evaluate the objective response rate (ORR) to this regimen. IV. To evaluate the
      response of tumors to stereotactic (high-dose) radiation using magnetic resonance tumor
      perfusion imaging modalities (magnetic resonance [MR]-dynamic contrast-enhanced
      [DCE]/perfusion weighted imaging [PWI], MR-diffusion, blood oxygenation level dependent
      [BOLD] sequences).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients will receive a hypofractionated boost to the primary tumor over 2 fractions (at
      least 40 hours apart) during week 1. Beginning week 2, patients receive cisplatin
      intravenously (IV) on days 8, 15, 36, and 43; and etoposide IV over 60 minutes on days 8-12
      and 36-40. If carboplatin and paclitaxel is administered concurrently with radiotherapy, 2
      cycles of carboplatin (AUC=6 mg/min/mL IV on day 1, 22) and paclitaxel (200 mg/m2 IV on day
      1, 22) consolidation chemotherapy are required, to be administered starting 4-6 weeks after
      concurrent chemoradiation has ended. Each cycle is 21 days long. If cisplatin and etoposide
      is administered concurrently with radiotherapy, consolidation chemotherapy is not allowed.
      Patients also undergo standard conformal radiation therapy once daily (QD) 5 days a week for
      a total of 30 fractions. Treatment continues for 6 weeks in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for 3 years.
