      technology-focused interventions addressing the HIV prevention and care continuum for youth.
      In years 1-2 of the iTech grant, the investigators optimized and pilot tested using a similar
      study design and identical study outcomes, two distinct mobile apps called LYNX and
      MyChoices. Each app is designed to increase HIV testing and PrEP uptake among YMSM. In this
      study, the individual apps are being tested in this follow-on research study to evaluate for
      efficacy. YMSM will be randomized to receive either MyChoices, LYNX, or SOC. LYNX uses the
      Information-Motivation-Behavior Skills (IMB) model and is a highly interactive mobile app to
      promote accurate risk perception, increase HIV/STI testing, and linkage to PrEP. MyChoices is
      guided by the Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) model, is adapted from HealthMindr and developed
      using iterative feedback from youth refined to maximize acceptability among YMSM. It includes
      three major functions that are designed to promote self-efficacy, self-regulation,
      goal-setting and environmental influences to impact behavior change. The SOC includes
      information on HIV testing and PrEP with the provision of referrals to local HIV/STI testing
      and PrEP resources.
