      preventable and treatable disease. Difficulties in diagnosis arise in non-radiopaque foreign
      body aspirations. Recently, when there is a suspicious history, bronchoscopy is recommended.
      Bronchoscopy is used to both diagnose and treat foreign body aspiration. Bronchoscopy seems
      to continue to be performed in suspicious cases until a method to establish a definitive
      diagnosis of foreign body aspirations before the operation is invented. In our study, to
      compare patients under 5 years of age with foreign body aspiration and without foreign body
      aspiration with radiological and blood gas results.
