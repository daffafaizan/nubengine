      the skin surface) near the ankle. In most people, such an injury should heal up within a week
      or two. However, when there is an underlying problem with the skin, ulcers do not heal and
      may result in longstanding (chronic), painful, smelly and embarrassing wounds. The ulcers are
      often due to varicose veins in the legs, which can cause skin breakdown and ulcer formation.
      To get the ulcer to heal, the current best treatment is to wear a tight compression bandage
      with multiple layers, with which about 60% of these ulcers will heal within 24 weeks. There
      is evidence that treatment of the varicose veins by surgery will prevent the ulcer from
      returning after it has healed. Recent studies have suggested that newer techniques of
      treating varicose veins, such as injecting a medicine into the varicose vein (sclerotherapy)
      or treating the vein with heat ablation to seal it (using laser or radiofrequency), in an
      outpatient setting may help the ulcers to heal more quickly and (like surgery) reduce the
      chance of the ulcer coming back. These techniques can be carried out in the outpatient
      setting and are much better tolerated by patients in comparison to surgery. The aim of this
      study is to see whether early treatment of varicose veins using sclerotherapy or heat
      ablation helps with healing.
