      undergo major surgery that require postoperative patient controlled morphine analgesia so as
      to examine the monitoring performance of oxygen desaturation, respiratory depression and
      patient satisfaction and user feedback.

      Patients who are undergoing elective surgery with plan to use postoperative patient
      controlled analgesia with morphine will receive study information either at pre-operative
      assessment clinic or upon admission for surgery if they have not attended the pre-operative
      assessment clinic. They will be screened for eligibility using the inclusion and exclusion
      criteria. If eligible for recruitment, the patients will be approached by the investigators
      for recruitment. Upon successful recruitment of the study, patients will be asked to complete
      two questionnaires and rate their pre-surgical pain on the numerical rating scale in the
      pre-anaesthetic evaluation clinic. The general anaesthesia technique and type of analgesia
      administered intra-operatively will be according to standard practice and is at the
      discretion of the attending anaesthesiologist. After surgery, patients will be reviewed daily
      (up to 3 days) in the post-operative wards. They will be asked on questionnaire scoring, pain
      score, and analgesia information and adverse event, if any.
