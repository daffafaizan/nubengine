      affects females. Previous work has shown increased sensitivity to painful and non-painful
      sensory stimuli in adults with fibromyalgia, as well as brain processing abnormalities
      associated with these stimuli. These abnormalities in adults are highly predictive of
      fibromyalgia status (as opposed to healthy status) in adults. Although JFM has some similar
      symptoms and features to fibromyalgia in adults, the neural mechanisms of JFM may be
      partially different, given the moment of sharp brain development characterising JFM. fMRI
      scans will be completed before and after different treatments for JFM (e.g. neuromuscular
      training + cognitive behavioral therapy, graded aerobic exercise) to investigate the effects
      of treatment on brain measures related to pain, fatigue and emotion processing.
