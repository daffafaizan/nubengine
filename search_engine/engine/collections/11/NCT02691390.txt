    
      Phase 1: (up to 2 weeks), participants undergo a set of baseline assessments, including
      questionnaires, rating scales, and resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging
      (rsfMRI).

      Phase 2, patients receive one of two treatments: High-frequency (10Hz, 100 trains of 3 sec
      with 15 sec inter train interval) dTMS targeting the ACC or sham stimulation for 30 min. Each
      treatment is preceded by provocation (pouring, holding and smelling the subject's favorite
      alcoholic beverage) designed to activate the relevant brain circuitry (provocation of
      symptoms may increase response rate to Deep TMS as was evident in the treatment of PTSD,
      cigarette smoking and OCD). dTMS sessions are conducted five times per week for 3 weeks, for
      a total of 15 sessions. A second scan that include rsfMRI and a risk-related decision-making
      task is conducted at the end of this phase.

      Phase 3 includes 12 weeks of patients' follow-up, including clinical visits at weeks 1, 2, 4,
      8 and 12 post treatment. During this phase, subjective and objective measures of alcohol use
      (self-report and analysis of urine samples for levels of ethyl glucuronide (EtG) and ethyl
      sulfate (EtS), respectively) are collected. Following completion of the main part by the
      individual, an "open label" treatment using the same parameters of the experiment is offer
      (regardless of treatment group).
