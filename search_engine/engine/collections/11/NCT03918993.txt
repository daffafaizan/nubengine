      Urology department of a private hospital between July 2017 and October 2018 were evaluated
      retrospectively. The number of samples to be included in the study was determined by the help
      of the computer-assisted power analysis. Random sampling was performed from all cohorts of
      patients with ED. Thirty-one male patients between the ages of 39-65 with organic erectile
      dysfunction more than one year and treated with OAD 5 mg dose of tadalafil for eight weeks
      were selected as the treatment group (group T)The patients in group T have been assessed both
      before (T1) and after (T2) the treatment.

      Between the ages of 39-65, thirty-one healthy men who were admitted to the internal medicine
      outpatient clinic for their annual follow-up were selected consecutively and the control
      group (group C) was formed. All subjects in the control group were sexually active men with
      regular monogamous heterosexual relationships during the last one year.
