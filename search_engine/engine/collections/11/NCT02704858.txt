      NEO100 is a highly purified (>99%) form of perillyl alcohol. Studies in Brazil suggest
      improved survival for patients with recurrent glioblastoma. Doses of 96 mg qid, 144mg qid,
      192mg qid, and 288 mg qid administered intranasally to patients with recurrent GBM for up to
      6 months, disease progression or death. From 3 to 6 patients will be evaluated after first
      cycle (28 days) until MTD is reached. MRI with gadolinium will be at base line, and at the
      beginning of even cycles. A total of 25 patients will be treated at the MTD. PK studies will
      be conducted during Phase 1 at first dosing, and after first dose of 3rd cycle.
