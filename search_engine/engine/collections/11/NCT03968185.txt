      acute unspecific low back pain.

      Ultrasound-guided interfascial infiltration is proposed to eligible patients presenting to
      our ED with low back pain and disability, as part of routine care. Patients receive standard
      medical treatment if they refuse interfascial infiltration or in case of absence or
      unavailability of a trained operator.

      Patients were followed-up at 1 day and 7-days pots ED discharge by telephone interview
      conducted by an independent member of our research team not involved in patient's management
