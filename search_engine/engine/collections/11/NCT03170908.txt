      community delivery of Interpersonal Psychotherapy. In Phase I, 250 pairs of therapist-patient
      dyads will be observed as IPT Fidelity measures are developed and validated. In Phase II, 175
      pairs of therapist-patient dyads will be observed to prospectively validate the IPT Fidelity
      measures with longitudinal outcomes on the PHQ-9.
