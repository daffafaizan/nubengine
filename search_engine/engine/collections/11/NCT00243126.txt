    
      Participants will be involved with the study and follow up for a total of 32 to 36 weeks.

      68-84 female adolescents and their mother/guardian (total N = 136-168).

      African American or mixed race, sexually active female adolescents age 15 to 19 who are at
      risk for HIV infection and their mother/guardian

      The adolescent participant and her mother/guardian will be randomized to either a
      family-based risk reduction intervention or a no-treatment control group condition.

      Participants in both conditions will be assessed at baseline, immediate post-intervention,
      and at 3- and 6-month follow-ups. A subset of 24 participants from the intervention condition
      (12 adolescents and 12 mothers) will participate in a qualitative interview following the
      6-month follow-up, in which information will be obtained on participant perception of
      procedures and intervention content, and whether they have utilized skills taught following
      the end of the project.

      Interviewers will collect participant data from the baseline and follow-up behavioral
      interviews using a Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI) method on a portable
      computer.
