    
      Background:

        -  Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia (CIN) is caused by persistent infection with the
           Human Papillomavirus (HPV).

        -  High-grade lesions are common, affecting 5% of the female population in the United
           States, and are more likely to progress to cervical cancer.

        -  Surgical and ablative therapies are effective but can lead to long-term morbidity. New
           treatment modalities are needed.

        -  E7 TCR T cells have demonstrated safety and clinical activity in treatment-refractory
           metastatic HPV+ cancers.

      Objectives:

      - To determine the safety of intralesional injection of E7 TCR T cells as therapy for high-
      grade CIN.

      Eligibility:

      - Patients greater than or equal to 21 years of age with HPV16-associated, high-grade CIN.

      Design:

        -  This is a phase I clinical trial with a 3+3 dose escalation design.

        -  Patients will receive intralesional injections of E7 TCR T cells.

        -  Patients will not receive a conditioning chemotherapy regimen or systemic aldesleukin.
