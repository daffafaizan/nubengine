        -  To gain an initial understanding of the ethical, family, and related concerns that
           individuals may have when offered the option of providing family medical history online
           for genetic risk assessment or research.

        -  To identify specific directions for future research into the ethics of online genetic
           risk assessment.

      OUTLINE: Participants undergo a 45-60 minute interview to assess their attitudes and concerns
      about providing family medical history online for genetic risk assessment or research.
      Participants' feelings about whether or not to use an online genetic assessment tool (i.e.,
      Genetic Risk Easy Assessment Tool [GREAT]) are explored. The GREAT allows for the electronic
      creation, analysis, and dissemination of family histories of individuals who may be at risk
      for various types of cancer. Key factors influencing a participant's use of the tool,
      including concerns about confidentiality, privacy, informed consent, access to risk
      information, and security of online family history databases, are explored. Ethical issues
      regarding communication and agreement among family members on disclosing family medical
      history are also discussed.
