    
      In a prospective, randomized, double-blind trial, 65 patients undergoing elective lower limb
      amputation were assigned to one of five analgesic regimens. Patients in groups 1-4 had lumbar
      epidural catheter placed 48 hours before amputation, and received epidural
      bupivacaine/fentanyl or saline infusion before and/or after amputation. Patients receiving
      epidural saline also had IV Fentanyl Patient-Control Analgesia, whereas patients receiving
      epidural analgesia also had IV saline. Group 5 (control) received IM meperidine and oral
      codeine/acetaminophen. VAS and McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ) scores (for ischemic, phantom
      and stump pain) were recorded starting 48 hours before, continuing until 48 hours after
      amputation, and at 4 days, 10 days, 1 and 6 months after amputation. Phantom and stump pain
      intensity and frequency were the main study endpoints.
