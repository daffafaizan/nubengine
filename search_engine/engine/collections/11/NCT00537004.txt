      anatomical and physiological changes in people with PPA throughout the course of the illness.
      The researchers in this study want to increase awareness of PPA, educate others about this
      unique disorder, and to encourage more research to eventually develop therapies.

      During the three-day research program, participants will be asked to undergo
      neuropsychological testing (paper and pencil tests that evaluate cognition), advanced imaging
      (MRI and PET), eyetracking experiments, and other computer and language testing batteries.
      Participants may be asked to return every two years to complete the same measures.

      For participants not living near Chicago, IL, flights and accommodations (for both the person
      with PPA and their companion) will be covered by the study.
