      studies found sympathetic nerves over activity in chronic renal failure patients. Traditional
      therapies included medications and dialysis replacement therapy need to spend much money.
      Renal ablation for sympathetic modification is a new method which is proved to be effective
      in decreasing sympathetic nerves activity. We assume that modifying renal sympathetic
      activity by ablation is effective and safe in treatment of chronic renal failure. This trial
      is going to recruit 200 patients (Ablation group VS Control group = 1:1) with a follow-up
      duration of 3 years. Patients in ablation group will receive additional necessary medications
      besides expectant intervention, and patients in control group will receive appropriate
      medications only. We aim to observe the effect of serum creatinine, creatinine clearance
      rate, glomerular filtration rate, urine microalbumin, urine microalbumin/creatinine, and
      composite cardio cerebrovascular events after renal sympathetic modification using
      THERMOCOOLÂ® catheter, and evaluate safety and efficacy of the intervention.
