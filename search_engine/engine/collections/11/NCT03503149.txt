        -  To ensure a prospective documentation of all patients who are referred to the Molecular
           Tumor Board in routine clinical care

        -  To prospectively ensure the documentation of MTB patients with an emphasis to clinical
           outcome parameters progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and further
           response assessments (e.g. peripheral immunmonitoring, imaging parameters)

        -  To prospectively assess patient-reported outcome of MTB patients

        -  To evaluate compliance to MTB suggestions in routine clinical care
