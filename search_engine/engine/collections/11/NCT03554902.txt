      banding. Despite its advantages (long term weight loss, comorbidities related to obesity
      improvement…), bariatric surgery is risky. In fact, complications putting the patient into a
      life-threatening condition can occur. Endoscopic approaches are similar to current surgical
      methods but less invasive, safer and allow ambulatory care.

      Nowadays, practitioners have the possibility to reduce stomach size by merging tissues
      through an endoscopic endoluminal suture approach without any incision. This leads to similar
      results (gastric restriction, weight loss, quality of life and comorbidities improvement)
      compared with standard surgical procedure while reducing the risk of complications.

      One of the major benefit of this technique is its reversibility. A new surgical or endoscopic
      procedure is possible at a later stage.

      Endoscopic gastric tubulization is currently proposed in the Digestive Surgery Department of
      the Nouvel Hôpital Civil, Strasbourg, France, to adult patients with morbid obesity. The
      procedure is performed using the CE marked endoscopic suture device Overstitch (Apollo
      Endosurgery, Austin, Tx. USA). It is standard practice since October 2016.

      The objective of this study is to prospectively collect data of patients who underwent an
      endoscopic gastric tubulization, from last visit before procedure to 2 years after procedure.
      These data are usually collected during medical consultations and will enable the evaluation
      of weight loss, quality of life and comorbidities improvement, reproducibility and durability
      of the technique.
