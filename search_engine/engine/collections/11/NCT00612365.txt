      life-threatening cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Abdominal fat is made up of structurally and
      functionally different tissues, which include visceral fat, subcutaneous fat, and
      intramuscular fat. The distribution and levels of these fat tissues are highly variable among
      obese people, and the effects of ABC differences on cardiovascular health are not well known.
      Notably, the standard measure of body mass index cannot distinguish between different kinds
      or ratios of tissue types that make up body weight and, therefore, may not be the best
      measurement tool. Determining the specific measures of these tissue types by computed
      tomography (CT) may provide better insight into the varied CVD risk seen among different
      ethnicities, sexes, and ages. This study will evaluate the association between volumetric
      measures of ABC, CVD risk, and inflammation in terms of ethnicity-, sex-, and age-specific
      variables.

      This substudy will use data and specimens, including blood samples and CT scans, from
      participants in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) for abdominal aortic calcium
      (AAC). Stored blood samples will be used to perform assays for several measures of
      inflammation and to generate new data on biomarkers and subclinical CVD measures. The
      existing CT scans will be used to calculate five discrete volumetric measures of ABC, which
      will include subcutaneous fat, visceral fat, intramuscular fat, the visceral fat to visceral
      cavity ratio, and the lean muscle to visceral fat ratio. There will be no study visits for
      this study.
