      cardiovascular disease risk factors. The cellular programs activated by caloric restriction
      are similarly turned on in preclinical studies in response to a 24-hour fast. We have found
      that a beneficial effect of a 24-hour fasting blunts the activation of a component of the
      immune system, termed the inflammasome, which is associated with the development of diabetes
      and atherosclerosis. We would like to study the inflammasome in human blood cells to evaluate
      whether the beneficial immune effects of fasting/caloric restriction are operational in
      humans. Blood samples to test the immune response will be collected in subjects after a fixed
      caloric meal and in response to a 24-hour fast (water intake will not be restricted). The
      objective of this pilot study is to identify if these immune adaptive pathways can be
      activated in human subjects as a possible readout to test whether this pathway could be
      investigated as a therapeutic target to blunt/negate the inflammation associated with
      nutrient-excess associated diseases such as diabetes and/or atherosclerosis.
