      to determine if there is an effect of feeding RS on zinc homeostasis and environmental
      enteropathy. These children are at high risk for zinc deficiency and environmental
      enteropathy by their demographic characteristics. Children will first have a quantitative
      assessment of zinc homeostasis where each child is given 2 zinc stable isotopes, one by mouth
      and another intravenously, which is followed by a stool and urine collection of 4 days. Zinc
      isotopes are quantified in the feces and urine, and these values are used to calculate the
      primary outcome, net zinc balance. This is followed by an assessment of environmental
      enteropathy quantitatively measured using the non-invasive site specific sugar absorption
      test, where each child drinks 100 mL of a sugar solution and a urine collection follows. The
      quantities of non-metabolizable sugars are measured, and the ratio of two of the sugars,
      lactulose and mannitol, is a measure of environmental enteropathy. Then the children will
      receive a dietary supplement, corn starch that has been modified to reduce its dietary
      absorption, for 5 weeks, which they will add to their phala. The RS is a standard food
      product that has been used safely in many millions of people for several decades. After
      taking this RS for 4 weeks both the zinc stable isotope test and the dual sugar absorption
      test will be repeated on the children to see if they have improved. These results will offer
      preliminary data as to whether RS might be used effectively on a large scale in the community
      to alleviate zinc deficiency and/or environmental enteropathy.
