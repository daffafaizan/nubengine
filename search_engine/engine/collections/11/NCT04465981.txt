    
      A longitudinal, non-randomized study to evaluate the utility of the INanoBio's protein arrays
      in detecting unique antibodies in COVID-19 patients. To study the feasibility of utilizing a
      viral proteome microarray for evaluating exposure status, immunity status, diagnosis, and
      prognosis of SARS-CoV-2 infections during and after the course of disease. The sample size is
      to include 80 subjects: 40 diagnosed with COVID-19 and 40 suspected to have COVID-19. The
      goal will be to assess antibodies throughout the subject's disease course compared to
      controls.
