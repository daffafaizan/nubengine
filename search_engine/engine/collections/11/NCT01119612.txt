      including Tanzania. There is a paucity of good quality randomized trials assessing the safety
      and efficacy of iron supplementation in pregnancy, and its effects on perinatal health
      outcomes. Prenatal iron supplementation is recommended based on its demonstrated benefit in
      preventing and treating maternal anemia. There is limited data on the efficacy of iron
      supplementation on pregnancy outcomes, including birth weight. There are also concerns
      regarding the use of iron supplementation, particularly among non-anemic women. In
      particular, there is a lack of research on the safety and efficacy of prenatal iron
      supplementation in developing regions, characterized by extensive burden of iron deficiency,
      malaria, and other endemic infectious diseases. Evidence from randomized controlled trials is
      urgently needed to examine the safety and efficacy of iron supplements among pregnant women
      in malaria endemic regions, particularly among women who are not anemic.

      NOTE: The time frames listed for the maternal malaria and hemoglobin outcomes were updated on
      4/22/15. This record initially indicated that maternal malaria anemia and hemoglobin would be
      measured at several specific time points throughout the study. Instead, maternal malaria was
      measured throughout pregnancy and hemoglobin was measured only at delivery. Due to an
      oversight, we did not update this record when this protocol change took effect at the start
      of the study.
