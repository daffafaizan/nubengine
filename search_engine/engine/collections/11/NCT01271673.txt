      (PO) Clinic, TMH. All women attending for screening of common cancers at the Preventive
      Oncology OPD at TMH are demonstrated the technique of BSE and advised on when, how and why to
      perform BSE.

      Women attending the PO clinic and who have mentioned their residential address as Mumbai and
      provided contact number will be invited to participate in the study. They will be explained
      the study protocol and those who are interested in participating will be offered informed
      consent forms. The women who sign the informed consent form will be enrolled into the trial.

      The data regarding the socio-demographic details and level of knowledge, attitude and
      practice (KAP) about breast cancer and BSE will be collected from the participating women.
      They will be asked if they have any doubts regarding the technique of BSE and their
      willingness to perform BSE. Thereafter, a follow-up period of 3 months, the women will be
      contacted telephonically to collect the data to assess the level of compliance to BSE and the
      reasons for non-compliance, if any. Also, the compliant women will be asked if they have
      observed any abnormal changes in their breasts and have they visited the clinician for the
      same. And subsequently, their health care seeking behaviour will be studied.

      The data collected before and after the follow-up will be entered in the SPSS software and
      analyzed using simple statistical tests like mean, chi-square, t-test and univariate and
      multivariate analysis.
