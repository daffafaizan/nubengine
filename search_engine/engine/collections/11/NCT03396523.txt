      losartan (50mg) on fear extinction in healthy male participants will be examined.
      Participants will initially undergo a Pavlovian fear conditioning procedure, followed by the
      administration of 50mg losartan or placebo. 90 minutes after treatment subjects will undergo
      the fear extinction procedure. Neural activity and psychophysiological indices of arousal
      will be assessed by the simultaneous acquisition of functional magnetic resonance imaging
      (fMRI) and skin conductance data.
