      curriculum. Persons with increased risk for developing type 2 diabetes will be exposed to an
      initial "orientation session" designed to frame the rationale for participation in the
      program and to encourage attendance to a core series of sessions. This orientation session
      will reinforce the pre-diabetes status of participants and present the rationale for
      lifestyle modification as a means to reduce diabetes risk. In addition, this session will
      highlight the recommended sessions and topics that are needed to help reduce risk. In many
      respects it mirrors the curriculum content used in the DPP with regards to themes and
      specific topics. There are significant differences, however, between the two approaches that
      warrant investigation. Weight Watchers uses a point system to help users select appropriate
      foods. This system is less focused on fat gram control as a central theme than was the case
      with the DPP. More importantly, it uses an "open visit" system in which users get a core set
      of materials for home review that is then reviewed in facilitated group sessions. In this
      regard, the group session content is not configured as a sequential series of sessions
      delivered in a specific order, as was the case with the DPP. Moreover, participants can
      rejoin groups at any time that they choose. Weight Watchers also provides a sophisticated set
      of support materials online, using both phone apps (to help users track food consumption and
      "points" used) and a website program. The open attendance feature and the availability of
      online support should, in theory, facilitate long-term adherence.
