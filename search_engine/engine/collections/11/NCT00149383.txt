    
      Study Rationale: Evidence suggests that if PPAR-RXR agonists (such as rosiglitazone) are used
      as adjunctive therapy in P. falciparum malaria infections they may increase phagocytic
      clearance of P. falciparum malaria, modulate deleterious inflammatory responses and decrease
      sequestration of malaria parasites in vital organs. They may therefore represent a novel
      immunomodulatory treatment approach for P. falciparum malaria.

      Study Objectives: 1) To examine the in vivo effect of rosiglitazone on the rapidity of
      clearance of P. falciparum parasitemia and fever in patients with non-severe P. falciparum
      infections 2) To assess the safety and tolerability of adjunctive rosiglitazone treatment in
      non-severe cases of P. falciparum infection.

      Primary Outcomes: Time to clearance of P. falciparum parasitemia

      Study Design: Randomized double blind placebo-controlled trial.

      Intervention: Standard antimalarial treatment (atovaquone/proguanil) to all patients combined
      with adjuvant rosiglitazone treatment (8mg per day) or placebo.

      Setting: Hospital for Tropical Diseases at Mahidol University, Thailand.

      Participants: 140 patients with non-severe P. falciparum infection.

      Follow-up: 28 days
