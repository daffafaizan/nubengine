      extracorporeal shock wave (ESWL), ureteroscopy, open surgery and percutaneous nephrolithotomy
      (PCNL). PCNL in an inpatient procedure performed in two steps. Step 1, is the placement of a
      drainage line (nephrostomy tube) from the back into the collecting system of the kidney. This
      step is typically performed by interventional radiologists under conscious sedation. Step 2
      is performed by urologists and involves dilating the tract of the nephrostomy tube, placement
      of an access sheath and actual removal of the stone using endoscopic equipment. The minimally
      invasive approach of PCNL is well accepted to be as effective as open procedures for stone
      removal with less morbidity. Post-operative pain management remains challenging and can lead
      to extended hospital stays.

      on intra-operative and post-operative pain control.
