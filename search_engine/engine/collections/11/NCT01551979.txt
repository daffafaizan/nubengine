      demonstrated the safety of image-guided theta burst stimulation (TBS) form of rTMS over the
      cerebellar vermis (Demirtas-Tatlidede et al., 2010) in eigh patients with schizophrenia.

      The primary goal of the present study is to assess efficacy of iTBS to the cerebellar vermis
      on positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. A second, added goal is to investigate
      the mechanisms of the expected clinical improvement.

      Schizophrenia is a leading cause of mental disability and current treatments still remain
      only partially successful for many patients. Our underlying hypothesis is that modulation of
      the cerebellar vermis may enhance activity of the neural systems that sub-serve cognition and
      emotion, reestablish the disturbed cerebellar regulation in schizophrenic patients, and
      produce clinical improvement.
