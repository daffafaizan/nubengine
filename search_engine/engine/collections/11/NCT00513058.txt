      Primary

        -  Evaluate the tolerability and feasibility of the lapatinib ditosylate and vinorelbine
           ditartrate combination by determining the maximum tolerated dose of vinorelbine
           ditartrate in combination with a biologically active dose of lapatinib ditosylate.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the maximum administered dose.

        -  Investigate the pharmacokinetic interactions related to the combination of vinorelbine
           ditartrate and lapatinib ditosylate.

        -  Determine the toxicity of vinorelbine ditartrate and lapatinib ditosylate.

        -  Determine the objective response rate in patients with measurable lesions.

        -  Validate the safety and efficacy of the oral vinorelbine ditartrate and lapatinib
           ditosylate combination, according to the vinorelbine ditartrate oral/IV dose
           equivalence.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive oral lapatinib ditosylate on days -7 to 21 for course 1 and on days 1-21 for
      all other courses. Patients also receive vinorelbine ditartrate IV over 15 minutes on days 1
      and 8. Courses repeat every 21 days for up to 12 months in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-9 patients receive escalating doses of lapatinib ditosylate and vinorelbine
      ditartrate until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the
      dose preceding that at which 2 of 9 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity during course
      1.

      Once the MTD is determined for oral lapatinib ditosylate and IV vinorelbine ditartrate, an
      additional cohort of 9 patients receive oral vinorelbine ditartrate with oral lapatinib
      ditosylate as above.
