      toxin-mediated intestinal injury and inflammation. Two primary mechanisms will be examined.

        -  To examine the hypothesis is that microRNA expression profiles are dysregulated by
           Clostridium difficile toxin exposure and that dysregulation of miRNA expression plays a
           role in the pathogenesis of C. difficile associated diseases.

        -  To examine the hypothesis is that the TLR9 receptor mediates key inflammatory events in
           response to Clostridium difficile toxin exposure.
