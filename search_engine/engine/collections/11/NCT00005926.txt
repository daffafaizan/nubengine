      administered concurrently with radiotherapy in patients with regionally confined resectable
      or unresectable adenocarcinoma of the pancreas that overexpress HER2. Patients will be
      treated with external beam radiation in a standard manner over 6 weeks prior to surgical
      exploration. Gemcitabine and Herceptin will be administered on the first day of irradiation
      and weekly during the course of radiotherapy. Patients will be assessed for resectability
      after treatment and may undergo a pancreatic resection. Patients will then be treated with
      once weekly gemcitabine and herceptin for three weeks followed by 1 week of rest for up to 6
      months. Patients will be assessed clinically for toxicity, tumor response, progression-free
      survival, and overall survival.
