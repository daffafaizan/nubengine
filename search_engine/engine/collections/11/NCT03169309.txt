      A sample of 162 military healthcare beneficiaries (within the Kaiserslautern Military
      Community footprint) with complaints of poor sleep quality will be instructed to wear sleep
      actigraphy monitors and complete daily sleep diaries upon waking for a total of four weeks.
      On weeks 3 and 4, participants will use BET at bedtime for a minimum of 30 minutes. Pre and
      post sleep quality measures will be compared along with pre- and post- c-reactive protein
      (CRP) measures and a post-study questionnaire to assess participants' perception about the
      technology.
