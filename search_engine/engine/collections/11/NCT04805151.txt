      patient's medical record from the hospital, the national prescription database of the
      Directorate of Health, and the and ICD-10 codes from primary care records. For this analysis,
      medicines will be classified into drug classes based on the first five characters of their
      WHO Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) code. The prevalence (pre) and incidence (post) of
      polypharmacy (≥5 or more regular medicines) and hyper-polypharmacy (≥10 regular medicines)
      will be calculated. Potentially inappropriate prescribing will be assessed in individuals ≥65
      years applying Beers 2019, Start and Stopp 2014, explicit prescribing criteria. The analysis
      will be restricted to older individuals, as Beers criteria have not been validated in younger
      age groups. The anticholinergic burden will be assessed for all individuals ≥18 years will be
      assessed by applying the anticholinergic burden scale This stratification is important in
      order to deliver targeted interventions in resource-limited healthcare settings
