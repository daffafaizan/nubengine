      gemcitabine, fluoropyrimidines and platinum agents. The United Kingdom (UK) National Cancer
      Research Network (NCRN) ABC-02 study established cisplatin and gemcitabine as the standard of
      care for the first-line treatment of patients with ABC and this regimen has been widely
      adopted in the UK and internationally. However, inherent and acquired tumour resistance
      limits the efficacy of gemcitabine and it is necessary to explore alternative treatments.

      The study will explore the combination of acelarin, a drug designed to specifically overcome
      the key cancer resistance mechanisms associated with gemcitabine, with cisplatin. As this is
      the first time the combination of acelarin and cisplatin will be given to patients the aim of
      the study is to investigate the safety of the combination and to establish the recommended
      phase II dose of acelarin.

      This is a phase Ib, single-arm, multi-centre, open-label trial. The trial design is a classic
      3+3 design where patients are recruited into cohorts of 3 to 6 patients at different dose
      levels until the dose level for phase II is determined. Patients in each cohort will be
      monitored closely for safety and drug toxicity.

      Secondary trial objectives will involve assessing the activity of acelarin in combination
      with cisplatin in terms ofÍ¾ progression-free survival, overall survival and response rate, as
      well as exploring the pharmacokinetic profile of the combination.
