    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated doses (MTD) of AZD1775 (adavosertib) in combination
      with the current standard of care (radiotherapy/temozolomide for concomitant therapy and
      temozolomide for adjuvant therapy) for treating patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma.

      II. To define the MTD of AZD1775 (adavosertib) in combination with 6 weeks of daily
      (Monday-Friday [M-F]) radiotherapy (RT) and concomitant temozolomide (TMZ) administered at 75
      mg/m^2/day in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma. (Arm 1) III. To define the MTD of
      AZD1775 (adavosertib) in combination with adjuvant TMZ administered at 150 mg/m^2/day-200
      mg/m^2/day for 5 days every 28 days in patients with glioblastoma after concurrent RT/TMZ.
      (Arm 2)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To characterize the safety profile of AZD1775 (adavosertib) in combination with RT and
      concomitant TMZ (Arm 1) and AZD1775 (adavosertib) with adjuvant TMZ (Arm 2) in patients with
      newly diagnosed glioblastoma.

      II. To assess the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of AZD1775 (adavosertib) in combination with
      upfront radiation/TMZ and adjuvant TMZ in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma.

      INTRATUMORAL CORRELATIVES/PHARMACOKINETICS OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the intratumoral concentration of AZD1775 (adavosertib) achieved in patients
      treated with the putative MTD.

      II. To characterize the time course of AZD1775 (adavosertib) in extracellular fluid within
      brain tumors following a single oral dose of drug by microdialysis.

      III. To characterize the pharmacodynamic effects of AZD1775 on tumor through
      immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis of pRb (S807/811), proliferation (e.g. Ki-67), pCDC2,
      Wee1, and apoptosis (e.g. cleaved caspase 3) on resected tumors exposed to drug.

      IV. To characterize MGMT methylation and P53 pathway status, also P-gp and wee1 expression
      levels in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma treated with standard therapy in
      combination with AZD1775 (adavosertib).

      V. To explore and analyze adaptive resistance mechanisms to AZD1775 using proteogenomics, and
      connect this data to spatially resolved drug distribution through targeted, imaging-based
      quantification of drug efficacy and tumor response.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of adavosertib. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2
      treatment arms.

      ARM I:

      INITIATION CYCLE: Patients receive adavosertib orally (PO) on days 1, 3, and 5 or days 1-5
      weekly and temozolomide PO once daily (QD) for 6 weeks. Patients also undergo concurrent
      radiation therapy 5 days per week for 6 weeks.

      MAINTENANCE CYCLES: Beginning in week 10, patients receive temozolomide PO QD on days 1-5.
      Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 cycles in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive adavosertib PO QD on days 1, 3, and 5 or 1-5 weekly, and
      temozolomide PO QD on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 cycles in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 2 months for 2 years, and
      then every 6 months thereafter.
