      significantly potentiated when the diet was enriched in calcium. This target may be reached
      either increasing the daily consumption of low-lipid milk and dairy products or increasing
      the daily consumption of calcium-rich vegetables.

      In the Italian population the mean daily consumption of calcium is rather low, not exceeding
      700 mg/daily whilst it would be desirable a daily consumption of 1200 mg/daily. Unfortunately
      there are in Italy very few dairy products (particularly low-lipid cheese) that would ensure
      a variable and palatable calcium-rich diet.

      Aims of the present study are:

        1. to prepare a low-sodium (about 3 g/daily) diet enrich in calcium (about 1200 mg/daily)
           and to compare the effects on blood pressure with those of a low-sodium diet similar to
           it in macronutrients but with a calcium content typical of the Mediterranean diet (no
           more than 700 mg/daily) (see Table 1);

        2. to verify if this diet is able to improve the control of body weight and of the main
           parameters of the glucose and lipid metabolisms;

        3. to evaluate if this diet is palatable enough to be prescribed in a long term study.

      Patients:

      At least 150 patients with arterial hypertension and/or overweight /obesity (IMC > 28 kg/m2)
      will be enrolled.

      Methods:

        1. evaluation of nutritional habits by an adequate frequency questionnaire at baseline,
           after a 3-month low-lipid low-sodium diet;

        2. anthropometric measures (body weight, height, waist circumference);

        3. measurements of blood pressure and heart rate;

        4. measurements of serum total and HDL cholesterol serum triglycerides, fasting blood
           glucose, serum sodium potassium calcium and phosphorus.

      Design of the study:

      This is a randomized parallel-group study performed in the Outpatient Clinic. Patients
      enrolled in the study will be prescribed a low-sodium low-lipid diet for 3 months. At the end
      of the first phase they will be randomly divided in two groups:

        1. Group A: patients will change their diet in a diet similar for total daily calories,
           sodium and macronutrients but enriched in calcium (1200 mg/daily) and will be followed
           up to 1 year with an intermediate control after the first 3 months;

        2. Group B: patients will continue the low-lipid, low-sodium diet up to 1 year with an
           intermediate control after the first 3 months.

      At baseline, after 3, 6 and 12 months of observation, patients will repeat the measurements
      1-4 described in the Methods.
