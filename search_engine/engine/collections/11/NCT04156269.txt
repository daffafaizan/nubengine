    
      BCMA-CS1 cCAR (Compound CAR BCMA-CS1) is a chimeric antigen receptor immunotherapy treatment
      designed to treat multiple myeloma using two different antigen targets, BCMA (CD269) and CS1
      (SLAMF7).

      The use of two different targets widely expressed on plasma cells, BCMA and CS1, intends to
      increase coverage and eradicate cancerous cells before resistance develops in surviving
      cancer cells that have undergone selective pressures or antigen escape. BCMA-CS1 cCAR bears
      two distinct functional CAR molecules expressed on a T-cell, directed against the surface
      proteins BCMA and CS1.
