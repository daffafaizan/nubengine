    
      A prospective randomized clinical study of all morbidly obese patients undergoing SG, RYGB
      and OAGB, as primary bariatric procedures, was performed. Patients were randomly assigned
      into 3 groups: those patients undergoing Sleeve Gastrectomy, those ones undergoing Roux-en-Y
      Gastric Bypass and those ones undergoing One-Anastomosis Gastric Bypass. Body Mass Index
      (BMI), excess BMI loss (EBMIL) and remission of type 2 diabetes (T2DM), hypertension (HT) and
      dyslipidemia (DL) were assessed.
