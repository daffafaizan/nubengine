      enterocolitis (NEC). A C-to-A nucleotide transversion (T1405N) in the gene that encodes
      carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase 1 (CPS1), the rate-limiting enzyme in the urea cycle, has been
      correlated with low plasma concentrations of L-arginine in neonates (> 35 weeks of
      gestation). Recently Moonen et al (Pediatr Res 2007; 62(2):188-90) described a correlation
      between this CPS1 T1405N single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and the presence of NEC in VLBW
      infants. However there is no data about the correlation between the plasma arginine
      concentrations and the T1405N SNP in the CPS-1 gene in VLBW infants. In the present project
      we postulate that T1405N SNP in the CPS-1 gene is associated with lower plasma arginine
      concentrations and is also a risk factor for the development of NEC.
