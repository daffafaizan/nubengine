    
      This prospective double blind randomized study will enroll 110 patients with recurrent
      Clostridium difficile infection (RCDI) in a 1:1 ratio to receive either LFMT or LSFF by
      capsules.

      Patients will receive 15 capsules at week 0 and be assessed at weeks 1, 4, 8 and 24. Blood,
      stool and urine samples will be collected. If the first treatment fails, patients will be
      given open label LFMT from the same donor. If treatment fails again, FMT will be offered in
      the form and route at the treating physician's discretion.
