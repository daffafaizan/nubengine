      malignancies. Although high dose methotrexate is generally well tolerated, unpredictable
      life-threatening toxicity can occur. For patients who have markedly delayed clearance of
      methotrexate secondary to renal dysfunction, therapeutic options are few and are of limited
      efficacy. Carboxypeptidase-G2 inactivates methotrexate by hydrolyzing its C-terminal
      glutamate residue. Carboxypeptidase-G2 could be used to rescue patients with renal
      dysfunction and delayed methotrexate excretion, as it provides an alternative to renal
      clearance as a route of elimination.
