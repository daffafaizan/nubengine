      perioperative hypertension, as assessed by comparing the incidences of death, stroke, MI and
      renal dysfunction in the clevidipine and sodium nitroprusside treatment groups from the
      initiation of study drug infusion through postoperative Day 30. Secondary objectives were to
      evaluate the efficacy of study drug, assessed by the blood pressure (BP) lowering effect and
      additional safety variables.
