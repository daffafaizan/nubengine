    
      A prospective randomized comparison of HD and 4K laparoscopic surgery for gastric cancer will
      be performed, to evaluate the clinical value and provide theoretical basis and clinical
      experience for the extensive application of the 4K laparoscopic technique. The evaluation
      parameters are perioperative clinical efficacy, postoperative life quality, immune function
      and 3-year survival and recurrence rates.
