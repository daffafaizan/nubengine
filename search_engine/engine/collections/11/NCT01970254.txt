      I. To derive a selective screening strategy that optimizes the identification of positive
      hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection cases in comparison to widespread screening of new cancer
      patients undergoing chemotherapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the prevalence of risk factors among patients with unknown HBV infection
      status as well as among patients known to have HBV infection, determine the incidence of
      reactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, rates of disruptions in cancer therapy,
      co-infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and
      mortality rates.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients with unknown HBV infection status undergo 3 HBV screening tests (hepatitis B surface
      antigen [HBsAg], hepatitis B core antibody [anti-HBc], and hepatitis B surface antibody
      [anti-HBs]) before chemotherapy. Patients with known HBV infection status undergo either
      HBsAg or anti-HBc screening tests if there is no evidence of HBV testing in the last 3
      months. All patients complete HBV risk assessment survey.

      After completion of study, patients with HBV infection are followed up every 3 months for at
      least 12 months after completion of chemotherapy or end of study period.
