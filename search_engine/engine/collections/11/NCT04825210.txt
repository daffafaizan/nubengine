      behavioral health needs of children in the pediatric setting, yet there is little evidence
      for a standardized model of care for providing universal preventive services in pediatric
      primary care. Current models are typically loosely constructed, inconsistently applied, and
      unspecified. Our aim is to evaluate a model of care developed to address these gaps.
      Integrated Behavioral Health-Prevention (IBH-P) is a collection of clinical strategies and
      structured approaches designed to promote emotional and behavioral health. IBH-P is delivered
      by psychologists in the pediatric setting as part of scheduled well-child visits. The overall
      objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the intervention in promoting infant
      self-regulation. Maternal experience and satisfaction, adherence to well-child visits and
      immunizations will also be examined.
