      I. To determine the feasibility of the proposed anti-burnout intervention for faculty at MD
      Anderson, defined as at least 35/50 of participants each attending at least 9 out of 13
      sessions.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore any changes in burnout, measured by the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) and
      Mini-Z surveys.

      II. To explore any changes in the self-reported health status of participants, as measured by
      the RAND Short-Form 36 (SF36) survey.

      III. To understand participants' perception of the benefits and usefulness of the
      intervention, measured by the customized Globalized Perception/Impression of Benefits Survey.

      IV. To define methods for improving the intervention, based on participants' feedback
      following each session.
