      intervention, which is based on the Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills model of health
      behavior change (IMB; Fisher & Fisher, 1992), and, thus, is designed to enhance knowledge,
      motivation, and behavior skills for reducing drug- and sex-related HIV risk behaviors.
      Outcomes assessed will include urine toxicology screens, self-reported HIV drug- and
      sex-related HIV risk behavior, HIV/AIDS knowledge, risk reduction motivation, and risk
      reduction behavioral skills.

      To measure the effects of CHRP, the investigators are proposing a two-condition (standard of
      care plus the CHRP intervention vs. standard of care plus a time-and-attention matched
      control condition) randomized design, balancing for participant gender. The investigators
      will assess participants at baseline, immediately post-intervention (i.e., at 4 weeks), and
      at 3-, 6-, and 12-month measurement points following the intervention. This assessment
      approach will allow the investigators to examine the trajectory of HIV risk reduction change
      including the decay or emergence of intervention effects.
