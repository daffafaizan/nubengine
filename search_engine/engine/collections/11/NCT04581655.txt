      Italian PICUs 2) risk factors of PICU admission, neurological outcome and mortality.
      Inclusion criteria: age <= 18 years, informed consent. Exclusion criteria: informed consent
      not obtained. After a retrospective analysis (2019-2020), investigators will perform a
      prospective study lasted 12 months (January 2021 - December 2021) gathering data from 15
      Italian PICUs. Each Center can decide whether to participate only in the prospective phase.
      Data will be recorded in an electronic data collection form in Red Cap.

      The following variables will be collected:

        -  Demographic variables: age, sex, ethnicity;

        -  TIP pre-admission clinical variables and at the time of admission: basic diagnosis,
           comorbidity, Hemopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (TCSE) number and type, treatment
           phase, HLA matching, Graft Versus Host (GVH) and grade, veno-occlusive disease, Venous
           Occlusive Disease

        -  Variables upon entering TIP: PIM3, POPC score, organ failure cause and staging, high
           intensity treatments, high flow oxygen therapy, dialysis, inotropes or other, fluid
           overload, immunodeficiency

        -  Clinical variables during hospitalization: organ failure cause and staging, ventilation,
           modality, presence of pARDS and severity, need for inotropic support, sepsis and
           severity score (SOFA), inotropes (VIS score), arrest event cardiac, need for HFOV,
           Extra-Corporeal Membrane Oxygenator, Nitric Oxide, dialysis, Intracranial Pressure
           monitoring, drugs used for sedation, development of withdrawal syndrome, development of
           delirium.

      Considering the participation of 15 Centers involving 20 patients in a year, the expected
      number is 600 patients considering the retrospective phase (optional, therefore some Centers
      may not contribute) and the prospective phase.
