      I. To develop the instrumentation to achieve real time processing and display of
      intraoperative 2-dimensional optical imaging and spectroscopy (i2DOS) maps in the operating
      arena.

      II. To examine the timing and spatial involvement of human cortex intraoperatively to
      different stimuli using i2DOS.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo i2DOS.
