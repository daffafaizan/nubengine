      currently used for several clinical applications will be evaluated for feasibility of
      studying chronic liver disease (this application has not yet been validated).

      Tomographic imaging has assumed a fundamental role in patients with Chronic Liver Disease
      (CLD) to screen patients for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and, is increasingly being
      explored as a noninvasive alternative for characterizing liver fibrosis. The overarching goal
      of this study is to improve noninvasive characterization of liver fibrosis through spectral
      CT.

      Hypothesis: concentration of iodine-based contrast agent in the liver parenchyma during the
      delayed phase, as measured with spectral CT imaging, increases monotonically with Ishak
      fibrosis score obtained from liver biopsy. This hypothesis is supported by the literature and
      our preliminary data, described in the references section (Lamb et al. 2015).

      We will evaluate multiphase spectral CT images consisting of the arterial phase, 2-minute
      delayed phase, and 5-minute delayed phase. Fibrosis will be assessed on both delayed phase
      images, where it is assumed that any remaining contrast agent, in the liver, is due to the
      presence of fibrosis. This type of multiphase protocol can still be used to image CLD
      patients with spectral CT for HCC detection and, thus, will not interfere with liver lesion
      workup and evaluation.
