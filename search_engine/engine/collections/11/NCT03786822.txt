      located in the pulmonary veins (PV). In order to isolate these triggers, radiofrequency
      energy or freezing is used to destroy the atrial tissue which propagate electrical impulses
      into and out of the pulmonary veins (PV), to achieve pulmonary vein isolation (PVI). Use of a
      patented cryoballoon catheter (Medtronic) to perform PVI has been shown to be safe and
      efficacious under fluoroscopic guidance with contrast angiography. The objective of this
      study is to identify methods to reduce radiation dose and radio opaque contrast use while
      maintaining PVI efficacy and safety.
