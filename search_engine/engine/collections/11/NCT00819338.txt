      population. The first step of NAFLD involves the accumulation of fat within the liver
      (steatosis). Steatosis occurs either due to defective generation, metabolism or excretion of
      fatty acids by the liver. The next step in NAFLD progression is inflammation, which commonly
      occurs due to pro-inflammatory stimuli. Persistent inflammation results in end-stage liver
      disease. NAFLD is associated with the metabolic syndrome, which is characterised by central
      obesity, insulin resistance, raised triglycerides and hypertension. With the current obesity
      epidemic, there is predicted to be greater numbers of patients with NAFLD in the future.

      Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are essential components of our diet, though standard
      Western intakes are lower than the recommended amounts. Supplementing the long chain n-3
      PUFAs (commonly termed omega-3), EPA and DHA, improves many of the metabolic syndrome
      features. They lower plasma triglycerides, and may improve insulin resistance.

      The diet of NAFLD patients tends to be deficient in n-3 PUFAs and have an excessive intake of
      the harmful n-6 PUFAs. This pattern is mirrored in their liver lipid content as assessed at
      biopsy.

      Currently there is no proven treatment for NAFLD. Animal studies and limited studies in
      patients have been supportive of a benefit with n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. This needs
      to be further assessed.
