      escalation part of the study is now closed and the highest tolerable dose of nab-paclitaxel
      (Abraxane) was assessed to be 100 mg/m2 in combination with doxorubicin (Adriamycin) and
      cyclophosphamide in patients with stages II-III breast cancer in the neoadjuvant setting. The
      initial phase I study objective was to primarily assess the safety of the drug combination,
      and to secondarily obtain preliminary data on the clinical efficacy of the combination. 25
      patients were enrolled. The expansion cohort will enroll 15 additional patients.

      The purpose of the expansion cohort is to assess pathological complete response.
