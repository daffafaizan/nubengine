      non-randomized (patients were assigned to treatment), multi-center pilot study with the
      objective to investigate the effectiveness of PROCRIT (Epoetin alfa) on hematopoietic
      response (effect on red blood cells) when administered at 60,000 Units subcutaneously (under
      the skin) every two weeks in anemic patients with cancer who were not receiving chemotherapy
      or radiation therapy.

      Treatment with study drug was for a maximum of 12 weeks followed by a 4-week observation
      period after the last dose of the study drug had been administered.

      Safety and efficacy evaluations were performed at specified intervals throughout the study
      and included assessment of laboratory tests (Complete Blood Count [CBC], Serum Chemistry
      [including hemoglobin level]), vital signs (such as blood pressure), physical examinations
      and the occurrence and severity of adverse events. All patients enrolled in this study
      received pharmacologic ferrous sulfate 325 mg by mouth once a day or an equivalent
      formulation, as tolerated, unless it was determined by the physician that the patient should
      not receive it. All patient's received injections of PROCRIT (Epoetin alfa) 60,000 Units
      under the skin once every two weeks. If after 4 weeks of treatment, the patient's hemoglobin
      level did not increase by >= 1 g/dL, the Epoetin alfa dose was increased to 80,000 Units
      every 2 weeks. Study drug was administered for a maximum of 12 weeks followed by a 4-week
      observation period after the last dose of study drug. Epoetin alfa doses were reduced or held
      as needed depending on the patients' hemoglobin level.
