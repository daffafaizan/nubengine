      of elopement. For parents of a child with ASD, having their child go missing is potentially
      dangerous and far more likely compared to typically developing children. This behavior
      interferes with household routines, engenders vigilance, and restricts the family's
      participation in their community. Such restrictions contribute to the family's isolation and
      hinders development of community supports. Elopement can result in injuries and deaths of
      children with ASD.
