      obesity and associated metabolic syndrome globally, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease has
      become a high incidence of liver disease in developed countries, the prevalence rate of NAFLD
      adult is about 10% ~ 30%. Therefore, effective prevention and treatment of NAFLD has
      important significance in improving people's quality of life and disease prognosis. The
      latest study found that intestinal microflora imbalance is closely correlated with NAFLD.
      When the structure of intestinal flora is destroyed, host energy absorption and storage of
      fat balance will be broken, with higher absorption of efficiency. At the same time, metabolic
      disorder expands. In this projects the investigators aim to re-establish a gut balance of
      intestinal microbiota through Standardized Intestinal Microbiota Transplantation for NAFLD.
      The CT ratio of liver/spleen, Fibroscan E value, general indicators, biochemical indicators
      will be used to assess the efficiency, durability and safety of Standardized IMT at the start
      and end of the projects.
