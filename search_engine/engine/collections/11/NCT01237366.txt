      exercises where they will be asked to write about difficult life experiences. Following
      expressive writing, participants will receive stress management skills training to assist
      them with managing any acute increases in distress that arise from the writing experience.
      Participants in the attention-control condition will write about neutral topics and complete
      psychological measures. The overarching goals of this Phase Ib RCT will be to: 1) examine the
      feasibility and acceptability of the intervention and attention-control; and 2) determine
      whether intervention participants report reductions in traumatic stress symptoms over the 3
      months following randomization. Findings from this Phase Ib trial will inform our efforts to
      implement a more definitive RCT of this intervention with HIV-positive, methamphetamine-using
      MSM.
