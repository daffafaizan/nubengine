      52 week effectiveness study of 120 bipolar subjects in current treatment at three
      socioeconomically diverse academic health science centers. Concurrent with this clinical
      effectiveness study, the research team, funded by the same NIH grant,will refine prototype
      software and integrate data security and establish quality standards into the KIOS-Bipolar
      system.

      The clinical trial will:

      Assess sensitivity of K-B assessed improvement or worsening by comparison with assessment by
      BISS-Self and BISS-42.
