    
      This is a randomized, double-arm, double-masked study designed to evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of eculizumab for the treatment of patients with dry AMD. There are three stages in
      the study: the screening period, the treatment period, and the follow-up period.During the
      screening period patients will be evaluated for eligibility. Eligible patients will receive
      either eculizumab or placebo for 24 weeks.

      A total of 60 patients will be enrolled and divided equally between the drusen cohort and the
      GA cohort. A 2:1 randomization will result in 20 patients in each cohort receiving eculizumab
      while 10 patients receive placebo.

      The treatment period will begin two weeks after administration of the meningococcal vaccine.
      During the treatment period, patients will receive eculizumab or placebo over a period of
      approximately 26 weeks. Patient will treatment according to the following regimen:

      Induction Period: patient will receive eculizumab 600 mg or 900 mg via IV infusion over
      approximately 30 minutes once a week (7 ± 2 days) for 4 weeks followed by 900 mg eculizumab
      for the fifth dose 7 days later (7 ± 2 days).

      Maintenance Period: patient will receive eculizumab 900 mg or 1200 mg via IV infusion over
      approximately 30 minutes every 2 weeks (14 ± 2 days).

      After the final scheduled dose of eculizumab or Placebo at week 24, patients will return for
      follow-up exam 2 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months after the final dose.
