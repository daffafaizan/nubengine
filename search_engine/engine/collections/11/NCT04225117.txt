    
      This study will consist of 3 periods: screening/baseline, treatment and follow-up.

      Screening/baseline period will take place up to 28 days prior to the first dose of study
      treatment.

      In the treatment period, starting at cycle 1, participants will receive enfortumab vedotin on
      days 1, 8, and 15 every 28-day cycle until one of the treatment discontinuation criteria are
      met. Disease assessment will be performed at screening/baseline and repeated every 8 weeks
      (56 days ± 7 days) from the first dose of study treatment throughout the study until the
      participant has radiologically confirmed disease progression, initiates a new subsequent
      anticancer therapy, dies, withdraws consent, is lost to follow-up or the study closes,
      whichever occurs first.

      Participants who discontinue study treatment for reasons other than radiologically-confirmed
      disease progression by RECIST Version 1.1 will enter into a post treatment follow-up period
      and continue to receive imaging scans every 8 weeks (56 days ± 7 days) until the subject has
      radiologically confirmed disease progression, initiates a new anticancer therapy, dies,
      withdraws consent, is lost to follow-up or the study closes, whichever occurs first.

      After 1 year on study treatment, the frequency of disease assessment will be reduced to every
      12 weeks (84 days ± 7 days).

      After radiologically-confirmed disease progression or initiation of subsequent anticancer
      therapy, whichever occurs first, participants will be contacted every 12 weeks in the
      long-term follow-up period for survival status until death, withdrawal of consent, lost to
      follow-up or study closure, whichever occurs first.
