      colonoscopy. Analgesia and sedation has adverse effects such as central respiratory
      depression, obstruction of the upper airways, hypoxia, hypotension and bradycardia.
      Non-pharmacological interventions had beneficial effects during percutaneous vascular or
      renal procedures. In this study we test the hypothesis that the adjunction of hypnosis to
      pharmacological sedation will decrease the quantity of sedative drugs used and will reduce
      the patient's anxiety and discomfort.
