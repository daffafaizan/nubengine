      anatomic modified Brostrum repair allows for earlier return to pre-injury level compared to a
      standard Brostrum procedure. It is also secondarily hypothesized that intermediate and long
      term incidence of recurrent instability will be lower with use of internal brace augmentation
      of standard modified Brostrum lateral ankle ligament reconstruction.
