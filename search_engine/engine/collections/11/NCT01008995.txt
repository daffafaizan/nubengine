    
      In this study, 220 patients will be divided into two groups randomly (by chance), like
      flipping a coin. Each group will receive a different treatment. The results for each group
      are compared to each other. There are 2 treatment groups in this study, Group 1 and Group 2.
      Group 1 will receive placebo at Weeks 0 and 4, ustekinumab 45 mg at Weeks 12 and 16. Group 2
      will receive ustekinumab 45 mg at Weeks 0, 4, and 16 and placebo at Week 12. All patients in
      the study will eventually receive ustekinumab after Week 12. The patients will be in the
      study for about 36 weeks, with study visit approximately 10 times. Effectiveness evaluations
      will be conducted throughout the study and include the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index
      (PASI), Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) and Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI). Safety
      assessments will also be performed throughout the study and include obtaining and evaluating
      laboratory tests, vital signs (e.g., blood pressure) and the occurrence and severity of
      adverse events. GROUP 1: Placebo at Weeks 0 and 4, ustekinumab 45 mg at Weeks 12 and 16.
      GROUP 2: Ustekinumab 45 mg at Weeks 0, 4, and 16. Placebo at Week 12
