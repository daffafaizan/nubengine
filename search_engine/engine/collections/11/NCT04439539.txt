      human liver. The acute phase of infection is either followed by an immune controlled state or
      progresses to chronic hepatitis B. The worldwide estimated prevalence of chronic HBV
      infection is about 292 million people affected. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)
      seroclearance is currently considered to be associated with the most thorough suppression of
      HBV replication (termed functional cure). With current available NA treatment strategies,
      rate of HBsAg seroclearance remains very low (around 3 percent [%]) even under long-term
      treatment. Also, with the persistently high global prevalence of HBV-associated mortality,
      there is a medical need for more effective finite treatment options that lead to sustained
      HBsAg seroclearance. JNJ-73763989 is a liver-targeted antiviral therapeutic for subcutaneous
      injection designed to treat chronic HBV infection via a ribonucleic acid interference (RNAi)
      mechanism. JNJ-56136379 is an orally administered capsid assembly modulator (CAM) that is
      being developed for the treatment of chronic HBV infection. The aim of the study is to
      evaluate the efficacy of a treatment regimen of JNJ-73763989 + JNJ-56136379 + NA with or
      without PegIFN-α2a in participants with hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) positive chronic
      infection. The study will be conducted in 4 phases: a screening phase, an induction phase
      with flexible duration, a consolidation phase with or without PegIFN-α2a and a follow-up
      phase. Safety assessments will include Adverse Events (AEs), serious AEs of the study
      interventions, clinical laboratory tests, Electrocardiograms (ECGs), vital signs, and
      physical examinations.
