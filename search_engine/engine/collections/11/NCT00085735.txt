      I. Compare event-free survival (EFS) of pediatric patients (3 to 7 years of age) with newly
      diagnosed standard-risk medulloblastoma treated with standard-dose versus (vs.) reduced-dose
      craniospinal radiotherapy (SDCSI vs. LDCSI).

      II. Compare EFS of patients (3-21 years of age) treated with standard-dose craniospinal
      radiotherapy and posterior fossa boost vs tumor bed boost radiotherapy in combination with
      this chemotherapy regimen.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Compare overall survival (OS) of pediatric patients (3-7 years of age) with newly
      diagnosed standard-risk medulloblastoma treated with SDCSI vs. LDCSI.

      II. Compare OS of patients (3-21 years of age) with newly diagnosed standard-risk
      medulloblastoma treated with PFRT vs. IFRT.

      III. To evaluate patterns of failure in patients treated with an irradiation boost volume
      smaller than conventional posterior fossa volumes.

      IV. To reduce the cognitive, auditory, and endocrinologic effects of treatment of
      average-risk medulloblastoma by reducing the dose of craniospinal irradiation therapy.

      V. To determine if the audiologic and endocrinologic toxicity will be reduced with the use of
      limited tumor boost volume irradiation compared to patients treated with conventional target
      volumes of radiation.

      VI. Develop an optimal gene expression medulloblastoma outcome predictor, validated
      prospectively in a multi-institution randomized clinical trial.

      VII. To improve compliance with long-term quality of life (QoL) and functional status data
      submission by educating institutional nurses to administer and submit for analysis a battery
      of four instruments (Behavior Assessment System for Children- 2nd Edition (BASC-2), Adaptive
      Behavior Assessment System - 2nd Edition (ABAS-II), Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive
      Function (BRIEF) and PedsQLTM 4.0).

      OUTLINE: Patients 3-7 years of age are randomized to 1 of 4 arms (Arm I-IV). Patients 8-21
      years of age are randomized to 1 of 2 arms (Arm V or VI).

      Within 31 days after definitive surgery, all patients begin therapy. Patients undergo
      radiation therapy with doses according to their Arm randomization on days 1-5, 8-12, 15-19,
      22-26, 29-33, 36-40, and 43-47 (weeks 0-6). All patients receive vincristine intravenously
      (IV) over 1 minute (or infusion via minibag as per institutional policy) on days 8, 15, 22,
      29, 36, and 43 (weeks 1-6).

      ARM I: Patients 3-7 years of age undergo lowered dose craniospinal irradiation (LDCSI) with
      involved-field radiation therapy (IFRT) boost.

      ARM II: Patients 3-7 years of age undergo LDCSI with whole posterior fossa radiation therapy
      (PFRT) boost.

      ARM III: Patients 3-7 years of age undergo standard dose craniospinal irradiation (SDCSI)
      with IFRT boost.

      ARM IV: Patients 3-7 years of age undergo SDCSI with PFRT boost.

      ARM V: Patients 8-21 years of age undergo SDCSI with IFRT boost.

      ARM VI: Patients 8-21 years of age undergo SDCSI with PFRT boost.

      MAINTENANCE CHEMOTHERAPY: Beginning 4 weeks after completion of chemoradiotherapy, patients
      receive 2 different regimens of maintenance chemotherapy for a total of 9 courses. Each
      course in regimen A is 6 weeks (42 days) in duration. Each course in regimen B is 4 weeks (28
      days) in duration.

      REGIMEN A (courses 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8): Patients receive lomustine orally and cisplatin IV
      over 6 hours on day 1 and vincristine IV on days 1, 8, and 15 of weeks 11, 17, 27, 33, 43,
      and 49.

      REGIMEN B (courses 3, 6, and 9): Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on days 1
      and 2 and vincristine IV on days 1 and 8 of weeks 23, 39, and 55.

      Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Quality
      of life is assessed at 3-6 months after completion of radiotherapy and at 3-4 years after
      study entry. Neurocognitive function may also be assessed.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 2 years, and then
      annually thereafter.
