      particular estrogens, have been shown to affect pain processing and pain sensitivity, and
      estrogen deficit has been considered a potential promoting factor for fibromyalgia. However,
      the effects of estrogen treatment in patients suffering from fibromyalgia have not been
      studied. Twenty-nine postmenopausal women were randomized to either eight weeks of treatment
      with transdermal 17Î²-estradiol (50 ug daily) or placebo according to a double-blind protocol.
      A self-estimation of pain, a set of quantitative sensory tests measuring thresholds to
      temperature, thermal pain, cold pain and pressure pain, and a cold pressor test were
      performed at three occasions: before treatment, after eight weeks of treatment, and twenty
      weeks after cessation of treatment.
