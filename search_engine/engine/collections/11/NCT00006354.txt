        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose and dose-limiting toxicity of mistletoe lectin
           (recombinant viscumin) in patients with advanced solid tumors who have failed standard
           therapy.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine whether induction of antibodies against recombinant viscumin occurs in these
           patients.

        -  Determine whether immunological stimulation at the RNA level of immune cells occurs in
           patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine whether modification of endothelial parameters occurs in patients treated with
           this regimen.

        -  Determine the objective response rates in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive mistletoe lectin (recombinant viscumin) IV over 1 hour twice weekly. Courses
      repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 1-3 patients receive escalating doses of recombinant viscumin until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which 20% of patients
      experience dose-limiting toxicity during the first course. Additional patients are treated at
      the MTD.

      Patients are followed every 3 months until disease progression or initiation of another
      therapy.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A minimum of 37 patients will be accrued for this study.
