      remains the most prescribed treatment for treating and preventing long-term thromboembolic
      events. They remain the most important drugs of iatrogenic accidents despite the means
      deployed by the health authorities. The balance of the patients under VKA can be appreciated
      thanks to the time spent in the therapeutic zone or TTR which is correlated with the risk of
      occurrence of haemorrhagic or thrombotic events.

      The management of VKA in France seems hardly comparable to that of the neighboring countries
      in front of:

        -  A TTR estimated at 60%.

        -  Majority management of anticoagulant treatments by general practitioners.

        -  The weak development of clinics anticoagulants.

        -  The takeoff of direct oral anticoagulant prescriptions.

        -  Preponderance of fluindione prescriptions among the various oral anticoagulants.

      It therefore seems interesting to study a cohort of French patients under VKA. Through the
      calculation of the TTR, the investigators will be able to draw a picture of the balance of
      the anticoagulant treatment and try to identify factors that can influence it.
