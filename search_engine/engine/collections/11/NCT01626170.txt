      Samples with DNA Biospecimen Description: Tissue Study Population Description: Primary care
      clinic Sampling Method: Non-probability sample

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the molecular response/resistance signatures with radiotherapy and standard
      chemoradiation treatments using the xenograft model of the Pediatric Preclinical Testing
      Program (PPTP).

      II. Validate these novel pathways/biomarkers by their detection within clinically annotated
      patient tumor tissue samples and testing their associations with clinical response, local
      control rates, and overall survival rates.

      OUTLINE: Archived tissue samples of matched primary-relapsed and non-matched primary are
      analyzed for genomic DNA, DNA methylation profiles, RNA sequencing, differences between
      alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (ARMS) and embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (ERMS), gene expression
      profiles, target-of-rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1) and TORC2 pathway intermediates, and paired
      box 3 (PAX3)/forkhead box O1 (FOXO1) translocation by microarray, immunohistochemical
      staining, and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH).
