    
      The ARCHYTAS Registry is a long-term, global, multicenter, non-randomized, prospective,
      registry established by Lombard Medical Ltd. (Lombard) to collect "on-label" data in real
      world clinical settings on patients undergoing endovascular repair with the latest generation
      Aorfix™ AAA Flexible Stent Graft System, for treatment of abdominal aortic and aorto-iliac
      aneurysms in anatomy where the aorta in the aneurysm neck is bent through an angle between 0°
      and 90°. This indication for Aorfix™ is approved in all territories where this Registry is
      being operated and this Registry does not seek to collect data on any use of the implant for
      which full commercial approval does not already exist.

      The ARCHYTAS Registry data will augment existing data from ongoing and prospective clinical
      trials with Aorfix™ for the purposes of publication, general product development and quality
      measures.
