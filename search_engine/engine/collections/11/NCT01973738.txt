      osteoporosis. There are two SERM approved in Japan for the treatment of postmenopausal
      osteoporosis in women at increased risk of fracture. One is raloxifene (RLX), and the other
      is bazedoxifene (BZA). There are few reports concerning to the clinical efficacy and safety
      data. In this study, we plan to compare clinical efficacy and safety between RLX and BZA.

      The main objective of this study is to reveal the effects of RLX and BZA on bone mineral
      density, bone turnover markers, and bone quality markers.
