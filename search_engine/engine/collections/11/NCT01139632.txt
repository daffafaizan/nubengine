    
      Background: The most common cause of death in patients with NAFLD(Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver
      Disease) is CAD(Coronary Artery Disease). NAFLD patients have 65% more mortality than general
      population. The aim of our study is to diagnose early coronary artery disease in NAFLD
      patient by measuring of PLA2.

      Methods: 60 patients with chest pain and low to intermediate risk for coronary events will
      undergo Cardiac CT and blood test measurement of enzyme PLA2, markers of inflammation: CRP,
      MDA(Malondialdehide), Paraoxonase, FFA(Free Fatty Acids), TG(Triglycerids) will performed.

      CAD is defined as a stenosis of more than 50% in at least one major coronary artery, unstable
      plaque defined as low attenuated plaque <30HU and fatty liver defined as difference in liver
      and spleen attenuation value -10HU by using CT.

      Expected results : we expect that PLA2 will higher in patients with patients with combination
      of CAD, unstable plaque and NAFLD.
