      in reducing pain associated with IM injection. Studies have shown that these applications are
      mostly used in children during vaccination or intravenous interventions. These methods are
      less commonly used on adults. Both methods without side effects are important in terms of
      being cheap, easy to use and reusable. As a result of the researches, these methods can
      provide a more comfortable injection experience and provide evidence for pain management,
      especially in adults sensitive to pain.

      The aim of the study is to use it to reduce pain associated with IM injection in adults.

      To evaluate the effect of cold spray and ShotBlocker applications on pain. In this study, it
      was used to reduce pain associated with IM injection in adults.

      It was aimed to evaluate the effect of ShotBlocker and cold spray application on pain. The
      research is planned to be completed between February 2020 and December 2020. The universe of
      the study, which was conducted as a randomized controlled trial model, consisted of all adult
      patients who received diclofenac sodium treatment in Malatya Turgut Ã–zal Medical Center
      Emergency Service. 195 patients selected by the simple random sampling method (shotBlocker
      group = 39, shotBlocker placebo = 39 spray groups = 39, spray group placebo = 39, control
      group = 39) were included in the study. Participant Introduction Form and Visual Benchmarking
      Scale (VAS) were used to collect data. According to the characteristics of the data In
      independent groups, t test, ANOVA test, Mann Whitney U test, correlation were measured.
