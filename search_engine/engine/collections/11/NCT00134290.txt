      hypo-energetic "standard diet advice" and a modest hypo-energetic "personal diet advice"
      which was determined by the energy needs of a person as calculated with a combination of
      basal metabolic rate (BMR) and physical activity level (PAL) on weight loss and insulin
      sensitivity.

      Secondly, this study wanted to determine what the influence is of insulin-insensitivity on
      obesity and weight reduction by treating the patients with metformin or placebo. The subjects
      were therefore randomised into two double blinded groups receiving either metformin (2 x 850
      mg per day) or placebo in combination with a moderate energy restriction and a exercise
      regimen of 30 minutes per day for 1 year.

      Treatment effects of both diets and the effect of metformin on weight reduction and insulin
      sensitivity were determined after a treatment period of 20 and 52 weeks.

      Insulin sensitivity was quantified using the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) and the
      OGTT. Body composition was determined with the bioelectrical impedance method.

      Blood was also drawn for hormonal and biochemical analyses after 20 and 52 weeks of
      treatment. Furthermore, the patients had to fill out a 3-day food diary at baseline, after 20
      weeks and after 52 weeks.
