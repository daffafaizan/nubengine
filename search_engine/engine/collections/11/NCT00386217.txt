    
      Women from the M. D. Anderson tumor registry who were diagnosed from 1992 to 1997 with
      invasive cervical cancer, breast cancer, Hodgkin's disease, or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma will be
      asked to participate. Researchers have chosen these types of cancers because they are the
      most common cancers in women of reproductive age. In addition, many of the standard
      treatments for these diseases have the potential to cause infertility.

      If you agree to participate, you will be asked to complete a survey over the phone. Topics
      that will be addressed by the survey include demographic information (such as age, sex,
      etc.), medical information, health-related quality of life, emotional distress, and stress
      related to interrupted childbearing. Some other topics include anxiety related to the impact
      of cancer on childbearing, menopausal symptoms, spiritual well-being, relationship happiness,
      sexual satisfaction, and attitudes about parenthood after cancer. The phone survey should
      take around 90 minutes to complete.

      If you feel distressed at any time during or after your participation in this study, you will
      be given a referral for professional counseling.

      THIS IS AN INVESTIGATIONAL STUDY.

      Up to 2091 women will be invited to participate in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D.
      Anderson.
