      localize the origin of patients diagnosed with fever of unknown origin (FUO) using a PET/MRI
      scanner. We hope to learn if this can detect FUO better than with the present nuclear imaging
      standard of care (67Ga SPECT).

      We propose the following aim:

      â€¢ To evaluate 68Ga Citrate PET/MRI for detection of origin of fever in patients with fever of
      unknown origin.

      Patients disgnosed with fever of unknown origin are injected intravenously (IV) with 370 MBq
      of 68Ga Citrate. 45-60 minutes later, a whole body PET/MRI images are obtained.
