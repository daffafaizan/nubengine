    
      1. Detect and evaluate the CTC status (a total of 3 times: 1 day before sugery, 3/12 months
           after surgery) for all of the PCa patients enrolled. Analyze the CTC result with PSA
           level, needle biopsy and radiological imaging information.

        2. Analyze the difference in CTC amount/Epithelial-Mesenchymal ratio between patients in
           different D'Amico risk level(low/intermediate/high).

        3. Establish a mathematic model based on the CTC results and pathological condition
           observed in operation (OC, organ confined; EPE, extraprostatic extension; SVI, seminal
           vesicle invasion; LNI, lymph node invasion), and compare this model with the latest
           version of Partin table.

        4. Detect and compare the CTC and PSA level 3/12 months after surgery. Evaluate the
           radiological condition in 12 months after blood draw.
