      centers, with an early onset age (less than 40 when diagnosed). A complete clinical history
      (information on history of hypertension, demographic characteristics, personal and family
      medical history) are collected by a trained staff using a standardized questionnaire on the
      first day of baseline observation, and physical examination are also collected in a standard
      procedure. Blood samples are collected after 12-hour overnight fast and biological variables
      are determined. Genomic DNA is isolated from leukocytes according to a standard procedure.
      The individuals will receive follow-up in an ordinal system. The investigators will focus on
      the clinical and genetic features, genotype-phenotype correlations and influencing factors of
      prognosis in Chinese early-onset hypertension patients.
