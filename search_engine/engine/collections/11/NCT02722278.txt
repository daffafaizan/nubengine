    
      This is a multicenter, Phase 3, randomized, open-label, active-comparator group, efficacy
      (based on Cavg of T), and safety study in adult hypogonadal male subjects. Enrollment is
      based on criteria designed to select the general population of hypogonadal men. Study drug
      doses will be titrated using a dose-titration algorithm based on total T Cavg. Subjects may
      be androgen treatment-na√Øve or washed out of prior androgen replacement therapies.

      Subjects must have 2 total T levels < 300 ng/dL based on 2 blood samples obtained in the
      morning (AM) on 2 separate days approximately 7 days apart.

      Approximately 180 subjects will be randomly assigned to receive open-label treatment in a 3:1
      ratio of oral TU to Axiron (ie, approximately 135 subjects will be randomly assigned to oral
      TU and approximately 45 subjects will be randomly assigned to Axiron topical solution).
      Subjects who complete the study will receive approximately 105 days of treatment. Dose
      titrations will be based on the T Cavg from serial PK sampling obtained on day 21 and 56 of
      treatment. Primary efficacy will be based on percentage of subjects within eugonadal range at
      Visit 7.

      A subset of approximately 30 subjects will participate in a cosyntropin stimulation test on
      Day 1 (before administration of study drug) and Day 106 after the last 24-hour PK sample has
      been drawn.
