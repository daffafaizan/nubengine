      activity and movement resulting from a feeling of susceptibility to painful injury or
      re-injury. Kinesiophobia was demonstrated to be related to lower levels of physical activity
      in people with chronic pain. As a result, there is an increased risk of sedentary lifestyle.
      Inactivity increases the risk of chronic pain as well as other health problems such as
      cardiovascular diseases. Kinesiophobia also is related to poor treatment outcomes. The
      negative effects of kinesiophobia on rehabilitation processes including exercise programs and
      thus its importance in the clinical course were illustrated in studies on various diseases.

      There are limited studies examining kinesiophobia and factors associated with kinesophobia in
      patients with lower limb amputation. The aim of this study is to illustrate the level of
      kinesiophobia in patients with traumatic lower extremity amputation and to analyze the
      correlation between kinesiophobia and associated factors (pain, prosthesis satisfaction, fear
      of fall, quality of life).

      his cross-sectional study will involve 52 patients with traumatic lower extremity amputation.
      Kinesiophobia level will be measured with the Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia (TSK). All
      patients will point the severity of sound limb pain, residual limb pain, low back pain and
      the overall prosthesis, socket system and prosthetic foot satisfaction on a Visual Analogue
      Scale (VAS). Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I) will be used for evaluation of falls
      efficacy under different circumstances. The quality of life (QoL) will be assessed with
      Nottingham Health Profile (NHP).
