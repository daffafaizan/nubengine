      women with breast cancer treated with cyclophosphamide, thiotepa, and carboplatin followed by
      autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. II. Determine the safety and efficacy of
      this combination chemotherapy regimen in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: Peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) are collected. Patients sequentially receive
      cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour, thiotepa IV over 1 hour, and carboplatin IV over 1 hour on
      days -6 to -4. PBSC are reinfused on day 0. Patients are followed at 3 months, 6 months, 1
      year, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: At least 40 patients with 4-9 positive lymph nodes and at least 50
      patients with 10 positive lymph nodes will be accrued for this study.
