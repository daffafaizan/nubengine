      in the vaginal environment in addition to affecting the thickness of the vaginal epithelium.
      The purpose of the proposed study is to take the first steps in testing the effects of local
      estrogen treatment on vaginal health parameters in humans. We have chosen an estriol product
      because, in comparison with estrone (E1) and estradiol (E2), estriol (E3) is generally
      considered to be a weak estrogen. The duration of estriol's interaction with the estrogen
      receptor is quick and exhibits rapid metabolic clearance. We have chosen a topical route of
      administration because it appears to result in fewer systemic effects than oral
      administration, while allowing us to concentrate treatment locally in the areas we wish to
      affect.

      Our primary goal is to test whether or not topically applied estrogen results in significant
      thickening and maturation of the vaginal epithelium. Our secondary goal is to measure the
      treatment's effects on other parameters of the vagina, such as Lactobacillus colonization and
      vaginal pH. If estrogen cream does indeed affect the vaginal environment in pre-menopausal
      women as it does in post-menopausal women, further study would be indicated to determine
      whether estrogen cream in the vagina decreases risk of infection in pre-menopausal women.
