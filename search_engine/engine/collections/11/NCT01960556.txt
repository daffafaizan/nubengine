      pediatric catheter associated blood stream infection (CA-BSI) rates could be achieved through
      improving compliance with maintenance bundle care for central lines. The investigators
      objective was to improve maintenance bundle compliance rates and nursing competency
      surrounding central venous line (CVL) care in their pediatric intensive care unit (PICU).

      A multidisciplinary team developed a bedside simulation-based training program to improve
      compliance with standard PICU CVL maintenance bundle. The investigators then performed a
      randomized comparison study comparing a standard CVL bundle education process for bedside
      PICU nurses in a control group (CG) to an intervention group (IG) receiving bedside training
      to simulate a CVL dressing change and maintenance bundle followed by intermittent educational
      refresh. Groups were assessed for compliance with prescribed components of the CVL bundle
      maintenance (CVL score).

      CVL scores will be compared between groups
