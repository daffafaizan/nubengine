      randomised to the experimental arm will receive Nivolumab 360mg + Paclitaxel 200mg/m2 +
      Carboplatin AUC5 for 3 cycles every 21 days (+/- 3 days) as neoadjuvant treatment followed by
      surgery and 1 year of adjuvant treatment with Nivolumab 240 mg Q2W (+/- 3 days) and 8 months
      with nivolumab 480 mg Q4W. Patients randomized to the control arm will receive Paclitaxel
      200mg/m2 + Carboplatin AUC5 for 3 cycles every 21 days (+/- 3 days) followed by surgery.

      The primary objective is pathological Complete Response (pCR) defined as the absence of
      residual tumor in lung and lymph nodes comparing patients treated with chemo-immunotherapy
      versus chemotherapy alone. Patient accrual is expected to be completed within 3 years
      excluding a run-in-period of 3 months. Treatment and follow-up are expected to extend the
      study duration to a total of 6.5 years. Patients will be followed 3 years after adjuvant
      treatment or surgery. The study will end once survival follow-up has concluded.
