      BioMonitor3®-guided AF management following ablation for persistent AF. Subjects will be
      followed for 15 months including a 3 month blanking period following AF ablation. The study
      subject population will include subjects with persistent atrial fibrillation (sustained AF
      episode lasting more than 7 days, but less than 1 year), refractory to at least one
      antiarrhythmic agent, according to current guideline indications for persistent AF ablation
      and ICM (BioMonitor3®) implantation.
