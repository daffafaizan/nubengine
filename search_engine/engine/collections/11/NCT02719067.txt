    
      Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a common severe, clinically and genetically heterogeneous
      childhood-onset neurodevelopmental disorder. Due to its high prevalence, typical autistic
      symptoms, and severe lifelong impairment without effective prevention and treatment, the
      developmental change of brain functions in individuals with this study has been recognized as
      one of the key topics of ASD. The goal of this project is to prospectively investigate the
      stability and changes of brain functions assessed by neuropsychological tests and neuroimages
      in a cohort of children and adolescents with ASD who had the first assessment 3-5 years ago.

      Specific Aims: To investigate the stability and changes of neuropsychological and structural
      and functional connectivity among children and adolescents with ASD as compared to age- and
      sex-matched typically developing (TD) controls; and to identify predictors for these
      neurocognitive changes across a 3-5 follow-up period.

      The investigators will prospectively follow up 70 ASDs and 70 TDs for reassessments of
      clinical symptoms, neuropsychological functions, and structural and functional brain
      connectivity. The assessments include ASD symptoms (ASD only: Autism Diagnostic
      Interview-Revised, Autism Diagnostic Observation Scale; all: Social Responsiveness Scale
      (SRS), Social Communication Questionnaires (SCQ), Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ)), other
      psychiatric disorders (The Chinese version of the Kiddie Schedule of Schizophrenia and
      Affective Disorder Scale-Epidemiologic version, K-SADS-E), neuropsychological functions
      (Conner's Continuous Performance Test) and MRI assessments (T1 and T2 templates, Diffusion
      Spectrum Imaging, resting-state fMRI).
