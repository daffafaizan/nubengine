      fatty acids (FFAs) contribute to the progression of sepsis severity in infectious patients
      presenting to the Emergency Department. In the present study, pilot data will be generated to
      validate our hypothesis that elevated free fatty acids are related to outcome in sepsis.

      We will examine our hypotheses with the following specific aims:

        1. To determine if plasma FFA levels are related to severity of illness in patients with
           sepsis presenting to the Emergency Department.

        2. To study the prognostic value of plasma FFA levels at predicting future morbidity and
           mortality in patients with sepsis presenting to the Emergency Department.
