      Cardiac Rehabilitation, with input from Veterans and provider stakeholders. Aim 2 will
      involve a preliminary test and refinement of the adapted TranS-C manual and protocol with a
      small sample of Veterans who are participating in cardiac rehabilitation and report sleep
      disturbance and/or sleep-related impairment. Aim 3 will involve a pilot randomized trial to
      establish the feasibility, acceptability, and plausibility of the intervention protocol and
      study procedures. Veterans in cardiac rehabilitation with sleep disturbance and/or
      sleep-related impairment will be randomized to TranS-C + Usual Care or Usual Care. Treatment
      satisfaction will be assessed at 3-months; sleep disturbance and sleep-related impairment,
      disability and functioning, and health-related quality of life will be assessed at baseline,
      3-months, and 6-months to determine measure responsiveness and provide preliminary insight
      into treatment effects.

      Of note, information provided in this entry (e.g., design, eligibility criteria, outcomes,
      etc.) pertains only to Aim 3 which includes the pilot randomized trial. Consistent with Stage
      I of the NIH stage model of behavioral intervention development research, results from Aim 1
      and 2 activities may lead to modifications to the pilot protocol and procedures in Aim 3.
