      reactivity in aspirin-treated cardiovascular patients using a system biology approach that
      include proteomics analysis of selected platelet sub-fractions in patients displaying extreme
      phenotype.

      Main objective:

        -  to characterize the proteome profile of platelet hyperreactivity in aspirin-treated
           cardiovascular patients

      Secondary objectives:

        -  to characterize the platelet hyperreactivity phenotype in cardiovascular patients
           treated with aspirin

        -  to determine genetic polymorphisms associated with platelet hyperreactivity
