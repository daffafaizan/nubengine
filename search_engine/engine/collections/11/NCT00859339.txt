    
      OUTLINE: This is a multi-center study.

        -  Gemcitabine ( 1000 mg/m2) IV days 1 and 8

        -  Cisplatin (70 mg/m2) IV day 1 and

        -  Sunitinib malate (37.5 mg) oral daily for days 1-14

      The treatment regimen will be administered in four, 21-day, cycles followed by radical
      cystectomy performed no sooner than 2 weeks but within 6 weeks of the last dose of sunitinib
      malate.

      ECOG performance status 0 or 1

      Hematopoietic:

        -  Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) > 1.5 K/mm3 [(IS): 1.5 x 109/L]

        -  Platelets > 100 K/mm3 [(IS): 100 x 109/L]

        -  Hemoglobin (Hgb) > 9.0 g/dL [(IS): 90 g/L]

      Hepatic:

        -  Total bilirubin < 1.5 x Upper Limit of Normal (ULN)

        -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤ 2.5 x ULN

        -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 2.5 x ULN

      Renal:

        -  Calculated creatinine clearance of > 60 cc/min

      Cardiovascular:

        -  No uncontrolled angina, congestive heart failure or myocardial infarction or
           coronary/peripheral artery bypass graft within 6 months prior to registration for
           protocol therapy.
