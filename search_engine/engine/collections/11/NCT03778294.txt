      I. Compare overall survival at 12 months for grade IV glioma patients after radiation therapy
      targeting volumes designed with both 18F-DOPA-PET and conventional magnetic resonance (MR)
      image (or PET/computed tomography [CT]) information with historical controls.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Compare progression free survival at 12 months after radiation therapy targeting volumes
      designed with both 18F-DOPA-PET and conventional MR image information with historical
      controls.

      II. Determine acute and late effect toxicity after hypofractionated proton beam radiotherapy
      treatment including areas of high 18F-DOPA-PET uptake (T/N > 2.0).

      CORRELATIVE RESEARCH OBJECTIVES:

      I. Compare radiotherapy (RT) treatment volumes defined by MR only with RT treatment volumes
      defined with both PET and MR information for grade IV glioma patients.

      II. Compare differences in RT volumes identified using biopsy-validated thresholds as highly
      aggressive disease comparing 18F-DOPA uptake and relative cerebral blood volume (relCBV) from
      perfusion MRI (pMRI) as well as differences in RT volumes identified using biopsy-validated
      thresholds as tumor extent comparing 18F-DOPA uptake and diffusion maps from diffusion tensor
      imaging (DTI) will be evaluated.

      III. Evaluate quality of life after radiotherapy using European Organization for Research and
      Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) questionnaires compared with historical controls from
      Keim-Guibert et al.

      IV. Compare differences in proton radiation planning utilizing radiobiologic
      modeling/evaluation techniques performed at Mayo Clinic Rochester to linear energy transfer
      distribution evaluation at Mayo Clinic Arizona.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive 18F-DOPA intravenously (IV) and undergo PET/MRI or PET/CT imaging scan.
      Patients then receive proton beam radiotherapy over 5 or 10 consecutive days excluding
      weekend and standard of care temozolomide on days 1-7 or 1-14. Beginning cycles 2, patients
      receive standard of care temozolomide on days 1-5. Cycles with temozolomide repeat every 28
      days for up to 7 cycles in the in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 2 months for 1 year, and
      then periodically for up to 5 years.
