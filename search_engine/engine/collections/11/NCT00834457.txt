    
      To identify factors associated with successful treatment of KS with antiretroviral therapy
      and to determine if highly active antiretroviral therapy improves survival and quality of
      life for persons with AIDS-KS in Zimbabwe.

      A secondary objective is to investigate the durability of HIV-1 suppression by the
      combination of ABC/3TC/ZDV in persons infected with HIV-1 subtype C and to evaluate the
      timing and characteristics of mutations in HIV-1 reverse transcriptase in subjects who fail
      to achieve, or to maintain suppression of HIV-1 replication during treatment with
      ABC/3TC/ZDV.

      An important objective is to assess adherence to a simplified antiretroviral regimen in a
      resource-limited setting.

      The study will evaluate the clinical, immunological, and virological effects of a switch from
      a twice-daily all-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) antiretroviral regimen to
      a once-daily regimen of 2 NRTIs plus a ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor in persons with
      AIDS-KS and good virologic suppression on ABC/3TC/ZDV (see above).
