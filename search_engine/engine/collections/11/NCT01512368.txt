      before, 1hr and 4hr after a bout of exercise and repeated after two weeks of daily supervised
      exercise. We studied sedentary young healthy women. A treadmill exercise test (following the
      Bruce's protocol) was done five times per week (from Monday to Friday) for two weeks. The
      Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism at the INCMNSZ performed all biochemical
      laboratory measurements using standardized procedures.
