      control of BDU, however, randomized prospective comparative studies are scarce, particularly
      in East Asian populations. Our preliminary data gave us the impression that IFNα2a might be
      more effectiveness than CsA in long-term control of refractory BDU, and this study aimed to
      compare their effectiveness and safety profiles in a well-designed prospective study.
      Refractory BDU is defined as relapse of posterior or pan- uveitis with at least 10mg daily
      prednisone (or equivalent) and one traditional immunomodulatory treatment (IMT) agents. The
      acute attack is controlled with large dose oral corticosteroid (60mg daily prednisone) for 4
      weeks, and then the patients are randomly assigned to the IFN arm and the CsA arm, in which
      patients are treated with IFNα2a (3×10^6 IU qd for 4 weeks and qod thereafter) and CsA (100mg
      bid), respectively, along with a fixed tapering regimen of corticosteroid. Patients were
      followed up until relapse, or for 12 months.
