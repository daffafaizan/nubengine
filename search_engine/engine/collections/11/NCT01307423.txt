      patients. The immunopathogenesis of PsA, which mirrors but is not identical to that seen in
      psoriatic plaques, reflects a complex interaction among resident dendritic, fibroblastic and
      endothelial cells, and inflammatory cells attracted to the synovium by cytokines and
      chemokines. Apremilast (CC-10004) is a novel oral agent that modulates multiple inflammatory
      pathways through targeted phosphodiesterase type 4 (PDE4) enzyme inhibition. Therefore,
      apremilast has the potential to be effective in the treatment of PsA.
