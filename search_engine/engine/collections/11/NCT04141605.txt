      transplanted and prospectively from consecutively enrolled patients for heart
      transplantation. The study is a chart review study.

      Ongoing eligible recipients will undergo heart transplantation according to standard
      practices at each participating institution.

      This study will be conducted at an estimated 25 institutions globally and will have about 500
      patients. Subjects will be followed from transplant through one-year post-transplantation
      (i.e., 24 hours post-transplant, discharge, 30-days, and 1-year).

      GUARDIAN provides critical and contemporary data on patient outcomes, with additional insight
      into risk factors and patient-related indices. Both donor and recipient information along
      with procedural details (including transportation) will be collected to provide information
      for major discrete endpoints such as death, primary graft dysfunction, right ventricular
      dysfunction, CPB weaning and Inotrope use.

      Information about re-hospitalizations and re-transplantations is vital to address the
      integrated endpoint of days alive out of hospital, which is particularly relevant for this
      patient population. In addition, the number of in-hospital days and ICU time is closely
      tracked as the major resource utilized, after the initial transplant.
