      factor receptor type 2)-positive disease represents a more aggressive type of breast cancer
      which often afflicts younger patients. As many as one-third of patients with HER2-positive
      breast cancer develop brain metastasis[1]. The development of brain metastasis in this young
      female population is particularly devastating as they are often highly functional and may
      have young children. Improvement in quality of life by preventing neurocognitive decline from
      disease progression and/or treatment related side effects is paramount.

      Patients with 1-10 brain metastasis from HER2+ breast cancer, after informed consent, will be
      treated with:

      Radiosurgery: Gamma-knife, Cyberknife, or linac-based SRS is followed by anti-HER2 based
      systemic therapy, with the treatment selection of approved agents at the physician's
      discretion. Possible anti-HER2 agents include trastuzumab, pertuzumab, trastuzumab-emtansine,
      or lapatinib. Anti-HER2 therapy will be delivered in combination with appropriate cytotoxic
      therapy as per FDA indications.

      Anti-HER2 based systemic therapy will continue until progression, patient discontinuation,
      unacceptable toxicity or if, in the view of the physician it is no longer indicated.

      MRI and neurocognitive testing will be done prior to SRS and repeated every 3 months during
      the first 6 months from enrollment.

      Patients can only be enrolled after all eligibility criteria are met. The date of
      registration/enrollment is considered to be the day the Eligibility Checklist is signed by
      the verifying physician. Once a patient is enrolled, a unique case number will be assigned to
      the patient.
