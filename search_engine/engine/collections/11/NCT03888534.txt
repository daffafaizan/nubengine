      situation. The duration of this pause is dependent on the leveling and control of the
      COVID-19 pandemic.

      The drug being tested in this study is called Ixazomib. Ixazomib is being tested to determine
      the MTD or RP2D of intravenous ixazomib when administered in combination with multiagent
      chemotherapy (reinduction therapy) in pediatric participants with relapsed or refractory ALL
      or relapsed/refractory LLy.

      The study will enroll approximately 18 participants. Doses of ixazomib will be escalated
      according to a standard 3+3 dose escalation schema. Participants aged >= 1 year will receive
      the starting dose of 1.0 mg/m^2 and participants aged <1 year will receive the starting dose
      of 0.03 mg/kg. Ixazomib will be administered in combination with multiagent reinduction
      therapy. The dose escalation phase will determine the MTD and/or RP2D of ixazomib. Dose
      escalation will be based on the observed safety and tolerability data.

      Participants aged <1 year will be assessed separately and will not contribute to the dose
      escalation assessment.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States and Spain. The overall time to
      participate in this study is approximately 30 months. Participants will be followed up to Day
      60 after the first dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.
