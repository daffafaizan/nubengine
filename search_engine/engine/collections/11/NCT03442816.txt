      scans a wide spectral range to obtain one spectrum for each image pixel. The combination of
      imaging and spectroscopy offered by hyperspectral imaging makes it possible to identify and
      quantify several specific biomolecules in the retina and the optic nerve, thus paving the way
      for metabolic imaging of the fundus. Subsequent analysis of the light signal with algorithms
      and image analysis software tools permits extracting molecular information modulated
      according to the underlying pathology. This technique thus permits direct, non-invasive and
      inexpensive diagnosis of pathologies of the retina and systemic pathologies presenting
      manifestations in the eye.

      In this research project, Optina Diagnostics aims to evaluate in a clinical context a novel
      Metabolic Hyperspectral Retinal Camera (MHRC) based on a mydriatic camera customized for
      observation of the fundus in combination with a tunable filter, i.e., one permitting
      selection of a specific wavelength, in order to provide monochromatic light in the visible
      and near infrared spectrum (energy spectrum between 450 and 900 nm).
