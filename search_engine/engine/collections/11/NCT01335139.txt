    
      This is a randomized, double-blind, single-center, placebo-controlled, three-arm study
      comparing SLIT with placebo and SCIT with placebo. The main comparison will be between SLIT
      and placebo.

      Individuals with severe grass pollen hay fever, with or without associated seasonal asthma,
      will be recruited during the pollen season of March through September 2011. Eligible
      participants will be randomized to one of the following three treatment arms administered in
      a double-blind (masked), double-dummy fashion in a 1:1:1 ratio:

        -  SLIT + SCIT placebo

        -  SCIT + SLIT placebo

        -  SLIT placebo + SCIT placebo

      Participants will receive treatment over a 2-year period followed by a 1-year blinded
      (masked) withdrawal phase. Participants will be provided with anti-allergic rescue
      medications (antihistamine, topical intranasal corticosteroids, and short-acting beta
      agonists) throughout the study. Clinical endpoint assessments will be performed at prior to
      initiating their assigned treatment, after 1 and 2 years of treatment, and after the 1-year
      withdrawal period at 3 years.
