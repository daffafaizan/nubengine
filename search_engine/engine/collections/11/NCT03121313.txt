    
      The primary endpoint will be 2-years distant failure rate which will be estimated by
      Kaplan-Meier method with two-sided 95% confidence interval.

      The secondary endpoints are described as follows:

        -  2-year locoregional failure rate, 2-year PFS rate and 2-year OS rate will be estimated
           by Kaplan-Meier method with two-sided 95% confidence interval.

        -  Safety profile: adverse events will be summarized by CTCAE. Safety parameters will only
           be analyzed on the safety analysis set and be presented in frequency tabulation.

      Determination of sample size:

      The estimated 2-year distant failure rate for squamous cell carcinoma of oral cavity with
      extracapsular spreading of lymph nodes is 26%. The 2-year distant failure rate of maintenance
      treatment with tegafur-uracil in this study is expected to be 13%. Using One Proportional
      Test with one-sided alpha 0.05 and power 80%, the sample size of 56 subjects will test an
      effect size of 13% (i.e. 26% vs.13%). With expected dropout rate of 20%, the sample size
      would be 68 subjects.
