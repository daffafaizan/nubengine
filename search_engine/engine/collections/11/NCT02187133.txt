      I. To assess the safety and tolerability of carfilzomib when combined with bendamustine
      (bendamustine hydrochloride) and rituximab in patients with relapsed or refractory
      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the preliminary antitumor activity of carfilzomib with bendamustine and
      rituximab in patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (dose escalation) and with specific
      non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) subtypes (dose expansion).

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of carfilzomib.

      Patients receive carfilzomib intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes twice weekly on days 1, 2, 8,
      9, 15, and 16 or weekly on days 2, 9, and 16; bendamustine hydrochloride IV over 60 minutes
      on days 1 and 2; and rituximab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 9 (course 1 only) and day 1
      (subsequent courses). Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 weeks for 6 months,
      every 3 months for 6 months, and then every 6 months thereafter.
