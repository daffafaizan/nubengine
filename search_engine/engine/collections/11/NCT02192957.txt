      All eligible and consenting patients will undergo elective electrical cardioversion for
      atrial fibrillation (AF) using the Ottawa AF protocol.The fact that the physician follows the
      protocol makes this experimental. Aside from following the protocol, subjects will receive
      standard care before, during and after the procedure. Outcomes of the procedure and clinical
      features know to affect cardioversion efficacy will be collected. These will be compared to a
      group of 500 previous patients who underwent elective electrical cardioversion for AF at the
      Heart Institute.

      Methodology:

      The Ottawa AF protocol prescribes the electrical energy dose, the electrode position and the
      application of pressure to the electrodes the physician will use. The individual elements of
      the protocol (energy dose, electrode position and pressure application) are often used by
      physician in clinical practice but not necessarily in the step by step order.

      The Ottawa AF protocol prescribes the following:

        -  the starting energy dose (200 J) and electrode placement (anterior-posterior)

        -  the second electrode placement (anterior-lateral) if the first shock is not successful

        -  addition of pressure to electrodes if second shock is not successful

        -  step up of energy dose (360 J) along with pressure to electrodes if third shock is not
           successful

        -  optional further steps at physician's choice if fourth shock is not successful
