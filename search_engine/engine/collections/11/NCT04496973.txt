      prevalence. Participant recruitment is a significant challenge to the success of Parkinson's
      disease research and we need your help more than ever in moving the field forward and
      improving the lives of people who have Parkinson's disease. Recruitment of study participants
      can be facilitated by maintaining registries of people who agree to be contacted for future
      studies.

      The purpose of the University of Delaware Participant Recruitment Registry for Parkinson's
      Disease Research is to create a registry that includes the contact information and basic
      health information pertaining the participant's diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. The
      registry will streamline recruitment and enrollment in a variety of research studies focusing
      on topics such as, but not limited to: brain changes in Parkinson's disease, balance and gait
      in Parkinson's disease, exercise and its effect on motor function.

      To be in the registry individuals must have a clinical diagnosis of Parkinson's Disease, have
      an interest in participating in research studies, and be willing to allow the Parkinson's
      Disease Team access to their medical history from their medical provider(s).

      To become a member of this registry, primary information including contact information and
      some general medical information from a health provider are needed. Medical information will
      be evaluated to confirm Parkinson's disease diagnosis and to determine if a potential
      participant is eligible to become a member of the registry.
