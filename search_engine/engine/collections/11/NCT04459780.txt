    
      -  Evaluate the expression of Cav1.4 calcium channels by Th17 lymphocytes from plaque
           psoriasis.

        -  To assess:

             -  The role of Cav1.4 channels on the activation of Th17 lymphocytes

             -  The transcriptomic signature relating to the signalling channel Cav1.4

             -  The epigenetic signature, in particular changes in overall methylation and specific
                promoter methylation
