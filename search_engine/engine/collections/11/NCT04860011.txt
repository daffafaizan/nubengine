      greater diuresis and decongestion compared to the standard practice of treatment with the
      thiazide-like diuretic metolazone (in addition to IV loop diuretic) in patients hospitalised
      for heart failure, with both renal impairment and diuretic resistance. Dapagliflozin has
      received National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) approval as an add-on
      option to optimised standard care in patients with HFrEF. The investigators primary focus is
      patients with HFrEF as it is in ambulatory patients with this phenotype that SGLT2 inhibition
      has already been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality (DAPA-HF).However, the investigators
      will also enrol patients with HFpEF in an ancillary study as they present the same management
      challenges as patients with HFrEF and the study hypothesis and aims are as clinically
      relevant in HFpEF as in HFrEF. HFpEF patients in the ancillary study will undergo the same
      protocol as the main study. One recent trial demonstrating benefit of a SGLT1/2 inhibitor,
      the Effect of Sotagliflozin on Cardiovascular Events in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Post
      Worsening Heart Failure (SOLOIST-WHF), included patients with both HFrEF and HFpEF
      hospitalised with worsening heart failure (NCT03521934). This trial demonstrated similar
      efficacy of sotagliflozin on cardiovascular death and worsening heart failure in patients
      with a LVEF <50% and â‰¥50%.There are other large trials currently underway specifically with
      SGLT2i in ambulatory patients with HFpEF underway. These trials are either fully recruited,
      or close to full enrolment. Both already have extensive follow-up of several thousand
      patients and are due to complete follow up in the next 1-2 years (EMPEROR-Preserved and
      DELIVER). Therefore, the findings will be contemporaneous and complementary to the results of
      those trials.
