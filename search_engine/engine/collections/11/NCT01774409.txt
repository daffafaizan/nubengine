    
      Determination of the tumor profile and review in multidisciplinary molecular board:

      The genetic and immunologic profile will be performed from the available tumor sample and
      from a blood sample.

      Genetic profile:

        -  Research of mutations/insertions/deletions for an array of predefined genes in tumor
           deoxyribonucleic acid by high-throughput sequencing

        -  Analysis of copy number variations of genes on tumor deoxyribonucleic acid by
           microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization

        -  Analysis of rearrangements involving the gene Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase that can't be
           detected by Next Generation Sequencing or array Comparative Genomic Hybridization
           (balanced translocations) by means of fluorescent hybridization probes on tumor samples
           Immunologic profile: analysis of the expression of relevant immunologic markers

      Clinical data collection:

      Patients' clinical data will be collected from the patient medical record. This study is not
      a treatment evaluation. Patients' follow-up and treatment will be performed according to the
      center local practices or to the specificities of a clinical trial in which the patient would
      have been enrolled, depending on the recommendations given by the multidisciplinary molecular
      board, with the review of the tumor genetic profile.
