    
      Opal-HIV-Gag(c) is not for direct injection and is administered by ex vivo incubation of
      whole blood or separated blood components (such as white blood cells or peripheral blood
      mononuclear cells) and reinfusion.

      As a practical alternative to PBMC separation and to optimise vaccine presentation during the
      ex vivo incubation, a blood cell separation device will be used to separate the whole blood
      and enrich the white blood cell component. The device processes whole blood in a closed,
      single use disposable kit. Reconstituted Opal-HIV-Gag(c)or matching placebo will be added to
      the white blood cells, incubated for one hour and reinfused into the subject. Subjects will
      receive 4 administrations at 4 weekly intervals. Subjects are followed for 12 weeks after the
      final administration.

      Each dose group will be enrolled sequentially, with a sentinel group for each dose group.
      Satisfactory safety data from each cohort, reviewed by a Data Safety Monitoring Board, will
      permit dose escalation.
