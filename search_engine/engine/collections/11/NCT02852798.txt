      Co., Ltd has developed an efficient VEGFR2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) - Apatinib. This
      drug works mainly by inhibiting VEGFR2 to produce the anti-angiogenic effects and treat
      malignant tumors. Apatinib was shown to have good tumor growth-inhibiting activity against
      lung cancer in both in vivo and in vitro experiments.

      This study aims to further validate the efficacy and safety of Apatinib combined with
      chemotherapeutics in the treatment of advanced EGFR wild-type non-squamous, non-small-cell
      lung cancer.
