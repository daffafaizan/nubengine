      care costs. Increasing resistance to antibiotics is making treatment of these infections even
      more problematic. Therefore, safe and effective nonantimicrobial prevention strategies are
      needed. One approach that appears to be effective is the use of cranberry products. However,
      data on the safety and effectiveness of cranberry products are limited. This study will
      determine whether cranberry juice can reduce UTIs in women.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either cranberry juice or a placebo drink
      daily for 6 months. Study visits will occur every month for the 6-month treatment phase of
      the study. At study entry and at each study visit, urine collection will occur and vaginal
      swabs will be taken. A rectal swab will be taken at study entry and at the Month 2 and 4
      visits. Participants will be asked about medication usage, any side effects they may be
      experiencing, and diet at each study visit. If participants develop a UTI at any time during
      the study, they will be asked to visit the study site within 24 hours.
