        -  To collect normal and malignant cells in bone marrow and peripheral blood samples from
           patients with acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, chronic myelogenous
           leukemia, or multiple myeloma and from patients with no malignancy to use as target
           cells in cytotoxicity assays.

        -  To collect information about HLA type and immunophenotype of malignant cells as
           determined by clinical flow cytometry.

      OUTLINE: Bone marrow aspirates and/or peripheral blood samples are collected and used as
      target cells in standard cytotoxicity assays, with notch-induced natural killer (N-NK) cells
      as the effector cells, to determine whether N-NK cells are capable of killing malignant cells
      and/or non-malignant cells. Receptor-blocking antibodies may be added to determine which NK
      cell receptors are responsible for malignant cell recognition and killing.

      Information about HLA type and immunophenotype of the malignant cells is collected from the
      patient's medical record.
