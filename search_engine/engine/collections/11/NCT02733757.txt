      ages from 30 to 86 years old, ASA I and II, both genders. The patients were randomly divided
      into 4 groups of 20 patients, and then were administered in control sub-Tenon's group 5 mL of
      2% lidocaine with 1 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride solution; in sub-Tenon's group clonidine, 5 mL
      of 2% lidocaine associated with 1 µg/kg of clonidine diluted in 1 mL 0.9% sodium chloride
      solution. In the peribulbar anesthesia, the control group with 6 mL of 2% lidocaine and 1 mL
      of 0.9% sodium chloride solution, and peribulbar group clonidine, 6 mL of 2% lidocaine
      associated with 1 µg/kg of clonidine diluted in 1 mL 0.9% sodium chloride solution. Were
      evaluated the systemic hemodynamic variables; IOP and OPA measurements according the dynamic
      contour tonometer (DCT) and calculation of OPP, prior to the blockade (M0), and one (M1),
      five (5) and ten minutes (M10) after the injection of the anesthetic solutions. Complications
      related to the sub-Tenon's and peribulbar anesthesia were recorded.
