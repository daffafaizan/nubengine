      significantly increased platelet count and decreased fatal hemorrage. As it's known that all
      patients with acute leukemia will experience bone marrow suppression and thrombocytopenia
      after chemotherapy. Some patients even died of fatal bleeding during this period for lacking
      of platelet transfusion or platelet transfusion refractoriness. So a lot needs to be done to
      shortern thrombocytopenia time or reduce fatal hemorrage incidence after chemotherapy in
      acute leukemia patients. In this prospective randomized controlled study, the effect and
      safety of eltrombopag in the treatment of thrombocytopenia after consolidation therapy in
      acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is evaluated.
