      breast augmentation and stromal vascular fraction enhanced autologous fat grafting for
      cosmetic breast augmentation in a carefully designed study.

      Patients will be given the option of participating in one of two studies:

        1. A small, level I study will compare AFG to SVF-enriched AFG in the same patient. One
           breast will be treated with AFG alone (control) and the other breast with SVF-enriched
           AFG (experimental).

        2. A larger, level II study comparing AFG to SVF-enriched AFG in different patients. The
           patient will either receive AFG alone in both breasts or SVF-enhanced AFG in both
           breasts.
