    
      Study population:

      A cohort with a total of 2000 HIV patients will be built, consisting of a discovery cohort
      (n=1200) and confirmation cohort (n=800). The investigators estimate a 2-year inclusion and
      2-year follow-up period and will strive for the inclusion of several clinical phenotypes such
      as long-term non-progressors (~2-3%), immunologic non-responders (~3%), and rapid progressors
      (~4-5%) and classical risk group patients such as men who have sex with men (MSM), females,
      and subjects from Sub-Sahara Africa. Patients will be recruited from the following Dutch HIV
      Treatment Centres: Radboudumc (Nijmegen), Erasmus MC (Rotterdam), Onze Lieve Vrouwe Gasthuis
      (Amsterdam), Elisabeth Twee-Steden Ziekenhuis (Tilburg).

      A sample size calculation cannot be provided due to the variable frequencies of the various
      traits in genome-microbiome interaction (SNP frequency, variable prevalence of specific
      microbial genera and species, etc.), and their effect on cytokine production. Because of the
      explorative nature of this study, the size calculation will be variable depending on the type
      of polymorphism analyzed. The frequencies of the various microorganism classes in the
      colonizing microbiome is not known in our study population, and therefore power calculations
      are impossible to be performed.

      Earlier studies in the Human Functional Genomics Project have assessed microbiome traits in
      250-500 individuals. An earlier HFGP study included a uniform cohort of 200 HIV-infected
      individuals (all MSM). The present study will also include HIV-infected patients with a more
      extreme phenotype, females and subjects originating from Sub-Sahara Africa. Because of this,
      the investigators decided to increase the number of individuals tested to 2000, consisting of
      a discovery cohort of 1200 subjects, and a confirmation cohort of 800 participants.

      Study visits and procedures:

      At inclusion

        1. The investigators will collect metadata from all the participants using questionnaires
           on lifestyle, health and clinical symptoms, including neuropsychiatric symptoms.
           Relevant data will also be collected from the patients records in the medical centers
           and the HIV Monitoring Foundation.

        2. Co-pathology will be assesed:

             -  Cardiovascular risk scores (D:A:D risk score and Framingham CVD score) will be
                collected as well as ECG and intima-media thickness (IMT) measurements.

             -  Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) assessment through liver ultrasound and
                FibroScan.

        3. Blood will be drawn (90 ml):

             -  DNA will be isolated for genetic analysis.

             -  The function of the immune system will be analyzed at several levels using
                circulating white blood cells from venous blood.

             -  Metabolism will be analyzed by metabolome analysis.

             -  Virological analysis, characterizing the HIV reservoir, HIV resistance and viral
                sequences in circulating DNA and RNA.

        4. Microbiome analysis will be performed on stool and saliva samples.

        5. Urine sample will be collected for creatinine measurements and microbiome.

      After 2 years (20-26 months) follow-up

        1. The investigators will collect metadata from all the participants using questionnaires
           on lifestyle, health and clinical symptoms, including neuropsychiatric symptoms.
           Relevant data will also be collected from the patients records in the medical centers
           and the HIV Monitoring Foundation.

        2. Co-pathology will be assesed:

             -  Cardiovascular risk scores (D:A:D risk score and Framingham CVD score) will be
                collected as well as ECG.

             -  Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) assessment through liver ultrasound and
                FibroScan.

        3. Blood samples (10ml) will be collected for biomarker and infection/inflammation
           parameter analysis.

      Patient informed consent procedure:

      Patients will always be approached first by a treating physician or specialized nurse. They
      will be provided with information and will be asked if a physician-researcher may contact the
      patient in one week. If there is oral consent for this, the researcher contacts the patient
      in one week to ask if they are interested in participating in the study. the
      physician-researcher will answer any questions the patient may have and plan the first visit.
      The informed consent procedure will be conducted during the patient's first visit to the
      physician-researcher.

      Patient registry procedures:

      All patient data will be recorded only in coded form in a secure database with audit and edit
      trail (CASTOR EDC). During the informed consent procedure, the patient is given a study code.
      The identifying patient data and study code is kept in a password-protected key file, only
      accessible to the local research team. No patient-identifying data will leave the local
      medical center.

      In the questionnaires and eCRFs in CASTOR, the investigators will enter as many data checks
      as possible (e.g. specified ranges for laboratory results, and questions popping up dependent
      on certain answers).

      Biomaterials:

      All biomaterial (blood, stool, urine, saliva) will be transported to and processed in the
      laboratory of Experimental Internal Medicine of the Radboudumc in Nijmegen. Here, all the
      biometarial will also be stored collectively. All materials will be handled and stored only
      under the patient's study code.

      Monitoring:

      Monitoring will be performed by an independent monitor according to the lastest guidelines of
      the The Netherlands Federation of University Medical Centres (NFU, April 2019). An initiation
      and close-out visit will be planned in plenary form with all the centers in Radboudumc. There
      will be one extra visit per center. This will be an on-site visit in Radboudumc, and a
      teleconference monitoring visit in the other centers. During these visits informed consents
      will be checked, as well as inclusion and exclusion criteria and source data verification in
      a small subset of total participants.
