      Unfortunately, standard organ preservation results in an ischemic-reperfusion injury (IRI) at
      the time of graft implantation. Novel strategies have been proposed to decrease reperfusion
      injury and improve graft function. This study will be the first to combine both strategies in
      a randomized, prospective trial. The intervention will occur during the retrieval surgery
      prior to cold preservation. Briefly, a glucose and insulin solution will be infused via the
      mesenteric vein at a controlled rate. Immediately prior to cross-clamping, blood supply to
      the liver will be restricted for 10 minutes and then resumed for 10 minutes before beginning
      cold preservation. All remaining surgical procedures, including the recipient surgery, will
      be performed by standard techniques. The liver recipient does not directly receive any
      intervention during this study.
