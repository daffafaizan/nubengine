      prospective, randomized clinical study. Patients were randomly assigned into one of a 2
      groups (8 patients each): bone substitute grafting of the intrabony defect, control group
      (Gr1), intrabony defect osseous wall swaging (OWS) combined xenograft (Gr2). In both groups
      root surfaces where treated with a neutral 24% EDTA gel and saline irrigation. Clinical and
      radiographic measurements were reassessed at 6 months after surgery.
