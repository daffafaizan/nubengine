      metastatic choroidal melanoma who may be previously untreated or have received one prior
      systemic cytotoxic regimen for advanced disease. Patients may not have been treated
      previously with taxanes. Patients may have been previously treated with immunological agents
      including IL-2 and vaccines. Patients will receive Taxoprexin® Injection at a dose of
      500mg/m2 intravenously by 1-hour infusion weekly for the first five weeks of a six week
      cycle. Treatment will continue until progression of disease, intolerable toxicity, refusal of
      continued treatment by patient or Investigator decision.
