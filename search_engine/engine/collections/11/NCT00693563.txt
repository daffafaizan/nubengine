      care given to all patients being discharged from acute inpatient rehabilitation following
      SCI. At 6 months and one year post injury an examiner blinded to group status will contact
      Control Group participants to collect outcome data.

      The Telephone Intervention group (Treatment Group) will also receive their usual care
      following discharge and a welcome letter, which will include the same information as the
      Control Group, but also remind them of the up-coming telephone call schedule. Treatment Group
      participants and their significant others will be contacted by telephone within 24 to 48
      hours after discharge and 10 additional times at weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, and months 2, 3, 4, 6, 8,
      and 10. The frequent early telephone contacts are meant to address early concerns that
      frequently arise after discharge are expected to last between 30 and 45 minutes. Later phone
      calls may be brief if no concerns are raised and are expected to address resource needs as
      well as ongoing questions that arise through the first year after injury. Content of each
      phone call will be dependent on issues raised by each individual participant and their
      significant other and/or follow-up on concerns raised in prior phone contacts rather than a
      specific structured interview. Treatment Group participants will also be contacted at 6
      months and one year post injury by the examiner blinded to group status to collect outcome
      data.
