    
      This is an open-label phase II study, with the aim of determining the efficacy of PD-1
      inhibitors (Camrelizumab) plus VEGF inhibitor (Apatinib) as a neoadjuvant therapy for
      dMMR/MSI-H locally advanced colorectal cancer.

      Patients will be evaluated for eligibility within 14 days prior to study initiation with CT
      (for colon cancer) and/or MRI (for rectal cancer).

      Patients will be given four cycles of Camrelizumab (200mg iv every 3 weeks) plus Apatinib
      (250mg QD day1-14) before being evaluated for response. For patients with colon cancer, if a
      SD/PD is achieved and the tumor is deemed unresectable, they will be offered
      chemotherapyÂ±radiotherapy; for patients with rectal cancer who have a SD/PD,
      chemoradiotherapy will be offered.
