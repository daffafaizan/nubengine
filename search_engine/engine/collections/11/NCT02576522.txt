      solid primary tumor for a multimodality approach: surgery followed by hypofractionated
      intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) using VMAT approach. The potential advantage of
      this treatment is to improve local control and to reduce toxicity compared with WBRT or SRS
      after surgical resection.
