      Activate-Initiate-Monitor (AIM) intervention vs. those receiving usual care, and will also
      compare outcomes in depressed and non-depressed stroke survivors. Patients are screened for
      depression 1 to 2 months post-stroke. Patients with depression are then randomized to the AIM
      intervention or control group. Patients without depression are also enrolled at the same time
      and are matched by hospital site to the depressed patients.

      The AIM intervention is a 3-part program consisting of activating or educating the patient
      and his/her family about post-stroke depression, instituting treatment for depression, and
      monitoring antidepressant treatments for side effects, efficacy, and compliance. Control
      patients are evaluated and treated with usual care by their physicians. Patients without
      depression do not receive the intervention but complete the same assessments on the same
      schedule as the patients with depression.
