    
      Thi is a study of pain control in subjects undergoing surgery for pancreatic or bile duct
      cancer.

      Subjects undergoing surgery will be randomized to surgery plus celiac plexus neurolysis with
      ethanol injection versus surgery plus placebo injection. Subjects will be followed every
      three months for survivorship or death to assess pain, quality of life measures, and narcotic
      pain control usage. The primary endpoint of pain control will be determined at one year post
      surgery. Subjects are not required to undergo any additional diagnostic testing procedures
      that are not part of their routine follow-up care.
