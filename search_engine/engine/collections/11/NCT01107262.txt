      administer questionnaires to identify risk factors for AI infections in human beings.Study
      volunteers will be interviewed regarding their exposures, medical history, and behaviors
      using a close-ended questionnaire specifically tailored for this study. A blood sample will
      be collected from every participant to verify presence of antibodies against the viruses
      under study. All study materials are in English and Arabic. Along side the human aspect of
      the study, specimens will be collected from the birds that the individual handles.

      This study hypothesizes that they will find evidence of previous infection with these viruses
      among poultry workers. Furthermore, the study team will collect animal specimens from the
      farms of the study volunteers and determine the types of Avian Influenza viruses that they
      harbour.
