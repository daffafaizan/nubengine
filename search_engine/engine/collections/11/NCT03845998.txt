      is placed in sequentially numbered opaque sealed envelopes by a non-investigator. Enrolment
      and data collection are performed by trained research staff who are not involved in the care
      of the patients. The treating clinicians are not blinded to the assignment group, but all
      other staff involved in both the collection and collation of data are blinded to group
      allocation. The primary measurement is the oropharyngeal leak pressure (OLP) at the
      recommended intracuff pressure. The secondary measurements included insertion time,
      fibreoptic view grade, insufficient ventilation, and the occurrence of complications such as
      postoperative sore throat. The sample size was calculated to be 390 by a statistical software
      based on previous research results. The continuous variables were expressed as means Â±
      standard deviation (SD) whereas categorical variables were expressed as frequency and
      percentage for data description. P <0.05 was considered statistically significant.
