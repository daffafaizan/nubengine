    
      Impaired thrombotic status is associated with adverse cardiovascular events. Patients with
      coronary artery disease (CAD) and atrial fibrillation (AF) are at increased risk of
      thrombotic events. It is not known whether thrombotic status differs in these patients, or
      how thrombotic status alters in response to clinical stabilisation with treatment.

      The aim of this study is to assess the global thrombotic status (stickiness of the blood) in
      patients with coronary artery disease and atrial fibrillation at baseline and after clinical
      stabilisation.

      This is a small, pilot, hypothesis-generating study. Design Single centre,
      hypothesis-generating study. Patients diagnosed with coronary disease (n=70) or atrial
      fibrillation (n=70) recruited from amongst in-patients or out-patients, will have a blood
      draw at presentation and after clinical stabilisation. Blood will be tested to assess global
      thrombotic status.

      The recruitment period is 3 years.
