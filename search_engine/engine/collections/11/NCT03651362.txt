      biomarkers enabling to predict retinal axonal loss and visual disability after clinical
      episode of optic neuritis (ON). Length of optic nerve lesion measured on MRI may be one of
      them.

      The aim of our study is to measure the association between the extent of inflammatory
      demyelinating process on optic nerve at the acute of ON and the retinal degenerative process
      following optic nerve injury.

      The investigators planned to include 50 patients suffering from a recent clinical episode of
      ON.

      Extent of demyelinating inflammatory process will be assessed by the length of optic nerve
      double inversion recovery (DIR) hypersignal at the acute phase of ON.

      The axonal degenerative process following optic nerve demyelinating injury will be assessed
      by retinal atrophy measured on optical coherence tomography at 12 months after ON, by visual
      disability measured on low vision contrast acuity scale and by microstructural quality
      analysis of optic nerve measured on diffusion tensor imaging sequence of the optic nerve.
