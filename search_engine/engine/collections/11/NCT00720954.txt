      a simple, safe and cheap method of obtaining tissue from pleura, but its diagnostic rate is
      between 7 % -72 %, ~ 50 %. Problems for Abrams needle are scattered tumoral involvement on
      pleura, blind performance, small tissue sampling, to tend to early and dense fibrosis and
      usually involvement of lower pleural surface and diaphragmatic pleura.

      Pleural needle biopsy with Abrams' needle, which can be performed by all chest physicians, if
      done with image guided and if this increase the diagnosis rate, the number of second
      procedure which is more expensive and hard will decrease.

      The study aims the comparison of rigid thoracoscopy with CT-guided pleural needle biopsy by
      the diagnostic efficacy and safety in patients with pleural effusion.

      It has been planned that a total of 120 patients accepted to the study who have pleural
      effusion at plain chest roentgenogram. All patients are being randomized after underwent
      contrast-enhanced CT. Undiagnosed patients of biopsy group are performed thoracoscopy and
      undiagnosed patients of thoracoscopy group followed up.

      Two groups will compare by age, sex, Karnofsky performance status (KPS), diagnosis and
      complication rate.
