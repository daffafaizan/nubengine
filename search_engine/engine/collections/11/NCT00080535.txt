    
      Background:

      It is estimated that 40-50% of patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) have tumors
      that express cluster of differentiation 25 (CD25) (Tac or IL2Ra). Normal resting T-cells do
      not express CD25. LMB-2 is an anti-CD25 recombinant immunotoxin containing variable domains
      of MAb anti-Tac and truncated Pseudomonas exotoxin. A phase I trial at National Cancer
      Institute (NCI) found that the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of LMB-2 was 40 microg/Kg
      intravenous (IV) given every other day for 3 doses (QOD times 3) with prophylactic IV fluid.
      The most common adverse events were transient fever, hypoalbuminemia and transaminase
      elevations. In that trial, two of two patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma had clinical
      benefit (1 partial response (PR), 1 stable disease (SD)). In 1999 another recombinant fusion
      protein, denileukin diftitox, was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for
      treatment of patients with advanced or recurrent CTCL expressing the high affinity
      interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor. This receptor is composed of three subunits: CD25, CD122 and
      CD132. Because LMB-2 is cytotoxic to cells expressing CD25 without the other IL-2 receptor
      subunits needed to form the high affinity receptor, CD25+ CTCL patients are good candidates
      for further testing with LMB-2.

      Objectives:

      The purpose of this study is to determine the activity of anti-Tac(Fv)-PE38 (LMB-2) in
      patients with Tac-expressing Cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma (CTCL). The primary endpoints of this
      trial are the response rate and response duration. We will also evaluate LMB-2
      immunogenicity, pharmacokinetics, and toxicity, and monitor soluble Tac levels in the serum.
      These will be evaluated using routine hematologic and clinical evaluation, and when
      appropriate, by monitoring the phenotype of circulating T-cells or of biopsied tissues using
      antibodies to CD25.

      Eligibility:

      CD25+ CTCL based on immunohistochemistry or flow cytometry of blood. Patients must have
      measurable stage 1b-IV disease which progressed after greater than or equal 2 prior systemic
      or topical therapies. Labs required: alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate
      aminotransferase (AST) less than or equal to 2.5-time upper limit, albumin greater than or
      equal 3, bilirubin less than or equal to 2.2, creatinine less than or equal to 2.0 (unless
      creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 50 ml/min), absolute neutrophil count (ANC)
      greater than or equal to 1000/ul, and platelets greater than or equal to 50,000/ul (ANC and
      platelets greater than or equal 500 and 10,000 if blood/marrow involvement).

      Design:

      Patients receive LMB-2 30 ug/Kg QOD time 3 every 4 weeks in absence of neutralizing
      antibodies or progressive disease. Dose escalation to 40 ug/Kg QOD times 3 if less than 2/6
      dose limiting toxicity (DLT) at 30 ug/Kg times 3. 1st stage is 16 patients, to expand to 25
      if greater than 1 of 16 patients respond.
