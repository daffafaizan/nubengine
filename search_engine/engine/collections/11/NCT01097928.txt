    
      The primary objective of this study is to capture high quality patient safety and
      effectiveness data on CDT for acute PE. The goal will be achieved by capturing a concise set
      of immediate and short-term functional and clinical outcome data for PE patients undergoing
      CDT.

      Secondary study objectives include the following:

      - To assess and benchmark clinical practice patterns (patient selection, optimal technique,
      use of procedure worldwide)

      These objectives will be achieved through the capture of selected process data for patients
      included in the registry. Data collected in this study may also be used to develop and refine
      standards of care for use of CDT for PE and to facilitate the design of randomized clinical
      trials
