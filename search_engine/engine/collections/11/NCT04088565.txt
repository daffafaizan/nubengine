      induce changes in cortical output circuits of human primary motor cortex, a neuromodulatory
      protocol known as paired-associative stimulation (PAS). Experiments seek to examine
      interactions between cortical PAS and non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) to
      understand the extent to which VNS amplifies cortical plasticity in humans.
