      I. To determine the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of PS-341
      (bortezomib) when administered as a bolus injection two times a week (on days 1 and 4) for 2
      weeks followed by one week of rest.

      II. To evaluate the pharmacodynamics of PS-341 by determining the 20S proteasome and nuclear
      factor kappa-light chain enhancer of activated B cells (NFkB) inhibition in blood of patients
      treated with intravenous PS-341 combined with weekly fluorouracil (5-FU) and leucovorin
      calcium (LV).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To identify any objective tumor response in patients treated with intravenous PS-341.

      II. To evaluate the relationship between inhibition of the 20S proteasome and NFkB and
      clinical toxicity.

      III. To obtain preliminary data on molecular correlates of response to PS-341 and 5-FU and LV
      including genes involved in apoptosis, cell cycle control, transcriptional regulation and
      adhesion/angiogenesis based on the mechanisms of PS-341 IV. To examine the pharmacokinetics
      of 5-FU when co-administered with PS-341.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of bortezomib.

      Patients receive bortezomib intravenously (IV) on days 1 and 4 and fluorouracil IV and
      leucovorin calcium IV on day 1 weekly for 2 weeks. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
