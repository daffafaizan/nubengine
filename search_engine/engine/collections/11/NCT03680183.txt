      patients with mutations in targeted genes. TKIs are metabolized in liver into inactive
      metabolites before eliminating from body. Liver function might plays a significant role in
      inter-individual differences of pharmacokinetics of TKIs. Hepatitis B is a disease of high
      prevalence in south China. The liver function will be compromised if the infection of
      hepatitis B virus has not been controlled. This study aims to compare the pharmacokinetics of
      TKIs before and after controlling HBV with standard treatment in Chinese patients of
      non-small-cell lung cancer.
