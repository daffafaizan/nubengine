      women with an without cesarean section.

      We compare the pain reported by the patient to the difficulty reported by the professional
      that performed the insertion. We also compare the pain the patient refers on the day of
      insertion and the pain the patient refers to remember a month after insertion.

      Our hypothesis is that there is no difference between nulliparous and multiparous patients.
