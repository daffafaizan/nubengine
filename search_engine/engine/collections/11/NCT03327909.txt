      upwards of 90% of patients with end- stage renal disease (ESRD) have high BP. Appropriate BP
      management, therefore, is a fundamental part of patient care in ESRD, yet the question of
      when best to take antihypertensive medications relative to the hemodialysis treatment session
      remains unanswered. Many patients on hemodialysis suffer from an abrupt fall in BP during the
      dialysis session (i.e., intradialytic hypotension [IDH]), a phenomenon that is associated
      with numerous adverse outcomes. In an attempt to minimize IDH, patients are often told to
      withhold antihypertensive medications prior to hemodialysis, and current guidelines suggest
      taking antihypertensive medications at night to minimize IDH. However, there are no data
      regarding the safety of these antihypertensive medication timing strategies, or whether these
      strategies are effective in reducing IDH.
