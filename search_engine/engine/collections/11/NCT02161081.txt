    
      The aim of this study is to compare the diagnostic performance of adenosine-stress dynamic
      myocardial CT perfusion using a reduced dynamic scan duration with perfusion protocol of
      30-second scan duration for the detection of myocardial perfusion defect and significant
      coronary artery stenosis.

      This trial is a single center, prospective, randomized trial designed to compare diagnostic
      performances and radiation doses between two protocols with 30-second or 21-second dynamic
      scan durations. A total of 120 symptomatic patients will be randomized to dynamic CT
      perfusion protocols with 30-second or 21-second scan duration. They will also undergo 1.5-T
      MRI and invasive coronary angiography as reference standards for the assessment of myocardial
      perfusion and coronary artery stenosis. The primary end point of the study is to compare
      diagnostic performances between two CT protocols of dynamic CT perfusion. The secondary
      endpoint of this study is to compare radiation doses and image qualities of two scan
      protocols.
