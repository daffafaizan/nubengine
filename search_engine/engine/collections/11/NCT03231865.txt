      light (407/425 nm) is used to detect ZnPP in the bloodstream non-invasively through the oral
      mucosa. The spectroscopic measurements are translated into a ZnPP value (mumol/mol heme).

      The non-invasive measurement of ZnPP is validated and compared to optical measurement of ZnPP
      in whole blood and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) measurement of ZnPP in whole
      blood.

      The ZnPP value is compared to other iron-deficiency parameters: Ferritin, Transferrin
      saturation and soluble Transferrin receptor.
