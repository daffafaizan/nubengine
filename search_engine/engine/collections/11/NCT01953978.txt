      intermediate dosis of dexamethasone (0.11-0.2 mg/kg) can be a safe part of a multimodal
      analgesic strategy after surgery. Dexamethasone has an opioid-sparing effect and reduces pain
      during rest and mobilisation. Our purpose is to investigate if dexamethasone in combination
      with paracetamol and ibuprofen has an increased analgesic effect compared to paracetamol and
      ibuprofen alone, on postoperative pain after herniated disk surgery. Our hypothesis is that
      dexamethasone can reduce postoperative pain and reduce opioidconsumption and side effects
      compared to placebo.
