    
      This is a non-treatment, blood collection study to evaluate biomarker panels for the
      diagnosis and prognosis of pancreatic cancer.

      Study participants will be recruited by physician referral or from a list of clinical
      patients being evaluated for a potential pancreatic abnormality or for potential treatment of
      pancreatic cancer. Additionally, a surveillance cohort will be recruited among individuals
      who are being monitored for recurrence following surgical or medical treatment for pancreatic
      cancer.

      Peripheral blood specimens will be collected from all participants at time of enrollment.
      Additional specimens may be collected from surveillance cohort participants no more
      frequently than once every 3 months as clinically indicated.

      The specimens will be sent to a clinical lab for sTRA biomarker and CA19-9 analysis.
      Participants will be followed for 36 months to track clinical outcomes. The performance of
      the investigation biomarker for the diagnosis, prognosis, or surveillance of pancreatic
      cancer will be compared to the performance of CA19-9.
