    
      The secondary objectives are to study the links between changes of the intestinal microbiota
      premature infants in terms of:

        -  changing diversity of the microbiota in the first 6 weeks of life;

        -  changes in the bacterial community (UniFrac study) during the first 6 weeks of life;

        -  diversity of the microbiota up to 6 weeks;

      -AND-

        -  diversity of the microbiota at 1, 2 & 3 years;

        -  bacterial communities (UniFrac study) at 1, 2 & 3 years;

        -  lymphocyte subpopulation profiles at 3 years;

        -  serum immunoglobulin A, G, M, E levels at 3 years;

        -  history of infectious episodes, allergic and inflammatory episodes during the first 3
           years of life.

      The links between certain variables known in the literature and neonatal microbiota will be
      confirmed / studied in our population:

        -  mode of delivery;

        -  length (and type) of antibiotic therapy in the neonatal period;

        -  duration of breastfeeding.
