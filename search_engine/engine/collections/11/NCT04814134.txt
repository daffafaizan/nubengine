    
      The CPNS Pilot Study is a prospective, multi-center and multinational study to evaluate the
      safety and performance of the CPNS System in patients hospitalized with acute decompensated
      heart failure (ADHF). The CPNS System is a neuromodulation system, intended to provide acute
      (â‰¤5 days) endovascular stimulation of the cardiac autonomic nerves in the right pulmonary
      artery. The system consists of a temporary neuromodulation stimulator catheter and a
      stimulator. Approximately 50 patients will be enrolled in the study and will be followed up
      through 6-months post-discharges from the hospital. Patients assigned to the treatment group
      will receive CPNS therapy and followed closely in an intensive care unit setting. Patients
      randomized to the control arm in Phase 2 will receive standard treatment for their heart
      failure.
