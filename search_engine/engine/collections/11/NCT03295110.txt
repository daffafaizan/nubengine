      burden felt by caregivers of patients with ADRD at 3 months and at 6 months of follow-up.

      The secondary objectives are to evaluate the impact of the Lili Smart solution at 3 months

        -  The risks associated with the functional decline (falls, run aways) of the patient with
           ADRD.

      In addition to the social impact measurement, the study aims to demonstrate the
      medico-economic impact of Lili smart solution as follow:
