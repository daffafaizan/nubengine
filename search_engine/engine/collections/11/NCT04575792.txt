      discomfort, functional limitations as reduced masticatory efficiency due to malocclusion,
      emotional limitations as reduced self-esteem and social limitations as being teased by other
      children.

      Deleterious Oral Habit is believed to be associated with emotional disturbances and orofacial
      dysfunction which will certainly affect child's OHRQoL.

      Sucking habits, mouth breathing habits and tongue thrusting habits are found to be the most
      deleterious habits, especially in the selected age group of (5-7) years. It was found that
      these three deleterious habits are the most practiced habits among Egyptian children aging
      from 6-9 years (19.6%).

      Up to the investigator's knowledge, there are very scanty studies investigating the effect of
      orofacial dysfunction on OHRQoL in children, only one of them was conducted on children
      practicing oral habits, but none of them was conducted on Egyptian children.
