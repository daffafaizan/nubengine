      (RCT) both including the Tasty&Healthy dietary intervention for 8 weeks in CD patients aged
      6-24 years vs. 1) EEN in mild-moderate CD, and the other RCT vs. 2) a control group
      continuing their habitual diet in those with mucosal inflammation despite stable medical
      treatment, but who are in clinical remission or have only minimal symptoms not requiring
      immediate treatment.

      As a third study, responders from both trials will be offered to participate in an open label
      extension personalized-diet study of further 16 weeks (total 24 weeks), in which gluten and
      dairy will be gradually re-introduced based on repeated monthly home assays of FC while
      otherwise following the Tasty&Healthy dietary intervention in a treat-to-target management
      approach.

      Patients will be evaluated at baseline, week 4 and week 8 with additional weekly phone visits
      to ensure adherence with the diets and address questions.

      The extension study will include two clinic visits at weeks 16 and 24 and a monthly call to
      ensure adherence.

      The investigators hope to establish a dietary-approach which is simpler to implement than
      current nutritional alternatives. It will enable high flexibility in the allowed foods and
      does not require liquid formula. In turn, this could position Tasty&Healthy, not merely for
      inducing remission, but also as a feasible maintenance strategy in selected patients.
