      diabetic macular edema. A epiretinal membrane group, a surgical control group, consisted of
      non-diabetic patients with epiretinal membrane who underwent pars plana vitrectomy. A healthy
      control was also included for the comparison of preoperative ciliary body thickness. Ciliary
      body thickness was measured using ultrasound biomicroscopy, and central macular thickness was
      determined using optical coherence tomography. The visual outcome, ciliary body thickness,
      and central macular thickness were compared between groups before and 1, 2, and 4 months
      after pars plana vitrectomy and the correlations between the central macular thickness and
      ciliary body thickness and best corrected visual acuity were determined.
