      (FF)/Vilanterol (VI)) is a once daily inhaler with bronchodilator effect lasting 24 hours.
      Our objective was to investigate the short and long-term effects of FF/VI on EIA in
      adolescents. Ninety-three adolescent asthmatics aged 12-18 years were referred for evaluation
      of EIA. 44 patients had a positive exercise challenge test (ECT), 22 (22/44) were allocated
      to a single administration of salbutamol (400 µg) and 22 to FF/VI (92/22 µg) in a double
      blind, double dummy method to assess the short-term effect on EIA. Then they received FF/VI
      for 30-60 days and were reassessed by a repeat ECT 24-hours after the last dose.
