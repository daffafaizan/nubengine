    
      This study is a randomized, open-labeled, controlled prospective study to evaluate the
      potential therapeutic effects of the cardiac glycoside digoxin and the secondary bile acid
      ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) on synovial inflammation and disease activity when administered
      as add-on treatments to the current DMARDs treatments for rheumatoid arthritis patients with
      variant disease activity. The study population will be rheumatoid arthritis patients
      attending the Physical Medicine, Rheumatology and Rehabilitation Department at Menoufia
      University Hospital, Menoufia, Egypt. A total of 90 rheumatoid arthritis patients who will
      meet the inclusion criteria will be enrolled in this study. The 90 participants will be
      divided into 30 rheumatoid arthritis patients who will receive placebo + the current DMARDs
      treatments of rheumatoid arthritis for 24 weeks and serve as the control group, 30 rheumatoid
      arthritis patients who will receive DMARDs + digoxin 25 mg every other day for 24 weeks and
      the last 30 rheumatoid arthritis patients who will receive DMARDs + ursodeoxycholic acid
      (UDCA) 500 mg/day for 24 weeks. Clinical Examinations and laboratory parameters will be
      performed and measured at the beginning of the study, 12 weeks and 24 weeks after
      randomization to evaluate the efficacy of digoxin and UDCA in the treatment of rheumatoid
      arthritis.
