    
      To improve the diagnostic performance of CTC in the prepared colon using improved spatial
      resolution, advanced image displays, and computer-assisted diagnosis, and to optimize
      diagnostic performance of CTC in the unprepared colon for colorectal polyp detection using
      electronic stool subtraction and computer-aided diagnostic techniques. To estimate the
      sensitivity and specificity of CTC in the unprepared colon for clinically important
      colorectal neoplasms (large adenomas â‰¥ 1 cm) and to compare such estimates with colonoscopy.
      To survey patient acceptance of CTC in the unprepared colon, and to assess implications for
      health care costs and cost-effectiveness of CTC in the unprepared colon in comparison with
      other approaches.
