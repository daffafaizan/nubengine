      turnover. Presently, serum or urinary assessments are used. However, the development of other
      procedures that are more patient-convenient, non-invasive and cost-efficient would
      significantly facilitate a clinician's ability to determine bone turnover. The objective of
      this application is to determine the feasibility of using saliva for this measurement. We
      will compare serum, urinary and salivary levels in 50 pre- and 50 post-menopausal women.
      Markers to be measured are bone alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, procollagen type
      propepties hydroxypyridinium crosslinks of collagen and crosslinked collagen telopeptides.
      Collection of saliva, serum and urine will be done at a single visit. We expect to observe
      reasonable good correlation between serum and saliva levels and poorer correlation between
      urine and saliva levels.
