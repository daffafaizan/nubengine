      largely curable disease. New effective treatment supervision strategies are needed
      particularly in low-resource high TB burden settings and a potential solution is in the hands
      of nearly every patient - a mobile phone. Modern modular design mobile phone software
      applications ("apps") hold great promise to address this unmet need.

      Current technologies allows for rapid design modification based on end user needs,
      implementation of native operating system (e.g., Android) versions for users with
      inconsistent internet access, and the integration of the patients' experiences with
      electronic health records using industry standards. Apps can perform multiple functions
      (e.g., automated reminders, symptom tracking, secure messaging, multi-media education). To
      date, few TB related apps have focused on patients as users, and none support patient
      engagement in self-management of their care or direct adherence monitoring. The research
      objectives are to understand end user needs and other stakeholder needs to build, refine, and
      pilot test an app to support patients self-administering treatment for active TB.
