      individuals at the beginning or during a competition where cognitive function are important
      for decision making for example. Tests will be conducted during the warm-up (fresh), during
      fatiguing situations (during two consecutive 10-minutes pedaling exercises) and during
      recovery. Tests will include a reverse digit memory test (from 3 to 7 digits), a stroop test,
      a simple reaction time test. Moreover, heart rate and rating of perceived exertion will be
      quantified.
