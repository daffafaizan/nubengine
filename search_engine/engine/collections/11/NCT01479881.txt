    
      TMC435 is a protease inhibitor (PI) and is being investigated for treatment of chronic
      hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, in combination with Peg-IFN (pegylated interferon) and RBV
      (ribavirin). This is a Phase I, open-label (both participant and investigator know the name
      of the medication given at a certain moment) trial in 28 healthy participants to investigate
      the effect of TMC435 at steady-state on the single dose pharmacokinetics of the
      immunosuppressants cyclosporine and tacrolimus. The trial population will consist of a total
      of 28 healthy participants, equally divided over 2 panels. In Panel 1, each participant will
      receive 2 treatments: a single 100-mg dose of cyclosporine on Day 1 and TMC435 150 mg once
      daily for 10 days on Days 1 to 10, coadministered with a single 100-mg dose of cyclosporine
      on Day 7. In Panel 2, each participant will receive 2 treatments: a single 2-mg dose of
      tacrolimus on Day 1 and TMC435 150 mg each day for 12 days on Days 1 to 12, coadministered
      with a single 2-mg dose of tacrolimus on Day 7. Safety and tolerability will be assessed
      during the study period and during follow up. Blood and urine safety samples,
      electrocardiogram (ECG) and vital signs (blood pressure and heart rate) will be taken at
      screening, Day1, Day 2 (only panel 1), Day 7(only panel 2), Day 8 (only panel 2) and at the
      follow-up visit about 5 to 7 days after last TMC435 intake.
