      diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) or
      radiation-induced heart disease (RIHD), there is little research on the impact on quality of
      life from the limitations imposed with these diagnosis. This study aims to address these
      unknowns in patients with inherited cardiac disease as well as non-inherited
      radiation-induced cardiac disease in first-time patients at the Cleveland Clinic. Knowledge
      gained from this study will provide us the ability for better management of the chronic
      impacts of the disease by identifying potential risk factors of low quality of life or
      changes in quality of life over time.

      This is a prospective, longitudinal, non-comparator, non-randomized survey study describing
      QOL outcomes for patients with HCM, TAA, or RIHD. Patients being seen for the first time at
      the Cleveland Clinic for cardiac disease with no previous or scheduled surgery for HCM or TAA
      will electronically complete a Cardiac Quality of Life Survey at 3 time points (baseline,
      3month & 9 month). The Cardiac Quality of Life Survey measures the participant's health
      status in five domains - global, physical ,emotional, social, and spiritual - as well as
      self-efficacy and resilience.
