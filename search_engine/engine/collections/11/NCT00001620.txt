    
      This protocol is designed for screening of subjects before a decision can be made as to their
      eligibility for one of the active National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) research
      protocols. Its purpose is to allow detailed investigation into the hematologic or oncologic
      problems of these subjects, and the status of other organ systems that would determine their
      ability to safely tolerate specific aspects of active research protocols. It allows
      investigation as to whether a donor is HLA matched, fit to receive G-CSF, and fit to undergo
      apheresis and therefore eligible to participate as a donor on a bone marrow transplant
      protocol. It also allows the investigation as to whether subjects are eligible for
      participation as normal volunteer based on protocol eligibility criteria that requires
      generally good health status by history or physical exam findings, or laboratory assessments.
      After completion of this screening process, the subject will either be offered a chance to
      participate in an active research protocol, or if no appropriate protocol is identified,
      subjects with hematologic or oncologic disease will have recommendations for other treatment
      options relayed to the primary or referring physician.

      Primary objective is to determine subject eligibility for participation on NHLBI protocols.

      Primary endpoint is the results of clinical, imaging and laboratory assessments.
