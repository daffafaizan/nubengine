      screened and randomly divided into control group and experimental group. Control group:
      chemotherapy plus water (at least 3-5 cups per day, 100-120ml per cup), test group:
      chemotherapy plus green tea (patients drink tea from the beginning to the end of the test,
      patients drink moderately concentration of green tea 3-5 cups per day, 100-120ml per cup, and
      the monthly tea consumption is ≥100g. The tea concentration is defined that the amount of tea
      in the cup after boiling water is 50% or more which is "strong tea", 25% to 50% is
      "moderately concentrated tea", and less than 25% is "light tea"). The number of days of tea
      drinking by the patient is greater than or equal to 18 days per chemotherapy cycle.The
      quality of life of patients was assessed according to the Lung Cancer Quality of Life Scale
      (FACT-L (4th Edition)) and the Lung Cancer Symptom Scale (LCSS). Pre-chemotherapy quality of
      life scores were used as baseline. The evaluation was performed once before each
      chemotherapy, and the final quality of life assessment was performed within 1-4 weeks after
      the end of the fourth cycle of chemotherapy. A total of 5 quality of life assessments were
      completed. If the patient's condition progresses during chemotherapy, the assessment endpoint
      is when the disease progresses. Primary endpoint: Assessment of changes in quality of life
      (QOL) after chemotherapy according to FACT-L (4th edition). A clinically significant change
      in the quality of life of lung cancer was defined as a FACT-L score change of ≥6 points from
      baseline, with <6 points defined as no clinically significant changes;
