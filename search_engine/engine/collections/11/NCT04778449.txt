      I. Collect systematic data on mental health, quality of life (QOL), social support, diet, and
      exercise behaviors in melanoma patients.

      II. Examine whether psychosocial factors and lifestyle are associated with clinical outcomes
      in melanoma patients.

      III. Examine the association between lifestyle and psychosocial factors and tissue and blood
      biomarkers in melanoma patients.

      IV. Examine whether psychosocial factors and lifestyle are associated with QOL adjustment in
      melanoma patients.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients complete a maximum of 3 paper or electronic questionnaires over 30 minutes within 2
      weeks of presentation to MD Anderson, new diagnosis of melanoma, and/or initiating a new
      treatment, within 2 weeks of first restaging, and within 2 weeks of the end of treatment.
      Patients may complete an additional paper or electronic dietary questionnaire over 10 minutes
      for 3 days (30 minutes total) or a phone-based dietary recall. Patients who start a new
      treatment of interest may repeat the questionnaires at the same time points. Patients'
      medical records are also reviewed.
