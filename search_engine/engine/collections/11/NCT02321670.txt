      urethroplasty used to treat bulbar urethral strictures. One technique is excision of the
      stricture and end-to-end anastomosis of the urethra. The other technique is an onlay grafting
      procedure with buccal mucosa where the corpus spongiosum is not divided. The study is
      designed to compare complications of sexual and penile function, and is not powered to
      compare the success rates of the two techniques. The primary endpoint will be degree of
      erectile dysfunction and penile complications. The secondary endpoint will be restricturing
      leading to reoperation, and other complications.
