      has not yet been reported whether this difference in effect remains at recovery time after
      anesthesia.

      Several studies have been reported that preoperative heart rate variability predicted the
      occurence of postoperative nausea and vomiting. However, whether the difference in heart rate
      variability after anesthesia is related to the difference in postoperative nausea and
      vomiting has not been studied. Therefore, this study aims to observe whether propofol and
      sevoflurane have differences during recovery period after anesthesia in heart rate
      variabiliy. In addition, we want to examine that these differences during recovery period in
      heart rate variability can predict the occurrence of nausea and vomiting within 24 hours
      after surgery.
