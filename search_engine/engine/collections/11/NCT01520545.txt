    
      This is a prospective 36-month Phase IIIb/IV clinical safety trial that will be conducted at
      clinical trial sites that are experienced with the use of intrathecal baclofen. All patients
      will be entered after signing an IRB approved informed consent. Patients will be followed for
      the duration of their treatment with Gablofen® (baclofen injection) 3 mg/mL using the
      SynchroMed® II Programmable Pump or until the study is terminated. Patients will be evaluated
      for clinical complications associated with the use of intrathecal baclofen that are
      considered signs and symptoms of an inflammatory granuloma, specifically new radicular pain
      at the level of the catheter tip, and/or spinal cord compression. An MRI scan with and
      without infusion will be performed (with consent of the patient) to evaluate the potential
      presence of an inflammatory granuloma if clinical signs exist. Events that may be related to
      an inflammatory granuloma will be classified as a definite granuloma, possible granuloma,
      other catheter related problem (confirmed not caused by a granuloma), or other clinical
      sequelae caused by the underlying disease or other infusion system related event.
