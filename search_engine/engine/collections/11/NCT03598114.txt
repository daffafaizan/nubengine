      benefits over time.

      The project builds upon the empirically-developed Program Sustainability Action Planning
      Model and Training Curricula. The training will incorporate experiential learning methods and
      includes: action planning workshops, development of action plans with measurable objectives
      to foster institutional changes, and technical assistance. The goal is to demonstrate change
      in sustainability outcomes in states who receive the Program Sustainability Action Planning
      Training compared to states that do not. After conclusion of the study, the sustainability
      training curriculum will be disseminated to all participating state TC programs.
      Additionally, the curriculum will be adapted for the use by any public health program in need
      of building sustainability capacity.
