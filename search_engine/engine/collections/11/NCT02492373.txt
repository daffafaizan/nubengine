           with Q-switched Nd:YAG laser was 78.3%.

        -  It has been found that the incidence of PIH decreased to 40% after applied topical high
           potency steroid 2 days after the laser treatment.

        -  By these anti-inflammatory and anti-PIH effects of the high potency steroid, the
           investigators aimed that the application of steroid 2 days before and 2 days after the
           laser treatment would be better reduction in the incidence of PIH after Q-switched
           Nd:YAG laser.
