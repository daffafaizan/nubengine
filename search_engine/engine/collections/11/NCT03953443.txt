      The investigators will prospectively collect 25 pairs of fresh HNSCC tumor-distant normal
      mucosal tissue.

      * Part 2, Retrospective Molecular Epidemiology Study of the Association of miRs with
      Therapeutic Response and Prognosis in HNSCC.

      The investigators will comprehensively test the association between miR expression and miR
      promoter methylation, and the response to therapy and survival in all cases of surgical
      HPV-negative HNSCC at UNMH collected after 1990. Lip and nonkeratinizing nasopharyngeal cases
      will be excluded as these are etiologically distinct and related to cutaneous SCC or to EB
      virus infection, respectively. No cases will be excluded due to gender, age, race or
      ethnicity.
