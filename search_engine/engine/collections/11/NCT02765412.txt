      implementing shared decision making, which incorporates the Decision Precision lung cancer
      screening tool. The investigators will use multi-site, cluster-based randomization to compare
      standard implementation with intensive implementation. Additionally, the investigators will
      determine the factors that were most important for successful implementation of the shared
      decision making tool. Finally, the investigators will have a human subjects research
      component to evaluate the effects of Decision Precision on patient's knowledge of the risks
      and benefits of lung cancer screening, the quality of their decision making, and their
      satisfaction with care.
