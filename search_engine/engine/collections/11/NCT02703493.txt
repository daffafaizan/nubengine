      diagnosed with oropharynx cancer. Tumors which do not contain HPV virus (termed
      "HPV-Negative") are not cured as frequently by radiation therapy. Tumors which do contain HPV
      in patients who have a history of cigarette smoking also are not cured as frequently by
      radiation.

      One way to potentially overcome this challenge is to deliver a more intense dose of radiation
      treatment to the tumor. The standard way to deliver radiation, termed Intensity Modulated
      Radiotherapy (IMRT), can protect normal tissues near tumors to a certain degree but not
      completely. Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is a technique which can deliver radiation more
      precisely.

      This trial will test the safety of treating HPV-unassociated oropharynx tumors to higher
      radiation doses wth SRS (termed a "boost") after a standard course of IMRT has been given. In
      addition, the investigators will look at whether magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning
      can detect treatment response in oropharynx tumors earlier than with standard tests.
