      antibiotic dose is required through the patient's venous injection. In this trial, patients
      with arbapenem-resistant gram negative bacteria pneumonia (CRGNB)were assigned to adjunct
      aerosolized colistin delivered by a jet nebulizer or a vibrating mesh nebulizer comparing to
      or standard intravenous injection by a randomizing protocol.

      Need for a systemic antibiotic was determined by the clinical physician. Comparisons were
      made between standard care and study drug for their effects on bacteria eradiation, incidence
      of nephrotoxicity, and oxygenation.
