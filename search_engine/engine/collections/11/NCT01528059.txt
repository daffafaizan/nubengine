      Additionally, it is associated with increased risk for cardiovascular events and diseases.
      Surgical intervention with gastric bypass has been shown to attenuate glycemic levels in
      obese patient comorbid with type 2 diabetes. However, since gastric bypass is not a standard
      procedure, surgical protocol including stomach and small intestine reconstruction may be
      varied. The investigators and others have found that stomach and small intestine
      reconstruction may affect the efficacy of diabetic treatment. In this study, the
      investigators will compare the efficacy of Billroth II and Roux en Y reconstruction on
      glycemic control in stomach cancer patients with type 2 diabetes. Both Billroth II and Roux
      en Y are used in stomach-small intestine reconstruction after subtotal gastrectomy. No
      differences in postoperative outcomes and quality of life have been reported in Billroth II
      and Roux en Y reconstruction.
