      I. To test the ability of clofarabine + ara-C (cytarabine) to eliminate minimal residual
      (MRD) in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients whose bone marrows exhibit complete remission
      by morphology.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the duration of complete remission after this treatment to minimize MRD.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) once daily (QD) on days 1-5 and
      clofarabine intravenously (IV) over 1 hour and cytarabine IV on days 2-5. Beginning
      approximately 1 month later, patients may receive one additional course of treatment in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years, and
      then annually for 3 years.
