      Approximately 8 licensed childcare centres will be randomly selected from an online listing
      of centres in London, Canada. Since it is necessary to implement the policy at the
      centre-level to groups of children, the childcare centres (i.e., the clusters) rather than
      the individual participants, will be randomly allocated to either implement the physical
      activity policy (experimental; n = 4), or maintain their daily programming (control; n = 4)
      for the 8-week intervention period.

      In both groups, toddlers' and preschoolers' physical activity will be objectively measured
      using motion sensors (ActiGraph wGT3X-BT accelerometers) worn on an elastic waistband for 5
      consecutive days, during childcare hours, before the policy is implemented (baseline; week 0;
      September 2018), mid-intervention (week 4; October 2018), one week after the intervention
      period ends (post-intervention; week 9; November/December 2018), and 6-months
      post-intervention (May-June 2019).

      The aim of the study is to examine the impact of a childcare physical activity policy on the
      objectively measured physical activity levels (light physical activity, LPA;
      moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, MVPA), and combined total physical activity (TPA),
      and sedentary time of young children in childcare centres compared to children from centres
      that maintain their usual standard of care.
