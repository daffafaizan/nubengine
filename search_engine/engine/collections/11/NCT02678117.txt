      with antinociceptive effects.

      Gabapentin is an alkylated analogue of gammaaminobutyric acid (GABA) developed primarily as
      an anticonvulsant drug. It was described as an analgesic drug for the treatment of
      neuropathic pain in the 1990s. Although it is named Gabapentin,it does not bind at the GABA A
      or GABA B receptor. It binds with high affinity for the α2δ subunit of the presynaptic
      voltage-gated calcium channels, which reduce calcium-dependent release of pro-nociceptive
      neurotransmitters in the pain pathways. Pregabalin is a structural analogue of GABA was
      introduced after Gabapentin. If we used these drugs in combination to opioids preoperatively
      as preventive analgesia may decrease postoperative opioid consumption and pain intensity.
