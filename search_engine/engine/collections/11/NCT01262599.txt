      similar manner. The entire unilateral rectus abdominis muscle will be harvested with
      fascial-sparing as part of the pedicled TRAM flap. The flap will be shaped and sutured to the
      chest site, and the abdominal fascial defect will be closed primarily, followed by a
      polypropylene mesh overlay. Two 10 mm Jackson-Pratt (JP) drains will be placed in the flap
      wound, and two JPs will be placed in the abdominal wound. Immediately after transfer of the
      extubated patient to the recovery room bed, study devices will be placed on the reconstructed
      breast and abdominal donor sites, and activated. In the treatment arm, the PEMF signal is
      automatically delivered every two hours for fifteen minutes while the patient is in the
      hospital.
