      radiculopathy due to nerve root compression. Knowledge about the association between changes
      in the experience of pain and changes measures of pain modulation is to our knowledge
      limited. The results could potentially contribute to knowledge about mechanisms involved in
      lumbar radiculopathy and facilitate future studies. The hypotheses of the study are: 1)
      Measures of pain modulation will be less efficient among patients with lumbar radiculopathy
      showing reduced pain inhibition and facilitated temporal summation compared to healthy
      controls. 2) Improvements in pain modulation will be associated with improvements in clinical
      pain outcomes
