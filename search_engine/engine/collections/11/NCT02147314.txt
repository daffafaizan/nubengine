      intended users, as well as other aspects to support lay use, such as labeling assessment and
      usability. The company is presenting diabetics who monitor their blood glucose with new
      technological innovations aimed at improving their daily lives (e.g., a unique blood glucose
      monitor, Web Portal applications and "smart phone" applications).

      Each subject selected for the comparison evaluation will perform their own fingerstick and
      test on their subject device following device instructions. A trained technician will perform
      a fingerstick on the subject immediately after and perform the test on the same device.
      Separate results will be recorded by subject and technician. A trained technician will take
      another blood sample, within as short of a time as practicable, for a glucose assay on the
      YSI 2300 Stat Plus Glucose Analyzer.
