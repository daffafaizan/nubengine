      metals in drinking water, soil and dust. Exposure to these metals, principally uranium and
      arsenic, and metal mixtures is associated with dysregulation of immune function and other
      health effects. The objective of this study is to conduct an intervention trial to assess the
      effect of dietary zinc supplementation to mitigate the toxicity of metal exposures. The
      current project is part of a larger research effort funded by the NIH Superfund Program to
      study environmental metals exposures in tribal communities in New Mexico.
