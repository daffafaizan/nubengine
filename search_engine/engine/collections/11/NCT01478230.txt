      immediately before administration at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11 hours. Thereafter
      samples will be drawn at 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 45, and 60 minutes after the 11-hour
      administration. Easiness of use will be rated using an 8-grade ordered category scale at 10
      minutes after the start of administrations at 3, 6, and 9 hours. Overall liking will be rated
      using an 8-grade ordered category scale at 12 hours. Urges to smoke will be rated on a
      4-grade ordered category scale immediately before and at 15 minutes after the first
      administration, and as well as before and 15 minutes after the start of administrations at 3,
      6, and 9 hours, and at 12 hours. Used cartridges will be collected. Pooled samples per
      subject and treatment will be analyzed to determine the amount of remaining nicotine.
      Tolerability of the treatments will be evaluated in terms of reported and observed adverse
      events (AE).

      Since the primary objective is to compare steady-state nicotine pharmacokinetics of N1/3-I5
      with that of Nicotine Inhaler 10 mg, this study will have a multiple-dose setting. A
      crossover design has been chosen for this study in order to allow within-subject comparisons
      of treatments. Healthy habituated adults smoking at least 10 cigarettes daily for at least
      one year preceding inclusion will be included in the study, since they are expected to
      tolerate the doses of nicotine that will be administered.
