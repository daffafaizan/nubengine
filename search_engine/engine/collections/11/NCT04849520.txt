    
      This is a prospective randomized controlled trial comparing two oxygenation methods for
      prolongation of apnea time in children aged 0 to 10 years old.

      This study measures time for the pulse oximetry drop from 100% to 92% after oxygenation with
      100% oxygen, applying high flow nasal cannula or buccal oxygen insufflation via an oral
      Ring-Adair-Elwyn endotracheal tube connected to oxygen.
