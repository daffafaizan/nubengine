      reduce multiple causes of disease. Since smoking has 9% contributions on the leading global
      risk towards mortality in the world and this risk factor has resulted in multiple causes of
      disease for example, lung cancer, heart disease, stroke, chronic respiratory disease and
      other conditions therefore by quantifying the impact of this risk factors on diseases, may
      help to decrease the number of burden disease that is caused by smoking. University students
      age of 18 -24 are among the group of age that has the highest prevalence on smoking, thus it
      is necessary to targeting the high-risk people, who are most likely to benefit from the
      intervention. Population-based strategies seek to change the social norm by encouraging an
      increase in healthy behavior and a reduction in health risk. University students are in
      transition between the adolescence and early adulthood and developed unhealthy behaviors like
      cigarette smoking
