    
      It is the intention of this protocol to study, in a controlled manner, the response of
      fingers of patients with Raynaud's phenomenon to two dosage strengths of a fast acting
      topical formulation of Nitroglycerin, MQX-503. Patients may have moderate to severe primary
      Raynaud's phenomenon or Raynaud's phenomenon secondary to autoimmune diseases such as
      scleroderma.

      Quantitative changes in blood flow in the fingers of the non-dominant hand will be measured
      after the clinical induction of constriction of blood vessels by exposure to local cold
      temperatures. Secondarily, the quantitative reduction in skin temperature recovery time and
      symptoms of pain, tingling and numbness associated with Raynaud's phenomenon will be
      evaluated using a patient hand symptom analog assessment score. The frequency and severity of
      adverse events associated with MQX-503 will be assessed.
