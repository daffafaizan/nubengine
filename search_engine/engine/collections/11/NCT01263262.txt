      is a difference in the incidence of corneal toxicity and/or ototoxicity in study subjects
      undergoing Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS) on the face if a povidone-iodine preparation is
      used pre-operatively as compared to a chlorhexidine-alcohol preparation. It has recently been
      found that the use of a chlorhexidine-alcohol preparation is superior to the use of a
      povidone-iodine preparation in preventing post-operative surgical-site infections (SSI) in
      patients undergoing clean-contaminated surgery. However, the use of chlorhexidine on the face
      has previously been associated with corneal toxicity and ototoxicity. This study will help to
      further define previously reported risks of corneal toxicity and ototoxicity associated with
      the use of a chlorhexidine solution on the face.
