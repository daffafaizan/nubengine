      the ventilatory efficacy of the Life2000 Ventilation System, as compared to a control group.
      Other important secondary endpoints as listed in this document will also be measured and
      reported. Prospective participants are all current participants in the ongoing CATCH program
      study. Subjects will be randomized to either continued monitoring alone or monitoring with
      the use of the Life2000 Ventilation System for a period of six months.

      Initial BODE Index (BMI, airway Obstruction, Dyspnea, Exercise intolerance), CO2 (carbon
      dioxide) measurements, and questionnaires and surveys are captured prior to therapy
      initiation. Thereafter, subjects will be randomly assigned to the Life2000 Ventilation System
      or their routine plan of care, as determined previously by the CATCH program, and followed
      for a period of six months. Both end tidal CO2 readings and the Physical Activity Scale for
      the Elderly (PASE) results will be captured at pre-assigned intervals during the study.
      Monthly phone assessments will be conducted with the subjects to track progress. An
      additional BODE Index measurement will be taken at Day 90, the study mid-point. At the end of
      six months, all baseline procedures and questionnaires will be repeated and the subject will
      be discharged from the study.
