      common symptom of Acute Myocardial Infarction, which is the main cause of death in Brazil and
      worldwide. Although most patients with chest pain do not have a final diagnosis of AMI, they
      remain under observation until the diagnosis of AMI is excluded. The most current strategy
      recommended for rapid AMI exclusion uses high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T at time zero and
      one hour later. However, some points that have not yet been properly evaluated in previous
      studies can be evaluated in the current study:

        -  Evaluation of the early exclusion protocol (0 -1 hour) in a Brazilian population

        -  Evaluation of the early exclusion protocol (0 -1 hour) in isolation and associated with
           traditional risk scores (TIMI, GRACE, HEART and EDACS)

        -  Systematic evaluation of the early exclusion protocol (0 -1 hour) in patients without
           chest pain but with a pre-defined condition of suspected AMI.
