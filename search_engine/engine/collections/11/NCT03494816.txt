    
      NAXIVA is a single arm, single agent, open label, phase II feasibility study of axitinib in
      patients with both metastatic and non-metastatic renal cell carcinoma of clear cell
      histology. 20 patients will be recruited from multiple centres within the United Kingdom.

      Patients who have signed informed consent and who have met all eligibility criteria will be
      registered into the trial.

      The starting dose of axitinib will be 5mg BID and escalated to 7mg BID and then 10mg BID. A
      dose modification assessment will take place every 2 weeks in clinic during the 8 week
      pre-surgical treatment period and will be dependent on tolerability of treatment. Patients
      will follow an aggressive axitinib dose escalation process within the 8 week period to a
      maximum of 10mg BID. Patients should stop axitinib a minimum of 36 hours and a maximum of 7
      days prior to surgery in week 9.

      Blood, urine and tissue samples will be taken prior to and during therapy to evaluate
      biomarkers of treatment response. Nephrectomy and IVC tumour thrombectomy will be planned for
      all patients on the trial.

      Response to axitinib in VTT, primary tumour and any RECIST measureable lesion will be
      correlated with changes in molecular markers.

      Patients will be followed up in clinic at 6 & 12 weeks post surgery.
