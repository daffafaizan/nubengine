      bioavailability is generally low. The majority of plant polyphenols are poorly absorbed in
      the small intestine and enter the colon where the colonic microbiota metabolise them to
      release a range of phenolic acids, which are now thought to be the main bioactive components
      related to the reduction in disease risk. Very little is known about the impact of other
      constituents of the diet on the metabolism and bacterial catabolism of these polyphenols. The
      colonic microbiota are key agents in the release of the bioactive molecules from polyphenols
      but also ferment non-digestible carbohydrates (NDC) such as dietary fibre to short chain
      fatty acids. It is likely that there are key interactions in the colonic bacteria metabolism
      of fibre and phenolics. We hypothesize that combination of polyphenolics and non-digestible
      carbohydrates (NDC) will increase the urinary output of bioactive phenolic acids.

      This study will enable a better understanding of how to deliver combinations of ingredients
      and nutrients to achieve maximum nutritional value and health benefits.
