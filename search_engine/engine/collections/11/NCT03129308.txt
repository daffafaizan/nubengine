      blistering disease (AIBD) in HIV infected patients. Various case reports have been published,
      though the overall frequency appears to be low. The aim of this project is to investigate the
      frequency of various autoantibodies specific for various AIBD such as bullous pemphigoid,
      epidermolysis bullosa acquisita and paraneoplastic pemphigus using commercially available
      ELISA (BPAG1/2, desmoglein 1/3, collagen type VII, envoplakin) as well as indirect
      immunofluorescence. The knowledge of the frequency of these auto-antibodies in HIV infected
      patients may elucidate their clinical significance and also help in the diagnosis of AIBD in
      HIV infected patients.

      In this cross sectional study all HIV infected patients at the HIV outpatient clinic (4-SÃ¼d)
      of the Department of Dermatology of Vienna's Medical University will be asked to participate
      in this study. Currently, the cohort includes approx. 1400 HIV infected patients and it is
      assumed that at least 600 patients will take part. In addition, it is intended to recruit 300
      HIV negative patients who wish to get tested for HIV or require counselling for post-exposure
      prophylaxis. After receiving the informed consent, 4.5ml of blood will be collected during a
      routine medical check-up and the aforementioned tests performed.

      The primary outcome is the prevalence of BPAG1/2 in HIV infected patients in comparison to
      uninfected, age matched controls. BPAG1/2 has been chosen as the primary end point given that
      bullous pemphigoid has the highest frequency among all AIBD. Secondary outcome measure will
      encompass the prevalence of auto antibodies against desmoglein1/3, collagen type VII,
      envoplakin as well as results from indirect immunofluorescence studies.
