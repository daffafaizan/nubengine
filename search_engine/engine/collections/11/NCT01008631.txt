      One application will be given immediately before a dialysis session and the second dose will
      be given after the consecutive dialysis session.

      In healthy volunteers sodium thiosulfate will be given only once. In both groups, dialysis
      patients and healthy volunteers, blood and urinary/dialysate samples will be collected at
      defined time points.
