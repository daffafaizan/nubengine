      adjuvant QS21 in patients with advanced pancreatic or colorectal adenocarcinoma. II.
      Determine the immunologic effects of this treatment regimen in these patients. III. Determine
      the antitumor effect of this treatment regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of ras peptide cancer vaccine. Patients receive ras
      peptide cancer vaccine mixed with immunological adjuvant QS21 subcutaneously monthly for 4
      doses, every 2 months for 4 doses, every 4 months for 3 doses, every 6 months for 2 doses,
      and then annually thereafter in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3 to 6
      patients receive escalating doses of ras peptide cancer vaccine until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2
      of 3 or 2 of 4 patients experience dose limiting toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 15-20 patients will be accrued for this study within 30
      months.
