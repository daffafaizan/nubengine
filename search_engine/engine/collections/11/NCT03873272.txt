      the administration of cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents. The incidence of CIPN can vary on
      the type of agent used, the frequency with which it is given, and the cumulative dose.
      Unfortunately, for some patients, symptoms may persist even after discontinuation of the drug
      due to irreversible nerve damage. As of now, there are no established agents for CIPN
      prevention.

      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical selection trial of interventions for CIPN
      in patients treated with docetaxel every 3 weeks or paclitaxel on a weekly schedule. Patients
      will be randomly assigned to receive either frozen gloves and socks, compression gloves and
      socks, or "loose" gloves and socks (placebo arm) during chemotherapy infusion to study the
      best intervention at reducing neuropathic pain.
