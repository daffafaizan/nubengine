      distant metastatic sites. Radiation is delivered to the prostate and seminal vesicles in 5
      treatment sessions (fractions). Doses ranging from 35-45 Gy in 5 fractions have demonstrated
      good outcomes with acceptable toxicity. In this initial study, MRI guided treatment planning
      and delivery will be used to deliver 7 Gy to the entire prostate and seminal vesicles, with a
      selective boost of additional 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, or 2 Gy per fraction for a total dose of 37.5,
      40, 42.5 or 45 Gy to biopsy-proven lesions, defined using MRI.

      Hypothesis: MRI-guided treatment planning and delivery can selectively target high-risk
      prostate nodules and deliver a higher radiation dose, to achieve maximal local control
      without increasing treatment toxicity
