      isometric strength of different muscle groups (1-7). A preliminary pilot study of 32 women in
      2009 showed that DSD may shorten the second stage of labor among nulliparous women (8) by
      increasing the expulsive efforts of the parturient. The study hypothesis was that DSD may
      decrease the length of the second stage of labor and decrease the need for obstetrical
      interventions such as cesarean delivery or operative vaginal delivery.

      The Laboraideâ„¢ is a DSD developed specifically for use during labor. It is an inert device
      located between the jaws and does not interfere with speaking, breathing or any other oral
      activity during labor. It is a single use device, and is not transferred between women. We
      hypothesize that using this device can shorten the second stage of labor and decrease
      obstetrical intervention rate. We will also investigate it's efficiency in pain management.
