      adequate polio immunity in certain immunocompromised populations, such as people with AIDS.
      Also, OPV can mutate and form neurovirulent strains capable of causing polio outbreaks.
      Inactivated polio vaccine (IPV), which cannot mutate into neurovirulent strains and which is
      more effective in populations that have failed to respond to OPV, will be needed globally to
      eradicate polio, but it is unaffordable for many developing countries. Because there are more
      immune cells in the skin than in the muscle, intradermal administration of IPV may be a way
      to increase the efficacy and reduce the dose (and thus the cost) of IPV. We plan to conduct a
      clinical trial randomizing 231 HIV-infected adults to receive a booster of two-fifths dose
      intradermal IPV, one-fifth dose intradermal IPV, full dose intramuscular IPV, or two-fifths
      dose intramuscular IPV. We will measure polio immunity before and after vaccine
      administration. Through this study, we will determine the optimal booster dose of intradermal
      IPV, whether intradermal works better than intramuscular IPV administration, and whether
      intradermal IPV is effective in an immunocompromised population. The data from this trial
      could contribute to global polio eradication.
