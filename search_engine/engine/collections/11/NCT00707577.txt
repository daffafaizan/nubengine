      12 week program and are randomized to a 9 month maintenance program are more likely to
      maintain weight loss, physical activity level, and reduction of other clinical risk factors
      for disease compared to the control group. Secondary objectives are to determine if employees
      who participate in the maintenance intervention have fewer chronic diseases related to
      lifestyle factors and lower health care costs at 3 years.
