      Primary

        -  Determine the antitumor activity of irinotecan and docetaxel, in terms of response rate,
           in patients with refractory metastatic breast cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the toxicity profile of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the progression-free and overall survival of patients treated with this
           regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour followed by irinotecan IV over 1 hour on days 1 and
      8. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients who achieve a complete response (CR) receive 2 additional courses beyond
      CR.

      Patients are followed every 2 months until disease progression and then every 6 months
      thereafter.
