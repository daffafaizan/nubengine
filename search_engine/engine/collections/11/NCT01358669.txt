      to placebo in adults undergoing revision surgery of total hip arthroplasty due to prosthesis
      related osteolysis. A total of 30 subjects will be enrolled into the study. Subjects will be
      randomized to receive either denosumab or placebo. 15 participants will be assigned to each
      treatment arm.

        1. 60mg denosumab by injection as a single dose

        2. Placebo by injection as a single dose After they have given informed consent, all
           participants will have a screening visit (Visit 1). Participants who are eligible after
           completing all screening assessments will be randomly assigned to receive one of the two
           treatments. All screening procedures will be completed within 14 (±7) days before
           beginning the medication. Study medication will be given at visit 2, which will occur 8
           weeks (56 ±7 days) before the date of the planned revision surgery. Participants will
           attend for 5 visits in total as shown below. Visit 1, Baseline, 2 weeks (±7 days)before
           being given the study medication
