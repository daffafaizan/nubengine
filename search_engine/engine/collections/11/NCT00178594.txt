    
      This is an exploratory study involving blood coagulation assays in a select group of
      individuals. The ROTEG is a newly developed coagulation analyzer which allows the continuous
      assessment of whole blood coagulation from the formation of the first fibrin fibers and
      activated platelets, to the formation of a three-dimensional whole blood clot until the
      eventual dissolution of the clot. This device will not be used as a diagnostic or procedure
      tool. No recommendations regarding interpretation of the results or implications for future
      treatment will be provided.
