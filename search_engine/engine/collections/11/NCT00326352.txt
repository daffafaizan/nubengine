      analgesic. We intend to provide sedation with propofol, 0.5 mg/Kg, and analgesia with
      remifentanil 0.5 microgram/Kg for reduction of dislocated shoulders. This will be a
      randomised sex-stratified comparison with current therapy which is midazolam incrementally up
      to a maximum of 0.15 mg/Kg, and morphine incrementally up to 0.15 mg/Kg. The primary outcome
      measure is time to full recovery. Secondary aspects are pain or discomfort during the
      procedure and operating conditions.
