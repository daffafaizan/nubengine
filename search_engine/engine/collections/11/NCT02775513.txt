    
      Loss-of-function mutations in voltage-gated potassium channels cause long QT syndrome (LQTS)
      due to a prolonged cardiac repolarisation phase.

      Voltage-gated potassium (Kv-) channels are known for their relation to malignant cardiac
      arrhythmias, but also play a role in pancreatic alpha- and beta cell hormone secretion, and
      possibly in incretin hormone secretion. We hypothesised that patients with loss-of-function
      mutations also exhibit altered hormone release upon glucose ingestion.
