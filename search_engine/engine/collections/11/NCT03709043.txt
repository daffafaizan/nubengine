    
      This study, entitled "The Harness Study" is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-arm trial
      in which 120 binge drinkers with AUD will be randomly assigned to receive 12 weeks of kudzu
      or placebo, to be taken on an as-needed basis (see Figure 2) with 1- and 3-month
      post-treatment follow-up visits. This efficacy study will enroll sexually active, binge
      drinkers with AUD because they are the most likely population to benefit from this
      intervention by limiting harms associated with heavy alcohol use and decreasing
      alcohol-related sexual risk behaviors. A study clinician will perform the Structured Clinical
      Interview for the DSM-V (SCID) to screen for AUD and determine eligibility. Upon enrollment,
      120 participants will be randomized 1:1 to kudzu extract (2 grams) or placebo for targeted
      administration. Participants will be seen weekly for behavioral surveys, urinalyses, study
      drug dispensing, and alcohol use counseling. Safety laboratory assessment, vital signs, and
      the audio computer assisted survey instrument (ACASI) will be completed monthly. Efficacy,
      tolerability, and acceptability (Specific Aims 1-4) will be assessed upon trial completion as
      measured by number of binge drinking occasions and numbers of drinks on drinking days via
      timeline follow-back at weekly visits; number of EtG-positive urine samples; sexual risk
      behavior data through monthly surveys via ACASI; frequency of adverse events; and cumulative
      medication adherence data at week 12. Durability of intervention effects will be evaluated at
      1- and 3-month post-treatment visits.
