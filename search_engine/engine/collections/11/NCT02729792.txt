      using focused magnetic field pulses to stimulate brain regions involved in emotion
      regulation, safely and non-invasively. Though rTMS is often effective where medications or
      therapy fail, it requires a series of lengthy (~30-40 min) treatment sessions. A new form of
      rTMS called theta burst stimulation (TBS) has been shown to have greater effects on neural
      activity than conventional stimulation, despite requiring as little as 40 s of stimulation.
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and tolerability of an accelerated TBS
      protocol, administered 2 times a day in patients with TRD. In addition, the investigators aim
      to identify candidate biomarkers from a multimodal suite of neuroimaging, neurophysiologic
      and molecular measures that are predictors and correlates of response to rTMS treatment.
