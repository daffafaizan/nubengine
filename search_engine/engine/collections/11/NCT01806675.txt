      • Evaluate 18F-FPPRGD2 and 18F-FDG as PET/CT or PET/MRI radiotracers for imaging prediction
      and assessment of response to anti-angiogenesis therapy in participants with glioblastoma
      multiforme (GBM), gynecological cancers, and renal cell carcinoma (RCC).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE

      • Progression-free survival (PFS) at up to 1 year after initial scans and treatment

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo 18F-FPPRGD2 and 18F-FDG PET/CT or PET/MRI medical imaging at baseline and at
      regular medical care follow-up (6 to 12 weeks).

      After completion of study imaging, patients are followed up at 12 months.
