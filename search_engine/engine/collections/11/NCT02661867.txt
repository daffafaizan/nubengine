      include pelvic organ prolapse (POP), urinary incontinence (UI), and fecal incontinence (FI).
      The prevalence of these conditions increases with age, but in general, PFD affect 20-50 % of
      women throughout their lives. Thus, PFD are common and have significant societal impact.
      Another important PFD risk factor is childbearing. Specifically, these disorders are more
      common among multiparas. Vaginal delivery (VD) has been considered the main contributing
      factor because of pelvic floor muscle, fascia, and nerves damage.
