      and viable in lymphoma.

      The investigators hypothesize that the novel immune platform of pembrolizumab and
      lenalidomide, will be safe and well tolerated in patients with Relapsed Refractory (RR)
      Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and that this combination will result in
      a complete response (CR) rate of 50% in patients with RR HL.
