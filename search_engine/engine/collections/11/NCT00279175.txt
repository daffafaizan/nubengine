    
      -  The study is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, multicenter trial.

        -  Patients after an acute myocardial infarction, undergoing successful reperfusion therapy
           are included.

        -  All patients undergo bone marrow aspiration 3 to 6 days after the infarction.

        -  After cell processing, enriched bone marrow-derived progenitor cells or placebo medium
           is infused direct into the infarct related artery during stop-flow. In addition, a left
           ventricular angiography is performed.

        -  After 4 months left ventricular angiography is repeated. The primary endpoint is the
           difference in change of left ventricular ejection fraction between the two groups.
