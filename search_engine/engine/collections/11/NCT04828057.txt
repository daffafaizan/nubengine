      controlling ocular hypertension, as measured by mean change in intra-ocular pressure (IOP)
      from baseline to after 6 months of treatment from initiation, in patients with open angle
      glaucoma (OAG) or ocular hypertension (OHT), who do not respond sufficiently to initial
      topical treatment, in routine clinical practice.

      This study will include adults with open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension, who received
      their first Tafluprost / Timolol prescription at baseline, even if Tafluprost / Timolol was
      not continued after the first prescription. In addition, patients must have their IOP
      recorded within 7 days before their first prescription of Tafluprost / Timolol, in order to
      be eligible for this study. Only those who provide informed consent will be included.

      At the time of a scheduled clinic visit, eligible patients will be invited to participate in
      the study and willing patients will be requested to sign an informed consent form. Once
      informed consent is obtained, the patient is included in the study and relevant data will be
      recorded during routine clinical visits. Participation in this study is entirely voluntary;
      any patient may withdraw consent to participate in this study at any time. The withdrawn
      patient's data will not be analyzed in this study and the number of patients who withdrew
      consent will appear in the final study report.
