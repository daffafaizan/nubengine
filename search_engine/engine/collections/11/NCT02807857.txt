      patients was performed by General Practitioners in collaboration with cardiologists
      (specialists). Previous studies had shown that many patients suffering from CHF do not
      receive optimal pharmacological and/or device treatment for their disease. An increase in
      natriuretic peptides (BNP, NT-proBNP) was associated with increased risk of cardiovascular
      events in heart failure patients. The purpose of the present study was to assess if a
      referral of clinical stable chronic heart failure patients with reduced ventricular ejection
      fraction (EF < or = 40%) and NT-proBNP level > or = 600 pg/mL to a specialist (cardiologist)
      led to treatment optimization, defined as adherence to the treatment recommendations
      according to the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines. In addition, data obtained
      in this study was used to describe demographic, clinical (including NT-proBNP levels) and
      treatment characteristics of CHF patients who were managed in the primary care setting across
      Europe..
