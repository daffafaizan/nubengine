      supplementation added to a proven CVD reduction program for moderate risk South Asians who do
      not meet guideline-based criteria (2018 ACC/AHA Lipid Guidelines) for medical lowering of
      their LDL-C with an HMG CoA reductase inhibitor (statin) drug, and they are recommended to
      improve their lipid-risk profile through diet and exercise primarily.
