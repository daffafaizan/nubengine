      sites including Thomas Street Health Center and North West Clinic (Harris Health System), and
      the Michael E. DeBakey Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Houston, Texas. After obtaining
      written informed consent, the investigators randomly assigned patients to either a single
      intramuscular injection of 2.4 million units of BPG (standard therapy) or three doses
      (enhanced therapy) of intramuscular BPG administered weekly (a total of 7.2 million units).

      Patients were eligible for inclusion in the study if they were 18 years of age or older and
      had a diagnosis of HIV. The diagnosis of syphilis was made based on a positive Rapid Plasma
      Reagin (RPR) and treponema pallidum particle agglutination tests. Patients with primary,
      secondary and early latent syphilis were included.

      Exclusion criteria were history of penicillin allergy, diagnosis of late latent syphilis,
      neurosyphilis, and antibiotic use with significant activity against Treponema pallidum within
      the preceding two weeks.

      Follow-up period was 12 months. Serum samples were obtained at initial visit and follow-up
      visits every 3 months for serological testing for syphilis. Treatment success was defined as
      a decrease in RPR titer of >= 2 dilutions (4-fold) from the initial RPR titer during the
      follow-up period.

      Both intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses were performed
