      relevant health information back to the treating clinician and the user. The monitoring
      system remotely monitors electrocardiographic (ECG) signals, heart rate, breathing rate, and
      activity levels. Additional devices will be integrated with the monitoring device to assess
      blood pressure and weight.

      Health Coaching involves a team of health care professionals including a registered nurse
      (RN). The health care team creates a plan specific to the patient and provides guidance on
      nutrition' medications, and exercise. The data collected by the remote monitoring device will
      assist the care team in patient management.
