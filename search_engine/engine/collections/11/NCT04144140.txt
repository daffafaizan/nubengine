      Escalation Part, E7766 will be administered intratumorally in participants with advanced
      solid tumors or lymphomas to assess safety/tolerability profile of E7766 and to determine the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of E7766. In the Dose
      Expansion Part, E7766 at RP2D will be administered to participants with melanoma, head and
      neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and/or other tumors
      including lymphomas to confirm safety and assess preliminary clinical activity of E7766 as a
      single agent. Clinical activity will be evaluated by objective response rate (ORR), duration
      of response (DOR), and disease control rate (DCR) on treatment with E7766.
