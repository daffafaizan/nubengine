      the most common procedures in the population. Learning about how often these surgeries are
      performed can give indications of whether the treatment of arthritis and other
      musculoskeletal conditions has been improving over time. Learning about the complications
      associated with these surgeries can give indications about ways to alter the care of patients
      before and after surgeries that may decrease the risk of complications and improve patient
      outcomes. We will analyze Medicare and Medicaid data from 1999 to 2015 to examine a series of
      questions, including whether the use of joint replacement surgery has changed over time among
      patients with rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis, to see if rheumatoid arthritis
      medications are associated with some types of surgical complications, to see if
      anticoagulation medication after joint replacement is associated with the risk of
      complications, to see if regional differences in surgery rates can be explained by
      differences in patient characteristics, and to determine the surgical treatment for hip
      fractures that is associated with the fewest long-term complications. From the Framingham
      Heart Study Cohort, we will study the changes in the incidence of hip fractures and the risk
      factors for osteoporosis over time.
