    
      The current study is a Phase I, open-label, multi-center, dose escalation study designed to
      evaluate safety, immunogencity, and potential anti-tumor activity of BB-MPI-03 at three
      peptide plus adjuvant dose levels. Subjects with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), multiple
      myeloma (MM), smoldering multiple myeloma (sMM), or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) who are
      off treatment and with stable disease or better or who are not eligible for or refuse
      allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) are to be enrolled. The study will
      be conducted at 2 to 4 study centers in the United States (US).

      The study employs a sequential group, open-label, 3+3 dose- escalation design to determine
      the safety and MTD of BB- MPI-03.
