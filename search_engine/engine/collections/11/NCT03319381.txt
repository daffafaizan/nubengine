      via the resuscitation room with need for intensive care treatment after the resuscitation
      room phase were included and compared before the implementation of the new SOPs (between 1
      January, 2000 and 31 December, 2006) and after their implementation in 2009 (between 1
      January, 2010 and 31 December, 2012) of our level-I trauma centre.
