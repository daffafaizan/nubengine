    
      Patients not receiving any insulin treatment with an HbA1c â‰¥ 7.5% before their scheduled
      primary care appointment will be invited to participate in the study and wear professional
      CGM for at least 3 days at either 3 intervals (baseline, 3-month and 6-month) or 2 intervals
      (baseline and 6-month). After removal, the downloaded report will provide quantitative data
      to determine the percent of time spent in the target range. The 6-month data will be analyzed
      to determine if frequency of professional CGM wear positively affects time spent in target
      range.
