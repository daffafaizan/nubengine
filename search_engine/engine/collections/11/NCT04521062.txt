      induction of labor at 39 weeks was associated with a decreased risk for hypertensive
      disorders of pregnancy and decreased risk for cesarean without any increased risk for severe
      neonatal complications or perinatal death. (1) Based on the results of this trial, hospitals
      have been questioning the feasibility of implementing a protocol which offers induction of
      labor to low risk women at ≥39 weeks. There are concerns regarding the ability of a busy
      labor and delivery to accommodate women presenting for inductions with an unfavorable cervix.
      Outpatient mechanical cervical ripening would allow for women to start the process of
      induction of labor at home. This is appealing because cervical ripening is typically the
      longest component of the induction process. Mechanical cervical ripening is the process by
      which balloons or dilators are placed into the cervix.

      There is lack of evidence on Dilapan-S® as an outpatient method of cervical ripening despite
      the potential benefits of increased maternal satisfaction and decreased length of hospital
      stay. With this in mind we propose a preliminary study of 40 women to assess for feasibility
      of performing a large randomized control trial and assess safety with outpatient treatment.
      This initial study is intended to assess the feasibility of outpatient cervical ripening,
      next day induction of labor, and safety. After completion of this feasibility study, the
      investigators plan to initiate a randomized control trial to assess the efficacy of
      outpatient Dilapan-S® for mechanical cervical ripening.
