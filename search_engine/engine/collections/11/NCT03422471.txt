      center for performance of study procedures. On Day 1, two hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemic (50
      mg/dl) clamps are performed - an AM clamp from about 9 to 11 am and a PM clamp from about 1
      to 3 pm.. Modified Oxford procedures are performed in duplicate at five time points -- before
      the AM clamp, during the AM clamp, before the PM clamp, during the PM clamp, and the morning
      of Day 2 (about 16 hrs after completion of the the PM clamp). The Modified Oxford procedure
      involves the sequential intravenous administration of nitroprusside and phenylephrine with
      assessment of blood pressure and heart rate by finapress. Baroreflex sensitivity is the
      relationship of changes in heart rate to changes in blood pressure. .
