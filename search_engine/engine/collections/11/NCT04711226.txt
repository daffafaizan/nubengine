      immunomodulation regimen in adult patients with T1D undergoing an islet cell transplant. This
      study will also provide valuable data with respect to its potential additional uses in
      autoimmunity and solid organ transplant. This is a single arm open-label study and up to 6
      participants will be recruited at a single center in Canada.

      The objectives include:

        -  To assess the safety and tolerability of immunomodulation with AT-1501, in combination
           (AT+) with rabbit anti-thymoglobulin (ATG), etanercept and mycophenolate mofetil
           (MMF/EC-MPS) in adults with T1D undergoing islet cell transplant.

        -  To assess the efficacy of immunomodulation with AT-1501 in adults with T1D undergoing
           islet cell transplant.

      The duration of treatment may vary from participant to participant and could be up to 20
      months. Participants may receive up to 2 islet cell transplants.
