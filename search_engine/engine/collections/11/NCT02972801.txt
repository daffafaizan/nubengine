      survivors and other patients that receive gonadotoxic therapies (e.g., prior to bone marrow
      transplantation). Semen cryopreservation is an established fertility preserving therapy, but
      is not accessible or appropriate for all men. Currently there are no therapies to preserve
      the future fertility of preadolescent boys. However, new reproductive therapies are under
      development and may one day offer "fertile hope" to those survivors that do not currently
      have access to fertility preserving therapies. Clinical management of fertility threatening
      diseases and treatments must have foresight of the gonadotoxic side effects and the potential
      for infertility. When no established fertility sparing options are available, it is
      reasonable to offer harvesting and cryopreservation of testicular tissue as a possible means
      of fertility preservation.

      This study will harvest testicular tissue from eligible patients. Separate portions of the
      harvested tissue and/or cells will be 1) designated for research and 2) cryopreserved and
      maintained for participating patients as a resource for future elective procedures to attempt
      fertility restoration.
