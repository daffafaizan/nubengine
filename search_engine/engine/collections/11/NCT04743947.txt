      respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2) have an increased risk to develop a more severe
      course of disease or die from COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019). SARS-CoV-2 vaccination can
      increase protection against COVID-19. Kidney transplant patients and patients requiring
      dialysis suffer from an acquired immune deficiency. Due to the dysfunctional immune response,
      the general vaccine response in dialysis patients and kidney transplant patients is in many
      cases insufficient.

      Until now, the vaccination response in dialysis patients and kidney-transplanted patients is
      unpredictable. Verification of vaccine response can provide important information on how to
      treat and protect these patients from a COVID-19. Therefore, there is a medical need to
      monitor vaccine protection after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in clinical practice. In this
      observational study, data of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccination response collected in clinical
      routine will be analyzed from these patients. Based on this observational study, the
      investigators aim to get first evidence whether and to what extent vaccination against
      COVID-19 causes a vaccine response in immunocompromised patients with kidney disease.
