      technology in treatment of OVCF with IVC. Forty cases of OVCF with IVC undergoing PKP were
      randomized into a MR technology assisted group (group A) and a traditional C-arm fluoroscopy
      group (group B). Both groups were performed PKP and evaluated by VAS scores, ODI scores,
      radiological evidence of vertebral body height and kyphotic angle(KA) at pre-operation and
      post-operation. The volume of injected cement and Operation time was recorded. And whether
      cement touching both endplates or not(non-PMMA-endplates-contact, NPEC) in radiological
      evidence were also recorded postoperatively. The clinical outcomes and complications were
      evaluated afterwards. All patients received 10 to 14 months' follow-up, with an average of 12
      months.
