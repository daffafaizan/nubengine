      I. To estimate clinical response rate (RR) at 3 and 6 months. II. To estimate Grade 2-4
      -infusion-related toxicity.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate laboratory parameters and correlate with clinical response including: antibody
      dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity and effector cell phenotype analysis at baseline, 4
      weeks and three months.

      II. To evaluate laboratory parameters and correlate with clinical response including: soluble
      cluster of differentiation (CD)20 fragments or CD20-containing membrane fragments at
      baseline, 4 weeks, and 3 months.

      III. To evaluate laboratory parameters and correlate with clinical response including:
      phenotype analysis of CD16 and CD32 on natural killer (NK) cells.

      IV. To evaluate laboratory parameters and correlate with clinical response including:
      rituximab pharmacokinetic studies at baseline, 4 weeks and 3 months.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive dexamethasone intravenously (IV) and rituximab IV once weekly. Treatment
      continues for 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3 and 6 months.
