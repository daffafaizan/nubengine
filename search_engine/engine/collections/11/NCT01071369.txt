    
      This is a Single-center, prospective, controlled, double-blind, randomized study in thoracic
      and cervical regions.

      Patients are studied in 2 groups in each region.

        -  Group I-local anesthetic only.

        -  Group II-local anesthetic with 6 mg of non-particulate Celestone.

      All patients will be unblinded at 12 or 24 months. Non-responsive patients will be unblinded
      after 3 months and will be crossed over to a different group, if patient consents.
      Non-responsive patients may be unblinded and withdrawn from the study at any time.
