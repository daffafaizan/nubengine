    
      Project Aim 1: Develop, field test, and further refine an Internet-based Wellness Portal for
      use by patients seen in primary care settings to facilitate patient-centered, preventive
      care.

      Specific Objectives:

        -  Assemble an Advisory Committee of clinicians, office staff, patients, and national HIT
           experts and develop a patient Wellness Portal that can be accessed by patients through
           the Internet and also in the provider's office via computer kiosks;

        -  Field test the Wellness Portal in two OKPRN practices and collect patient and provider
           satisfaction data via surveys and personal feedback to improve and refine the Wellness
           Portal and its integration into the comprehensive care delivery process.

      Project Aim 2: Determine the impact of the Wellness Portal on the process of patient-centered
      preventive care by examining the experience of patients and providers with care and
      individualization of recommended services.

      Specific Objectives:

        -  Assess the impact of the Wellness Portal on patient-centered care:

             1. Assess the impact of the Wellness Portal on patient activation and the medical
                home;

             2. Understand the impact of Wellness Portal use, the role of activated patients, and
                the concept of medical home on the provision of patient-centered care;

             3. Measure the impact of the Wellness Portal on the individualization of preventive
                services that are recommended and delivered based upon individual risk factors and
                patient preferences;

        -  Describe utilization and implementation of the Wellness Portal, capture and analyze
           documented decisions on opting out from evidence-based recommendations, and assess the
           impact of the portal on missed opportunities for delivering preventive care.
