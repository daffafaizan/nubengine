      transplantation (HTx) or, in some cases, to recovery of the ventricular function has
      increased and, during the same time, the duration of the implantation period has lengthened
      dramatically. When removing VADs after a long period, surgeons face severe pericardial
      adhesions at the mediastinum level and of the surrounding tissue due to the inflammatory
      response. During resternotomy, dissection of these adhesions increases surgical time and can
      be a source of lesions on the cardiac or vascular structures and of severe bleeding at the
      moment of transplantation or when the device is removed.

      Many products have been used to prevent or reduce adhesions but an ideal antiadhesive
      treatment has remained elusive. CoSealÂ®, a licensed synthetic hydrogel (Baxter, USA) has been
      shown to reduce pericardial adhesions in a limited series of reoperations.
