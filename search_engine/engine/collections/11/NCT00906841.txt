    
      Initial treatment: 6 courses of CHOP-R 14 with evaluation of response before C4 (observation
      of no change or progression at this time will get the patient off study).

      Consolidation : fractionated RIT (8 weeks after the end of R-CHOP: 2 injections of 15 mCi/m2
      of 90Y-DOTA-hLL2 and hLL2 at day 1 and day 8).
