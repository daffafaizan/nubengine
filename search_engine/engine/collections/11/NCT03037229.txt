    
      The primary objective of this study is to determine if the Smartphone electrocardiogram (ECG)
      is an acceptable replacement for a standard ECG in the identification of ST Elevation
      Myocardial Infarction (STEMI).

      Toward this objective, this study involves the following:

      Obtain simultaneous recordings of a standard 12-lead ECG and the iPhone "12-lead equivalent"
      ECG on patients presenting with chest pain in which the STEMI protocol was activated.

      Obtain simultaneous recordings of a standard 12-lead ECG and the iPhone "12-lead equivalent"
      ECG on patients presenting to the Emergency Department for evaluation of chest pain, not
      necessarily presenting with STEMI.

      Reading of ECGs (standard 12-lead and iPhone) by three independent cardiologists, who are
      blinded to the initial clinical ECG readings, the type of ECG equipment used, and the
      patient's clinical information.

      Assess the operational feasibility of using the Smartphone to obtain "12-lead equivalent" ECG
      recordings in patients suspected to have STEMI, and

      Determine the possibility of pooling the data obtained from this study with data from other
      institutions conducting identical studies, and developing a future and statistical analysis
      plan to compare the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and the negative
      predictive power of the iPhone ECG, using a paired standard 12-lead ECG as the gold standard.

      There will be no therapeutic interventions. A single research-related procedure will be
      required, i.e., an iPhone ECG. Effort will be made to ensure that the performance of this
      procedure will not delay any treatment and/or diagnostic procedures that are part of usual or
      specialized care that the patient requires.

      The individual patient's participation in the study will actually be only one day, i.e., the
      day the informed consent is obtained and the two comparison ECGs will be done.
