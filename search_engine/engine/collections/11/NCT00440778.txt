    
      OBJECTIVES AND END-POINTS The objectives of the present study are to assess the benefits and
      safety of 1) a single bolus of abciximab (100% dose) compared with the standard bolus (ca 80%
      of the total dose) + 12h infusion (ca 20% of the total dose), and 2) intracoronary abciximab
      bolus administration compared with intravenous route of abciximab administration in primary
      PCI.

      The primary PLATELETS end-points are the percentage of patients with ≥ 95% platelet
      aggregation inhibition 10 minutes after abciximab bolus (MAX) and the mean platelet
      aggregation inhibition 10 minutes after abciximab bolus (MEAN).

      The secondary CLINICAL end-points of the study are:

        -  The composite of death, stroke, repeat myocardial infarction, urgent target vessel
           revascularization and major bleedings at 30 days following primary PCI.

        -  The composite of cardiovascular death, repeat myocardial infarction and repeat target
           vessel revascularization at 6-months follow-up.

      The secondary ANGIOGRAPHIC end-points of the study are:

        -  The proportion of patients having myocardial blush grade 2-3 and TIMI 3 score at the end
           of PCI in the culprit vessel.

        -  The restenosis rate (diameter stenosis ≥ 50%) and late loss in the culprit vessel at
           6-months follow-up.

      Other exploratory end-points are the feasibility and safety of early transfer to the
      referring hospital after uncomplicated primary PCI, the cardiac MRI measurements and platelet
      aggregation inhibition at 6h post-PCI.
