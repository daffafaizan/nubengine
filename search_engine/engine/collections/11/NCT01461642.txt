      will be identified, developed, introduced and clinically evaluated. The study will include
      120 patients diagnosed with asthma that is poorly managed. The study will use the ACT (Asthma
      Control Test) questionnaire and an evaluation questionnaire that will cover issues regarding
      the satisfaction of subjects with asthma care offered. Subjects with a PEF meter, will be
      able to enter the value of PEF (Peak Expiratory Flow).

      In addition to this, users can enter values (1) physical activity (type, duration,
      intensity), and (2) food (type, quantity).
