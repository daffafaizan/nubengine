      used to image the superficial and deep retinal vascular plexuses before ICL implantation
      surgery and at 3 months follow-up. OCTA images were corrected for magnification,
      skeletonized, separated the large vessels and partitioned. Retinal microvascular density was
      measured by using fractal dimension analysis. The aim of this study was to uncover potential
      retinal vascular network alterations induced by ICL implantation surgery.
