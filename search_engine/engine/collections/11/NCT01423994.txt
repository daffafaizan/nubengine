      substrate for intermittent heart block. The first is to assume that intermittent heart block
      is the cause, and simply implant a pacemaker. The second is to implant a digital ECG loop
      recorder with a lifespan of 2 - 3 years, determine the rhythm abnormalities during the next
      faint, and treat accordingly. Both approaches expose patients to a risk of fainting and its
      sequelae, and both carry device-related complications.Which approach is superior is unknown.
