      Methods: Women with overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms who scored a 6 on the Questionnaire for
      Urinary Incontinence Diagnosis and who consumed at least 200 mg of caffeine daily were
      recruited. After completing baseline 3-day bladder diaries including amount and type of
      caffeine consumption, as well as validated urinary symptom severity, bother and quality of
      life questionnaires, women were randomized to receive caffeine reduction education vs. a
      control group who reviewed their voiding diary with no counseling to reduce caffeine; both
      groups were asked to maintain total fluid intake. Participants repeated the 3-day bladder
      diary and validated questionnaires following randomization. A total of 80 women were required
      to achieve 80% power with an alpha error of 0.05 to detect a difference of 1.3 in mean number
      of daily voids averaged over a 3-day voiding diary.
