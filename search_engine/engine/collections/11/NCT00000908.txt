      > 200 cells/mm3. Few data exist to confirm or negate the continued necessity of PCP
      prophylaxis for such patients. This study will assess the effects of discontinuing therapy.

      Subjects are asked to discontinue PCP prophylaxis if antiretroviral therapy has resulted in a
      sustained CD4 increase greater than 200 cells/mm3 on two measurements at least 12 weeks
      apart. They will be evaluated for symptoms and CD4 counts every 8 weeks as well as plasma for
      HIV-RNA every 16 weeks for 18 months. Subjects whose CD4 count falls to less than 150
      cells/mm3 or between 150 and 200 cells/mm3 will have the CD4 count re-evaluated immediately
      or within 4 weeks. If the second CD4 count is less than 200 cells/mm3 for either case,
      conventional PCP prophylaxis will be resumed and the subject will be followed on study.
      Subjects will be followed during study by physical exams and laboratory tests at Weeks 4, 8,
      and every 8 weeks thereafter.
