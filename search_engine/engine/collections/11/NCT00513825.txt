      undergoing diagnostic or interventional procedures requiring radiographic contrast agents and
      is the third leading cause of acquired acute renal failure in hospitalized patients.
      Strategies for the prevention of radiocontrast nephropathy have focused on countering
      vasoconstriction (pre-hydration, fenoldopam, and theophylline), enhancing flow through the
      nephron (diuretics), or protection against oxygen-free-radical injury (urinary alkalinization
      and N-acetylcysteine).

      Among all prophylactic measures that have been proposed, adequate preprocedural and
      postprocedural hydration has demonstrated effectiveness in the prevention of radiocontrast
      nephropathy. Thus, it remains the most frequently applied measure in clinical practice.

      A Recent study in May 2004 have shown benefit in administering Sodium Bicarbonate over normal
      saline as a prophylaxy.Since alkalizing renal tubular fluid with bicarbonate may reduce
      injury .

      Most studies have excluded patients with history of pulmonary edema, severe heart
      failure(NYHA 3-4), uncontrolled hypertension or ejection fraction less than 30% and no
      specific protocol is tested for this group of patients. This study focuses on preventing RCIN
      in this specific group of patients .

      Comparisons:1075 cc NaCl 0.45% or 75 cc of sodium bicarbonate 8.4% solved in one liter of
      NaCl 0.45%. Each fluid is infused at the rate of 3 ml/kg/ hour one hour before the
      angiographic procedure, continuing at the rate of 1 ml/kg/ hour for 6 hours after the
      procedure. Maximum rate of fluid permitted is that for a body weight of 110 Kg.
