      Therefore, repeated blood samples of patients undergoing cardiac surgery will be taken.
      Patients are selected after "open" cardiac surgery (via sternotomy), when when they require
      postoperative care in the cardiovascular intensive care unit. The blood samples will be
      analysed in collaboration with the Inflammation Research Unit of the Department of Internal
      Medicine at the University Hospital Zurich.
