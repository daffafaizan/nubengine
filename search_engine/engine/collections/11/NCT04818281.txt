      participants and placebo administration to 6 participants. After completion of low-dose
      group, decision of switch to high-dose will be taken by the Independent Data Monitoring
      Committee and study will continue accordingly.

      The study will be completed in 12 months.

      All injections will be done subcutaneously.
