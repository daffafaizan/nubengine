      HFS, its efficacy needs to be demonstrated in prospective controlled trials. We estimated
      that the HFS rate with placebo and pyridoxine would be 0.35 and 0.18, respectively, and we
      therefore calculated that a sample size of 345 patients would be necessary to detect these
      hazard rates with an 80% power (β=0.2) and two-sided significance level of α=0.05. We assumed
      a follow up loss rate of 10%, thus requiring 380 patients to be randomized.
      Chemotherapy-naive patients with gastrointestinal tract cancers who were scheduled for
      capecitabine-containing chemotherapy were assigned to receive oral pyridoxine or placebo in
      randomized double-blind placebo controlled study. Pyridoxine 100 mg b.i.d was prescribed to
      the patients in the pyridoxine group, identical placebo 100 mg b.i.d was prescribed in the
      placebo group by the closed envelop randomization. Patients were stratified by chemotherapy
      regimen: capecitabine alone (X), capecitabine and cisplatin (XP), or docetaxel, capecitabine,
      and cisplatin (DXP). Patients were observed until NCI CTC grade 2 or 3 HFS developed or
      capecitabine-containing chemotherapy ended. Patients in the placebo group who developed grade
      2 or 3 HFS were randomized to receive pyridoxine or placebo for the next chemotherapy cycle
      to determine whether pyridoxine could improve HFS, and the same treatment was continued for 2
      chemotherapy cycles.
