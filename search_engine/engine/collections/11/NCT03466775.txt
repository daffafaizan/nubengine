    
      The aims of this study are:

        1. To assess the incidence of post-transplant anti-angiotensin II type 1 receptor
           antibodies within the first year after transplantation in an unselected population of
           kidney transplant recipients.

        2. To investigate the incidence of biopsy-proven kidney allograft rejection according to
           the presence of post-transplant anti-angiotensin II type 1 receptor antibodies and of
           post-transplant concomitant donor-specific anti-HLA antibodies within the first year
           after transplantation, and to evaluate the incidence of rejection cases associated with
           anti-angiotensin II type 1-receptor antibodies that are not recognized by the current
           diagnostic approach based on HLA testing.

        3. To investigate the allograft injury phenotype associated with post-transplant
           anti-angiotensin II type 1 receptor, using histopathology, immunochemistry and
           measurement of endothelial-associated transcript (ENDAT) expression level in allograft.

        4. To evaluate the impact of post-transplant anti-angiotensin II type 1 receptor antibodies
           on kidney allograft survival up to 7 years after inclusion, in univariate and
           multivariable survival models including clinical, histological and immunological risk
           factors for allograft loss.

      This study includes kidney recipients transplanted between January 1, 2008 and December 31,
      2012 at Necker and Saint-Louis Hospitals (Paris, France), who undergo screening for
      post-transplant anti-angiotensin II type 1 receptor antibodies and simultaneous kidney
      allograft biopsy within the first year after transplantation, either at the time of an
      episode of rejection in the first year after transplantation or at 1 year after
      transplantation in the absence of previous rejection episode.
