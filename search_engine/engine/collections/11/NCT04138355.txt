      essential to ensure that good functional recovery is achieved. In burn patients, the wound
      healing process may lead to a fibrotic hypertrophic scar, which is raised, red, inflexible
      and responsible functional and cosmetic impairments.

      This randomized, controlled trial involved 40 patients with burns and dominant right-hand
      function impairment. Patients were randomized into a ESWT or a CON group. Each intervention
      was applied to the affected hand for 4 weeks once per week. Hand function was evaluated using
      the Jebsen-Taylor hand function test (JTT), grasp and pinch power test, and Michigan Hand
      Outcomes Questionnaire (MHQ). These assessments were evaluated pre-intervention and 4 weeks
      post-intervention.
