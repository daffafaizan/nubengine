      accurately predicting the optimal insertion depth of Uniblocker,however in some hospital the
      CT scan performed for the preoperative surgical evaluation without the vocal cords slices. If
      a more extensive CT scan was needed for obtaining a more reliable image of the vocal
      cords,the additional exposure dose would be a major disadvantage of the method.So the
      investigators measure the distance between the upper edge of the thyroid cartilage to the
      upper edge of the sternum add the distance from the upper edge of the sternum to the carina
      calculated according to the chest CT scans as a guide to the placement of Uniblocker without
      the aid of FOB.
