        -  Determine the antitumor activity of erlotinib in patients with advanced renal cell
           carcinoma.

        -  Evaluate the safety and tolerability, in terms of the toxicity profile, of this drug in
           these patients.

        -  Determine the biologic activity of this drug, in terms of early disease progression,
           progression-free survival, 12-month survival rate, and overall survival, in these
           patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacodynamics of this drug in these patients.

        -  Analyze the postreceptor effects of epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosinase kinase
           inhibition by this drug on cell cycle, apoptosis, and angiogenesis in tumor biopsies
           from these patients.

        -  Correlate changes in biological measurements with indices of outcome in patients treated
           with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral erlotinib once daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 4 weeks for 52
      weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 2 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 19-40 patients will be accrued for this study within 8-10
      months.
