      first-line treatment outcome needs to be improved. To make this possible, a crucial condition
      is optimal identification of patients that will not be cured on R-CHOP. The aim of this
      protocol is to develop new tools to monitor treatment response and disease outcome. Molecular
      monitoring of treatment response through liquid biopsies (LB) is such a promising new tool.

      The primary objective is to collect liquid biopsy samples of patients with newly diagnosed
      DLBCL/HGBCL to develop a blood based assay allowing biomarker driven treatment in the future.

      The secondary objectives are to collect clinical data and pre-treatment tissue samples (for
      determining molecular profiles) to allow for correlation to the blood based assay.

      This study is designed for patients with newly diagnosed DLBCL and HGBCL â‰¥ 18 yr.
