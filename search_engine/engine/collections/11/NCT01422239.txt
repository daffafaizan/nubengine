      cessation intervention in which counseling sessions are tailored to individual smokers'
      perceived risks of quitting. The feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of the novel
      treatment will be examined through a pilot study in which female smokers will be randomly
      assigned to receive either the tailored treatment or a standard treatment. It is expected
      that participants receiving the tailored treatment will show higher rates of smoking
      abstinence than participants receiving the standard smoking cessation treatment at the end of
      the 8-week treatment and at one month follow-up.
