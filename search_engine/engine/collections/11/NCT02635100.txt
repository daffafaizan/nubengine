      with Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) over 45 nights while using a CPAP machine at home. The
      researchers are evaluating the performance of the existing algorithm as well as capturing the
      data to make enhancements.

      Two main stages of this algorithm will be assessed:

      i. Fast Track (FT) stage. In the FT stage the aim is to assess if the algorithm reliably and
      timely reaches approximate therapeutic pressure levels.

      ii. Slow Titration (ST). In the Slow Titration stage the aim is to assess if data samples
      have been appropriately collected in a pressure range so that the therapeutic pressure can be
      inferred according to the algorithm proposed.
