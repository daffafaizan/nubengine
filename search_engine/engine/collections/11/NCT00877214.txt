      rituximab in follicular lymphomas. The advantage of a maintenance therapy in other indolent
      and mantle cell lymphomas is - due to the lower incidence of these diseases- not well
      investigated.

      This study tries to determine the significance of an extended maintenance therapy with
      rituximab in follicular lymphomas and the significance of a maintenance therapy other
      indolent and mantle cell lymphomas compared to observation.
