      closure. Several studies have demonstrated that a key to successful initial closure involves
      deep dissection of the pelvic floor so that the bladder can be placed in the most posterior
      and inferior position possible. Oftentimes, the need for repeat closure of the abdomen is
      required if the initial surgeon failed to properly dissect deep enough into the child's
      pelvic floor. Many surgeons are unfamiliar with the complex anatomy and are unable to verify
      that they have properly reached the true pelvic floor during this initial surgery. This often
      leads to failed closures, which result in poor continence rates later in life.

      The investigators are attempting to determine the safety and efficacy of the use the
      Brainlab, Inc. VisionVectorÂ® Cranial Image Guided Surgery System during closure of bladder
      exstrophy. The value of this research is two-fold. Firstly, the project will help us to
      verify if the investigators are indeed dissecting down to the proper plane required for
      successful initial closure of bladder exstrophy. Secondly, this project will help others with
      relatively less experience with bladder exstrophy to properly identify where they are
      anatomically during closure of exstrophy, thus yielding higher success rates and better
      patient care at other centers.
