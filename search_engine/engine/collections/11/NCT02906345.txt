    
      Therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) should used for patients with septic shock in a controlled,
      prospective study.

      Investigators will study three groups:

        1. untreated control group;

        2. TPE group, plasma separation carried out by filtration;

        3. TPE group, plasma separation carried out by centrifugation.

      All treated patients should treated two (minimal) to five times by TPE, depending on the need
      of norephinephrine for the therapy. For each session 40 ml/kg body weight plasma should be
      exchange. Fluid resuscitation will be done with fresh frozen plasma. The study will focusing
      on the organ functions of the patients, especially liver-, kidney- and nervous function and
      also displayed in the SOFA score on study days 3 and 7.
