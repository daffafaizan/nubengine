      performance and satisfaction of a mobile phone supported and person-centred rehabilitation
      intervention (F@ce1.0) after stroke in Stockholm, Sweden. The purpose of the present proposal
      is to implement and evaluate F@ce 2.0 on functioning in activities in daily living (ADL) and
      participation in everyday life among persons with stroke and their significant others
      (someone identified by the person with stroke as close i.e.partner, friend, son, daughter).

      With recommendations on evaluation of complex interventions both outcomes and processes will
      be studied and hence both quantitative and qualitative methods will be applied. In a
      randomized controlled trial F@ce 2.0 will be evaluated compared to ordinary rehabilitation in
      urban/rural Sweden regarding; self-efficacy, perceived performance and participation in
      everyday activities, independence in ADL, health care utilization and the familiesÂ´ perceived
      participation in everyday activities. Qualitative data will explore experiences of people
      with stroke, significant others and rehabilitation staff of participating in F@ce 2.0. The
      research project has a multidisciplinary perspective for sustainable rehabilitation
      interventions, a prerequisite for better participation in everyday life for people with
      stroke.
