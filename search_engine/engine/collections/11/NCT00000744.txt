      HIV-negative women. An increasing likelihood of oral and esophageal candidiasis in
      conjunction with progressive immunosuppression raises the question of the potential role of
      prophylactic antifungal therapy in high-risk persons.

      Four hundred HIV-infected women are randomized to receive fluconazole or placebo weekly for
      up to 2 years. Patients undergo follow-up every 3 months or more often if signs and symptoms
      of mucosal candidiasis occur.
