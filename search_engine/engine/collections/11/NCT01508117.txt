      the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Axitinib works by preventing new blood
      vessels from forming, and tumors need to make new blood vessels in order to grow. The study
      will find out what effects, good or bad, axitinib has on the tumor. In addition, this study
      will try to determine whether the response to axitinib and the overall outcome depends on
      certain characteristics of your tumor.
