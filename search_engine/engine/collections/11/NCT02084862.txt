    
      TRACHUS trial is a randomized non-inferiority trial designed to evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of ultrasound guided percutaneous tracheostomy compared to bronchoscopy guided
      percutaneous tracheostomy.

      Patients will be randomly assigned to be submitted to ultrasound or bronchoscopy guided
      percutaneous tracheostomy and then the procedure related complications and clinical outcomes
      will be evaluated and compared between groups.
