      toxin type A ( BTA) to prevent hypertrophic scar in median sternotomy wound. The entire
      median sternotomy wound was divided into the upper half and the lower half. Both halves of
      the wound were randomized to receive treatment with either BTA or 0.9% normal saline. The
      patient and the surgeon will be blinded to the treatment arm. The primary end point was the
      evaluation of upper and lower half scar using the Vancouver Scar Scale (VSS). At 6 months
      follow-up, two blinded dermatologists examined the patients and took photographs of the scar
      in the outpatient clinic of XiJing Hospital. Scars were assessed using the VSS and assigned
      the mean score of the two observers. At 6-month follow-up, ultrasonography to measure the
      scar width will be performed. At the same time, patients were asked to evaluate their overall
      satisfaction, using a four-point grading scale for each half the scar(1= very satisfied, 2=
      satisfied,3= slightly satisfied, 4= unsatisfied ).Paired t-test was used to compare the VSS
      scores, scar width and the overall satisfaction between the BTA-treated group and normal
      saline group.
