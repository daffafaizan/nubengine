    
      The primary aim of this study is to assess the associations between to investigate the
      association of rs2854117 C > T and rs2854116 T > C SNPs of the APOC3 gene with liver
      steatosis, as measured by liver ultrasound.

      As a secondary aim, the investigators will examine the associations between APOC3 rs2854117 C
      > T and rs2854116 T > C SNPs and serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate
      aminotransferase (AST) levels. In addition, the investigators will further analyze the
      association with other biomarkers, such as body mass index, adiponectin and insulin
      resistance.
