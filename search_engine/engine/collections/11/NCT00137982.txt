      this case, we propose a randomized controlled trial between medical and conservative surgery.
      In all others clinical situations, we proposed surgery treatment. In a randomized controlled
      trial we compare conservative versus radical treatment. The patients are followed-up during 2
      years with phone contact every 6 months.
