      risk of alcohol dependence is not clear. Animal studies indicate that the neuroactive steroid
      allopregnanolone is an alcohol-modulated endogenous agonist at GABAA receptors and that
      genetic variation in steroid 5a-reductase type I gene which generates neuroactive steroids,
      may moderate alcohol effects. To better define the role of neuroactive steroids we will
      conduct a laboratory study of non-alcohol dependent drinkers using a 4-session design in
      which alcohol/placebo beverage is paired with dutasteride/placebo pretreatment. Dutasteride,
      an inhibitor of both type I and type II 5a-reductase enzymes, blocks the production of
      5a-reduced neuroactive steroids. This study will extend our preliminary findings with
      finasteride by including a) a placebo control for alcohol, b) a more specific inhibitor of
      both 5a-reductase isoenzymes, c) a larger group of subjects (including both light and heavy
      drinkers).
