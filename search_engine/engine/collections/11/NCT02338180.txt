      community in Valparaiso, Chile. They were examined clinically and radiographically, divided
      into 3 groups, and treated accordingly: children in Group A had no carious lesions on the
      approximal surfaces of 05d-6m and received no sealants; those in group B had active caries on
      05d and received a preventive sealant on the caries-free 6m; and those in group C had active
      caries on 05d with an initial active lesion on 6m and received a therapeutic sealant on 6m.
      After 3.5 years, standardized follow-up radiographs were obtained for the children that
      remained.
