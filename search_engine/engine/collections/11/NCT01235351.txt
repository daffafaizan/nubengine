      cardiovascular events in acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients.However, inter-patient
      variability in the pharmacodynamic response to clopidogrel is well recognized, and patients
      with lesser degrees of platelet inhibition in response to clopidogrel have been shown to be
      at increased risk of cardiovascular events.

      One potential source of this variability is the metabolism of clopidogrel, which is a
      pro-drug requiring biotransformation to become an active antiplatelet compound. Cytochrome
      P-450 (CYP) enzymes play a role in the metabolism, and carriers of reduced-function genetic
      variants in CYP2C19 (~30% of the population) have lower active clopidogrel metabolite levels,
      diminished platelet inhibition, and higher rates of adverse cardiovascular events as compared
      with non-carriers in the setting of treatment with standard maintenance doses of clopidogrel.

      Aim: To determine whether higher as compared with lower maintenance doses of clopidogrel can
      adequately improve the degree of platelet inhibition in carriers of a reduced-function
      CYP2C19 allele.

      Hypotheses: The primary hypothesis is that subjects who carry a reduced-function CYP2C19
      allele will have improvement in platelet inhibition with higher maintenance doses of
      clopidogrel.The secondary hypothesis is that higher maintenance doses of clopidogrel in
      carriers of a reduced-function CYP2C19 allele will result in similar platelet inhibition as
      compared to a standard maintenance dose of clopidogrel in non-carriers.
