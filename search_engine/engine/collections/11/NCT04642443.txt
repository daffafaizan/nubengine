    
      This study is a two-stage, pivotal, prospective, non-randomized, multi-center, within patient
      comparison of the SENSE device and the standard diagnostic test, head CT scan in patients
      with a diagnosis of primary spontaneous ICH (parenchymal ICH without secondary causes, such
      as arteriovenous malformation, cavernoma, aneurysm, hemorrhagic transformation of ischemic
      stroke, venous sinus thrombosis) or traumatic intracranial bleeding (defined as epidural
      hemorrhage, subdural hemorrhage and/or traumatic contusions/intraparenchymal hemorrhage) for
      the detection and monitoring of intracranial hemorrhages. All subjects with any spontaneous
      or traumatic ICH who meet eligibility criteria should be enrolled. We anticipate that some
      TBI patients with traumatic ICH may not have a prolonged hospital stay and the standard
      practice in these patients who do not experience hemorrhage expansion is to obtain a head CT
      within 6-24 hours. It is anticipated that the majority of subjects admitted to the hospital,
      i.e., spontaneous ICH or TBI patients who experience hemorrhage expansion, will be managed in
      an intensive care unit (ICU). Mild TBI with traumatic ICH patients may be managed outside of
      an ICU depending on local practice. The SENSE device will be evaluated in subjects at risk of
      early and delayed hemorrhage expansion.
