    
      Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) after nasal surgery (Septorhinoplasty, Septoplasty,
      Functional endoscopic sinus surgery) is a very common complication (34-60%). Gastric blood is
      known to be a powerful emetic. In the literature, there are studies showing that pharyngeal
      packing application decreases the incidence of PONV after these surgeries and has not been
      effective in this regard.The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of pharyngeal
      packing on the perioperative gastric volume.

      In order to compare preoperative and postoperative gastric volumes, measurements are made
      with USG and thus show the effectiveness of the application.

      This study aims to compare the pre / post-operative gastric volumes of patients with USG in
      two different positions, supine and right lateral decubitus, in order to evaluate the
      effectiveness of pharyngeal packing in patients undergoing nasal surgery, and to show its
      effects on PONV.
