      Primary

        -  To validate a new assay for lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) in early detection of ovarian
           cancer.

      Secondary

        -  To estimate the risk of finding ovarian cancer at the time of surgery in pre- and
           post-menopausal women presenting with a pelvic mass and compare LPA results from both
           surgical patient groups with those from "normal", disease-free women at high-risk of
           ovarian cancer.

      Tertiary

        -  To examine the response to primary adjuvant treatment and recurrence of disease.

        -  To evaluate urine levels of CA125 and LPA to determine their ability to estimate the
           risk of cancer at the time of surgery in patients presenting with a pelvic mass.
           (exploratory)

      OUTLINE: Blood and urine samples are collected before or on the day of surgery; before,
      during, and after completing chemotherapy; or at a clinic visit. Samples are tested for
      concentrations of CA125 and lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) using a new assay and compared to
      liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry results. Remaining
      serum, plasma, and urine is stored frozen for future research evaluation of other novel
      biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of cancer.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up periodically for approximately 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 500 surgical patients, 100 cancer patients undergoing
      first-line therapy, and 40 disease-free women who are known BRCA-mutation carriers will be
      accrued for this study.
