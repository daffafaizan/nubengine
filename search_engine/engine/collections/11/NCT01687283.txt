    
      Male or female subjects between 17 to 70 (inclusive) years of age with severe persistent
      asthma meeting the inclusion criteria and having completed the screening period of 2 weeks
      will, in a proportion of 1:1, randomly receive fluticasone propionate 1mg via nebulizer BID
      or budesonide 2mg via nebulizer BID for a treatment period of 12 weeks. The clinic visit will
      be arranged at 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 8 weeks and 12 weeks during study treatment. If the subjects
      meet the criteria of pre-defined asthma control at treatment 4 weeks or 8 weeks, they will
      have one chance to be treated with the half dose of study drug. 2 weeks after completion of
      study treatment or after early withdrawal from study, the follow-up visit will be performed
      to assess the post-treatment adverse events. The primary endpoint is the mean change from
      baseline in morning peak expiratory flow (PEF) over the 12 week treatment period. Safety
      assessments include adverse events, vital signs, oral and oropharyngeal candidiasis,
      hematological, biochemical tests), 24-hour urinary cortisol and 12-lead ECG. The steady-state
      plasma pharmacokinetics of fluticasone propionate inhalation solution will also be assessed.
