      accepted universally. But the rout of administration should be systematic, oral, or both is
      controversial. Furthermore, although many trails have been performed, no trial limited to
      laparoscopic surgery is performed. We compare 2 approaches - oral and systemic versus
      systemic antibiotic prophylaxis - in limited to elective laparoscopic colorectal surgery.
