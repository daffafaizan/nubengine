      bacterial contamination introduced at the time of surgery and most appear by 3-4 weeks
      post-operatively. Protection must persist well beyond the surgical procedure to make certain
      that all contaminating bacteria are completely eradicated.

      Depending upon the institution, shunt infection rates have been known to be as little as 1%
      to as much as 25%. However, two prospective trials that have been published from large
      databases, with a consistent definition of infection, have indicated an overall infection
      rate of approximately 10%

      This prospective non-randomized, open-label Registry is designed to investigate and identify
      short-term shunt/catheter-related infection rates in ventriculoperitoneal shunt systems using
      various catheters during hospital standard of care treatment of Subjects with hydrocephalus.
      Prospective Subjects will include those receiving shunts for the first time (de novo) and
      those with previously implanted shunts for whom catheter or total system replacements are
      required.

      This Registry will enroll 450 implanted Subjects of any age who meet all the inclusion
      criteria and none of the exclusion criteria and who provide signed Informed Consent to
      participate in this clinical Registry

      Subjects will be followed for up to 90 days.
