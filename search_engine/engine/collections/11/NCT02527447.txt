      remains a significant unmet need. Current response criteria were originally proposed in 1956
      and do not provide a sensitive assessment of AML disease burden, as evidenced by the
      disconnect between the apparent success of current induction therapy in achieving complete
      remission in most patients and the stark reality of median overall survival times of less
      than two years. While sensitive minimal/measurable residual disease assays assessing AML
      disease burden have been developed, the role for these tests in the treatment algorithm for
      patients with RR-AML has yet to be defined. We propose evaluating if these high sensitivity
      assays could function as early predictors of salvage therapy failure.

      This protocol is designed as a feasibility study to evaluate if use of high sensitivity
      peripheral blood-based molecular assays on day 4 of induction salvage chemotherapy can
      predict failure to ultimately achieve a CR or CRi in patients with RR-AML. Eligible patients
      will receive salvage induction therapy using FDA approved antineoplastic agents given either
      alone or in combinations as defined in the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN)
      Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology for AML.

      Additional secondary objectives include investigating the relationship between kinetics of
      gene expression changes and response to chemotherapy, determining the proportion of patients
      for whom results of day 4 peripheral blood gene expression testing are available before day 8
      of therapy, determining the proportion of patients for whom results from pre-treatment
      molecular and genetic testing are available before day 8 of therapy, assessing patient and
      disease specific factors associated with failure to achieve a CR, determining the feasibility
      of measuring AML residual disease burden using alternative technologies and alternative
      tissue sources, determining the proportion of patients who receive allogeneic hematopoietic
      stem cell transplant after completion of therapy, determining the incidence of infectious
      complications with the use of modern prophylactic antimicrobial agents compared with
      historical comparisons and determining the feasibility of recruiting patients with RR-AML to
      the NIH Clinical Center.
