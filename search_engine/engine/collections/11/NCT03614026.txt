    
      In the business-as-usual control condition, participants will have access to any services
      that a school would routinely provide (e.g., develop and implement a behavior support plan)
      as well as services families can access in the community (e.g., mental health support).

      Teachers and Parents as Partners will occur in a series of stages comprised of approximately
      four structured meetings over approximately 8 weeks. A Teachers and Parents as Partners
      consultant will meet together with a student's parent(s), teachers, other school personnel
      (as appropriate), and the student (as appropriate). The Teachers and Parents as Partners team
      will collaboratively address behavior problem solving objectives. Specific TAPP objectives
      include: identifying strengths and specific behaviors of concern, specifying alternative
      prosocial behaviors, creating measurable behavior goals, co-constructing behavior
      intervention/support plans to address the target concerns, creating sustainable conditions to
      support plan implementation at home and school, and evaluating the plan to assess progress
      toward goals.
