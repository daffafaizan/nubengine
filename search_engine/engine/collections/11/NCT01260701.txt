      I. To estimate the overall survival (OS) for patients with advanced gastric and
      gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma treated with MK-2206 (Akt inhibitor MK2206).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the progression free survival (PFS) in this patient population. II. To
      estimate the response rate (confirmed and unconfirmed complete response [CR] and partial
      response [PR] by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors [RECIST] 1.1) in this patient
      population.

      III. To assess the frequency and severity of toxicity associated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE (CLOSED TO ACCRUAL 05/01/13):

      Patients receive Akt inhibitor MK2206 orally (PO) every other day on days 1-28. Courses
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years.
