      (TIL) as the Investigational Product (IP). Yet, the administration of the TIL cellular
      product can only be accomplished in the context of an Autologous, Adoptive Cell Therapy (ACT)
      procedure which is composed of the following steps:

        1. Reduced Intensity, non-myeloablative, lymphodepleting induction regimen using
           Fludarabine (25 mg/m2 for 3 days) followed by Total Body Radiation (TBR) (2 Gray as a
           single treatment) for 1 day

        2. Preparation and administration of unselected or 4-1BB enriched TIL

        3. Bolus high-dose (720,000 IU/kg) IL-2 will be administered to each patient every 8 hours,
           to tolerance. A maximum of 10 doses will be administered per patient.

        4. Early-stage follow-up until 30 days post-discharge

        5. Late-stage follow-up, such as CT scans, will be carried out four and twelve weeks after
           TIL administration, and then every 3 months thereafter for the first year after TIL
           therapy; for the second year and onwards, as clinically indicated.
