      usual diet and a commercially available portion-controlled diet. The commercially available
      diet will be the Nutrisystem-D program, which consists of pre-packaged meals and snacks that
      are supplemented with grocery items, including fruits, vegetables, and dairy items. This
      trial will be a randomized cross-over trial of 15 patients with type 2 diabetes (weight
      stable for at least 3 months prior and medication stable throughout the trial). Participants
      will consume each diet for a 2-week period. During each diet period, participants will wear a
      blinded (i.e., providing no feedback) continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) device to assess
      glycemic stability and variability, and will be instructed to keep a detailed record of food
      and beverage intake and physical activity. The two diet/assessment periods will be separated
      by a 1-week washout period during which no dietary instruction will be given and no outcomes
      will be measured. Laboratory values (HbA1c, glucose, insulin, lipid panel) and physical
      measures (height, weight, waist circumference, blood pressure) will be assessed at the
      baseline for descriptive purposes.

      Primary Hypothesis: A significantly greater percentage of CGM readings will fall in the
      euglycemic range (71-180 mg/dl) during consumption of the Nutrisystem-D program, as compared
      with Usual Diet.

      Secondary Hypothesis: Participants will have significantly smaller areas under the curve,
      mean amplitude of glycemic excurisions, mean, standard deviation, and interquartile range of
      glucose values, and a smaller of percentage of values in the hypo- (</= 70 mg/dl) and
      hyperglycemic (>180 mg/dl) ranges during consumption of the Nutrisystem-D program, as
      compared with Usual Diet.
