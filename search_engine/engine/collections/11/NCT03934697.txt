    
      An initial meeting consisting of a screening, questionnaires, and a brief psychoeducation on
      imaginal exposure therapy, followed by 8-10 sessions with a licensed psychologist (the PI) or
      a clinical psychology graduate student who is supervised and trained by the PI. In Session 1,
      patients will create a script with the therapist on an eating disorder fear. In sessions 2-10
      the therapist and patient will then imagine this eating disorder related fear based on the
      script. Each session will be modified to focus on "hot spots" or the most feared aspect of
      the script. Sessions will be audiotaped and videotaped and participants will be asked to
      listen to the sessions nightly for homework. Sessions will be weekly or twice per week for
      8-10 weeks after the initial screening session.
