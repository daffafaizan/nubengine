    
      OBJECTIVES: I. Compare, using a prospective controlled randomized study design, the survival
      and failure patterns associated with conventional-dose radiotherapy and
      fluorouracil/cisplatin (5-FU/CDDP) vs. high-dose radiotherapy and 5-FU/CDDP in patients with
      esophageal cancer. II. Compare the tolerance and quality of life of patients receiving these
      therapies.

      OUTLINE: Randomized study. Arm I: Radiotherapy plus 2-Drug Combination
      Chemotherapy/Radiosensitization. Tumor irradiation using megavoltage photons of at least 6 MV
      (electrons may be used if required to boost supraclavicular fossa dose); plus Cisplatin,
      CDDP, NSC-119875; Fluorouracil, 5-FU, NSC-19893. High-dose radiotherapy. Arm II: Radiotherapy
      plus 2-Drug Combination Chemotherapy/Radiosensitization. Tumor irradiation as in Arm I; plus
      CDDP/5-FU. Conventional-dose radiotherapy.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Up to 298 patients will be entered over 4 years.
