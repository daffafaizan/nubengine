    
      This is a prospective randomized clinical trial of same day discharge versus overnight stay
      for patients undergoing uncomplicated elective or low-risk urgent PCI with uncomplicated
      post-PCI recovery. The outcome is total cost accrued by patients from the time of index
      hospital presentation through 30-day post-PCI follow-up.

      Conduct of PCI procedures and provision of post-PCI care will be in accordance with routine
      institutional practices and will not be protocol-driven.

      Consented patients will be assigned to SDD or ON stay using a block randomization schedule.
      Randomization will occur once the patient has completed an uncomplicated 6-hour post PCI
      observation period.
