      including reduction of cardiovascular disease and improved satiety. However, studies of
      pistachios are extremely limited. The aim of this study is to determine the energy value of
      pistachios in the human diet and to probe mechanisms by which pistachios impart health
      benefits. The metabolizable energy value of pistachio nuts will be calculated based on the
      chemical composition and energy content of the consumed diet and excreta. This will provide a
      better estimate of the energy value of pistachios than simply calculating energy value based
      on Atwater factors. In addition to determining the energy value of pistachios, we will
      evaluate the effects of pistachio-rich diets on plasma phytonutrient levels and on gene
      expression changes to determine what protective mechanisms are activated by pistachio
      consumption.
