      Injury to this nerve during thyroid surgery can manifest as ipsilateral paralysis of the
      cricothyroid muscle. Clinical symptoms may include: hoarseness, breathy voice, an increase in
      the rate of throat clearing, vocal fatigue, or diminished vocal frequency range, especially
      with regards to raising pitch. The amount of EBSLNs identified intraoperatively varies from
      10% to 80%, while the rate of EBSLN injury reported in the literature is between 5% and 28%,
      depending on different evaluation methods. Advances in intraoperative neuromonitoring
      techniques would allow for EBSLN identification during thyroid surgery. However, there is
      controversy regarding usefulness in preserving EBSLN function using nerve monitoring system.
      The aim of the study is to evaluate effectiveness of neuromonitoring during thyroid surgery
      for the preservation of EBSLNs.
