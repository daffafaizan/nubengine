    
      A cohort of 10 cases of macula-involving retinal detachment complicated by proliferative
      vitreoretinopathy grade C (RDPVR group) will be identified from vitreoretinal clinics at
      Moorfields Eye Hospital. 26 weeks following retinal detachment repair, and after removal of
      any silicone oil tamponade, these cases will undergo post-operative visual assessment, OCT
      imaging and microperimetry. These investigations will be correlated with adaptive optics (AO)
      enface imaging of cone photoreceptors at the macula. This will be compared with groups of 10
      cases of macula involving retinal detachment without PVR (RD-OFF) and 5 cases of
      macula-sparing retinal detachment (RD-ON). Both comparison groups (RD-OFF & RD-ON) will
      undergo assessments at both 6 weeks and 26 weeks post-operatively.
