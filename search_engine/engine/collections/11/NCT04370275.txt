      patients still asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic, positive for SARS-CoV-2 on the RT-PCR test,
      presented chest CT images referring to parenchymal infiltrate with a prevalent appearance at
      ground-glass compatible with initial COVID-19 pneumonia.

      An ongoing study anticipates that the sensitivity of chest CT is higher than that of the
      RT-PCR molecular test for SARS-CoV-2 (performed on the pharyngeal swab or sputum) (50 out of
      51, 98%, 95% CI: 90% -100% vs 36 out of 51, 71%, IC95%: 56% -83%) in the early diagnosis of
      COVID-19.

      Recent work seems to shows that Lung Ultrasound is effective in the clinical evaluation and
      diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia.

      In a previous study, in addition, sensitivity and specificity of the Lung Ultrasound in the
      early diagnosis of H1N1 flu pneumonia was 94.1% (32 out of 34) and 84.8% respectively (28 out
      of 33), with a positive predictive value of 86.5% (32 out of 37) and a negative predictive
      value of 93.3% (28 out of 30).

      The concordance between the lung ultrasound findings and the lung lesions found on CT has
      recently been demonstrated ("lobe-specific" concordance equal to 87%; "lung-specific
      concordance" equal to 92.5 % for the right lung and 83.6% for the left lung).

      These data suggest to better explore the diagnostic accuracy of the Lung Ultrasound in
      SARS-CoV-2 infection.
