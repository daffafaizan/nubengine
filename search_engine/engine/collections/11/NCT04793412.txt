      the efficacy and safety of cochlear implantation in children with asymmetric hearing loss
      (AHL) or single-sided deafness (SSD). A hearing aid (HA) phase occurs over a minimum of 4 mos
      prior to obtaining a cochlear implant (CI). A CI phase occurs over the 15-month period after
      initial activation of the CI. The AHL/SSD groups are tested for change in performance pre- to
      post-implant. Investigators also collect longitudinal data over 12 months (matching the 3 to
      15 month post-implant timeframe) from normal hearing (NH) participants to provide additional
      information about outcome trajectory due to development alone. The NH participants are
      matched to AHL/SSD participants on age, gender and parent education. Post-implant performance
      with a CI alone is expected to outperform pre-implant performance with a HA. The study
      evaluates the effectiveness of bimodal hearing defined as a CI in the poor ear and a HA in
      the better ear for AHL or a CI in the poor ear and normal hearing in the better ear for SSD
      compared to pre-implant performance. The study examines factors contributing to CI outcomes.
