      (GERD), which is a common refractory gastrointestinal disease. Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs),
      the preferred treatment, have the following problems in clinical use: about 50% of patients
      respond to PPIs only partially or not at all; PPIs has a single target, and the effect of
      acid suppression alone is poor; long term use of PPIs can lead to dyspepsia, fundic gland
      polyp, atrophic gastritis, intestinal flora disorders, and even dependency. Liver-stomach
      depression-heat syndrome, spleen deficiency damp-heat syndrome and cold-heat complicated
      syndrome account for 80%-91% of NERD's Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) syndrome. TCM
      syndrome differentiation treatment has the advantages of overall regulation and
      individualized treatment, but it lacks high-level evidence-based medicine evidence. On the
      basis of previous work, the project plans to establish sub centers in 6 Chinese hospitals,
      including 180 patients with NERD who meet the requirements to carry out a multicenter,
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study, in which 90 subjects in the
      experimental group received the treatment of syndrome differentiation series of prescriptions
      combined with PPIs descending ladder withdrawal, and 90 subjects in the control group
      received the treatment of placebo combined with PPIs descending ladder withdrawal. The
      therapeutic effects were evaluated from the following aspects: the VAS score of reflow and
      heartburn, the rate of discontinuation of antacids, the rate of recurrence of NERD symptoms,
      the score of TCM syndromes and the improvement of gastrointestinal function. The purpose of
      this study is to evaluate the efficacy advantage and safety of Tongjiang series prescription
      combined with PPIs descending ladder withdrawal compared with PPIs descending ladder
      withdrawal alone for patients who use PPIs for a long time that can not stop, so as to obtain
      evidence-based medical evidence of high-quality TCM syndrome differentiation treatment of
      NERD, and form an effective and popularized treatment plan to solve the problems of various
      side effects and dependency caused by long-term use of PPIs.
