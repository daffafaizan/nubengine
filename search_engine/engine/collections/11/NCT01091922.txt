      conducted in 20 healthy human volunteers to test the impact of a high-flavanol containing
      meal on the growth of the large intestinal bacteria (microflora). The high flavanol test meal
      will contain 495 mg of flavanols and the low flavanol control will contain 23 mg of
      flavanols. The two intervention diets are otherwise matched for macro- and micronutrient
      content. Changes in the gut microbiota will be determined by measuring bacterial population
      levels in human faecal material using 16S rRNA targeted oligonucleotide probes and
      fluorescence in situ hybridization. A number of other biochemical and physiological measures
      will be recorded including blood glucose, lipoproteins, cytokine levels and blood pressure.
