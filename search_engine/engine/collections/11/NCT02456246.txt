      higher than 90% for early stage NSCLC, leading to increased use of this technique as a
      curative method for lung cancer treatment. With growing clinical experience with this
      technique, post-SBRT follow up has received more attention. Follow up after SBRT is done
      primarily by thorax CT, which is affected by radiation-induced radiographic lung changes that
      can resemble or obscure local recurrence.

      FLT (3'-deoxy-3'-fluorothymidine) is a thymidine analogue which is non-toxic in tracer doses,
      and can be labeled with 18F. FLT-PET is a type of imaging (similar concept to the widely used
      18-FDG PET-CT) that is based on integration of thymidine into DNA for assessment of
      proliferation. Conceptually, increased DNA synthesis is correlated to tumor aggressiveness
      and response to therapy, more so than glucose utilization - as in FDG-PET could be.

      The purpose of this study is therefore to see what added information the use of FTL-PET can
      provide in distinguishing between changes in the lung that occur as a result of treatment
      that are not cancerous and those that are due to recurrence or progressive disease.
