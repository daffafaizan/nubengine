      the detection in nursery, and by first line doctors in order to diagnose autism before 3 year
      of age. After screening, a specialized teem will realize a follow-up by phone to guide
      practitioners to a diagnostic teem in proximity. Early screening realized near family house
      is compulsory to facilitate accessibility and collaboration between professionals. Diagnostic
      should be realized in a three month delay, conform to the recommendations. Our project
      proposes to screen the general population of children who hasn't been screened yet for
      autism.
