      participate in this study. The investigators are looking for some women with uterine fibroids
      and some without uterine fibroids based on ultrasound or MRI. If the patients have not had a
      recent ultrasound or MRI of the uterus, a physician can provide one.

      Individuals cannot participate if they have high blood pressure, diabetes, or disease in the
      kidneys, lungs, or blood vessels. Also, individuals who smoke, have high cholesterol, or are
      obese (BMI is higher than 30) cannot participate. Certain medications, including high blood
      pressure medications, beta-blockers and anti-depressants, will also limit potential patient
      participation. The investigators would be happy to review medications for potential
      participants.

      Screen Day:

      One of the members of the research team will review the study and the informed consent
      document with the patient. The patient will have their height, weight, blood pressure, pulse
      and respirations measured. The patient will also complete three questionnaires. If the
      patient has not had an ultrasound of the uterus in the last 12 months, a physician will
      complete one for her.

      Study Day:

      The patient will need to fast overnight (no eating or drinking). The investigators will draw
      a blood sample and then do a series of tests on the participant's blood vessels. For some of
      the tests, medication will be given through an IV. The investigators will also test nerve
      activity in the nerve on the outer aspect of the leg.
