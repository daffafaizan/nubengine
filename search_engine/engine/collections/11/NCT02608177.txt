      on glucose variability among people with type 2 diabetes and stage 3-4 CKD. In a cross-over
      design, each enrolled participant will receive 28 days of each study medication. Study
      medications will be provided in a randomly assigned order without blinding. The primary study
      outcome is glucose time in range, measured by blinded continuous glucose monitoring for the
      last 6 days of each 28-day treatment period. Secondary outcomes include indices of glycemic
      variability, hypoglycemia, and biomarkers of systemic inflammation, oxidative stress, and
      albuminuria. The overall goal of this research is to identify safe and effective treatments
      to control glycemia among patients with diabetes and CKD.
