      behavioral, emotional, and physiological problems. In the absence of specialized services,
      problems in the relationship between caregiver and child may develop; problems in the child's
      functioning often persist and are exacerbated. This study will attempt to alleviate the
      attachment and regulatory difficulties that affect many young children placed into care.

      Children are randomly assigned to either an experimental group or to a treatment control
      group for 3 years. The experimental group focuses on relational issues; the control group
      focuses on cognitive development. Caregivers receiving the relational intervention are
      trained to provide nurturing care, and to help children learn to develop adequate regulatory
      skills. Caregivers in the treatment control group receive training designed to enhance
      children's cognitive development. Caregivers in both groups will receive 10 home visits.
      Observations of children and parents are used to assess participants.
