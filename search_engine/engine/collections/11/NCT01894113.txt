      disease. However, in some cases obtaining lung tissue is necessary to establish a final
      diagnosis. The current standard procedure is transbronchial forceps biopsy - if not
      sufficient: surgical lung biopsy. Transbronchial lung biopsy bears essential limitations
      however:

        -  Small tissue sample

        -  Limited evaluability of the material caused by forceps-induced crush artifacts

      In cryobiopsy the cryoprobeÂ´s tip is being cooled and thereby cools the surrounding tissue to
      approximately minus 89 degrees Celsius. Subsequently, the frozen probe is retracted with the
      frozen tissue being attached onto the frozen probe's tip. When applied in the central
      airways, cryobiopsy proved to deliver large specimens of good quality, which may exceed
      forceps biopsies in terms of diagnostic yield. Pilot studies on transbronchial cryobiopsy
      showed that same advantages as seen in the endobronchial use.
