      airway samples to see how the subjects express certain cells. The subjects will also have two
      blood draws to provide information on the number of inflammatory cells that are present in
      their blood. This will help the study team determine if mepolizumab might be able to be used
      in more patients with COPD. The use of mepolizumab in COPD subjects with elevated blood
      eosinophils has been proven effective. However, the cellular mechanisms in the COPD
      population are unknown, including the extent to which these subjects express IL-5 in their
      airway and whether eosinophils are the sole target. Through this study the study team plans
      to provide proof of concept that mepolizumab could target additional IL-5-expressing immune
      cells in the airway, including especially PMNs. The study team will also investigate
      additional feasible biomarkers that could be utilized to predict mepolizumab responsiveness
      in COPD. The study team is hoping to determine if COPD patients with elevated blood
      eosinophils will demonstrate increased concentrations of IL-5 in their bronchoalveolar lavage
      (BAL) fluid and increased expression in their BAL of CD125+ PMNs. To address this hypothesis,
      the following specific aims will be addressed: To define the expression of IL-5R on PMNs in
      COPD and to demonstrate elevated concentrations of IL-5 in BALF obtained from COPD subjects
      with blood eosinophils (≥300/µL).
