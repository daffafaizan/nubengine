      behaviors (10, 14, 15). CHALO's intervention components-- home visits, phone support, and
      "patient navigation" to dental visits-- proved to be feasible and acceptable. In the pilot
      R34, there were promising behavioral change on all measures. CHALO builds on this work, with
      the addition of: a) sippy cups as an intervention target, b) an iPad-based dietary recall
      tool, "MySmileBuddy," c) caries and obesity data, and; d) increased intervention contacts-
      consistent with recent child obesity and caries interventions (16, 17).

      An RCT (Aim 1) will enroll 360 mothers of children 4-6 month olds from New York City (n=3)
      and New Jersey (n=2) pediatric practices in SAPPHIRE ("SA Practice Partnership for Health
      Improvement and Research"). The Community Health Worker intervention includes: a) home visits
      with mothers/families (n=6 visits over one year) and follow up telephone support; b) patient
      navigation to make/keep timely dental visits (2x by 18 months). The Knowledge Translation
      component (Aim 2) will raise awareness of child health risks in SA communities and among
      professionals who provide their care. The campaign will include both traditional and social
      media components and will be evaluated using multiple metrics.
