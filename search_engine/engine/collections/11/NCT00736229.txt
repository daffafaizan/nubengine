      Clinical practice guidelines from the American College of Cardiology/American Heart
      Association for the treatment of patients with acute coronary syndromes call for treatment to
      achieve preprandial glucose <110 mg/dL, a maximum daily target <180 mg/dL, and a
      post-discharge hemoglobin A1c <7%. Initiation of aggressive insulin therapy is also warranted
      to achieve blood glucose <150 mg/dL during days 0-3 and 80-110 mg/dL when possible
      thereafter. To date, no studies have been conducted assessing the efficacy of intravenous
      exenatide administration on achieving glucose lowering in hyperglycemic coronary ICU
      patients.
