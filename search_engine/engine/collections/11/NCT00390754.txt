      behaviors. Unfortunately, women with unintended pregnancies do not recognize their
      pregnancies promptly, and inadvertently continue risk behaviors into the vulnerable early
      pregnancy weeks. Home pregnancy testing is a rapid and inexpensive means of pregnancy
      diagnosis. The objective of this study is to determine whether women in a Medicaid population
      at risk for unintended pregnancy will keep a home pregnancy test on hand and (if necessary)
      use it appropriately
