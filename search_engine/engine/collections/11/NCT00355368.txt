    
      Objective: to compare succinylcholine and rocuronium with regard to 1) quality of intubating
      conditions, 2) length of the intubating sequence, 3) failed intubating attempts, 4)
      hemodynamic sequelae of intubation, and 5) desaturations.

      Design: prospective, randomized, single-blind study. Setting: Intensive care units of an
      University Hospital. Patients: adult patients in intensive care requiring emergency
      intubation. Randomization: 1:1 randomization to either succinylcholine (1mg/kg) or rocuronium
      (0.6 mg/kg).

      Data: 1) assessment of the quality of intubating conditions by means of a score, 2) length of
      the intubating sequence defined as time between injection of neuromuscular blocking agent and
      first end-tidal CO2 on the monitor, 3) number of failed intubating attempts, 4) hemodynamic
      sequelae of intubation, defined as events requiring injection of vasoactive drugs, and 5)
      desaturations, defined as saturation below 90% and/or any decrease in saturation of 5% or
      more.
