      I. To determine the median progression-free survival in patients treated with leucovorin
      calcium, fluorouracil, and irinotecan hydrochloride (FOLFIRI) and panitumumab for K-ras and
      NRAS wild-type, metastatic colorectal carcinoma who have already progressed on FOLFIRI +
      Bevacizumab.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the frequency and severity of toxicities of the regimens. II. To determine
      overall response rate. III. To determine the median overall survival and the overall survival
      rate at 1 year.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive panitumumab intravenously (IV) over 60-90 minutes, leucovorin calcium IV
      over 90 minutes, fluorouracil IV continuously over 46 hours, and irinotecan hydrochloride IV
      over 90 minutes on days 1 and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.
