    
      Patients will be selected based on diminished likelihood of receiving a liver from the
      waitlist within a period during which they would be likely to succumb to severe
      comorbidities. This will be determined in part through use of a patient's MELD score, listing
      status, and clinical judgment. To ensure maximal benefit for the recipient, only high quality
      donor livers will be accepted.
