      study was stopped at 7 subjects in each study arm. The study design and outcome measures did
      not change for this study. See below for further details.

      Original: 15 subjects with well controlled type 1 diabetes and regular hypoglycemia and 15
      healthy volunteers will be recruited for this study.

      If you agree to participate in this study, you will be asked to participate in a screening at
      Yale New Haven Hospital. Each study subject will undergo two hypoglycemic clamp studies (a
      procedure where the blood sugar is closely regulated with intravenous insulin and glucose.)
      In these hypoglycemic clamp studies, the subject will be given an inhaler. On one visit the
      inhaler will contain formoterol capsules and on the other visit, the subject will be given
      'dummy' capsules. Subjects will be required to be admitted to the HRU the night before the
      study so that glucose levels can be stabilized and hypoglycemia avoided.
