      rate has been ranked fourth. Morbidity and mortality were ranked sixth and fourth in all
      malignancies, respectively. Therefore, esophageal cancer has always been a major malignant
      tumor that threatens the health of our residents. Investigator designed a single-arm,
      open-label, phase II trial of SHR-1210 combined with preoperative chemotherapy for locally
      advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. The purpose of this study is to observe and
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of SHR-1210 combined with preoperative chemotherapy for
      locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.
