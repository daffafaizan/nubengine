      Changing walking motions to lower these knee joint loads is an emerging management strategy
      for knee osteoarthritis. Multiple studies have targeted a change in the position of the foot
      relative to the direction of walking (toe-in or toe-out walking) and have shown this walking
      modification to lower knee joint loads and improve symptoms (e.g. pain) related to knee
      osteoarthritis within the context of a walking program. Building off the many studies that
      have found telerehabilitation to be an effective method of providing exercise and pain-coping
      physical therapy, the investigators will use this method to provide walking modification
      treatment. Telerehabilitation (using video or teleconferencing to conduct the physical
      therapy appointment) provides a convenient and cost-effective method to work with patients
      and coordinate their treatment plan. To monitor progress with learning the walking
      modification, the investigators will use a custom sensor shoe that the participants will wear
      during daily walking activities over the six-week intervention. Overall, this study will
      investigate the feasibility and effectiveness of a walking modification program delivered
      using video- or teleconference.
