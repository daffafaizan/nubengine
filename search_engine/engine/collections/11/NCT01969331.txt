      prescribing probiotic preparations as the only or (more often) adjuvant therapy in certain
      indications. A significant step forward was made in the current report of the European
      Helicobacter Study Group ,which states that "Certain probiotics and prebiotics show promising
      results as an adjuvant treatment in reducing side effects". At this stage,probiotics are
      classified as Grade D recommendation. That is precisely why the investigators believe that
      clinical studies are necessary in order for such effects to be objectively proven in a
      clinical setting.

      The investigators decided to conduct a clinical trial based on a clearly defined and
      sufficiently frequent indication,with a preparation of known probiotic composition that is
      easily available on the market, and in a real setting where such approach is bound to show
      both advantages and disadvantages.
