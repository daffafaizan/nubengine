    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the complete response (CR/complete response with incomplete recovery [CRi]) rate
      of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) treated with venetoclax combined with
      cladribine (2-CDA) plus low-dose cytarabine (LDAC) alternating with 5-azacytidine (AZA).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess overall survival (OS) of patients with AML treated with venetoclax added to
      cladribine plus LDAC alternating with 5-azacytidine.

      II. To assess the disease free survival (DFS) patients with AML treated with venetoclax added
      to cladribine plus LDAC alternating with 5-azacytidine and achieved a complete response
      (CR/CRi).

      III. To assess the overall response rate of patients with AML treated with venetoclax added
      to cladribine plus LDAC alternating with 5-azacytidine.

      IV. To assess toxicity and induction mortality of patients with AML treated with venetoclax
      added to cladribine plus LDAC alternating with 5-azacytidine.

      OUTLINE:

      INDUCTION: Patients receive cladribine intravenously (IV) daily over 1-2 hours on days 1-5,
      cytarabine subcutaneously (SC) twice daily (BID) on days 1-10, and venetoclax orally (PO)
      daily on days 1-21. Treatment continues for 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients who do not achieve a CR or CRi after course 1 may receive a
      second induction cycle. Patients who do not achieve CR or CRi after second induction cycle
      may proceed to cycle 3 of consolidation per investigator.

      CONSOLIDATION/MAINTENANCE:

      Patients who achieve CR or CRi after cycle 1 of induction receive cladribine IV over 1-2
      hours daily on days 1-3, cytarabine SC BID on days 1-10, and venetoclax PO once daily (QD) on
      days 1-21 of cycle 2. All patients receive cladribine IV daily over 1-2 hours of cycles 5-6,
      9-10, 13-14, and 17-18, cytarabine SC BID on days 1-3 of cycles 5-6, 9-10, 13-14, and 17-18,
      venetoclax PO QD on days 1-21 of cycle 3-18, and azacitidine SC daily or IV over 30-60
      minutes on days 1-7 of cycles 3-4, 7-8, 1-12, and 15-18. Treatment repeats every 28 days for
      up to 18 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6-12 months for 5 years.
