      population. They also have decreased physical and functional capacity. Exercise has shown to
      improve cognition in general population. This study will evaluate if exercise improves
      cognition in dialysis patients. It will also evaluate whether exercise affects performance in
      daily activities, mood or depression and inflammatory markers in the blood.
