      satisfaction of pretreatment with Picato® gel 4 days prior to methyl aminolevulinate
      photodynamic therapy (MAL PDT). This test area will be compared to Picato® treatment alone or
      MAL PDT alone treatment areas as well as a control field (no treatment).

      Rationale This study focuses on the topical treatment of actinic keratosis. Patients
      diagnosed with actinic keratosis who are eligible to receive topical treatment with ingenol
      mebutate (Picato®) and photodynamic therapy will act both as the test group and the control
      group. Patients will be followed through appointments with the study nurse and dermatologist.

      Patient treatment eligibility and regimen for prescribed medication are at Dr. Rivers (and
      patient's) discretion. Patients will be followed in the study for the duration of one
      complete treatment plus 2 months.

      Study duration:

      The inclusion period is 6 months, depending on the speed of patient recruitment. The study
      duration for each individual patient will end eight weeks after treatment completion.
