      This is a retrospective review of data on patient characteristics (such as age, gender,
      co-morbidities), procedure specifications and indications, and outcomes of lead extraction
      done at OHSU.

      Patients who have undergone either pacemaker or defibrillator lead extraction will have their
      charts reviewed for the desired data, which will then be compiled into a database. All
      procedures will be part of routine clinical care.

      Data Analysis:

      This is an observational registry study; there are no primary or secondary outcomes. Data
      will be analyzed to determine patient and procedural characteristics, procedure indications,
      complications and outcomes
