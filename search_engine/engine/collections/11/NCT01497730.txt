    
      The study is designed as a prospective, single arm stratified, multi-center investigation.

      Approximately 20 study sites, worldwide, will enroll 840 patients (840 knees). Each study
      site is expected to enroll approximately 42 patients (42 knees). Cohort reallocation is
      permitted. There will be no control group. Eight hundred forty (840) Subjects will be
      stratified into 4 subgroups of 210: fixed bearing cruciate retaining (FB CR), fixed bearing
      posterior stabilized (FB PS), rotating platform cruciate retaining (RP CR), and rotating
      platform posterior stabilized (RP PS).

      Treatment assignment in this study is not randomized. Each site will only enroll patients in
      one of the four knee configuration sub-groups most commonly used as their standard of care.
