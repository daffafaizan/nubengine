      I. To determine correlation between 18F-FDOPA PET activity, MRI contrast enhancement, and
      high- or low-grade glioma biopsies.

      II. To compare radiotherapy target volume delineation with and without 18F- FDOPA-PET
      metabolic imaging information to determine role of metabolic imaging in radiotherapy
      treatment planning.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine correlation between concordance of 18F-FDOPA PET activity, MRI contrast
      enhancement, and high- or low-grade glioma biopsies and patient outcomes including overall
      survival and progression free survival.

      OUTLINE:

      Beginning at no more than 1 week before biopsy and resection, patients undergo fluorine F 18
      fluorodopa-labeled PET/CT scan and pre-operative MRI. Patients then undergo stereotactic
      craniotomy. Some patients may also undergo radiation therapy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every year for 5 years.
