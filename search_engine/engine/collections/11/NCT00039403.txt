      I. To determine the safety and toxicity profile of UCN-01 when given in combination with
      gemcitabine to patients with unresectable or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.

      II. To characterize the pharmacokinetic profiles of gemcitabine and UCN-01 when given in
      combination and to correlate various measurements of UCN-01 with intracellular
      concentrations.

      III. To determine recommended doses of UCN-01 and gemcitabine in combination to be used in a
      planned subsequent phase II trial.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To record the frequency, extent, and duration of any tumor responses. II. To correlate
      serum alpha-1 acid glycoprotein (AGP) levels with UCN-01 pharmacokinetics and toxicity.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 1-2 hours on days 1 and 8 followed by UCN-01 IV over 3
      hours on day 1. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Sequential dose escalation of UCN-01 is followed by sequential dose
      escalation of gemcitabine.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of UCN-01 and then gemcitabine until the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the combination is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose
      preceding that at which at least 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.
      Once the MTD is determined, at least 6 patients are treated at the recommended phase II dose.
