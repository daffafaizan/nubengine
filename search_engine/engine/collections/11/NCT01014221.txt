      study. Those who had fixed sensory complaint over the median nerve and thenar muscle atrophy
      were excluded. The CTS patients were randomly divided into 2 treatment arms: (1) 2 weeks of
      prednisolone 20 mg daily followed by 2 weeks of prednisolone 10 mg daily (n =39), and
      (2)acupuncture administered in 8 sessions over 4 weeks (n=38). A validated standard
      questionnaire as a subjective measurement was used to rate the 5 major symptoms (pain,
      numbness, paresthesia,weakness/clumsiness, and nocturnal awakening) on a scale from 0 (no
      symptoms) to 10 (very severe). The total score in each of the 5 categories was termed the
      global symptom score (GSS). Patients completed standard questionnaires at baseline and 2 and
      4 weeks later. The changes in GSS were analyzed to evaluate the statistical significance. NCS
      were performed at baseline and repeated at the end of the study to assess improvement. All
      main analyses used intent-to-treat.
