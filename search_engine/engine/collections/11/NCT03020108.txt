      2 cc blood samples will be drawn from the antecubital vein for serum analysis of caspase 3,
      annexin a2 and soluble fas levels before the operations. The patients will divide into three
      groups. The group 1 will comprise of 30 patients with benign ovarian cysts such as mature
      teratoma or simple serous cysts on ultrasound examination. The group 2 will comprise of 30

      Reproductive Medicine classification. The blood samples will be kept in -80 C degree after
      centrifuge till at the end of the study.The relation between serum caspase 3, annexin a2 and
      soluble fas levels and severity of endometriosis will be analysed.
