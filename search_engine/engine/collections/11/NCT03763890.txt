      burning and other sever condition and characterized by diffuse alveolar damage and alveolar
      heterogeneity.ARDS patient need MV(mechanical ventilation )to maintain oxygenation and need
      unique MV tragedy to avoid VILI(Ventilator induced Lung injury ).PEEP(post-end-expiratory
      pressure) is crucial to maintain oxygenation and avoid VILI according to researches. But
      there are also some other research different voice. This study try to use EIT ( Electronic
      impedance tomography ) to evaluate the alveolar heterogeneity and use trans-pulmonary
      pressure and stain to evaluate the lung injury . The study use these methods to figure out
      how PEEP impact the alveolar heterogeneity and VILI.
