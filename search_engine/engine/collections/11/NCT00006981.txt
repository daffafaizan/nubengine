      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose and toxic effects of SS1(dsFv)-PE38 immunotoxin in
           patients with advanced malignancies that express mesothelin.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the response in patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the plasma pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive SS1(dsFv)-PE38 immunotoxin IV continuously on days 1-10. Treatment repeats
      every 4 weeks for a maximum of 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of SS1(dsFv)-PE38 immunotoxin until the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at
      which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.
