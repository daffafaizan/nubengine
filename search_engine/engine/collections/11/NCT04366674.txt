      who received Langenbeck surgery without specific restoration of levator veli palatini or
      tensor veli palatini. Group 2: patients who received palate surgery with special levator veli
      palatini restoration. Group 3: patients who received palate surgery with modified tensor veli
      palatini restoration. The conductive auditory brainstem response and 226 Hz tympanometry were
      used to test the audiological and otological status of the three groups. Preoperative and
      postoperative results were compared intragroup and intergroup.
