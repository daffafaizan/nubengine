      The Acute Respiratory Syndrome by Corona Virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), first discovered in December
      2019 in Wuhan/China, is causing a worldwide pandemic with potentially lethal implications on
      an individual basis, and, on the large scale bringing the health care systems and the economy
      to its limits. The mortality rate of this COronaVIrus induced Disease, COVID-19, has been
      estimated by the World Health Organization (WHO) to be 3.7%, which is more than 10-fold
      higher than the mortality of influenza.

      An infection with SARS-CoV-2 may cause an excessive host immune response, leading to an Acute
      Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and death. Reports from China and from Italy describe an
      overwhelming inflammation which is triggered by the virus, causing a cytokine storm with
      features of Cytokine-Release Syndrome (CRS) and/or Macrophage Activation Syndrome (MAS).
      Pro-inflammatory cytokines such as Interleukin-6 (IL-6) are elevated in the plasma of
      patients and features of MAS in COVID-19 include elevated levels of ferritin, d-dimer and low
      platelets.

      There is increasing evidence, that cytokine-targeted biological therapies can improve
      outcomes in CRS or MAS and even in sepsis. In recognition of the dramatic development of the
      COVID-19 pandemic, and in a pragmatic manner, already approved and safe therapies should be
      evaluated for the use in severe COVID-19.

      Tocilizumab (TCZ), an anti-IL-6R biological therapy, has been approved for the treatment of
      CRS and is used in patients with MAS (and in other rheumatologic conditions like Rheumatoid
      Arthritis (RA) or Giant Cell Arteritis (GCA), with a good safety profile also in the
      elderly).

      Collectively, the data strongly suggest that neutralization of the inflammatory pathway
      induced by IL-6 may reduce mortality in patients with severe COVID-19 prone to CRS and ARDS.
