      predictor for poor short and long-term survival. Delayed graft function increases
      post-transplantation morbidity, hospital stay, and incidence of premature graft failure.
      However, the definition of delayed graft function varies and more than ten definitions have
      been used in previous studies. Although the definition using dialysis requirements during
      seven days after transplantation has been used most frequently, dialysis may be required
      without any evidence of renal damage during one week after transplantation. Furthermore, the
      incidence of delayed graft function in living donor kidney transplantation using this
      definition has been reported to be relatively low (as low as 1.6%) compared with the
      incidence in deceased donor kidney transplantation (up to 50%). Therefore, it is required to
      establish a better definition of delayed graft function in deceased donor kidney
      transplantation. We attempt to compare various definitions of delayed graft function in
      deceased donor kidney transplantation and find the definition that can predict graft function
      survival best in deceased donor kidney transplantation.
