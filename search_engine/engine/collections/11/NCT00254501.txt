      visits to usual care can improve clinical outcomes in patients with diabetes. The central
      hypothesis is that a program overseen by community pharmacists that empowers patients to
      self-manage their diabetes will lead to improved clinical and humanistic outcomes and will be
      cost-effective. Strong preliminary data collected from other sites suggests that patient
      empowerment programs are effective at reducing hemoglobin A1C after 12 months and in reducing
      the total cost of care. This hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims to
      evaluate the impact of a pharmacist-administered diabetes patient empowerment program on:

        1. clinical markers for diabetes and related metabolic disorders;

        2. the cost of care and resource utilization; and

        3. patient knowledge and perceived ability to manage diabetes. There is an additional
           specific aim to assess the pharmacists with respect to satisfaction with the training
           program and the overall project, the activities conducted in patient sessions, and the
           time taken to complete the visits in this study.
