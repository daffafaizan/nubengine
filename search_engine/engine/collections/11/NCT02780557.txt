      advantaged peers. While many factors contribute to language ability, two aspects of the early
      caregiving environment are known to be correlated with child language outcomes 1)
      caregiver-child book reading and 2) caregiver contingent talk. Contingent talk refers to a
      style of communication whereby the caregiver talks about what is in their infant's current
      focus of attention. This style of talking can be facilitated when parents read books with
      their babies. The aim of this research is to establish whether asking parents to engage in
      contingent talk in the context of book reading promotes vocabulary learning. This study will
      compare the effects of an intervention to promote contingent talk against a control where
      parents are given books but not given any training in how to read them in a contingent
      manner. The study will include children from socio-economically advantaged and disadvantaged
      families.
