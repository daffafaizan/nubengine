    
      EVI-3 is a phase 2 international, multicentre, randomized, parallel-group,
      placebo-controlled, double-blind study of the efficacy and safety of oral vitamin C
      supplement in combination with azacitidine (AZA) in patients with higher-risk myeloid
      malignancies with or without mutations in genes recurrently affected in myeloid malignancies.
      Treatment allocation is in 1:1 ratio (vitamin C vs. placebo) by block randomization
      stratified by clinical site. Study entry is staggered. Patients are randomized to either oral
      vitamin C 1000 mg daily or placebo from start of AZA treatment until end of study (EOS) or
      until AZA treatment is discontinued at the discretion of the treating physician, whichever
      occurs earlier. The accrual time is estimated to 48 months and 6 months follow-up, thus,
      maximum treatment duration will be approximately 54 months. A total of 196 patients is
      planned for enrollment.

      Study visits are scheduled at baseline, after 1st AZA treatment cycle, after 6 AZA treatment
      cycles, and, if AZA treatment is continued, at EOS or end of AZA treatment. Evaluations at
      study visits include bone marrow investigation, peripheral blood tests, patient-reported
      outcome measures, adverse events and compliance. Bone marrow aspirate and peripheral blood
      will be collected for biobank at each study visit.

      All patients will undergo follow-up once yearly from EOS. Follow-up will include information
      on duration of AZA therapy, survival and disease progression from myelodysplastic syndrome
      (MDS) or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) to acute myeloid leukemia (AML), if diagnosed
      following a clinical indication for a bone marrow test.
