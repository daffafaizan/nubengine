      in evaluating study variables. Electrocardiography, noninvasive blood pressure, heart rate,
      and peripheral oxygen saturation were monitored for all patients before, while, and after
      conducting procedure.

      For US-guided SGB, patients are supine positioned, and skin preparation on injection site is
      done with chlorohexidine. Procedure is conducted under ultrasound guidance at C6 level. 4ml,
      6ml, and 8ml of 1% lidocaine is injected for the each group, respectively. Syringes are
      prepared by one nurse who do not involved in other steps of this study.

      Temperature measurement is conducted 4 times (before US-guided SGB and after 10, 20, and 30m
      from SGB) at both hands, face, axillar by one person who's not involved in other measuring in
      the study.
