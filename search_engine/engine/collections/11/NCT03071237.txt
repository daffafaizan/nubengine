      cancer patients, the pylorus-preserving gastrectomy requires the preserving of IPA. In
      advanced gastric cancer patients, the subgroup of No. 6 lymph node might be associated with
      IPA. In Japanese Gastric Cancer Association(JGCA) gastric cancer classification guidelines,
      the No. 6 lymph nodes is defined as lymph nodes along the first branch and proximal part of
      the right gastroepiploic artery(RGEA) down to the confluence of the right gastroepiploic vein
      and the anterior superior pancreatoduodenal vein. However,if IPA origins from the
      gastroduodenal artery(GDA) or anterior superior pancreatoduodenal artery(ASPDA), the lymph
      nodes along the IPA can not be grouped into the No. 6 lymph nodes. Thus, a new definition of
      No. 6 lymph nodes is needed on the basis of the origin of IPA.

      Previous studies about IPA origin are few and the origin of IPA varies greatly among
      different studies.
