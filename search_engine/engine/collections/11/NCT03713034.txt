      Further adapt and expand our culturally and socially-tailored videogame to have a greater
      focus on HIV testing and counseling (HTC) in addition to HIV prevention in an older age group
      of 14-18 year old boys and girls.

      This will be accomplished by refining the conceptual model of the theoretical mechanisms of
      behavior change to be applied specifically within the game. New content will be created with
      additional input from 4 focus groups of 5 adolescents each (n = 20, aged 14-18) and these
      participants will also play-test the game. In addition, this model will inform new
      intervention manuals ("Game Playbooks") targeting these new outcomes. Building the new
      content from focus groups into the game are intended to adapt and expand its scope.

      A system will be established for the newly adapted game for web access/distribution and
      program integration. Work will continue with commercialization partners on widespread
      distribution of the adapted game.

      The final piece of the study will be to conduct a randomized controlled trial in 296
      adolescents (aged 14-18) to evaluate the acceptability and efficacy of the adapted game on
      its new web-based platform compared with a set of control games.
