      evidence with clinical expertise to design a detailed training protocol for RT in patients
      with different severity of stroke. The other is to examine the effects on UE motor function
      and explore the client perspective.

      The training protocol was developed based on the ACE Star Cycle Knowledge Transformation
      Model, which includes steps such as summarizing previous evidence and adjusting the protocol
      after practice by therapists. Purposive sampling will be used to recruit 35patients with
      stroke with different severities (Brunnstrom stage of distal part: 10 for stage II~III /10
      for stage IV /15 for stage V~VI) from a regional hospital in Taiwan. Each participant will
      receive 12-15 sessions of 50-60 minutes intervention over 3 weeks. Motor function evaluations
      will be administered before and after the intervention. Wilcoxon Signed Rank test will be
      used to examine the change between the pretest and posttest.
