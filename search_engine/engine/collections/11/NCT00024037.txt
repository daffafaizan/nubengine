    
      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine whether low-energy laser therapy can prevent oral mucositis in
      patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Patients are
      randomized to one of three treatment arms. Arm I: Patients undergo low-energy laser therapy
      with visible red light (650 nm) daily over 15-20 minutes beginning on the first day of their
      transplant conditioning regimen and continuing until day 2 after bone marrow transplantation.
      Arm II: Patients undergo low-energy laser therapy with invisible infra-red light (780 nm)
      daily on the same schedule as in arm I. Arm III: Patients undergo sham laser therapy daily on
      the same schedule as in arm I. Patients are followed on days 3, 7, 10, 14, 18, 21, and 24.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 66 patients (22 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
