      in the trunk and hip muscles have been shown in those with pregnancy-related low back pain.
      Lumbopelvic stabilization exercises have been shown to decrease pain and disability in those
      with low back pain. However, there have been very few studies with post-partum women,
      specifically those who have undergone Caesarian section births.

      The purpose of this study is to examine the effectiveness of lumbopelvic stabilization
      exercises on women who have undergone Caesarian sections on: 1) disability using the Modified
      Oswestry Low Back Disability Index (OSW), 2) pain according to the Numeric Pain Rating Scale
      (NPRS), 3) percent change of muscle thickness of the deep abdominals using ultrasound
      imaging, and 4) perceived improvement using the Global Rating of Change (GROC).
