      that might contribute to increased risks of an abnormal Pap smear in Appalachian women in
      Ohio. To accomplish these aims, a case-control study was proposed. Women age 18 and older
      with an intact cervix, not pregnant, and no current or past history of invasive cervical
      cancer are recruited at the time of their scheduled Pap smear from clinics/physician
      practices in Appalachian region of Ohio. Women receiving Pap tests at participating medical
      clinics/physician practices are recruited for a case control epidemiologic study assessing
      HPV prevalence and its impact on cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). Cervical mucus
      will be collected for Human Papillomavirus (HPV) assays and stored for potential other assays
      related to HPV. Serum will be drawn for HPV serology and stored for future analysis. Controls
      are defined as women with a normal Pap smear. Cases are defined as women with abnormal Pap
      smear (from atypical squamous cells of uncertain significance (ASCUS) to cancer.
