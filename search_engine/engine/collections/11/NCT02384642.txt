      program for adolescent girls. The study will seek to determine whether the structured
      intervention with girls' parents has an added impact on outcomes improve girls' safety and
      well-being. Research will focus on unpacking the components of the program in order to
      determine which components or combination of components have the most impact. This research
      will include a mix of qualitative and quantitative approaches to establish a foundation for
      good programming that supports adolescent girls' safe and healthy transition into adulthood.

      The study assessment will employ a mixed methods approach with most data collection occurring
      at pre-test/baseline and post-intervention, although a qualitative assessment will also be
      performed at the intervention midpoint as a process indicator. Quantitative survey methods
      will be used to evaluate attitudes towards a host of topics related to physical and financial
      assets and health-related behaviors. Survey questions will be administered using Audio
      Computer Assisted Self-Interviewing (ACASI) and Computer-Assisted Personal Interviewing
      (CAPI). Quantitative methods will be used to yield statistical measures of the scale of
      changes in attitudes, skills, and behaviors due to the intervention.

      Qualitative methods will include in-depth semi-structured interviews and focus group
      discussions with girls, their family members and mentors, as well as participatory methods
      with girls to assess topics such as self-esteem, empowerment, and resilience.
