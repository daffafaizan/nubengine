      two mydriatic treatments, with an optimal duration and a good tolerance of the drugs. The
      study will evaluate the mydriasis in premature newborns, neonates and infants justifying a
      mydriasis for a bilateral diagnosis fundus, using ophthalmic insert Mydriasert® versus
      reference treatment (association of phenylephrine and tropicamide eyedrops). Ophthalmic
      insert Mydriasert® can control drug dispensation and decrease the number of nurse
      interventions to obtain mydriasis in patients.
