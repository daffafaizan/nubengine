      allocated to the treatment group and the observation group by the stratification factor; the
      institution. Each group is determined to have same number of study population. This study is
      open labeled and follow the permuted block design. Also the patients will be allocated by
      randomized table provided by a statistician. If it is converted to e-CRF, randomization of
      the patients will be performed by the automated computer program.

      Total 1012 patients will be enrolled to this study. Among 506 high risk stage 1B
      adenocarcinoma patients, patients will be allocated to the treatment and the observation
      groups, 253 patients each. Also 506 low risk stage 1B adenocarcinoma patients will be
      enrolled as the observation group. Because, among stage 1B patients, it was revealed that the
      high risk patients whose nomogram point exceeds 104 occupied about 50% in analysis.

      Estimated 3 year disease free survival for the treatment group and the observation group is
      66% and 54%, respectively. The 3 year disease free survival rate for the observation group
      was estimated based on retrospective multicenter study on 1132 stage 1 NSCLC patients,
      previously reported in Korea. During the 3 year of follow up duration, the withdrawal rate
      was presumed to be 10% because of loss of follow-up, violation of the consent and other
      causes. Study population enrollment is estimated as 48 months and mean follow-up duration is
      estimated as 24 months. Total duration of the study is set as 72 months. In this study
      design, the number of the high risk patients of each group is 253 and it supports 80% power
      of test with a two-sided alpha level of 0.05.
