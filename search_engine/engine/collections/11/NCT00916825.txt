      home. They face additional challenges and stress, their children are also affected by the
      mother's illness. The oncological rehabilitation programme "getting better together",
      administered by the Rexrodt von Fircks Foundation and the Clinic Ostseedeich in Groemitz,
      Germany, focuses on these special family needs. This waiting-control-group-study, designed
      and executed at the Philipps University Marburg Medical Center, Department of Child and
      Adolescent Psychiatry, examines the effectiveness of the intervention by accompanying the
      patients and their children over the course of a year and assessing their quality of life and
      psychological health.

      The primary outcome measure for mothers is the health related quality of life as assessed by
      the EORTC QLQ-C30 and BR-23; children's adaptation is assessed with the ILK (Inventory for
      the Assessment of Quality of Life of Children and Adolescents) as well as the Strengths and
      Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ)
