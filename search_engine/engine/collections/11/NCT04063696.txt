      complete 3 questionnaires in order for the researchers to understand more about the
      background of patients who have teeth extracted at the centre. The study will focus on the
      patient's previous experience of dentistry such as whether they have had antibiotics
      prescribed for toothache, whether they suffer from dental anxiety and how they regularly look
      after their oral health.
