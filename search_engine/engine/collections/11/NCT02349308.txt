      similar to other "split tip" catheters in the market: outflow ("arterial") and return
      ("venous") lumens that separate, a subcutaneous Dacron® cuff, extension sets with clamps and
      caps, and construction from Carbothane® material. The CentrosFLO™ catheter contains two small
      pressure-relief holes near the tips.

      The main difference of the CentrosFLO catheter is in the design of the tip. Current "split
      tip" catheters have two free ends that diverge, but are each essentially straight segments.
      In the CentrosFLO catheter the arterial lumen bends in an arc back towards the venous lumen,
      and the venous lumen bends towards the arterial lumen. As a result, the catheter has two
      curved surfaces that will rest against the vena cava wall to automatically "center" the
      catheter within the vein. The contact points of the catheter against the vena cava wall
      should be smaller and more disperse than with current straight-tip or split catheters. The
      following drawing demonstrates the design of the catheter, showing the current recommendation
      that the arterial port always be to the left.

      The goal of the study is to demonstrate the stability of blood flow with the CentrosFLO
      catheter, during intermittent dialysis over a period of 6 months after placement. The
      investigators plan to enroll 10 patients in the study.
