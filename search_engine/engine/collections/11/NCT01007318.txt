      acute appendectomy. In addition, recently single port laparoscopic surgery was introduced in
      the laparoscopy-dedicated center. When compared with conventional 3 port laparoscopic
      appendectomy, single port laparoscopic appendectomy was expected to be less painful, more
      rapid recovery of bowel function, and better cosmetic. In this prospective randomized trial,
      we tried to investigate the superiority of this new technique in adult patients with acute
      appendectomy.
