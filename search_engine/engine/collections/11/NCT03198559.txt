      individuals on antiretroviral therapy (ART) is the use of pharmacological agents to reverse
      HIV latency, thereby initiating virus-mediated cell lysis or immune-mediated killing. Recent
      clinical trials of latency reversing agents (LRAs) in HIV infected subjects on ART, including
      histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) and the anti-alcoholism drug disulfiram, have shown
      that inducing an increase in Cell Associated Unspliced (CA-US) HIV RNA or plasma HIV RNA is
      possible. Yet, these interventions did not have a demonstrable effect on the frequency of
      latently infected cells or time to viral rebound after cessation of ART, potentially because
      latency reversal alone didn't trigger an adequate immune response or cell death or that the
      potency of latency reversal with a single-agent intervention over a very short period of
      time, lacked sufficient potency, as suggested by recent in vitro studies. It is highly likely
      that long-term remission off ART will require interventions that lead to both a reduction in
      latently infected cells and an increase in HIV-specific immunity, therefore identifying a
      strategy to increase viral antigens on the surface of latently infected cells will be a key
      component of this strategy.
