      disease and compare it to controls Thus, the investigators will be able to see if iron starts
      to accumulate in those patients, way before motor symptoms of Parkinson disease develop.
      Hypothetically, an iron chelator drug could remove excessive iron from the brain and slow
      down process of neurodegeneration. A precise technique to measure iron in the brain and to
      detect small changes therefore is needed as a radiological marker of disease progression
      and/or therapeutic effect in clinical trials.
