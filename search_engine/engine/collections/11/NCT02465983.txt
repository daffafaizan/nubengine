    
      Immunotherapy is a novel and promising approach for the treatment of solid tumors;
      immunotherapy with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells (CART cells) in particular has the
      potential advantage of targeted therapies that can invoke a rapid tumor response, and the
      advantage of long-lived responses that are the hallmark of engagement of the adaptive immune
      system such as memory T cells.

      This is a single arm, open-label, phase I study to determine the safety and feasibility of
      combination CART-meso cells (autologous T cells lentivirally transduced to express
      anti-mesothelin scFv fused to TCRζ and 4-1BB costimulatory domains) and CART19 cells
      (autologous T cells lentivirally transduced to express a humanized anti-CD19 scFv fused to
      TCRζ and 4-1BB costimulatory domains) in patients with pancreatic cancer following
      lymphodepletion with cyclophosphamide.
