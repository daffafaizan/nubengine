      behavior, vomiting, and dumping in 100 patients who undergo bariatric surgery. Patients are
      put into one of two conditions; they will either receive standard postoperative care or
      biweekly counseling sessions with a dietician that will help them with the postoperative
      diet. Patients who receive dietary counseling are anticipated to experience greater weight
      loss and report less consumption of sugar and fat as compared to patients who do not receive
      dietary counseling. Moreover, patients who receive dietary counseling are predicted to report
      less frequent nausea, vomiting, and gastric dumping, as compared to patients who do not
      receive postoperative dietary counseling. This is predicted to result as a consequence of
      increased dietary adherence evidenced by the former group.
