      with stereotactic radiation for early stage lung cancer and who are at high risk for
      microscopic metastatic disease.

      Chemotherapy in the form of cisplatin/docetaxel or cisplatin/pemetrexed will be administered
      approximately six weeks after Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT). Patients will then
      undergo follow up clinical evaluation and imaging to evaluate treatment response and for
      surveillance.

      A patient population of 65 patients will be required. Enrollment in this protocol is planned
      by multi center involvement in the state of Kentucky as part of the Kentucky Trial Network
      (KTN).
