      the effect of single dose intravenous rifampin on the single-dose PK of oral TAK-906 in
      healthy adult participants.

      The study will enroll approximately 12 participants. Participants will be randomly assigned
      to one of the two treatment sequences AB or BA:

        -  Sequence AB: TAK-906 25 mg, followed by a washout period of at least 7 days, then
           Rifampin 600 mg and TAK-906 25 mg

        -  Sequence BA: Rifampin 600 mg and TAK-906 25 mg, followed by a washout period of at least
           7 days, then TAK-906 25 mg

      This single center trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall time to
      participate in this study is 49 Days. All participants will make final visit 14 days after
      receiving their last dose of study drug for follow up assessment.
