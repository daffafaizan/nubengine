      and mortality, especially in hypovolemic patients. Ultrasonographic measurement of internal
      jugular vein (IJV) has been recently shown as effective in predicting the intravascular
      volume status. The aim was to investigate the reliability of preanesthetic ultrasound
      measurements of IJV in predicting hypotension after spinal anesthesia.
