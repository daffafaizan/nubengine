      to an extent such that complete macroscopic resection is technically feasible, but an R0
      resection poses a challenge when surgery is the primary therapy. Therefore, a different
      management strategy may be beneficial.

      The primary outcome of the PANCREAS trial is defined as the proportion of eligible patients
      enrolled in the study over an 18-month period and the proportion of patients who complete the
      protocol (neoadjuvant therapy and pancreatectomy). Certain modifications of the neoadjuvant
      therapy protocol are expected and allowed, and the primary feasibility outcome will be one of
      the following: stop, main study non-feasible; continue with protocol modifications; or
      continue without modification. A safety analysis will be performed after first 15 patients
      are enrolled and complete neoadjuvant therapy and surgery. Patients enrolled in this trial
      will undergo interventions in the following order: neoadjuvant chemotherapy, re-staging CT
      scan, SBRT, re-staging CT scan, pancreatectomy and adjuvant chemotherapy. Postoperative
      mortality will be recorded up to 90 days after surgery. Patients will be followed every four
      months with a CT scan of the chest/abdomen for two years after resection or until evidence of
      disease recurrence. Patients who do not undergo surgical resection will be followed for two
      years after accrual (duration of study period) or until evidence of disease progression or
      death.
