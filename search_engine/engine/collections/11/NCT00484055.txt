      Local application directly in the surgical wound of aminoglycoside antibiotics (gentamicin)
      bound to collagen reduced the incidence of wound infection with more than 50 % in a previous
      prospective randomised trial.

      As the technique has been introduced in clinical practise two questions need to be monitored:

        -  Are there signs of change in the bacteria that cause the wound infections with a shift
           over time towards more gentamicin resistant agents?

        -  Is the effect of the prophylaxis still comparable to that which was seen in the previous
           study?

      Furthermore, results from the previous study indicated that the effect of the local
      antibiotic was better when combined with an extra rigid sternal wound infection, defined as
      at least one extra steel wire for sternal fixation.

      The study is conducted at those two Swedish cardiothoracic surgery centers where it was first
      studied. There are thus two objectives of the study: first to analyze the microbiologic
      findings of the sternal wound infections that occur, and secondly to monitor the incidence of
      sternal wound infection (especially deep infections) when the local collagen-gentamicin
      prophylaxis is used in daily routine in combination with a specific surgical technique for
      optimization of the strength of sternal fixation.
