      (100 patients/group); radiofrequency ablation using remote magnet navigation, radiofrequency
      ablation using manual method, and cryoablation. A loop recorder (REVEAL) is implanted one
      month before the catheter ablation of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and the effects of
      atrial fibrillation burden will be compared between the three methods at 12 and 24 months
      after ablation excluding the first three monthsÂ´ blanking period.

      The primary endpoints are:

        1. the proportion of patients remaining free from atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter or
           atrial tachycardia (> 2 minutes) recorded by the implantable cardiac monitor (Medtronic)
           at 24 months follow-up and

        2. total atrial fibrillation burden recorded by the loop recorder.

      Other endpoints:

        1. Atrial fibrillation burden in 7 days Holter recording at 12 and 24 months compared to
           baseline,

        2. the time to first documented symptomatic and asymptomatic recurrence of atrial
           fibrillation

        3. prescription of antiarrhythmic drugs after the 3 months blanking period following the
           ablation

        4. re-ablation after the index ablation procedure,

        5. total procedural duration;

        6. total time of fluoroscopy and radiation dose;

        7. number and duration of cardiovascular hospitalization;

        8. quality of life questionnaires at 12 months and 24 month compared with baseline,

        9. cognitive function at 12 and 24 month compared with baseline,

       10. cost-efficacy of the different ablation techniques.
