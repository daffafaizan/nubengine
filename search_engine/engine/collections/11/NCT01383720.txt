      and the lack of drug therapies to prevent, halt, or effectively slow the stenotic process.
      Transcatheter aortic valve replacement has become a viable alternative for treatment of
      severe symptomatic aortic stenosis in selected patients who are unsuitable candidates for
      surgical valve replacement. The Lotus Valve System is designed to enable precise placement
      and minimize or eliminate the paravalvular regurgitation and associated adverse events seen
      with earlier generation devices. The REPRISE I study assesses acute safety and performance.
