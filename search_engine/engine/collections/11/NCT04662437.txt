      through the droplet, has caused the global Coronavirus 19 (COVID-19) pandemic. COVID-19
      infection can be asymptomatic or lead to serious illness and even death. This virus causes a
      hypersensitive immune reaction and varying degrees of widespread inflammation through
      cytokines in various organs of the body, mainly the lungs.

      Cytokine-mediated widespread inflammation caused by the virus may also affect the parathyroid
      glands, causing their functions to deteriorate. Thus, it may cause changes in parathyroid
      hormone secretion.

      The researchers evaluated the results of serum parathyroid hormone, calcium, phosphorus,
      alkaline phosphatase tests in patients who were symptomatic and hospitalized with COVID-19
      infection. Participants also evaluated the relationship of parathormone with white blood
      cells, neutrophil / lymphocyte ratio, c reactive protein, fibrinogen, procalcitonin,
      ferritin, and D-dimer in these patients. The researchers compared the parathyroid hormone
      levels of patients with COVID-19 infection with the parathyroid hormone levels of healthy
      individuals without COVID-19 infection and parathyroid disease. So the investigators looked
      for differences in parathyroid hormone levels between both groups. Researchers did not
      include patients in the intensive care unit and patients with known parathyroid disease.
