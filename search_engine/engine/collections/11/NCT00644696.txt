      stem cell transplantation and radiation therapy, the long-term survival of patients with
      high-risk neuroblastoma remains poor. Patients who experience a relapse of their disease or
      fail to achieve complete remission fare even worse. More intense chemotherapy is not the
      answer. The development of new drugs with different mechanisms of action are required.

      Inhibitors of the proteasome have created a considerable interest in their use in cancer
      chemotherapy, either as a single agent or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents.
      The precise mechanism of action for these class of drugs is unclear, however, inhibition of
      I-kB degradation by VELCADEÂ® (bortezomib) decreases NF-kB activity in neuroblastoma cell
      lines as well as other systems.

      Previous studies have reported the activity of Irinotecan, a strong Topoisomerase-I
      inhibitor, against murine xenografts including those with high-risk features such as MYCN
      gene amplification (MYCN is also called V-Myc Myelocytomatosis Viral Related Oncogene,
      Neuroblastoma Derived). Irinotecan has also been shown to be active against neuroblastoma
      xenografts resistant to vincristine, melphalan, and topotecan, suggesting an alternative
      mechanism of resistance to Irinotecan. In vitro synergy between bortezomib and irinotecan has
      been documented in pancreatic cancer by others and in neuroblastoma by our group.
