      exceeds patient's inspiratory flow demand, to improve oxygenation. In a recent meta-analysis
      of seven trials with 1771 patients, HFNC was shown to improve oxygenation and avoid
      intubation in patients with severe hypoxemia. The high velocity of the gas can rinse the dead
      space of the upper airway and reduce CO2 rebreathing, reduce COPD patients' work of breathing
      and improve the dynamic compliance of respiratory system.

      Thus, we proposed a randomized controlled trial to investigate the value of high flow nasal
      cannula in weaning AECOPD patients from invasive ventilation, with comparison of noninvasive
      ventilation.
