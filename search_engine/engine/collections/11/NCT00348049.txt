      predictability, stability and safety of LASIK versus PRK in a volunteer group of myopic
      military servicemen recruited from the Singapore Armed Forces. 132 subjects who were eligible
      for the study were randomized to undergo either LASIK or PRK in both eyes in a 2:1 ratio. 45
      subjects (90 eyes) underwent PRK and 87 subjects (174 eyes) underwent LASIK.

      An additional 59 subject underwent a non-randomised arm of the study and underwent PRK.
