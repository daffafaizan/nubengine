    
      All the patients were premedicated with oral midazolam 0.5 mg/kg,1 hour prior to induction.
      General anesthesia was induced by inhaled sevoflurane.

      Laryngeal mask airway with appropriate-size for body weight was slipped, then an intravenous
      line was inserted,anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane (Minimum Alveolar Concentration
      (MAC)from 1-1.5 in air/oxygen to maintain the Heart rate (HR) and mean arterial blood
      pressure (MAP) within 20% of their baseline values.

      A rescue dose of fentanyl 0.5 µg/kg was given if the MAC of sevoflurane exceeded 1.7 whereas
      HR and MAP exceeded 20% of their baseline values.

      Fascia iliaca compartment block was performed as described by Dalens et al technique.

      An axillary nerve block needle was inserted with an angle of 45±60º with the skin at
      (0.5±1cm) below the inguinal crease at the junction of the medial two-thirds and the lateral
      one-third of the line between the pubic tubercle and anterior superior iliac spine.

      The needle was advanced until the perception of two losses of resistance (pop) was noted
      which corresponded to the crossing of fascia lata and then fascia iliaca.

      Hypotension was defined as systolic arterial pressure 70 plus twice the age in years and
      associated with altered peripheral perfusion.

      Bradycardia was defined as HR below 80 beats/min. Delayed anesthetic emergence was defined as
      20 min elapsing from the end of surgery to exiting the operating theater.
