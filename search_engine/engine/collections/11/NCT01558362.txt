    
      Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) is an
      established, cost effective tool for the risk stratification and management of patients
      suspected or known to have coronary artery disease (CAD)Myocardial perfusion imaging is
      significantly affected by interruptions in the supply of 99mMo, the parent isotope of 99mTc
      used for the majority of MPI. An alternative radiotracer, I123-CMICE-013,developed at the
      Canadian Molecular Imaging Center of Excellence (C-MICE) at the University of Ottawa Heart
      Institute, has completed pre-clinical trial testing and is ready for Phase 1 human trials.

      This Phase I study will be a single centre, open label study. Subjects will receive 2 doses
      of study drug. One rest dose and one stress dose will be administered on separate days, one
      week apart. Subjects will undergo a standard clinical exercise stress protocol for the stress
      dose. Gamma camera imaging following each administration will be done over 2 days.

      Biodistribution, pharmacokinetics, dosimetry and safety variables will be analyzed.
