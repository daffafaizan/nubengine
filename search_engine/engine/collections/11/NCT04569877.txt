      Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 and results in progression to the acute respiratory distress
      syndrome (ARDS). Apart from protective ventilation, fluid restriction, prone positioning and
      extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), no specific therapeutic options exist to treat
      this devastating disease with a mortality rate of up to 50%. The growth factor
      granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is widely recognized to promote
      differentiation and mobilization of different myeloid leukocyte subsets including
      neutrophils, tissue macrophages/dendritic cells or their circulating precursors. GM-CSF was
      found to be crucial for alveolar epithelial repair following hyperoxic and inflammatory lung
      injury.The aim of the current trial is to prevent progression to ARDS in COVID-19 pneumonia
      patients by preemptive GM-CSF Inhalation.
