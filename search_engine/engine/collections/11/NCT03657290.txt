    
      This is a randomized, open-label, single-dose, three-period crossover study in healthy adults
      to assess the bioequivalence of 3 X 150 mg vadadustat tablets (Test) compared to a single 450
      mg vadadustat tablet (reference). Blood samples for vadadustat PK will be collected at
      pre-dose (0 hour) and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 5, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 32, 40, and 48
      hours post-dose. The study will also assess the effect of food on vadadustat bioavailability
      by evaluating the pharmacokinetics of the 450 mg tablet in fed and fasted subjects.
