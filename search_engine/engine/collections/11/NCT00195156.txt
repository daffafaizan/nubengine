      all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA-IV) in patients with advanced solid tumor malignancies.

      This will be a 2-step dose escalation study. Once the patient starts therapy at a designated
      dose level, it will not be escalated for that patient. Three patients at each dose level must
      complete 4 weeks of therapy before escalating to the next higher level. If none of the
      patients experience dose limiting toxicity (DLT), then 3 new patients will be treated with
      the next higher dose level.
