      acute myeloid leukemia, indicating its critical role in leukemogenesis. IDH2 mutations
      account for about 10%-20% of AML patients. IDH2 mutation is found to be associated with
      production of 2-HG, which interferes with histone methylation and DNA modification, results
      in partial block of myeloid cell differentiation. IDH inhibitors have shown in preclinical
      model to reverse differentiation blockage in tumor cells. The assessment of IDH2 inhibitors
      is ongoing with phase I/II clinical trials. The analysis of IDH2 mutation in AML patients
      will help to identify AML patients who might benefit from IDH inhibitor treatment.

      Bone marrow samples from 300 adult patients (>20 years old) with newly diagnosed AML since
      2014/1/1 and received standard chemotherapy in hospitals which has jointed Ministry of Health
      and Welfare AML program will be examined. The mononuclear cells are extracted from bone
      marrow samples at the initial diagnosis. The mutational analysis of exon 4 of IDH2 gene will
      be performed by PCR amplication followed by pyrosequencing to detect IDH2-R140 and R172
      mutations and mutant levels. Follow-up samples of patients carrying IDH2 mutations at the
      time of achieving hematologic remission, subsequent samples during different time points
      including at least following two post-remission chemotherapy, at the end of therapy and every
      3 months thereafter in the first year and then every 6 months up to 24 months, as well as at
      time of relapse, will be measured by LNA-quantitative real-time PCR with TaqMan probe assay
      to determine the changes of IDH2 mutant levels.
