      slice thickness of 0.35 mm and without inter-slice gap), and calculated not only the IPFP
      maximal sagittal area and IPFP volume, but also the quantitated signal, and compared the
      differences between healthy controls and osteoarthritis patients. This is an observational
      cross-sectional study without specific interventions to the subjects. MRI is a regular
      examination in our hospital. And all subjects are included for the reasons of osteoarthritis
      (need MRI) and healthy controls (pain but not osteoarthritis, also need MRI). The
      investigator does not assign specific interventions to the subjects of the study.
