      dependent on active student involvement. Constructing VP cases rather than solving them may
      engage students more actively in encoding new information and integrating it with previous
      knowledge.

      Fourth-year medical students were included and randomized to constructing (intervention) or
      solving (control) four cardiopulmonary VP cases. The participants were presented with a short
      case overview. The control group solved the cases, whereas the intervention group also
      received the final diagnosis and had to complete the history, physical findings, and lab
      results. After a week, participants completed a transfer test involving two standardized
      patients presenting a respiratory case and a cardiology case, respectively. Performances were
      video-recorded and subsequently assessed by two blinded raters using the
      Reporter-Interpreter- Manager-Educator (RIME) framework. Knowledge gains were assessed using
      a pre- and post-test of a 95-item Multiple-Response-Questionnaire (MRQ).
