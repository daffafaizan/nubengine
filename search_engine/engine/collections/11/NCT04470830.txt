    
      This is a long-term prospective, observational post-marketing surveillance study of
      azilsartan medoxomil/chlorthalidone FDC in participants with essential hypertension. The
      study will assess the safety and effectiveness of azilsartan medoxomil/chlorthalidone FDC
      prescribed as a monotherapy or taken concomitantly with other anti-hypertension therapies in
      participants whose blood pressure is not properly controlled by azilsartan medoxomil
      monotherapy or who require administration of multiple drugs in order to reach the target
      blood pressure in routine clinical settings.

      The study will enroll and will consider approximately 600 participants. These participants
      will be grouped with the ones treated with azilsartan medoximil monotherpy. The data will be
      prospectively collected, at the centers from medical files and recorded into electronic case
      report forms (e-CRFs). All the participants will be assigned to a single observational
      cohort:

      â€¢ Participants With Essential Hypertension

      The multi-center study will be conducted in South Korea. Data collection will be based on
      routinely scheduled and emergency visits over the surveillance period, scheduled at Visit 1
      (Baseline), Visit 2 (6 weeks), Visit 3 (at least 3 months to 6 months) and Visit 4 (6 months
      or more up to 9 months) after drug administration. The overall duration of the study will be
      approximately 5 years. All participants will be followed up for 9 months after drug
      administration.
