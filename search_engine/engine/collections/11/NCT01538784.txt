      meal-stimulated gastric acid secretion and enhance gastric emptying of a liquid meal in man.
      Therefore YF476 might benefit patients with reflux oesophagitis. The compound has been
      remarkably well tolerated in animal toxicity studies at doses well in excess of the projected
      therapeutic dose in patients, and merits first administration to healthy volunteers. That
      study using the oral route of administration is described here. Extrapolation from data
      obtained with pentagastrin in animals suggest that single doses of less than 1mg of YF476
      should be active in man. However, extrapolation from data obtained in comparative studies
      with the H2-antagonists and with omeprazole in animals suggest that the therapeutic dose in
      patients with reflux oesophagitis will be larger, in the region of 10mg. A range of single
      doses will be used in this study. The maximum dose will be 10 times more than the expected
      therapeutic dose.
