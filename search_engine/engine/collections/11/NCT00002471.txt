      nonlymphoblastic lymphoma and acute B-lymphoblastic leukemia using an intensive, short-course
      regimen of combination chemotherapy. II. Assess the toxicity of the regimen.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 30 patients, accrued from 4 institutions, will be entered. If
      at any time more than 3 patients are not "event free", the trial will be terminated early,
      with patients considered event free if they enter remission, do not die as a result of
      treatment toxicity, and do not experience progression within 1 year from the start of
      therapy.
