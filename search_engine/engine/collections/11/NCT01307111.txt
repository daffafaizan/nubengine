      use, long term duration (5-10 years), low side-effect profile, and the immediate return to
      fertility after IUD removal. Despite advantages associated with the IUD, the smaller cervical
      diameter of nulliparous patients may lead to a more difficult and uncomfortable insertion.
      Some providers have started pre-medicating nulliparous patients with misoprostol prior to IUD
      insertion because of the drug's known effect as a cervical ripening agent. Limited evidence
      is available addressing the effect of misoprostol on patient comfort and provider ease of IUD
      insertion in nulliparous women. The goal of this study is to evaluate whether using
      misoprostol as a cervical ripening agent in nulliparous patients eases IUD insertion and
      decreases pain.
