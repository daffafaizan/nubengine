      Leukemia refer to the cancers in blood while solid tumors refer to the cancers which involve
      the formation of an abnormal mass without any liquid or cysts. Patients suffer from leukemia
      are usually have better prognosis which result in better psychological well-being when
      compared with those suffer from solid tumors (Rodin et al., 2010). The development of solid
      tumors in children is different from that in adult. Some of the solid tumors such as
      osteosarcoma, neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, Wilms' tumor and retinoblastoma are
      exclusively found in children. Other types of solid tumors such as brain tumor can also be
      found in children.

      Yet, most of recent studies in Hong Kong have focused in general childhood cancer survivors
      or their family members but no study has been conducted to focus on the physical and
      psychological well-being of survivors of childhood solid tumors (Li, Lopez, Chung, Ho, &
      Chiu, 2013; Wills, 2009). Therefore, the quality of life and psychological well-being of
      solid tumors survivors are always be overestimated. The actual psychological needs of solid
      tumors survivors may be overlooked. There is thus an imperative need to investigate the
      impact of cancer and treatment-related effects on the physical and psychosocial well-being
      and quality of life among Hong Kong Chinese survivors of childhood solid tumors.
