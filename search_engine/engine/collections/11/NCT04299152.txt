    
      This is a prospective, two-arm, partially masked, single center clinical study to assess the
      safety, feasibility, and efficacy of SCE therapy for the treatment of patients with
      SARS-CoV-2 infection. Patients will be evaluated by the study principal investigator or
      co-investigators. Informed consent will be obtained at the initial screening visit. Subjects
      who meet all criteria will be scheduled for treatment. All enrolled subjects will receive one
      treatment with the SCE therapy consisting of a single session of mononuclear cells (MNC)
      collection by apheresis of blood. The MNC product will be treated with the SCE, and followed
      by an infusion intravenously back to the patient. The SCE-treated subjects will be evaluated
      according to the schedules of follow-up studies within 4 weeks.
