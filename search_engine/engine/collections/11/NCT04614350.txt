      cadaveric ADM (Markman Biologics) used in sites with < 1 mm of attached gingiva requiring
      soft tissue grafting without root coverage as compared to control cadaveric ADM (AlloDerm,
      LifeCell) over 180-day post-op period. During the treatment period, each site will be
      monitored for soft tissue healing and augmentation of keratinized tissue width. All subjects
      will be seen at post-op day 7, 14, 30, 90, and 180.
