      coronary angiography (CAG), and DECT characteristics of the culprit lesion will be
      determined. All Non-culprit lesions will be observed during 2 month and 1 year follow up
      characteristics and changes in plaque composition, volume and core content will be assessed.

      Patients with SAP undergo a baseline DECT similar to NSTEMI group. Because the expected
      change in coronary plaques in SAP group is minimal, there is no need for follow up at 2
      month.
