      ultrasound device) of 25 participants or a control group (inactive ultrasound device) of 8
      participants with an equal number of males and females in each group. The research
      coordinator will be blinded to the assignment of devices to each group.

      The daily pain scores reported by patients who receive active devices will be compared to
      those who receive placebo devices.

      Background:

      Approximately 50 to 80 million people in the United States suffer from some form of chronic
      pain. Back pain is the most common neurological disorder in the United States after headaches
      and costs consumers nearly $50 billion annually. Pharmaceuticals currently dominate the
      treatment options despite a myriad of public health problems including cost, untoward side
      effects, and addiction to widely available opioid analgesics. Non-pharmaceutical treatments,
      such as the one under test, provide a safer and potentially lower cost alternative to
      traditional analgesic use.
