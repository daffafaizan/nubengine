      malnutrition has the highest mortality risk, most malnutrition-related deaths are thought to
      be related to mild-moderate malnutrition.This is because moderate malnutrition is common, it
      directly increases the risk of death from common infectious diseases and may progress to
      severe malnutrition.

      Malnutrition may arise from poverty, food insecurity or inadequate nutrition being offered,
      and may begin early in life. Malnutrition is exacerbated by the multiple effects of
      infectious diseases such as gastroenteritis, pneumonia, malaria or HIV. All these common
      infections are associated with net protein loss with diversion of essential amino acids to
      producing acute phase and immune response proteins. Fever is associated with an increased
      resting energy expenditure of 7 to 13% per degree Centigrade. Activation of inflammatory
      cascades also causes reduced appetite and loss of lean tissue and fat. Acute infection is
      therefore associated with growth faltering, resulting in a vicious cycle. Acute infection is
      therefore a potential target for intervention to interrupt the vicious cycle between
      malnutrition and infection in children.

      This study aims to evaluate a strategy of giving short-term RUSF as a supplement to usual
      diet at home, without daily observed feeding, administered through existing health services
      at Kilifi District Hospital, Kenya. RUSF has a very low moisture content and is essentially a
      lipid-enveloped paste, it is microbiologically stable with a long shelf life at tropical
      temperatures and preserves delicate micronutrients such as vitamin A.
