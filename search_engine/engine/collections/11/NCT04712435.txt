      safety of N-acetylcysteine as prophylaxis of sinusoidal obstruction syndrome in patients
      undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation Up to date, no approved medications are
      available for prophylactic treatment of sinusoidal obstruction syndrome in patients
      undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. N-acetylcysteine is a drug that has been
      long used as a mucolytic. And placebo responses contribute to help assess the appropriateness
      of randomized clinical trials in determining the size of drug effect.

      The study will enroll patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation to receive
      sequentially one of two treatment: N-acetylcysteine or Placebo.
