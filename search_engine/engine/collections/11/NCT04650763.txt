      whereas, the subjects in Group II received Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) therapy. All subjects
      were given a standard treatment with single implant system. Inserted implants were analyzed
      through Cone Beam Computerized Tomography (CBCT). Records were registered at the baseline, at
      12th week before functional loading and 26th week after functional loading.
