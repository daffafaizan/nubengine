      detailed instructional materials including a brochure to introduce the new device, a
      videotape showing how the device is used, a detailed slide show explaining each of the steps,
      and a checklist of the steps to perform during the exchange (E) in simulation. The Mentored
      group (M) will also receive expert instruction just before the procedure, while the Control
      group (C) will have the same amount of time to review the steps themselves. Next, they will
      perform the first exchange procedure (E1) while the pair of experts observe and measure the
      simulated patients' apnea time. The experts will then conduct a debriefing with the M group,
      while the C group will debrief themselves before both groups perform the exchange a second
      time (E2). Both groups will then receive debriefing by the experts. The apnea times and a
      performance assessment will be compared between M and C to determine the effects of expert
      training, and will also be compared within each group from E1 to E2, to determine the effect
      of experience on apnea time and performance. Finally, surveys conducted after E1 and E2, and
      before debriefing, will determine the participants' satisfaction with the new device. Data on
      apnea times will be used for a statistical power analysis to determine the size of a larger
      group necessary to show significant differences in outcomes.
