      the symptoms of dry eye syndrome. The study design is a parallel randomized double-blind
      placebo controlled trial. The participants daily consume sea buckthorn or placebo oil for 3
      months. The dry eye symptoms will be monitored during the study using a validated
      questionnaire. In addition clinical dry eye tests are made by an ophthalmologist three time
      during the study. Samples will be taken for tear film lipid and cytokine analyses. Blood
      samples for the analyses of inflammatory markers are also obtained. The cytokine and other
      inflammation marker analyses are optional. The symptoms will be monitored and clinical tests
      made also 4 weeks after the participants have stopped consuming the study oils.
