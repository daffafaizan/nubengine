      on questionnaires distributed to participants biennially thereafter. Dietary intake data was
      collected in form of a comprehensive, 131-item food frequency questionnaire (FFQ),
      distributed among participants every four years. The response rate remained over 90%. Dietary
      data was validated using biomarkers, health status data using medical records.

      Dietary pattern scores were derived from FFQs using cumulative average whenever possible from
      years preceding the outcomes.

      Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate associations between
      dietary pattern scores and health outcomes, except in case of pregnancy complications (such
      as gestational diabetes mellitus/GDM and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy/HDPs) where
      multivariable logistic regression models with generalized estimating equations, with an
      exchangeable working correlation structure to account for correlated outcomes between
      pregnancies.
