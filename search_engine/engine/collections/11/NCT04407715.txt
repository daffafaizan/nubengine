      groups prospectively: high flow of 2 L/min and minimal flow of 0.5 L/min. Anesthesia was
      maintained with 50% oxygen-50% air at 2 L/min and desflurane at 1.1 MAC in Group 1 (n=40) and
      with 50% oxygen-50% air at 2 L/min and desflurane at 1.1 MAC in Group 2 (n=40). After 10-15
      minutes, group 2 was administered minimal flow with 50-60% oxygen-40-50% air at 0.5 L/min and
      desflurane, and 10 minutes before the end of the surgery, the patients were switched to high
      flow with 50% oxygen-50% air at 2 L/min.
