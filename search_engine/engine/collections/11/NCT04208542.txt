      postoperative complications. Poorly controlled acute pain may contribute to the impairment of
      respiratory function and the development of chronic post-thoracotomy pain.

      Recently, an increasing number of erector spinae plane (ESP) nerve blocks are being performed
      as it has been demonstrated, and via case reports that the blocks provide clinical
      effectiveness, but may have a better side-effect profile than the paravertebral nerve block
      and epidural analgesia. Moreover, there is an advantage for novice because ESP block is
      simpler and safer to proceed than conventional nerve blocks.
