      cerebrovascular events and central atrophy. Age induced changes on cerebral tissue in
      adulthood is witnessed as atrophy and well know ischemic changes on imaging studies. There is
      no consensus at this time what constitutes normal, age induced atrophy and pathologic atrophy
      on imaging studies. The same challenge is also encountered for ischemic cerebral parenchymal
      change.

      Until recently there have been several important limitations in this research 1) Measurement
      of cerebral tissue loss and amount of ischemic insult was based on a qualitative grading (2)
      There was no cognitive testing. With Advancements in software technology that have now
      allowed for measurements of CSF and brain volumes in reliable and reproducible ways and the
      neuroradiologist having access to the subject's Neurological Cognitive Testing Scores, this
      study will objectively measure MRI findings and correlate them with the level of cognitive
      function.

      This study will look at subjects who have undergone cognitive testing from the Neurology
      Clinic and then referred for an MRI brain exam, as standard of care testing. The MRI
      information will be acquired by volumetric technique for calculation of brain and CSF volumes
      and MRI data will be plotted against the cognitive test results.

      The results of this study will be to correlate quantitative measures of cerebral atrophic and
      ischemic changes with level of cognition and to establish reliable imaging criteria that can
      help identify normal, age induced versus pathologic. Information obtained will shed light to
      cognitive effects and imaging appearance of: Separation of normal age related changes from
      pathologic states, changes leading to dementia and normal pressure hydrocephalus.
