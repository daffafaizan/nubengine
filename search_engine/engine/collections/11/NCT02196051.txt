      years) and healthy, lean elderly individuals (65-90 years) will undergo 1H/13C MRS
      measurements of liver and muscle lipid and glycogen content before and after a high
      carbohydrate meal challenge. Hepatic de novo lipogenesis will be determined as the
      incorporation of deuterium, from deuterium labeled water (2H2O), into plasma triglycerides 5.
      These metabolic studies will be performed in 3 sets: Study Part 1: Resting, Study Part 2:
      After 1 bout of exercise and Study part 3: After 6 weeks of exercise training. Since
      intra-abdominal obesity has been postulated to be at the core of the metabolic derangements
      and directly responsible for the atherogenic dyslipidemia associated with the metabolic
      syndrome, the investigators will also measure intra-abdominal fat content by magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI).
