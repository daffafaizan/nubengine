      to death of photoreceptor cells. The investigators have observed that short pulses of focused
      ultrasound can cause perception of light (phosphenes) when directed to spots on the retinal
      surface. If this phenomenon is caused by direct stimulation of the retinal nerves, which
      seems probable, then it might be possible to use this phenomenon to produce a form of vision
      in such patients. The investigators propose to conduct a study of a small cohort of patients
      affected by RP to determine if pulsed ultrasound will evoke a perception of light in the
      absence of functional photoreceptors.
