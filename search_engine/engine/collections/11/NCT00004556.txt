      augment, have no effect, or hamper brain function. We hypothesize that these population
      differences might be related to differences (high vs. low) in monoaminergic synaptic function
      which may be due to specific allelic variations in monoamine system genes (e.g., various
      synaptic proteins, synthetic enzymes, etc.). We wish to examine the effect of
      dextroamphetamine, a non-specific monoaminergic drug, on cognitive efficiency while subjects
      perform a variety of tasks including memory challenges with increasing cognitive load and
      varying rewards, selective attention and emotional processing. Further, in collaboration with
      other NIMH neuroimaging protocols, we wish to examine the neurophysiological correlates of
      these effects. We believe this protocol will provide a matrix for many investigations to
      elucidate important neurophysiological mechanisms that underlie normal cognition and
      cognitive efficiency. It is anticipated that these studies would be of potential
      'pharmacogenetic' importance with regard to individual differences in the metabolism of
      monoaminergic drugs in normal health, aging and in disease.
