      ventricular systolic function â‰¤35% or selected patients with channelopathies and
      cardiomyopathies.

      Defibrillation threshold testing (DFT) defines the minimal energy required to successfully
      terminate a ventricular arrhythmia by an ICD. It remains the gold standard to evaluate the
      electrical integrity of the device. However inherent complications of this procedure have
      been registered, such as refractory ventricular fibrillation, and the need for this practice
      during implant and/or replacement of ICD has recently been questioned.

      If several studies have led to abandonment of the DFT during initial ICD implant, its
      interest during replacement is still controversial. Indeed, the leads essential for the
      device electrical integrity are older, more fragile, and the ICD replacement may damage it.

      Device replacement is indicated when battery reaches the point of Elective Replacement
      Interval (ERI).

      Patients over 18 years old with indication for replacement of defibrillator will be included.
      Patient's informations (comorbidities, medical history and events during hospitalization or
      follow-up) and device characteristics will be collected. Procedure will be realized under
      local or general anesthesia and prophylactic antibiotic will be administrated. Leads will be
      tested before and after the implantation of the new device. After connexion of the new
      implanted device to the leads a DFT will be performed. Protocol of DFT will be decided by the
      physician who will chose between induction of ventricular fibrillation or R-wave synchronized
      shock. Patients will be followed for 6 and 12 months from the date of defibrillator
      replacement.
