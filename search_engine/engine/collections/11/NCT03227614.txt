      social support, from a partner, friend or family member, report better psychological
      adjustment. During medication abortion, patients reported high satisfaction levels, in part,
      because of being able to share the experience with another person. During in-clinic abortion,
      patients report lower levels of anxiety when they have a support person (partner, spouse,
      friend or family member) in the post-abortion recovery room. Additionally, support persons
      indicate feeling they can successfully comfort the woman. In the abortion procedure room,
      doula support has a positive psychological impact on patients and decreases the need for
      additional clinic support resources. Because doula support in the abortion procedure room and
      social support in the post-abortion recovery room improves patient experience, it is
      reasonable to believe that having a support person in the procedure room may also improve
      patient experience. However, there are no data about the patient, support person, and health
      care provider's experience and satisfaction with a support person in the abortion procedure
      room.

      This study aims to explore patient, support person, and health care providers' experience and
      satisfaction with social support in the abortion procedure room. Although some providers do
      allow a support person in the abortion procedure room, no study has formally examined the
      effects of this practice.

      If this study demonstrates higher patient satisfaction and lower perceptions of pain and
      anxiety levels in patients who have social support in the in-clinic abortion procedure room,
      this could change standard procedures in the in-clinic abortion procedure room, allowing for
      more positive patient experiences.
