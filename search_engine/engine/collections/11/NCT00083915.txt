      patients, whether angio-chemotherapy with D.T. PACE followed by tandem transplant with
      MEL-DTPACE Hybrid may be equivalent or superior to tandem transplant with high dose melphalan
      in terms of complete remission (CR)/near CR/very good partial remission (VGPR) rate and
      event-free and overall survival.
