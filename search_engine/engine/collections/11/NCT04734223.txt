      dizziness, syncope, and altered state of consciousness. It has been reported in previous
      studies that thromboembolic ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes associated with COVID-19 have
      been observed in the early period. It has been suggested that conditions characterized by
      neurological sequelae, such as encephalitis and encephalopathy, ataxic seizures,
      Guillain-Barr√© syndrome (GBS), demyelinating diseases, and neuromuscular disorders may occur
      in the longer term.In the present study, the investigators aimed to reveal the findings of
      neuroimaging analyses performed in patients followed up with a diagnosis of COVID-19 who had
      neurological symptoms, discuss the relationship of these findings with laboratory and
      epidemiological data, and emphasize that CNS involvement in these patients should not be
      overlooked. In this study, 436 patients with COVID-19 who underwent at least one neuroimaging
      procedure during April 2020-December 2020 due to neurological symptoms and whose diagnosis
      was confirmed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction test were included. Although
      computed tomography was predominantly used for imaging, magnetic resonance imaging was also
      used when necessary. The patients were grouped based on imaging findings, and statistical
      evaluations were made between the groups.
