      gene respectively code polycystin 1 and polycystin 2. Currently the hypotheses for increased
      intracranial aneurysm rate in ADPKD patients is that mutation of polycystin is not only
      confined to nephron tissues but also in endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells
      and results in mutation of vascular phenotype. Also recent studies show polycystin complex
      causes cystic changes through mutation in primary cilia in renal epithelium. Wild type
      endothelial cells respond to fluid shear stress by regulating levels of intracellular calcium
      and nitric oxide, however, PKD1 or PKD2 mutation in fetal aortic endothelial cells revealed
      loss of these responses.

      During kidney transplantation, bilateral nephrectomies are routinely performed to ADPKD
      patients. In this study, the investigators plan to perform PKD gene tests and gene sequencing
      from polycystic kidney nephrectomy specimens of154 ADPKD patients who received kidney
      transplantation at Asan Medical Center between 1994 and 2018. The aim of this study to
      analyze the gene mutation of ADPKD patients and investigate mechanisms associated with
      intracranial aneurysm occurence in ADPKD patients.
