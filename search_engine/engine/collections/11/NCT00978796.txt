      study demonstrated significant reductions in microvascular complication. Similar to type 2
      diabetes, patients with type 1 diabetes have a paradoxical increase in glucagon after meals
      which contribute to worsening post prandial glucose control. This proposed study is designed
      to determine if altering the glucagon axis by giving sitagliptin can improve glucose control
      in patients with type 1 diabetes.
