      determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) that will be used in Part B to confirm tolerance
      and provide assessment of the effect of SLV213 on clinical symptoms of COVID-19.

      Part A will consist of three sequential cohorts of 12 subjects receiving treatment
      administered orally either twice a day or once a day for seven consecutive days. Subjects in
      each cohort will be randomized to one of two treatment arms, SLV213 (8 subjects) or placebo
      (4 subjects). After each cohort, a Selva Safety Review Committee (SRC) will evaluate the
      safety of the regimen before proceeding to dose the next cohort. If a cohort is deemed to
      have reached an intolerable dose level, the dose prior to that level will be the MTD. PK
      blood samples will be collected throughout the study.

      In Part B of the study 45 subjects will be dosed at the MTD (30 SLV213 and 15 Placebo) to
      confirm tolerance, and to provide assessment of the effect of SLV213 on clinical symptoms of
      COVID-19. PK blood samples will be collected throughout the study.
