      PEP005 Topical Gel (0.01% concentration) and vehicle control will be applied under open
      conditions to sites on the infrascapular region of the back 3 times weekly for 3 weeks (9
      applications in total) during the induction phase. Following a rest period of approximatley
      10-14 days, a single challenge application will be performed. Local tolerability will be
      assessed visually using an ordinal scoring system. If a cutaneous response observed in the
      challenge phase indicates possible sensitisation, or at the discretion of the investigator, a
      rechallenge will occur
