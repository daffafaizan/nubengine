      population. Monotherapy treatment in hypertension is often unable to achieve the desired
      blood pressure (BP) goals and subjects even remain at significant risk for developing
      cardiovascular disease. The use of combination therapy as first line treatment for
      hypertension provides a solution to the management problems related to hypertension. Among
      combination drugs, low dose combinations are useful tools in treating large segments of
      hypertensive subjects because of their several advantages, such as simplified dosage
      regimens, improve compliance and hypertensive control, decrease dose dependent side effects
      as well as reduce costs.
