      collect samples in CML patients with successful versus patients who have failed TKI therapy
      discontinuation. The investigators plan to study functional and phenotypic characteristics of
      innate T cells. The investigators also plan to evaluate in vitro whether immune check points
      inhibitors could help to restore the innate T lymphocytes population.
