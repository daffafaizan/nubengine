        -  Assess the scale structure, psychometric validity, and reliability of quality of life
           measurements using the EORTC QLQ-C30 and the prostate cancer-specific QLQ-PR25
           questionnaires in patients with stage I-IV prostate cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to stage of disease
      (local or locally advanced disease vs metastatic disease).

      Patients complete EORTC QLQ-C30 and prostate cancer-specific QLQ-PR25 questionnaires before
      therapy and at 3 months after the start of therapy. Patients in stratum II also complete
      questionnaires at 6 months after the start of therapy.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 375 patients will be accrued for this study.
