      myeloma who have had prior treatment with lenalidomide. Up to 54 patients will be enrolled.
      Patients who sign informed consent form and fulfill all eligibility criteria will be
      enrolled.

      ClaPd therapy:

      Dexamethasone (40mg ) on days 1, 8, 15, 22 of a 28-day cycle. Clarithromycin given orally at
      a dose of 500 mg twice a day on days 1-28 of a 28 day cycle.

      Pomalidomide will be given 4mg daily for days 1-21 of each 28 day cycle.

      Serial clinic visits and laboratory measurements will be performed to monitor for treatment
      response. Those patients who demonstrate progression of disease at any point during ClaPd
      therapy will be taken off study.

      At the end of every cycle (which may coincide with day 1 of the new cycle), response and
      toxicity will be evaluated. During cycle 1, patients will have labwork done weekly (CBC with
      differential and blood electrolytes). All patients will remain on study until disease
      progression or side effects become excessive. Patients who achieve a stable plateau may be
      taken off study if eligible to proceed to high dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell
      transplantation.
