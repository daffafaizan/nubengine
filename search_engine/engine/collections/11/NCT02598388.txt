      2-part, Phase 2 study of Ad26.ZEBOV and MVA-BN-Filo in healthy and HIV infected adults. In
      part 1, dose 1 vaccination with MVA-Bn-Filo will be followed by dose 2 vaccination with Ad26
      14 days later in the US. In part 2, two regimens will be investigated. The first regimen will
      be Ad26 dose 1 vaccination followed by MVA-BN-Filo dose 2, 28 days later and the second
      regimen will be MVA-BN-Filo dose 1 vaccination followed by MVA-BN-Filo dose 2, 14 days later
      in Africa. The study consists of a Screening phase of up to 8 weeks (starting from the moment
      the participants signs the ICF), a Vaccination Phase, in which participants will be
      vaccinated at baseline (Day 1) followed by a dose 2 vaccination on Day 15 or 29, and a
      post-dose 2 follow-up phase of maximum 1 year post-dose 2 vaccination. Upon completion of
      6-month post dose 2 visit those participants who received active vaccine will enter long-term
      follow-up until the 1 year post dose 2 vaccination visit to assess long-term safety and
      immunogenicity.
