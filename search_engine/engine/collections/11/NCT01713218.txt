      precluding cytotoxics delivery to the epithelial tumoral compartment. There is thus a
      rationale for combining chemotherapy and antistromal drugs like Hedgehog inhibitors.
      Targeting the resectable primary tumor offers an appropriate setting to (1) evaluate and
      monitor early treatment effects on the tumor, (2) correlate dynamic imaging changes
      (perfusion and diffusion coefficient) to pre- and post-therapeutic tissue changes, (3)
      identify specific predictive biomarkers for the drugs used (i.e. gemcitabine transporters and
      Hedgehog pathway genes and proteins) and (4) assess if this early "dynamic and biomolecular
      response" can predict treatment benefit and patient outcome.
