      to relieving the symptoms associated with gingival inflammatory conditions or gums trauma in
      infant, recently, products containing Hyaluronic Acid have been marketed in Europe. In
      particular, Ricerfarma is developing several high molecular weight Hyaluronic Acid medical
      devices characterized by the absence of preservatives, alcohol and dyes; therefore, the
      administration of these products in infants is safe and can help creating a natural
      protective layer on the gingival tissue. In previous clinical trials with these high
      molecular weight Hyaluronic Acid medical devices it was noted a periodontal tissue/fluid
      balance with accelerated healing and repair properties that could be of interest either for
      accelerating the wound healing process or for treating the complex physical symptoms (i.e.
      soreness and swelling of gums, crying, sleeplessness) related to the teething in infants.
      These data were confirmed by a recent pilot study on 18 infants suffering by teething where
      the two formulation of the tested high molecular weight Hyaluronic Acid medical device
      evidenced, at the end of treatment period, for pain, swelling, gingival rush,
      hyper-salivation and redness a statistically significant reduction from baseline.
