      important role during urogenital development. Patients carrying a WT1 germline mutation show
      symptoms like proteinuria, Wilms tumors, genital malformations and kidney failure, which
      usually occur in early childhood. Milder variants are possible and classification as one of
      the three rare syndromes associated with WT1 mutations (Denys-Drash syndrome, Frasier
      syndrome or WAGR syndrome) is not always possible. In this registry we are collecting
      detailed clinical data of affected individuals to establish genotype-phenotype correlations
      with the greater goal to optimize patient care.
