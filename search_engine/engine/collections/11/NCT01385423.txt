      patients. The primary goal of this extended phase will be to establish a correlation of the
      clinical endpoint, CRp defined as leukemic clearance (< 5% marrow blast and no peripheral
      blood blasts) and neutrophil recovery without platelet recovery, with in vivo expansion.

      Patients achieving a complete remission and neutrophil recovery (ANC > 500) for at least 4
      weeks will be considered for allogeneic transplant to prolong remission independent of this
      study.

      All patients, including those who go on to transplant, will be followed to determine disease
      free survival, treatment related mortality, and time to relapse.
