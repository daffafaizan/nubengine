      infection and following the development of AIDS to determine the location of escape mutations
      that might provide information about potential B*35 epitopes. These data will be useful in
      explaining the difference in disease progression between individuals possessing B*35 Px
      alleles and those with B*35 PY alleles. We have previously shown that individuals with B*35
      Px alleles progress at a significantly faster rate compared to those with B*35 PY alleles.
      This study might provide information which is potentially useful in the development of a
      successful HIV vaccine.
