      cancer surgery. Former studies have demonstrated that inflammatory response is altered during
      peri-operative period causing lymphopenia. It has been suggested that lymphopenia may
      contribute to postoperative infection. To date, no one has proved it in a multivariate
      analysis.

      The aim of this study is to determine if lymphopenia is associated with postoperative
      infections in thoracic and digestive cancer surgery. It is a multicenter French cohort study.
      Lymphocytes counts are obtained from patients undergoing pulmonary or digestive cancer
      surgery before surgery (day-0) as well 1, 3, 5 and 8 days after surgery. Anesthetic and
      surgical procedures are collected as well as risk factors for postoperative infections
      recognized in the literature. Clinical and biological signs of infection are collected.
