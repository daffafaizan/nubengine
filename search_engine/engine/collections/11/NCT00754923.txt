    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine the efficacy of sorafenib tosylate, in terms of 6-month progression-free
           survival rate, in non-smokers or former light smokers with relapsed or refractory stage
           IIIB or IV non-small cell lung cancer.

      Secondary

        -  To determine the 1-year survival rate in patients treated with this drug.

        -  To assess the frequency and severity of adverse events associated with this drug in
           these patients.

        -  To investigate the mutational status of EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor), ALK
           (anaplastic lymphoma kinase), ROS1, and K-Ras(Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene
           homolog)in archived tumor samples from these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral sorafenib tosylate twice daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat
      every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Archived tumor tissue samples are analyzed for mutations of EGFR, ALK, ROS1, and K-Ras by PCR
      (polymerase chain reaction) and DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) sequencing.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months.
