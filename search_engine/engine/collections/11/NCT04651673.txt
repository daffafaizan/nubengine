    
      This is a noninterventional registry study pertaining to knee OA braces. There are no
      comparative devices or treatments. Subjects are expected to follow the recommendations of the
      brace subscriber and other health care professionals at any time independent of their
      continuation within the registry.

      Subjects will be enrolled at the clinic where their brace was prescribed or at the site where
      the brace was fitted.

      There is no formal end date for this data registry. A revisit to this protocol may be
      motivated after 5 years, to assess if longer follow up is required.

      For individual participants follow up will continue with annual questionnaires as long as the
      brace is in use. The questionnaires will be administered either through mail with a paper
      version, or through a link to an electronical version (ePRO). There is also a possibility of
      administrating the questionnaires as a phone guided interview, if that is a mean that serves
      the patient or clinics better. The planned follow-ups are at 4 weeks, 6 months, 1 year from
      brace prescription and then annually as long as participants are disposed as "ongoing" in the
      registry.

      The questionnaires contains question about pain, function, medication, general brace use and
      quality of life question.
