      estimation of lean body mass. Only the transgender subjects will have a repeat OGTT two weeks
      after discontinuation of Gender Affirming Hormone Therapy (GAHT).

      Beta cell function will be correlated with the Estrogen/Testosterone ratio to evaluate the
      relationship between sex hormones and beta cell function. Plasma Glucagon-like peptide 1
      (GLP-1) response during the OGTT will be measured to evaluate if estrogen treatment modulates
      insulin secretion by increasing GLP-1 secretion.
