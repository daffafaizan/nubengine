      study will look at the retrospective data of patients that have switched from Darbepoetin
      Alfa to an approved epoetin alfa biosimilar. Data will be collected for the 26 week period
      prior to switch and a 26 week period post switch to a biosimilar. Data to be collected
      includes haemoglobin measurements, dose requirements, iron use, any transfusions,
      hospitalisations and other lab values including TSAT, Ferritin and albumin. Data from the
      study will be published.
