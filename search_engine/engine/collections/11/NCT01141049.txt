      of gabapentin in the treatment of alcohol dependence will be studied in 60 patients.
      Participants will be randomly assigned to treatment under double-blind conditions with either
      1) a fixed dosing schedule of gabapentin or 2) placebo. All participants will receive weekly
      supportive behavioral treatment that promotes abstinence from alcohol and other substances,
      encourages mutual-support meeting attendance, and facilitates compliance with study
      medication. The primary outcome measures will be: the reduction of heavy drinking days per
      week as measured by the timeline follow-back method.

      Participants will be alcohol-dependent men and nonpregnant women who report drinking a
      minimum of 5 standard drinks for men or 4 standard drinks for women at least 4 days per week
      over the past 28 days. The daily minimum drinking requirements are consistent with the
      commonly accepted definition of "binge drinking." A minimum requirement of having a heavy
      drinking episode 4 days a week would select for a population of individuals who are drinking
      excessively more days than not. A minimum threshold of weekly alcohol use is set to prevent a
      "floor effect" (i.e. participants with minimal alcohol use at baseline would be unable to
      demonstrate significant improvement.)
