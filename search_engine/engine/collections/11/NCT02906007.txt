    
      This purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, and tolerability
      of bedaquiline (BDQ) in combination with an optimized background multidrug-resistant
      tuberculosis (MDR-TB) treatment regimen in HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected infants, children,
      and adolescents.

      The study will enroll HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected children 0 to 18 years of age treated
      for clinically diagnosed or confirmed intrathoracic (pulmonary) MDR-TB and certain types of
      extrathoracic MDR-TB. Participants will be assigned to cohorts based on age. Cohort 1 will
      include children 6 years of age or older but less than 18 years of age; Cohort 2 will include
      children 2 years of age or older but less than 6 years of age; and Cohort 3 will include
      children 0 months of age and older but less than 2 years of age. Cohort 1 will be divided
      into two weight bands, one for participants weighing 15 kg or more but less than 30 kg and
      one for participants weighing 30 kg or more. Cohorts 2 and 3 will include participants
      weighing 3 to 30 kg.

      Study visits will occur at enrollment (Day 0) and at Weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 32,
      40, 48, 60, 72, 96, and 120. Participants in each cohort will take BDQ once a day during the
      first 2 weeks. For the next 22 weeks, BDQ will be taken three times a week. Dosing for
      Cohorts 2 and 3 is based on data from Cohort 1.

      Study visits may include physical examinations, blood and urine collection, an
      electrocardiogram (ECG), medical history reviews, and other assessments.
