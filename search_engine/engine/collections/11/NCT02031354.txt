      sodium free chloride ion as a lysine chloride to patients with heart failure could improve
      parameters of neurohormonal status and diuretic responsiveness. Volunteers will receive
      Lysine Chloride 7 grams three times daily for three days. At baseline and then again post
      lysine chloride patients will undergo sampling of venous blood for determination of
      neurohormonal parameters in addition to formal diuretic responsiveness testing.
