      at least the first four months of life. Breast fed infants may develop milk protein
      intolerance. The management of breast milk protein intolerance differs from that of cow's
      milk protein intolerance in formula fed infants. Because breast milk is considered by many to
      be nutritionally superior to formula and results in maternal infant bonding mothers are often
      told to continue breast feeding. Despite the lack of evidence based data to support or refute
      the modification of the mother's diet, it is suggested that they eliminate their own intake
      of dairy products strictly and avoid supplementing with a cow's milk based formula. The
      investigators are doing this study to demonstrate that the deletion of dairy from the diet of
      a breast feeding mother will not cause breast milk protein intolerance to resolve.Some
      infants have difficulty digesting breast milk. When this happens, the doctor may advise the
      mother to eliminate dairy from her diet as long as the mother continues breast feeding or
      until the baby is 12 months old. However, no studies have proven that this change in a
      mother's diet actually solves the baby's problem with breast milk. The purpose of this study
      is to find an answer to this question.
