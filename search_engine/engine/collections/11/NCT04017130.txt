      tolerability, preliminary efficacy, PK, pharmacodynamics, and immunogenicity of TAK-169
      monotherapy in participants with RRMM.

      The study will be conducted in 2 phases: Dose Escalation Phase (Part 1) and an Expansion
      Phase (Part 2). The study will enroll approximately 81 to 102 participants (39 to 60
      participants in Part 1 and approximately 54 participants in Part 2).

      In the Dose Escalation Phase (Part 1), the starting dose level will be 50 microgram/kilogram
      (mcg/kg), once weekly. On the basis of investigator and sponsor review of available safety,
      PK, pharmacodynamic, and efficacy data from Cohort 1, the dose will be escalated in the
      subsequent cohorts to 100, 200, 335, 500, and 665 mcg/kg, once weekly. A separate dose
      escalation may also occur in which TAK-169 will be administered once every 2 weeks.

      In the Expansion Phase (Part 2), the study will evaluate two types of RRMM cohorts:
      Daratumumab-relapsed or Refractory (RR) Cohorts (once weekly and once every 2 weeks TAK-169
      administration) and an Anti-CD38 Therapy Naive Cohort (once weekly TAK-169 administration).
      The starting dose for each expansion cohort will be the MTD/RP2D (once weekly and once every
      2 weeks) determined in Part 1 after review of the available safety, efficacy, PK, and
      pharmacodynamic data from the dose escalation phase of the study.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall duration of the
      study is 34 months. Participants will be followed up for 30 days after the last dose of study
      drug for a follow-up assessment.
