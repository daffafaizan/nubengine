      adolescents, but diagnoses remain largely exclusionary relying on symptomology with an
      otherwise normal diagnostic workup.

      Successful completion of the project could contribute to understanding the altered physiology
      of functional nausea (FN), to stratification of FN patients according to physiological and/or
      psychological phenotypes, to improve diagnosis and provide objective measures of nausea and
      to inform and guide treatment options.

      The analysis of slow wave activity represents the first physiologically-quantifiable
      noninvasive assessment method for pathological processes associated with functional nausea in
      adolescents.
