      integrated cognitive-behavioral intervention for reducing alcohol use disorder (AUD) and
      posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms among women who experienced a sexual assault
      within the past six weeks. The intervention will be tested in an open label trial to make
      final modifications to evaluate feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of the
      five to six week integrated intervention with standardized repeated measures during a
      one-month follow-up. Next, a pilot randomized controlled trial will be conducted among 54
      recent sexual assault victims to evaluate feasibility and preliminary efficacy in reducing
      AUD severity and PTSD symptoms. Ecological momentary assessments (EMA) will be used to assess
      alcohol use, craving, and affect during the five-week treatment phase.
