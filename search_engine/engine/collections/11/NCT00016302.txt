    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the feasibility of the addition of nelarabine to modified multiagent
      Berlin-Frankfurt-Muenster-86 chemotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed T-cell acute
      lymphoblastic leukemia.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the pharmacokinetics and intracellular pharmacology of nelarabine in these
      patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot, multicenter study.

      Prednisone Response Pre-Induction: All patients receive oral prednisone three times daily on
      days -7 to -1 and methotrexate intrathecally (IT) on day -7* of week 0. Good prednisone
      responders proceed to induction on regimen A. Poor prednisone responders proceed to induction
      on regimen C.

      NOTE: *Patients who have received cytarabine IT within the week prior to study entry receive
      methotrexate IT on day -6.

      Regimen A (good prednisone responders) (closed as of 2/27/03):

      Induction (weeks 1-5): Patients receive vincristine IV on days 1, 8, and 15; oral prednisone
      three times daily on days 1-14; daunorubicin IV over 15 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and 22;
      asparaginase intramuscularly (IM) on days 12, 15, 18, 22, 24, 27, 30, and 33; and
      methotrexate IT on day 1.

      If bone marrow is M1, week 6 of induction therapy begins on day 36 or when peripheral blood
      counts recover. If bone marrow is M2, patients begin week 6 of induction therapy immediately.
      If bone marrow is M3, treatment discontinues. Those patients with minimal residual disease
      (MRD) on day 36 proceed to regimen B.

      Induction (weeks 6-9): Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on days 36 and 63;
      cytarabine IV over 72 hours on days 38-40, 45-47, 52-54, and 59-61; oral mercaptopurine daily
      on days 36-63; and methotrexate IT on days 45 and 59.

      Consolidation (weeks 10-19): Patients receive oral mercaptopurine on days 64-119;
      methotrexate IV over 24 hours and leucovorin calcium IV, or orally as tolerated, on days 71,
      85, 99, and 113; and methotrexate IT on days 71, 85, 99, and 113. (Patients begin
      methotrexate once blood counts recover and only if bone marrow is M1).

      169 or when blood counts recover, patients receive cyclophosphamide IV on day 169, cytarabine
      IV over 72 hours on days 171-173 and 178-180; oral thioguanine daily on days 169-182; and
      methotrexate IT on days 171 and 178. Patients also receive cranial irradiation for up to 10
