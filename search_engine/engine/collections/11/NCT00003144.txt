      gemcitabine and cisplatin. II. Compare the dose limiting toxicities of gemcitabine and
      cisplatin administered with and without amifostine in these patients. III. Determine the
      maximum tolerated dose of gemcitabine and cisplatin administered with amifostine in these
      patients. IV. Determine whether synergy is produced by administering gemcitabine and
      cisplatin on the same day.

      OUTLINE: This is a two stage study. The first stage is a randomized study, and the second
      stage is a dose escalation study. In the first stage of the study, patients receive either
      intravenous gemcitabine/amifostine/cisplation (GAP) or gemcitabine/cisplatin (GP) in the
      first cycle. Patients are administered the other arm in the second cycle. In the second stage
      of the study (dose escalation), the initial dose of GP or GAP is given on days 1 and 8 every
      28 days. Dose escalation is carried out in cohorts of 3 patients per dose level. If 1 of 3
      patients experiences dose limiting toxicity (DLT), then 3 more patients are accrued at the
      same dose level. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is defined as the lowest dose at which 2 of
      6 or 2 of 3 patients experience DLT. Patients experiencing grade 3 or 4 toxicity or tumor
      progression are removed from the study. Patients will be reassessed every 12 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 32 patients will be accrued over 12-24 months in the first
      stage of this study, and 9-12 patients will be accrued for the second stage..
