      countries. There are few French epidemiological data on this disease. Worldwide, studies have
      included a small number of very old subjects. Thus, it is important to estimate the AMD
      incidence in an elderly French population, in order to evaluate more precisely the number of
      cases in the French population. Besides, some clinical, genetic and modifiable parameters
      predisposing to the AMD are under study. The aim of the ECLAIR project is to study the 8-year
      incidence of AMD in an elderly French population and to identify the predisposing factors. It
      is based on an existing cohort study (ALIENOR) in which some clinical, genetic and modifiable
      data were collected at baseline, 2 and 4 years. It is the only cohort study performed in
      France in this field since fifteen years in parallel with another one performed in Dijon
      according to the same methodology. It is important to extend the study to 8 years in order to
      have a sufficient statistical power for the identification of predisposing factors. In the
      ECLAIR study, there is no treatment. The subjects will be followed during 2 years (6 and 8
      years after baseline of the Alienor study). The visit 1 (A0) will be the inclusion visit
      where the subjects will sign the inform consent and will perform ophthalmological
      examinations. The subjects will come back 2 years later for the visit 2 (A2). In this second
      visit, the ophthalmological examinations will be the same that is: measure of clinical
      parameters, measurement of visual acuity exams, retinophotography,spectral domain optical
      coherence tomography (SD-OCT), intraocular pressure, retinal imaging (OPTOMAP), axial length
      (IOL master)
