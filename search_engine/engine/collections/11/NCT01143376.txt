      (control group) iso-caloric protocols (for the duration needed to induce a 250 kcal energy
      deficit) or SDS (8s sprint:12s rest) for 10 minutes for 12 weeks. The intervention groups
      will be matched for age, BMI and male/females ratio and participants will be asked not to
      change their normal diet throughout the study.

      Before and after the exercise intervention (12 weeks), participants will perform the
      following assessments:

        1. Three-day food diaries

        2. Anthropometric measurements (weight, height, waist and hips) using standard procedures;

        3. Body composition using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA)

        4. RMR and resting respiratory exchange ratio (RER) using indirect calorimetry;

        5. Endothelial function assessed by flow-mediated dilation (FMD) of the brachial artery
           using vascular ultrasound according to current guidelines;

        6. Maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) and fat oxidation, cardiac output and left ventricular
           function during exercise using a cycle ergometer;

        7. Muscle and fat biopsies

        8. Fasting and postprandial release of appetite related hormones (and subjective feelings
           of hunger/fullness using visual analogue scales - VAS).
