      Phase 2 and 3. Subjects will be invited to continue to the subsequent Phase given they meet
      entry criteria described below:

      Phase 1: The investigators will evaluate whether TSPO is elevated in individuals during a
      current MDE compared to healthy controls. Eligible participants will receive one [18F]FEPPA
      PET scan and one MRI scan. Other measures will include urine sample, blood samples for
      genetic and peripheral biomarker analysis, a neurocognitive battery, mood scales and
      questionnaires.

      Phase 2: Participants who have elevated TSPO VT in Phase 1 and are agreeable to receiving
      minocycline will be invited to participate in Phase 2. Based on our previous results
      participants will be considered candidates for Phase 2 if TSPO VT ≥ 10.5 (HAB) or ≥8.5 (MAB)
      in any of the primary regions of interest (prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex or
      insula). Eligible participants will be invited to participate in a randomized, double blind,
      placebo controlled trial, to receive either minocycline or placebo. After the eight weeks of
      treatment, participants will receive one [18F]FEPPA PET scan. Other measures will include
      urine samples, blood samples, mood scales and questionnaires.

      Phase 3: If, after the initial eight week treatment period with either minocycline or
      placebo, any participant continues to have depressive symptoms (17-item Hamilton Depression
      Rating Scale score ≥ 8) they will be invited to participate in an eight week open label trial
      of celecoxib. Participants not eligible for Phase 2 may also be invited to participate in
      Phase 3 directly from Phase 1.
