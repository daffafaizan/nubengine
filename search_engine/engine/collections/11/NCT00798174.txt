      cardiac death will be asked to participate. Patients will undergo implantation of a standard
      right ventricular ICD lead at the time of ICD implantation. In addition, patient will receive
      another high voltage ICD lead placed in the azygos vein as has been previously described in
      the literature (1). After sedating the patient, the DFT will be determined using a binary
      search algorithm. This consists of testing the device at a given output for the first shock
      after inducing ventricular fibrillation (VF). Should the shock fail, external defibrillation
      will be attempted, as is the standard method for performing DFT testing. As per the standard
      method of DFT testing, VF will be induced a second time, with the shock strength dependent on
      the success of the first shock. If the first shock was unsuccessful, the second will be at a
      higher output. If the first shock was successful, the second will be at a lower output. A
      third shock will then be delivered, based on the success or failure of the preceding shock to
      define the DFT. Of note, as the device can be programmed to give multiple shocks for one
      episode, VF will not necessarily need to be induced each time. For example, VF could be
      induced, and the device programmed to give a 20 Joule (J) shock followed by a 23J shock if
      not successful, thus limiting the number of VF inductions required. DFT testing will be done
      using both the standard configuration of high voltage leads as well as using the azygos lead.
      We hypothesize that using the azygos lead will result in a lower DFT.
