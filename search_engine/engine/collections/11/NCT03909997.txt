    
      Gastrectomy is the main treatment for gastric and Siewert type II-III esophagogastric
      junction (EGJ) cancer. This surgery is associated with significant morbidity. The aim of the
      present study is to identify the predictors of postoperative morbidity and to evaluate long
      term survival according to complications.

      This was a retrospective cohort study. The investigators included patients treated with
      gastrectomy for gastric or EGJ cancers at a single center. Severe morbidity was defined as
      Clavien-Dindo score â‰¥3.

      The following factors are analyzed: age, sex, comorbidity, American Society of
      Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status, tobacco and alcohol consumption, body mass index
      (BMI), hematocrit, serum albumin level, tumor location, the use of preoperative chemotherapy,
      laparoscopic or open surgery, total or subtotal gastrectomy, duodenal stump closure,
      multi-organ resection, lymphadenectomy, reconstruction method, T status, lymph node
      metastasis, and resection margin. The T stage was grouped by T1-T2 and T3-T4 for analysis.
      Patients will be followed for 5 years after surgery for survival analysis. A multivariate
      analysis is performed to identify predictors of overall and severe morbidity; and predictors
      of long-term survival.
