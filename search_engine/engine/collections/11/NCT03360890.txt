      Cohort 1: salivary gland tumors without SOC treatment option Cohort 2: 'aggressive' thyroid
      cancer without SOC treatment option

      Both cohorts will undergo a biopsy and will begin immunotherapy plus chemotherapy.

      6 cycles. For accessible tumors only, at week three patients will receive an on-treatment
      biopsy.
