      with session-introducing relaxation interventions (SIRI) and no session-introducing
      interventions (treatment as usual, (TAU)). Patients between 11 and 19 years and a primary
      diagnosis of hyperkinetic disorder, depressive disorder or anxiety disorder are invited to
      participate. Psychotherapy will be conducted by trainee therapists at a trainee outpatient
      clinic for children and adolescents. It is hypothesized that psychopathological
      symptomatology and therapeutic alliance improve more in the mindfulness condition than in the
      relaxation condition and TAU, and that mindfulness moderates the relationship between
      therapeutic alliance and psychopathological symptomatology stronger than the relaxation
      condition and TAU.
