    
      Lymphoscintigraphy is an accepted and commonly-performed procedure used for staging of
      certain cancers, especially melanoma and breast cancer. It involves injecting a small amount
      of radioactivity under the skin in order to identify lymph nodes which should be biopsied
      (ie, the "sentinel lymph node, SLN") to determine if cancer has spread. The study objective
      was to evaluate the potential benefit of a new, camera-based technology (prototype device)
      which allows actual images to be obtained intra-operatively in the identification of sentinel
      nodes.

      Each device was assessed for relative node detection sensitivity (S), defined as the
      proportion of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) that were identified with each instrument, with the
      proportion determined as the number of true positives (TP) divided by the total evaluated
      (N).
