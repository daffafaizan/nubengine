    
      The study is a single institution, phase 1b, single arm non-randomized, open label
      prospective clinical trial to evaluate the combination of Avelumab and Docetaxel in adult
      subjects with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma with disease progression
      during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy, or within 12 months of neoadjuvant or
      adjuvant platinum-containing chemotherapy.

      The study has two phases:

        1. A Phase 1b dose de-escalation of Docetaxel in combination with Avelumab, to establish
           the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) for the combination. The dose de-escalation phase
           will utilize a 3+3 design over 3 planned dose levels leading to the identification of a
           RP2D for the combination of Docetaxel and Avelumab. Note: Dose de-escalation is allowed
           only for Docetaxel and no changes will done to standard dose of Avelumab (i.e, 10
           mg/kg).

        2. In the dose expansion phase of the study, the fixed dose of Docetaxel in combination
           with Avelumab will be evaluated. The study is powered to a primary endpoint of overall
           response rate (ORR) with the combination of Docetaxel and Avelumab. Enrollment for part
           2 will commence only after a RP2D is identified from phase 1.
