      patients who had failure of standard TKI therapies including imatinib, sunitinib, and/or
      regorafenib. In this phase I-II study of dovitinib plus imatinib, we aim to determine a
      recommended dose of dovitinib plus imatinib and to evaluate the safety and activity of the
      combination at the recommended dose as a 3rd or more line of treatment in metastatic or
      unresectable GIST.
