    
      Aim: To evaluate the GIP receptor antagonizing effect of peptide-based competitive GIP
      receptor antagonist GIP-A (vs. saline (placebo)) in 10 healthy subjects during 1 hour
      hyperglycaemic clamps with and without concomitant iv infusion of GIP[1-42]. The intention is
      to establish GIP-A as a tool to eliminate glucose-dependent insulinotropic GIP signalling.

      The study consists of four experimental days (A-D) with assessment of beta cell function
      during 12 mM-hyperglycaemic clamps with concomitant infusions of A) GIP[1-42], B) GIP-A, C)
      GIP[1-42] + GIP-A, or D) saline (placebo).
