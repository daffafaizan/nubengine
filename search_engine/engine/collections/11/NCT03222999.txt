      developed to comprehend various researches conducted in the field of out-of-cardiac arrest
      resuscitation and to strengthen the cooperative effort in conducting studies. It was
      organized in 2014 with recruitment of hospitals willing to participate voluntarily to the

      Committee (CCR) and Pediatric Resuscitation Research Committee (PRR). Also Data Safety and
      Monitoring Board Committee (DSMB) is organized to provide annual review and Security and
      Ethics Committee to oversight security and ethical issues in research. Monthly meeting of
      interdisciplinary steering committee, consists of the consortium chair, steering committee
      chair, each research committee chair and secretary committee, is held to approve the proposed
      research agendas and to mediate between multi-center trial participating hospitals.
