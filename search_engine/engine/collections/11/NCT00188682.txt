      Tissue density are believed to be associated with proliferation of stroma and/or epithelium,
      which result in an increase in water associated light absorption and a decrease in lipid
      associated light absorption. The amount of density of the breast tissue has been shown to be
      an indicator of cancer risk. Thus, assessing this breast tissue density is also an important
      tool in determining breast cancer risk.

      Optical transillumination has been shown to give information about tissue composition and
      tissue density. Unlike x-ray mammography which uses ionizing radiation, optical
      transillumination uses normal white light and is deemed safe to be used frequently for women
      of all ages and therefore can be used for those situations where mammography is not an
      option.

      Normal white light is shone into the tissue and the light that leaves the breast on the other
      side from the source is detected and analyzed. Since the same physiological conditions that
      contribute to dense breast tissue, as seen in mammography, also will have unique optical
      signatures.

      We will compare the amount of this dense tissue from the mammogram, taken with 12 months, to
      the density measurements found through the optical procedure. The goal is to be able to
      duplicate the information from the mammogram using the transillumination technique. All
      measurements are non-invasive and no blood samples or biopsies are required.
