    
      Prospective, multi-center, randomized, controlled, open-label, blinded-endpoint trial with a
      sequential design. The randomization employs a 1:1 ratio of mechanical thrombectomy with
      stent-retriever and/or thromboaspiration versus medical management alone in patients who
      suffer a large vessel anterior circulation ischemic stroke between 8 and 24 hours from time
      last seen well. Randomization will be done under a minimization process using age (≤68 vs.
      >68 years), baseline NIHSS (<17 v. ≥17), ASPECTS (5-7 vs. 8-10), therapeutic window (6-12 or
      12-24 hours after TLKW), occlusion site (Intracranial ICA or M1), and clinical site. For the
      primary endpoint, subjects will be followed for 90 days post-randomization. Sham endovascular
      procedure has been rejected due to the medical risk of the angiography and practical issues
      that difficult to maintain blindness of investigators.
