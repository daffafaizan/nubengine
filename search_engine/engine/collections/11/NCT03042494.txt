      or low dose (2.5-3 g/d) of prebiotic on gut microbiota profiles in healthy adults compared to
      a non-prebiotic containing control.

      The primary outcome is change in microbial composition (measured via 16S rRNA sequencing).

      The secondary outcomes are change in gastrointestinal (GI) tolerance (measured via
      questionnaire); change in fecal short chain fatty acids; and change in quality of life.

      This study will consist of two separate trials of 12 week duration. Each trial will be
      performed in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover manner with a 4 week
      intervention period followed by a 4 week wash-out period and final 4 week cross over.
