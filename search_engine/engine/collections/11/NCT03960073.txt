      preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) accounts for a large burden of heart failure with the
      incidence and cost associated with the disease projected to double in the next 20 years. The
      pathophysiology of HFpEF has not yet been fully elucidated and no proven therapies for
      improving outcomes in HFpEF currently exist, posing major diagnostic and therapeutic
      challenges. The addition of chronic kidney disease (CKD) presents a complicated cardio renal
      syndrome that manifests a distinctly different phenotype and exacerbates the diagnostic and
      therapeutic challenges of HFpEF. This study aims to address the urgent need to establish
      treatment targets and therapies by investigating potential underlying biological contributors
      to HFpEF and its symptoms.

      Mitochondrial dysfunction is consistently reported in CKD and heart failure. Mitochondrial
      dysfunction has been implicated in cardiac, skeletal muscle and vascular dysfunction and is
      therefore an attractive target for a 'whole systems' therapeutic approach that would
      encompass exercise intolerance and abnormal blood vessel hemodynamics. A known contributor to
      and subsequent cyclical result of mitochondrial dysfunction is an abnormally heightened
      production of mitochondria derived oxidative stress. This study will address the role of
      mitochondria derived oxidative stress in mitochondrial dysfunction, exercise intolerance and
      large blood vessel hemodynamics HFpEF patients with and without CKD.
