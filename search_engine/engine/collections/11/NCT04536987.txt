      function is critical to a functional upper limb, and is often resistant to conventional
      therapeutic interventions. Many stroke survivors have residual ability to flex the fingers,
      but extension is often limited and impeded by increased passive stiffness in flexors,
      involuntary activation of flexors and inability to activate extensors. The rationale for this
      approach stems from the growing evidence that neuro-rehabilitation after stroke may be
      enhanced via the application of motor learning strategies within the context of repetitive
      movement practice. The key therapeutic aspects of these strategies are high repetition,
      volitional effort, and successful completion of tasks to prevent frustration. While these
      represent promising therapeutic strategies, they are limited to mildly impaired subjects who
      already have enough control of finger extension to tolerate high repetitions of grasp/release
      tasks without succumbing to fatigue and/or frustration. There is a very large population of
      stroke patients who don't fall into this category and often must rely on compensatory
      strategies. In these patients, repetitive task practice facilitated by a robotic device may
      be more effective than unassisted task practice.
