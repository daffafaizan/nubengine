      people annually). If a person survives SAH from a ruptured intracranial aneurysm, the most
      common complication is delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI). This is the delayed neurologic
      deterioration associated with angiographic vasospasm. Vasospasm refers to the arterial
      constriction that typically begins 3 days after SAH, is maximal 7 to 8 days later and
      generally resolves by 14 days. About two-thirds of patients with SAH develop vasospasm,
      one-third develop DCI and one-sixth of SAH patients die or sustain permanent disability from
      DCI, despite aggressive medical/surgical intervention.

      Nimodipine, a calcium-channel antagonist, is currently the only drug to convincingly improve
      outcomes after SAH. Randomized multi-centre clinical trials utilizing clazosentan, an
      endothelin receptor antagonist, demonstrated no change in clinical outcome despite
      significant decrease in large vessel vasospasm. These results have shifted the research in
      the pathophysiology of DCI to alternative mechanisms other than large vessel vasospasm.

      It is known that the presence of blood in the subarachnoid space triggers massive local and
      systemic inflammation, including increase in the production of a pro-inflammatory cytokine
      called tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFa). We have shown in mice that global, and smooth
      muscle-specific knockout of TNFa prevents increased myogenic tone and reduces brain injury
      after SAH. Furthermore, systemic or intrathecal treatment with etanercept may prevent the
      increase in myogenic tone observed after SAH and may reduce brain injury. Administration of
      etanercept to patients with SAH is a critical step in determining the safety and potential
      efficacy of TNFa antagonists in SAH.
