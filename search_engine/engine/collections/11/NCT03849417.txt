      evaluating relationships and differences in PET-MR imaging and behavioral measures in 64
      patients with late life depression (LLD) compared to 64 healthy controls, and (2) a
      longitudinal arm evaluating relationships and differences in imaging and behavioral measures
      in 20 patients receiving ECT as part of their normal clinical management. The study will
      utilise three PET tracers: (1) [11C]UCB-J, which targets the Synaptic Vesicle Glycoprotein 2A
      receptor, to estimate synaptic density (2) [18F]MK-6240, which targets tau associated with
      neurofibrillary tangles, to assess the presence of tau pathology and (3) [18F]-Flutemetamol,
      which targets beta-amyloid neuritic plaques in the brain, to assess the presence of cerebral
      amyloidosis. The main aim of the study is to clarify how hippocampal synaptic density, tau,
      amyloid and white matter lesions, relate to neuropsychological function, stress and ECT in
      late life depression.
