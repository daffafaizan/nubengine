      which can lead to severe pain. Current standard methods to remove these stones include ERCP
      and extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy (ESWL) which are limited in removing larger and
      multiple impacted stones. Availability in the USA of ESWL for this indication also may be
      limited even at major referral centers. The introduction of single-operator per-oral
      pancreatoscopy (SpyGlassTM) has enabled direct intraductal visualization to target stones.
      Retrospective studies demonstrate a high success rate but literature is quite limited,
      uncontrolled, and highly selective. Further, many experts and recent European Society
      Guidelines suggest that ESWL is the only primary therapy for larger stones (5mm or larger)
      and that intraductal endoscopy and lithotripsy should only be used for 'salvage' therapy in
      select patients.

      A critical need exists to compare the efficacy of per oral pancreatoscopy-guided lithotripsy
      (PPL) with ESWL to determine which therapy is most efficacious in removing refractory PD
      stones. The investigators believe ERCP with POP has distinct advantages of localizing
      'shocks' to the stones, helping to identify and treat underlying strictures in the duct, and
      lithotripsy of multiple stones can be performed at a single session with a recent
      multi-center international retrospective study showing all stones removed in a single session
      in over 70% of cases. Therefore, this project seeks to change the perceived standard of care
      as it relates to symptomatic pancreatic duct stones in this population, shifting the pendulum
      towards endoscopic and specifically pancreatoscopy-guided therapy.
