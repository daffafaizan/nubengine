      smokeless delivery system for inhaled marijuana. We will compare plasma levels of
      delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), cannabinol, cannabidiol, and metabolites, including
      11-OH-THC, in healthy volunteers after smoking ~400 mg each of approximately 1.8, 3.5, and 7%
      THC marijuana cigarettes (using the Foltin puff procedure) to those obtained when the same
      individuals inhale the vaporization product of the rest of the marijuana from the identical
      cigarette processed through the Volcano device. In addition to plasma levels, we will also
      compare the THC concentrations over an 8-hour time period, the subjective high experienced by
      the patients, and clinical evidence of cannabis effect by evaluating conjunctival hyperemia
      and heart rate. We will also compare the tolerability of the two methods of ingestion, and we
      will monitor expired carbon monoxide to evaluate whether the vaporizer reduces exposure to
      respiratory toxins.
