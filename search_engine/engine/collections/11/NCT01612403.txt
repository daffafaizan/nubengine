      seminal plasma of asthenozoospermic subjects. Zinc supplementation restores HMW-Zn% in
      seminal plasma of asthenozoospermic subjects to normal value. LMW-Zn% is elevated in seminal
      plasma of asthenozoospermic patients. It may be because increment the levels of semenogelin
      in seminal plasma of asthenozoospermic subjects. Zinc supplementation elevates LMW-Zn% in
      seminal plasma of asthenozoospermic subjects to more than normal value, this may be because
      of its enhancement of the synthesis of metallothioneins (Low molecular weight zinc binding
      protein).
