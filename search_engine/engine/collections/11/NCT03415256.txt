        -  The control group will not receive any treatment and they will continue their usual
           lifestyle.

        -  Visit 2 through 8:

        -  The treatment group will receive a passive vibration for 15 minutes followed by SBF
           measurement.

        -  The control group will continue their usual lifestyle.

        -  In the fifth session, the treatment and control groups will come back for tests.
