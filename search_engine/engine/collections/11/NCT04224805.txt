      of head and neck region. This includes breathing, swallowing, speech and temporomandibular
      disorders. It is estimated that in about 19% of orthodontic patients, orthognathic surgery is
      required along with the orthodontic procedure. The introduction of CAD/CAM technology in
      orthognathic surgery planning has facilitated the procedure and allowed for more predicted
      results. Aim of this study: The aim of the present study is to propose a new design of the
      intermediate stent that relates the mobilized maxilla to a fixed anatomical landmark in the
      skull which would allow for more accurate positioning of the maxilla during orthognathic
      surgery. Materials and methods: This study was conducted on sixteen patients who have been
      undergone Le Fort I osteotomy procedure. Eight of them (group A) were treated via a
      conventional stent while the other eight patients (group B) via a CAD/CAM bone-borne stent.
      Postoperative patient evaluation was performed by comparing the predicted maxillary position
      to the resultant position postoperatively. This was done via 3D reconstruction CT scans.
