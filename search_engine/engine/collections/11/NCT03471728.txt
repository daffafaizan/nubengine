    
      This is a post-marketing long-term specified drug use-result survey study required for
      products in Japan. The investigator will register the patient who have been taking this
      product for the first time within 14 days after the start of treatment (inclusive of the
      start day). For each of the registered patients (including withdrawals and dropouts), the
      investigator will enter the survey data on the case report form.
