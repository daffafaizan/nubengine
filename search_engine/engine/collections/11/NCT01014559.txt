    
      Eligible patients with documented cancer or non-cancer pain, either currently receiving a WHO
      step II opioid and requiring the initiation of a WHO step III opioid or currently receiving a
      WHO step III opioid, and having opioid-related constipation defined by either a KESS score ≥9
      or the current use of laxatives (≥3 times per week), will be randomly assigned to receive
      either OXN PR or Oxy PR. Randomisation will be stratified on the cause of pain: cancer or
      non-cancer.

      Any patient having completed the study and wishing to receive OXN PR afterwards may enter an
      optional open extension phase. During this phase, all patients will receive OXN PR and be
      managed as per the usual practice in the center until commercial OXN PR is available in
      France (with a limit of 1 year after Day 28). Adverse events will be assessed at each visit.
