        1. Characterize the relationship between BMI and Th2 skewing in non-atopic adult subjects.

        2. Compare these results to those previously obtained from atopic adult subjects It is
           expected that the results of this study will demonstrate enhanced Th2 skewing in
           overweight and obese atopic subjects as compared to non-atopic subjects. It is further
           anticipated that the results of this study will be used as preliminary data to generate
           an NIH grant application exploring the link between obesity and atopy.
