      is the leading cause of perinatal mortality and morbidity. During the latency period, several
      events such as the ascent of pathogenic microorganisms from the lower genital area could
      create complications which may culminate in cerebral palsy. Avoiding intrauterine infection
      appears as one of the most important objective in the PPROM management. Most authors propose
      the conservative management of women with PPROM, associating antibiotic therapy to
      corticosteroid administration in patients with PPROM before 30 to 32 weeks. The main benefit
      of conservative management is prolonging pregnancy, but the benefit must be balanced with the
      risks of fetal complications. In an effort to diminish the risks of infection linked to a
      longer latency period, several authors have proposed intentional delivery after PPROM.

      The primary objective is the comparison between the results of IMMUNOCHROMATOGRAPHY tests
      done at the bedside of the patient and the ELISA tests performed in the laboratory.

      The secondary outcome is the description of the inflammatory status following a rupture of
      membranes at term and during labor.

      Vaginal secretions samplings are perform after premature rupture of membranes and during
      labor. The bedside test is performing immediately after sampling and the rest of the sampling
      is frozen. ELISA assays will be performed on these samples.
