      unipedal and bipedal movement in a cohort of healthy individuals (Aim 1).

      The rigor and reproducibility will be evaluated by comparing the results of 1) active
      movement -Bipedal with 2) active movement -unipedal 4 and 3) imagined movement.

      Dependent measures include: 1) head motion during the fMRI task, 2) BOLD signal in the
      ipsilateral and contralateral motor cortex during the fMRI task, 3) force applied during the
      fMRI task, and 4) participant feedback using a modified version of the Presence Questionnaire
      (a standard tool to assess ecological validity of virtual environments.

      Each Aim has a development and evaluation aspect. Through this 1 year proposal the
      investigators will determine if the bipedal fMRI protocol (active movement) is able to engage
      neural networks more robustly (e.g. greater effect size) than bipedal imagery alone in
      Healthy Volunteers.

      Specific Aim #1: Healthy volunteers: The investigators will test the hypothesis that with
      active bipedal movement there will be 1) no difference in head movement, but 2) greater motor
      cortex BOLD signal, 3) smoother force exchange between the feet, 4) higher participant
      satisfaction than unipedal movement or motor imagery alone. This sample size was selected
      based on a prior publication of imagined movement. The outcome of this aim may result in the
      first publication in the field to evaluate bipedal movement in an MR-environment.
