    
      Left atrial appendage closure (LAAC) is an increasingly used non-pharmacologic strategy to
      prevent stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation who have absolute or relative
      contraindications to long-term oral anticoagulant therapy, mainly due to previous major
      bleeding or high bleeding risk. As the candidates of the procedure are mainly aged and
      multimorbid, the reduction of procedural burden is of huge significance for them. More
      comprehensive data about the optimal imaging of LAAC may contribute in finding the most
      accurate and least invasive way to plan and guide the procedure and to follow up the
      patients.

      The aim of the present prospective, randomized, single-centre study is to examine the
      potential advantages of preoperative multimodal imaging in percutaneous left atrial appendage
      closure. The investigators are going to assess the success rate, safety and long-term outcome
      of LAAC procedures, and determine the procedural burden (total radiation dose, procedure
      time, fluoroscopy time, contrast amount) of the interventions after preprocedural multimodal
      (2D/3D transesophageal echocardiography /TOE/ and multidetector computed tomography /MDCT/)
      and standard (2D/3D TOE or MDCT) appendage characterization and device sizing. Multimodal
      procedural guidance (2D/3D TOE, fluoroscopy-angiography) and multimodal postprocedural
      imaging (2D/3D TOE, MDCT) is going to be used to reveal complications (peri-device leak,
      thrombus). The investigators are planning to compare the accuracy and additive value of
      different postoperative imaging techniques, and ascertain the additive value of
      echocardiographic contrast agents in detecting postoperative complications.
