      the WEAVE trial to determine the one-year outcomes for these patients.

      This includes both the assessment of any stroke, hemorrhage, or death, as well as assessment
      of delayed imaging results to determine the re-stenosis rate of the stents in these patients
      and the medication regimen in those patients who had symptomatic re-stenosis.

      The subjects for this study are pre-defined as the 152 patients who had placement of a
      Wingspan stent for treatment of their intracranial artery stenosis that had symptoms of
      stroke and 70% or greater arterial stenosis. The study will be conducted at 24 sites in the
      United States. It is expected that up to 152 patients' records will be assessed for follow up
      data analysis. Patient's information will be included in the study if they were enrolled in
      the WEAVE Trial and had placement of a Wingspan stent in its on-label usage indication
      between 12/1/2013 and 10/31/2017. Follow up information from the patients' charts will be
      extracted out to the one-year interval following stenting up to December 2018.
