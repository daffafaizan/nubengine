      We propose a monocentric-randomised study. Inclusion criteria are women over 18 years
      requiring hysteroscopic surgery for fibroma. After informed consent, patients will be
      randomised in two groups: hysteroscopic surgery with morcellation technic and conventional
      hysteroscopy technic with resection. The main objective is duration of procedure. Secondary
      objectives are characteristics and perioperative complications (distension media quantity,
      cervical injury, uterine perforation), immediate et long term postoperative data's
      (postoperative pain and synechia). We hypothesis hysteroscopic with morcellation reduces
      duration of procedure of 50%. The estimated size of population number is 30 per group and 60
      for the study.

      Expected results

      We expected a significant decrease of procedure duration with hysteroscopic morcellation.
      This data will be interesting according peroperative complications are correlated to
      procedure duration and allow hysteroscopic surgery to patients with large or several
      fibromas.
