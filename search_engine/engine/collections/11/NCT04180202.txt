      an invasive procedure that requires a central venous catheter. To overcome this challenge, a
      new technology to assess CVP non-invasively using an oscillometric method is being developed.
      It is called enclosed zone central venous pressure (ezCVP). A comparison study of ezCVP and
      CVP is needed to determine accuracy and reproducibility.
