      among immunocompromised people, including solid-organ or hematopoietic stem-cell transplant
      recipients, those with HIV infection, those with hematological malignancies, and individuals
      on immunosuppressive drug regimens. There is a high rate of morbidity and mortality
      associated with IFI. Over the past decade, there has been an increase in resistance to
      commonly used antifungal agents and an epidemiological shift to more drug-resistant strains.
      This has demonstrated the need for the development of a new generation of azoles.
