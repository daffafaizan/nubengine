    
      This is a randomized controlled trial to assess and compare pain levels and pain medication
      needs following placement of Laminaria versus Dilapan-S for cervical preparation prior to
      second-trimester dilation and evacuation (D&E) procedures. Pain levels and medication usage
      will also be assessed following the D&E procedure itself, up to 7 days after the procedure.
