        -  Determine the response rate in patients with advanced melanoma treated with temozolomide
           and pegylated interferon alfa.

        -  Determine the toxicity profile of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the duration of disease response and overall survival of patients treated with
           this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to CNS metastases (yes vs no).

      Patients receive oral temozolomide once daily on weeks 1-6 and pegylated interferon alfa
      subcutaneously once weekly on weeks 1-8. Courses repeat every 8 weeks in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 23-61 patients (12-35 without CNS metastases and 11-26 with CNS
      metastases) will be accrued for this study within 18 months.
