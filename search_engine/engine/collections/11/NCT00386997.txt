    
      This is a multi-center, pilot, prospective, open label study. Approximately 20 patients will
      be recruited in 10 to 15 centers.

      The patient group will be the following:

      Elderly patients (≥ 55 years) with acute lymphoblastic leukemia undergoing chemotherapy with
      GMALL-Elderly 1/2003 protocol.

      They will be treated with LAMB for four weeks after induction phase I. Patients will attend
      for full assessment until trial completion or withdrawal: there will be 3 assessment visits
      during the first week, 2 assessment visits during the second week, and 1 weekly assessment
      visit during the third and fourth week of the prophylaxis treatment (the first visit of each
      week being the infusion visit as well).

      After the end of the prophylaxis period, patients will have 3 follow-up visits which will be
      scheduled at Weeks 6, 9, and 12.

      Please note that no other systemic antifungal prophylaxis is allowed to be used concomitantly
      with AmBisome®.
