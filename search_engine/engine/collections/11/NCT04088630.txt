    
      This is a double-blinded, placebo-controlled pilot trial of fingolimod in patients with
      primary spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage. Eligible participants will be allocated to
      study groups using fixed allocation randomization and a computer-based random
      number-generating allocation. Participants will be monitored at time of enrollment and days
      1, 3 5, 7, and 14 (discharge dependent) by 2 blinded assessors (neuroscience subspecialists)
      and will receive standard of care for the duration of the study. After discharge from the
      hospital, participants will enter a follow up phase of 12 months, with clinic visits at 30±14
      days, 90±14 days, 180±14 days, and 365±14 days. They will receive a standard of care MRI scan
      at the 30 day visit and standard of care CT of the brain at the 90 and 365 day visit and will
      be assessed with the pre-selected outcome assessments established by the NINDS Common Data
      Elements for Stroke at these time points.
