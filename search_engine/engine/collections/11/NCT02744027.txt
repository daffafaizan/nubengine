      malformations. Complicated LA cases in the past have been called lymphangiomatosis because of
      varied disseminated involvement including soft tissue and viscera such as the spleen, liver
      and bone. Pleural effusions and pericardial effusions are often associated with these
      lesions. These are now classified into different phenotypes such as Generalized Lymphatic
      Anomaly (GLA), Gorham's Stout Disease (GSD) and Kaposiform Lymphangiomatosis (KLA). These
      complicated phenotypes can cause massive osteolysis causing a morbidity and mortality from
      infection or paralysis or worsening pulmonary function and effusions (GSD, GLA, KLA).

      The major cause of mortality and morbidity in these patients is the deterioration of
      pulmonary function by chronic chylous effusions and progressive interstitial lung disease.
      Unfortunately, little is known about biomarkers, risk stratification or the pathophysiology
      of this progression. The understanding of changes in patients' lymphatic anatomy with LA is
      hindered by the difficulty of imaging the lymphatic system. Dynamic Contrast Enhanced MR
      Lymphangiogram (DCMRL) is a technique that has recently been developed, allowing dynamic MR
      imaging of the lymphatic system by injecting gadolinium contrast agent in the groin lymph
      nodes.

      This technique has been previously used to identify pathological lymphatic perfusion of the
      lung parenchyma in patients with plastic bronchitis and neonatal chylothorax. Based on these
      imaging findings, a treatment algorithm has been designed and used to successfully treat the
      majority of those patients with these conditions.
