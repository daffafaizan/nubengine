      resulting in damage to cellular lipids, proteins and DNA. Because of free radical-induced
      apoptosis of skeletal muscle fibers, oxidative stress is an important contributor to skeletal
      muscle fatigue and low exercise tolerance of congestive heart failure patients. Enhanced
      oxidative stress in congestive heart failure can exert negative inotropic effects and can
      have important effects on the structure and function of the myocardium, and may be implicated
      in the progression of congestive heart failure. Free radical stress could also impair
      recruitment and differentiation of circulating endothelial progenitor cells resulting in
      increased all cause mortality.

      Reduced pulmonary clearance of free radical loaded white blood cells and platelets is an
      important contributor to enhanced oxidative stress in congestive heart failure patients.
      Failure of pulmonary clearance of free radical loaded white blood cells and platelets
      probably results from pulmonary congestion which has led to the rationale of the current
      study. Biventricular pacing for resynchronization therapy in congestive heart failure
      patients reduces left ventricular filling pressure and pulmonary congestion. Biventricular
      pacing may therefore augment pulmonary clearance of free radical loaded white blood cells and
      platelets in congestive heart failure patients.

      We conduct a prospective, observational clinical study to investigate the correlation of left
      ventricular filling pressure, pulmonary clearance of FR loaded circulating white blood cells
      and platelets and number of endothelial progenitor cells in congestive heart failure (CHF)
      patients before and after implantation of a biventricular pacemaker for resynchronization
      therapy.
