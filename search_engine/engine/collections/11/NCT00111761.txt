      combination with the FOLFIRI regimen in subjects with metastatic colorectal cancer. (The
      primary objective in the original protocol was to assess progression free survival after
      treatment with ABX-EGF in combination with the Saltz regimen in subjects with metastatic
      colorectal cancer).

      Secondary Objective(s) To assess the clinical efficacy of ABX-EGF in combination with the
      FOLFIRI regimen in subjects with metastatic colorectal cancer. (Secondary objectives in the
      original protocol were to assess safety and additional measures of the clinical efficacy of
      ABX-EGF in combination with the Saltz regimen in subjects with metastatic colorectal cancer).

      To assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) of ABX-EGF in combination with the FOLFIRI regimen in
      subjects with metastatic colorectal cancer. (Secondary objectives in the original protocol
      were to assess the PK of ABX-EGF in combination with the Saltz regimen, and the PK of
      irinotecan (IR) and its active metabolite SN-38 when IR is given in combination with ABX-EGF,
      leucovorin (LV), and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in subjects with metastatic colorectal cancer)
