    
      The NUsurfaceÂ® Meniscus Implant is intended for use in patients with medial compartment pain
      that have had a previous partial medial meniscectomy.

      Patients who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be assigned by balanced randomization
      into one of two groups: the Meniscus Implants versus non-surgical standard of care. The KOOS
      (Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score) and IKDC (International Knee Documentation
      Committee) forms will be used to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the patients'
      pre-intervention and post-intervention condition including activity levels, pain, swelling,
      locking, stability, support, sports activity, and quality of life assessment.
