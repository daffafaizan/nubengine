      with blinded assessment of the outcome in a study network with helicopter emergency medical
      service units in Austria, Germany, Switzerland, Italy, Czech Republic and the Netherlands.

      The protocol, information and consent procedure will be approved by the institutional review
      board of each participating center. Since this is a study randomizing unconscious patients
      who are unable to give informed consent at the time of randomization (ยง43a Emergency study),
      the requirement of informed consent is planned to be waived in accordance with the ethical
      standards of national legislation in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Italy, Czech Republic and
      the Netherlands and the guidelines for good clinical practice of the European Agency for the
      Evaluation of Medicinal products. Depending on the patient's outcome, either the surviving
      patient, or the patient's family in case of death of the patient or in case that the patient
      survives but remains mentally handicapped will be informed about the trial (see appendix for
      patient information sheet); the protocol specifies that if there are any objections, the
      patient will be withdrawn from the study.

      Treatment assignments of blinded study drugs will be randomly generated by computer in blocks
      of two, with stratification according to center. Before the start of the trial, staff at
      participating centers will be informed about the rationale of the protocol and the study;
      participating centers will be subsequently contacted and visited to ensure proper enrollment.
