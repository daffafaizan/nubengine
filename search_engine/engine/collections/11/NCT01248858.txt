    
      This is a Phase I, open-label, dose-escalation study to characterize the safety,
      tolerability, pharmacokinetic profile, pharmacodynamic profile, and clinical activity of the
      oral PI3K inhibitor GSK2126458 and the oral MEK inhibitor GSK1120212 dosed in combination in
      subjects with advanced solid tumors. The study will be conducted in 2 parts, a Part 1 dose
      escalation phase and a Part 2 tumor specific cohort expansion.

      A continuous daily dosing schedule will be utilized initially for both investigational
      products. The frequency and schedule of dosing may be adjusted based on emerging safety,
      pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics data.

      Once a recommended regimen has been characterized in Part 1, it may be further evaluated in
      Part 2 . More than one regimen (doses and schedules) may be evaluated in Part 2, based on
      findings in Part 1.

      Subjects eligible for enrollment in Part 2 will have solid tumors with genetic profiles that
      are likely to benefit from a MEK and PI3K pathway inhibition.
