    
      CerefolinNAC速 is an orally administered prescription medical food, and is formulated as a
      combination of L-methylfolate calcium (as Metafolin速), methylcobalamin, and N-acetylcysteine.
      In a retrospective analysis, disease-delaying effects of Cerefolin速/CerefolinNAC速 (CFLN) are
      examined in terms of cognition (measured by MCI Screen (MCIS)), and functional capacity
      (measured by Functional Assessment Staging Test (FAST)). - the treatment effect of CFLN on
      cognitive and functional measures, and on biomarker measures in patients with Alzheimer's
      disease and related disorders (ADRD).

      The current study will expand the NAC-002b study dataset by prospectively collecting
      additional biomarker and imaging data in a more comprehensively assessed, matched sample of
      patients. This will allow more precise evaluation of cognitive and functional outcome
      measures, and biomarker measures will be assessed in an attempt to identify specific
      populations or conditions in which CFLN is most effective.

      The sample will consist of patients with homocysteinemia plus past/current CFLN treatment
      (Treatment Group) matched to those without homocysteinemia plus no past/current B12, folate
      or CFLN treatment (Non-Treatment Group). Also 65 additional subjects will be recruited for
      the non-Treatment group, which will be used to improve the rate of decline estimates for the
      cognitive and functional outcome measures.
