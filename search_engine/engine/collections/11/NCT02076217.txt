      unprotected sex. Although high sensitivity urine pregnancy tests effectively rule-out
      pregnancy resulting from sex that occurred more than 14 days ago, clinicians are frequently
      concerned that pregnancy may result from unprotected sex that occurred <14 days prior to IUD
      placement. Placement of a copper IUD within 5 days of unprotected sex is a highly effective
      form of EC. Among 52 Chinese women who reported unprotected intercourse 5-7 days prior to
      copper IUD insertion, no pregnancies occurred. However, the effectiveness of the copper IUD
      when unprotected sex occurs 7-14 days prior to IUD placement is unknown. Intrauterine
      pregnancies rarely occur with a copper IUD in place. As some clinicians are concerned about
      injuring a pregnancy that occurs with an IUD in place, women who have had unprotected sex
      7-14 days prior to requesting IUD placement are typically told they must use another, less
      effective, contraceptive for 2+ weeks and then return to obtain an IUD. To remove this
      barrier to emergency placement of a copper IUD, we propose to study rates of pregnancy when a
      copper IUD is placed "any time a urine pregnancy test is negative." We believe that
      simplifying guidance regarding the recommended timing of copper IUD placement has the
      potential to significantly increase the number of women offered "same-day" IUD service.
