      exercise may modulated by CrAT activity. Furthermore, dynamic changes in acetylcarnitine
      during the transition from exercise to resting metabolism (acetylcarnitine off-kinetic) may
      also reflect the action of CrAT protein. To date, the only possibility to get information on
      CrAT activity is by taking a muscle biopsy and perform enzyme activity assays ex vivo. By
      dynamic MRS scanning, it might be possible to deduce information that reflects CrAT activity,
      thereby making the biopsy sampling unnecessary.
