      the Sleep Clinic of the Hospital Miguel Servet, a large teaching hospital in Zaragoza
      (Spain). Following a baseline visit, subjects are to be followed-up at 3 months, and then
      every year.

      Subject participation. The investigators will enroll a total 300 consecutive OSA male
      patients aged 20-60 yrs, with baseline apnea-hypopnea index â‰¥ 5 events per hour of sleep
      (AHI). In addition, 50 control subjects (AHI < 5) aged 20-60 yrs and matched by body mass
      index (BMI) are also to be recruited. Exclusion criteria will include any comorbid condition
      including alcohol and tobacco use.

      Measurements: Routine clinical assessment, full sleep study, bilateral carotid
      ultrasonography, biochemistry, circulating inflammatory cytokines, T cell subsets and
      epigenetics studies at baseline and every year until at least 5 years of follow-up.
