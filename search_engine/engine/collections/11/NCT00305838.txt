        -  Determine the percentage of patients with relapsed advanced ovarian carcinoma, fallopian
           tube carcinoma, or primary peritoneal carcinoma who have a log linear rise in CA 125
           levels.

        -  Determine whether the log linear part of the curve is consistent enough to allow
           comparison of the slope before and after introduction of a new therapy.

        -  Compare the serial doubling time before and after commencing tamoxifen citrate
           treatment.

        -  Determine the number of patients required to detect a significant difference in CA 125
           doubling time before and after starting tamoxifen citrate treatment.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo blood collection once a month to measure CA 125 levels. Once the CA
      125 level goes above the upper limit of normal (ULN) or has started to rise from its nadir
      level (if not previously normal), CA 125 levels are measured every 2 weeks. When CA 125
      levels reach 4 times the ULN or 4 times the nadir level (if not previously normal), patients
      begin oral tamoxifen citrate once daily for 3-6 months in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity. CA 125 levels will continue to be measured every 2 weeks during
      treatment.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 200 patients will be accrued for this study.
