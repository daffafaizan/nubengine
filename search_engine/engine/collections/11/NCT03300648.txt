      swelling, cerebral herniation, compression of the brainstem respiratory center, and
      respiratory arrest. In those who survive their illness without specific interventions,
      reversal of diffuse cerebral swelling is rapid.

      Mechanical ventilation may help to preserve life while diffuse brain swelling diminishes.
      Intravenous hypertonic saline may work as an osmotic diuretic, directly decreasing brain
      swelling.
