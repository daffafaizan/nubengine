      adenocarcinoma treated with combination gemcitabine and docetaxel. II. Determine the toxicity
      profile of this combination therapy in these patients. III. Assess the survival rate of these
      patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour followed by gemcitabine IV over 30
      minutes. Patients receive treatment every other week for 8 weeks (4 courses). Patients may
      continue treatment in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Patients
      are followed every 12 weeks until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: This study will accrue approximately 10 patients per month for a maximum
      of 33 patients.
