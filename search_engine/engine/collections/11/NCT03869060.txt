      nine healthy subjects between 18 and 45 years old will be inoculated with Dengue 1 Live Virus
      Human Challenge (DENV-1-LVHC) at a dose used in the previous study. Subjects will be closely
      monitored for the first 28 days with continued follow up through 6 months. Clinical and
      laboratory parameters, viremia and antibody levels will be assess. The goal is to expand the
      data set of symptoms produced by uncomplicated dengue-like illness.
