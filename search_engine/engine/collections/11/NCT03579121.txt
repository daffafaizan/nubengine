      groups will receive pharmacogenomics (PGx) testing preoperatively. The PGx guided group will
      have their results reviewed by the clinicians during their treatment and the results may
      guide clinical decisions. The control group results will be sealed until completion of
      treatment and clinicians will not have access to this information. These participants will
      undergo standard treatment dosing and medication selection.
