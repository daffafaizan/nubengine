    
      Eligible adults 30 to 70 years old hospitalized for an MI, (cf inclusion and non-inclusion
      criteria), will be asked to participate in the study. (screening)

      At M0 :

        -  patients will be examined by a periodontist for assessing the severity of periodontitis
           (standard oral examination including a periodontal screening test).

        -  Patients with severe periodontitis will then receive: Complete periodontal examination
           of all teeth (6 sites per tooth) including pocket depth measurement, measurement of
           gingival recession, plaque index, gingival bleeding index, and a gingival fluid sample.
           Patients will then be informed of their periodontal status and therapeutic options. At
           this point, the patient may decide not to follow the treatment and will not be
           randomized.

        -  Patients who agree to continue the study will have a venous blood sample and a PET-FDG
           examination. Patients in whom the acquisition of FDG-PET is impossible will not be
           randomized.

      At the end of these examinations, if all the conditions are met, the randomization will be
      carried out :

        -  Intervention group: Periodontal treatment, for a maximum of 6 months. At the end of the
           periodontal treatment, a follow-up of at least 6 months, including a maintenance visit
           to M9, will be performed.

        -  Control group: patients will be referred to their treating dentist for usual care.
