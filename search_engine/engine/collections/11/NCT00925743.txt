    
      The total duration on the study per subject will be about 26 weeks broken down as follows:

        -  A maximum of 21-day screening phase,

        -  21-days (+/- 2 weeks) study treatment cycles,

        -  30-day follow-up visit after the last dose of study medication.

        -  Cut-off date for parts 1, 2, 3 and 4: when the last patient has completed 6 cycles
           (parts 1 and 2) or 2 cycles (parts 3 and 4) of treatment or discontinued study treatment
           (for disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or
           investigator's decision to withdraw), whichever comes first, in the corresponding part.

      Patients still receiving treatment at the cut-off date may continue to receive treatment
      beyond the cut-off date at investigator's discretion if benefiting.
