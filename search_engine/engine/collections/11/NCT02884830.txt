      inducing a flow limitation. As a consequence, we observe in these patients an increased end
      expiratory lung volume and a positive end expiratory pressure (PEEPi) at the end of a normal
      expiration.

      Patients are breathing at higher pulmonary volumes: this is the concept of static
      hyperinflation.

      This worsens the breathing pattern because in this situation, the work of breathing is
      increased such that dyspnea increases.

      The application of a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) has been shown to improve
      static hyperinflation and to decrease the work of breathing.

      Sleep is deteriorated in COPD patients, and causal factors includes static hyperinflation,
      cough, depression. Moreover, normal physiological changes occuring during sleep in COPD
      patients are leading to deterioration of gaseous exchanges. The purpose of our study is to
      assess the effect of nocturnal CPAP on sleep quality and functional respiratory parameters.
