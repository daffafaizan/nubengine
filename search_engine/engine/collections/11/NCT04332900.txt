      participants will be assessed during level walking at a self-selected speed and the stepping
      manoeuvre test under the three conditions that will be randomized: i) the control condition;
      ii) intervention proximal condition; and iii) intervention distal condition. The control
      condition refers to the condition in which no interventions will be administered. In both the
      intervention proximal condition and intervention distal condition, the respective therapeutic
      approach will be administered. For each functional task, three valid attempts will be
      collected. The primary outcome of this study is knee pain intensity and the secondary
      outcomes are both self-reported measures and kinematic variables measures. The self-reported
      measures are global change, symptoms, ease of performance and confidence, while the kinematic
      variables measures are hip adduction and internal hip rotation peak and rearfoor eversion
      peak
