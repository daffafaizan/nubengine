      outline the accurate long-term outcomes of fat transfer to the breast. Currently, fat
      grafting to the breast is a treatment option in conditions such as micromastia, breast
      ptosis, post mastectomy breast reconstruction, asymmetric breasts, congenital malformations
      of breast development and for treatment of complications associated with implant augmentation
      mammoplasty. In addition to fat grafting, the current surgical treatment for these conditions
      is mainly based on techniques requiring implant augmentation or reconstruction. Although the
      safety of saline implants has been well studied and documented, this data cannot be
      extrapolated for the newer generation silicone implants and other alternatives such as fat
      grafting need to be investigated. Also implant augmentation and reconstruction comes at the
      price of capsular contracture, implant deflation, infection and more future corrective
      surgeries. We plan to prospectively study the outcomes of fat grafting in patients with these
      conditions for a period of 5 years. The collected information will be entered into a database
      and will be prospectively collected and reviewed. Patients demographics, information obtained
      during the preoperative and postoperative visits along with the pertinent findings regarding
      the fat transfer to the breast will be collected into the database for our investigation.
