      National Eye Institute Silicone Study demonstrated the superiority of silicone oil compared
      with sulfur hexafluoride, and its comparability with perfluoropropane, for the treatment of
      complicated retinal detachment associated with advanced proliferative vitreoretinopathy.
      There are some complications occurring in pars plana vitrectomy with silicone oil tamponade.
      These complications may occur during surgery and after the surgery. Silicone oil
      emulsification is one of the complication that may result in severe sequels including
      band-shaped keratopathy, complicated glaucoma and retinopathy that are difficult to treat.
      The commonly used silicone oil includes low viscosity and high viscosity type. It is believed
      that low viscosity silicone oil has more risk to develop emulsification than high viscosity
      silicone oil. Up to now, however, there is no conclusive guideline that which types of
      silicone oil is suitable for these complicated retinal detachment surgeries and what is the
      appropriate time to remove the oil. Retrospective medical review of these patients using
      1000-vs 5000-centistoke silicone oil demonstrated that anatomic and visual acuity outcomes,
      as well as complication rates including emulsification, were similar in both groups. To the
      best of authors' knowledge, there has been no prospective study on this subject. This study
      aims to study the silicone oil emulsification comparing between low viscosity and high
      viscosity silicone oil after complicated retinal detachment surgery.
