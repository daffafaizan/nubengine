      tomography (PET) with [C-11]FLB 457, in cortical regions of interest in subjects who have a
      history of cocaine dependence. We hypothesize that cocaine dependence is associated with
      decreases in dopamine in the prefrontal cortical regions compared to controls. This may
      explain the impulsivity and cognitive deficits that underlie relapse in this disorder.
