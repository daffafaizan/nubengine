      Arthritis, even in the absence of active inflammation. The investigators believe that these
      symptoms may be a result of abnormal pain processing by the Central Nervous System (CNS), in
      a process called central sensitization.

      The investigators have developed a short, self-report questionnaire to measure central pain
      mechanisms in people with RA. It is called Central Aspects of Pain in Rheumatoid Arthritis
      (CAP-RA), and was adapted from a pre-existing questionnaire called CAP-Knee (which measures
      central sensitization in people with chronic knee pain).

      This study aims to measure the psychometric properties of CAP-RA, and the ability of the
      questionnaire to predict worse pain in the RA population. Secondary objectives of the study
      include predicting worse fatigue in people with RA, deriving CAP-RA scoring recommendations,
      investigating other factors associated with persistent RA pain, the association between
      central sensitization and pain, and investigating the course of pain and fatigue in RA.

      Participants will be recruited from a Rheumatology clinic. At baseline and 12 weeks these
      participants will undergo quantitative sensory testing (QST, pain tests), ultrasound for
      synovitis, clinical assessments, laboratory tests for systemic inflammation and, complete a
      questionnaire booklet, including the CAP-RA questionnaire.

      Some participants will complete the CAP-RA questionnaire 1 week after the baseline visit to
      assess the test-retest reliability of the questionnaire.

      In addition, participants will provide weekly pain and fatigue self-report via SMS for 12
      weeks.
