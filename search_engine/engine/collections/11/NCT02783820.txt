    
      This Phase I study will evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic properties of
      escalating single doses of reformulated MMV390048 when administered to healthy men and women
      of non-childbearing potential (WNCBP) under fasted conditions (Part A).

      Primary objectives:

      • To evaluate the safety and tolerability of single ascending doses of MMV390048 administered
      orally to healthy subjects (men and WNCBP) under fasted conditions

      Secondary objectives:

      • To describe the pharmacokinetics of MMV390048 in healthy subjects (men and WNCBP) after
      single oral dose administration
