      with conducted atrial arrhythmias. Secondarily, an investigation will be carried out to
      determine whether this increase in biventricular pacing results in an improvement in quality
      of life, as well as an improvement in the symptoms caused by the atrial arrhythmia and an
      improvement in the level of physical ability.
