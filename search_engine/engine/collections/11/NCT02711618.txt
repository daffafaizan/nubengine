      performance and safety of the UltraShape contour I V3 device non-invasive abdominal fat
      reduction for subjects with body mass index (BMI) above 28.

      Up to 60 healthy subjects will be enrolled. All subjects will undergo an assessment of their
      general health. During the treatment period, subject's fat thickness and circumferences will
      be measured and three successive UltraShape contour I V3 treatments will be performed (two
      weeks interval).

      Subjects will undergo treatment with the UltraShape contour I V3 using the U-Sculpt/VDF
      transducer on the abdomen area.

      Follow-up (FU) visits will be conducted as follows: 4 weeks FU, 8 weeks FU and 12 weeks FU
      post last treatment (Tx.3). Subject's fat thickness and circumference will be measured at
      each visit. Subject's blood test will be taken at baseline (prior to the first treatment, pre
      Tx.1), before the third treatment (pre Tx.3) and at 12 weeks follow-up visit (12wk FU). "No
      Pregnancy" will be verified before first treatment as well. In all following visits (TX2, Tx3
      and FU 1 FU 2 and FU3), lack of pregnancy will be verified by questioning. Additionally,
      subject satisfaction and investigator satisfaction questionnaires will be completed at each
      FU visit. Finally, photography will be performed under visible light conditions of the front,
      right and left view. Optional, 3D photographs will be taken at each visit (at treatment
      visits, prior to treatments).
