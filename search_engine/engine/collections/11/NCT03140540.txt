    
      TEE as guide for tailoring perioperative fluid therapy to achieve target hemodynamic goals of
      stroke volume index (SVI) greater than 35 mL/m2 and cardiac index greater than 2.5 L/min/m2
      and tissue oxygen delivery.

      GDT (goal directed therapy): continuous infusion of crystalloids 2 mL/kg/h.

      If (velocity time integral) VTI <20, 250 mL colloid bolus administered. Dose repeated every
      10 min until goal of VTI >20 met. Norepinephrine titrated to maintain MAP(mean arterial
      pressure) > 65 mm Hg. Blood transfused for haemoglobin <8 g Lactate levels as a surrogate
      indicator of organ perfusion as measured by arterial blood gas analysis at time of incision
      intraoperatively and after 12 hours and 48 hrs. The incidence of postoperative complications,
      morbidity, mortality, duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU stay.
