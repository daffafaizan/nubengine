    
      Huntington's Disease (HD) is an inherited disease that causes changes in a person's ability
      to control movements, thinking, and feelings. The intent of this study is to learn more about
      the beginning changes in thinking skills, emotional regulation, and brain structure and
      function as a person begins the transition from health to HD.

      Preliminary studies indicate that people with HD may have marked decline before an actual
      diagnosis. This study will help reveal the earliest indicators of the disease and what
      factors influence the age at which a person carrying the gene develops the disease. It is
      necessary to get information on the early stages of HD in order to develop drugs that can
      slow or postpone the onset of HD. The investigators hope this study will provide essential
      information for future trials of experimental drugs for HD.

      During this study, participants will undergo several detailed tests, including MRI scans of
      the brain, cognitive assessments, physical exams, bio specimen (blood, urine, cerebral spinal
      fluid) collection and neurological and psychiatric testing.
