      participants are receiving), and multicenter (when more than 1 hospital or medical school
      team work on a medical research) study. The study will consist of a Screening Phase (6
      weeks); an Open-label Treatment Phase (6 weeks for Arm A and 8 weeks for Arm B); and a
      Post-treatment Follow-up Phase (until 24 weeks after end of study treatment). Using a
      staggered approach, all eligible participants will be assigned to 1 of the 2 arms, according
      to their level of fibrosis. Arm A (consists of chronic HCV genotype 1 infected participants
      with early stages of liver fibrosis): participants will receive a combination therapy of SMV
      150 milligram (mg), DCV 60 mg and SOF 400 mg once daily for 6 weeks. Arm B (consists of
      chronic HCV genotype 1 infected participants with cirrhosis): participants will receive a
      combination therapy of SMV 150 mg, DCV 60 mg and SOF 400 mg once daily for 8 weeks. A
      sub-study will be performed at a selected study site, where only participants who will be
      eligible to participate in both the main study and the sub-study will be enrolled.
      Intra-hepatic and plasma HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA) levels; intra-hepatic, peripheral innate
      and adaptive immune responses during the treatment, will be assessed in the sub-study.
      Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.
