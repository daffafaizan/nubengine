      rule to Pap smear by prolonging the insertion of speculum after samples are obtained from the
      cervix. Methods: This study aims to conduct a randomized controlled study at NTUH.
      Approximately 200 subjects are expected to be recruited. The investigators will utilize the
      peak-end rule by adding a non-painful step right after the most uncomfortable phase in the
      intervention group. All study subjects are requested to score on a numeric pain scale during
      the Pap test. The primary outcome was the recalled pain intensity within five minutes after
      the Pap smear test.
