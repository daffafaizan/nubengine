      following initial urine collection on day 1. Patients undergo additional urine collection at
      4-6 hours following doubly labeled water consumption and then daily for 7 days.

      Additionally, at the beginning of the study, patients and healthy controls undergo
      respiratory calorimetry over approximately 45 minutes at rest, starting approximately 2-3
      hours after the last meal consumption and last use of aerosol bronchodilators (if required).
