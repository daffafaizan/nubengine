      (CHW) intervention at addressing glycemic control among Latinos with poorly controlled Type 2
      diabetes. Our group has worked with a promising model of intervention that utilizes CHW's
      based at one of our major community partners. Pilot data from this program has shown
      clinically significant prepost test improvements in HgA1C. Using the Chronic Care Model as an
      overarching framework, the study design of NOCHOP is a randomized controlled trial of 360
      Latinos, mostly of Caribbean descent, aged 35-70 years with HgA1C >=8.0. At a minimum,
      subjects in the intervention group will receive four home visits, ten group level visits and
      monthly phone calls by CHWs based at Alianza. The control groups will receive three separate
      mailings of bilingual diabetes health education materials. The primary outcome is glycemic
      control at 12month follow up, as measured by HgA1c. The secondary outcomes are changes in
      cholesterol and blood pressure (BP). We will also collect exploratory data on potential
      mechanisms through which our intervention resulted in hypothesized improvements including
      medication adherence, medication Intensification, diet and exercise. If successful, our
      project will make an important contribution to ongoing national and local debates about the
      sustainability of CHW programs. In particular, data from this study would be extremely useful
      for local Medicaid managed care plans who have expressed strong interests in data from
      rigorously designed clinical trials addressing the role of CHWs in delivering culturally
      appropriate and effective diabetes care.
