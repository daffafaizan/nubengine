      upper motor neuron lesion, and its reduction is a significant therapeutic target for
      optimizing motor performance.

      Investigator's recent study describes decrease in spasticity after SM in a group of children
      with CP. But that case series has no control group and the sample size was small so it does
      not prove the influence of the SM on the muscle spasticity.

      The purpose of the present study is to evaluate influence of the SM on muscle spasticity and
      on manual dexterity of the child with CP in a double-blind randomized clinical trial with two
      arms: SM (experimental group) and imitation of SM (control group).

      Children admitted to the International Clinic of Rehabilitation are selected according to
      inclusion-exclusion criteria and invited to participate. After getting the permission the
      baseline assessment is performed.

      Patients are allocated to the experimental or control group using stratified randomization.
      Medical doctor certified in Manual Therapy performs the intervention (SM in the experimental
      group and imitation in the control group) and in 15 minutes the second assessment is
      performed. Investigators, children and parents are blinded to group allocation.
