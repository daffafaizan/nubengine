      intermittent spontaneous breathing trials (1). Optimal respiratory muscle rest in-between
      breathing trials however has never been investigated.

      Using a crossover design, patients are to be ventilated with complete and partial respiratory
      muscle unloading for a period of ten hours respectively. Respiratory muscle activity is being
      monitored by oesophageal balloon technique using a commercially available System (Avea,
      Viasys, Conshohocken, PA, USA). Time of spontaneous breathing, respiratory- and ABG
      parameters are being determined to characterize the course of each spontaneous breathing
      trial.
