      therapy-cognitive-only version (CPT-C) in a sample of 130 active-duty service members through
      a variable length treatment. The study seeks to determine if some service members would
      benefit from a longer or shorter dose of treatment (4-24 sessions), and to identify which
      individuals are likely to require more, less, or the standard number of treatment sessions to
      reach good end-state functioning. Predictors of length of therapy and treatment outcome will
      be examined. Specifically, we will evaluate factors related to internalizing/externalizing
      traits, cognitive flexibility, inability to inhibit dysfunctional cognitions, and readiness
      to change as they are related to the number of treatment sessions required to treat patients
      to the point of good end-state functioning. Additional outcomes including alcohol use,
      psychosocial functioning, physical health, and sleep also will be evaluated.
