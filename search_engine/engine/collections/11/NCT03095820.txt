      intervention for late-life depression has increased. However, few studies have attempted to
      integrate several therapeutic approaches in one intervention program.

      Main objective of this study is to assess the effectiveness of a 12-week multidomain
      intervention with contingency management for reducing depressive symptoms in older adults
      with major depressive disorder.

      We plan to conduct a randomized controlled parallel-design study. We plan to allocate study
      participants to multidomain intervention or supportive therapy group, in a 1:1 ratio. Block
      randomization using SAS (PLAN procedure) and sample size estimation were performed. We
      estimated that, with at least 40 participants per group and an attrition rate of 10%, we
      could achieve a power of at least 0.80 (beta = 0.2, two-tailed alpha = 0.05).

      Intervention was based on the financial and human resources of a community mental health
      service, and involved four home visits and 12 telephone calls over 12 weeks. Four
      evidence-based therapeutic approaches (physical activity, healthy diet, social activity, and
      emotional regulation) were incorporated into the multidomain intervention program. To
      maintain participant motivation, we plan to apply contingency management based on operant
      conditioning theory.

      The primary outcome is the change in depressive symptoms, as measured by the
      Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Secondarily, we plan to investigate
      changes in resting-state functional connectivity in the default mode, salience, and central
      executive networks.
