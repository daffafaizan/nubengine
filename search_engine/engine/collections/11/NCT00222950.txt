      increasing body of evidence that indicates that increased plant sterol serum concentrations
      are correlated with an increased cardiovascular risk. Functional foods such as margarines
      supplemented with plant sterol esters are advertised to patients with hypercholesterolemia.
      Numerous studies show that margarines supplemented with plant sterol esters reduce serum
      cholesterol concentrations significantly. However, there are no studies available
      investigating relevant clinical endpoints. Nor are there any studies availabe investigating
      the effect of the consumption of margarines supplemented with plant sterol esters on serum
      and cardiovascular tissue concentrations. This study is done to investigate the effect of
      margarines supplemented with plant sterol esters on serum and cardiovascular tissue
      concentrations.
