      I. To determine the pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of icotinib (icotinib hydrochloride) in
      patients with advanced cancers.

      II. To determine the safety, tolerability and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of icotinib in
      patients with advanced cancers.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To preliminarily assess the anti-tumor activity of icotinib in patients with advanced
      cancers.

      II. To characterize the effect, if any, of icotinib on corrected QT interval using Bazett's
      formula (QTcB).

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate single nucleotide polymorphisms in genes encoding for icotinib's target
      (epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR]), putative transport protein (ATP-binding cassette,
      sub-family G [WHITE], member 1 [ABCG1]) and major metabolizing enzyme (cytochrome P450 3A4
      [CYP3A4]) as well as other genes that may be found to be important in icotinib activity, and
      correlate these single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with clinical activity and toxicity.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive icotinib hydrochloride orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Courses
      repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.
