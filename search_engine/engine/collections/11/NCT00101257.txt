      Primary

        -  Determine the safety and toxicity of autologous CD4-positive antigen-specific T cells in
           patients with stage III or IV ovarian epithelial cancer or primary peritoneal cavity
           cancer.

        -  Determine the duration of in vivo persistence of this drug in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the antitumor effect of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients undergo leukapheresis for collection of T cells. Responder T cells are stimulated in
      vitro with autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cell-derived dendritic cells pulsed with
      NY-ESO-1 immunogenic peptides. Patients receive autologous CD4-positive antigen-specific T
      cells IV over 30 minutes.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of autologous CD4-positive antigen-specific
      T cells until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose
      preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 4, 8, and 12 weeks and then periodically thereafter for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 9-18 patients will be accrued for this study.
