      Data source Data will be obtained from the French Programme for the Medicalisation of
      Information Systems (PMSI) database, which contains all discharge abstracts from all
      hospitals nationwide. The PMSI includes data on all hospital activities, whether acute
      (Medecine chirurgiae Obstetrique [MCO]), chronic (Soins de Suite et de Réadaptation [SSR]),
      or home-care (Hospitalization à Domicile [HAD]). Discharge abstracts include information on
      the patient's demographics, principal and associated diagnosis codes according to the tenth
      revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) [10], procedure codes, mode
      of hospitalization (elective, emergency, or hospital transfer), mode of discharge (home,
      hospital transfer, death; the latter was used to compute survival), duration of hospital
      stay, patient's home address, and hospital identification code. In addition, each patient has
      an anonymous alphanumerical identifier that enables all hospital admissions throughout the
      country to be traced. The databases will be provided for the calendar years 2009 to 2018
      included.

      Data extraction

        -  date: 01/01/2009 to 31/12/2018

        -  ICD-10 diagnostic code: C22.0 (liver cell carcinoma - HCC or hepatoma) and C22.9
           (malignant neoplasm of liver, unspecified)

        -  Patient: age, gender, co-morbidities, postal code

        -  Cause of chronic liver disease, presence of cirrhosis and severity

        -  1st diagnosis of HCC or recurrence

        -  Hospital of care, status and postal code

        -  Number and type of therapeutic procedures performed per year (each procedure will be
           counted according to whether it is the first treatment of HCC or the treatment of a
           recurrence):

             -  Liver transplantation

             -  Destruction of hepatic tumor by radiofrequency, percutaneous

             -  Destruction of hepatic tumor by radiofrequency, intraoperatively

             -  Hepatectomy and liver resection:

             -  Preoperative portal embolization

             -  Liver arterial chemo-embolization:

             -  Yttrium 90 Radio Embolization

        -  Survival from diagnosis and 1st treatment

      The expected results of this study are of major importance. On the one hand, this study will
      provide an overview of the current situation regarding the management of HCC at a national
      level, by analysing the evolutionary trends of the various therapeutic solutions. The
      analysis of the geographical variability of care that may exist between different health
      structures at different levels of expertise, but also at regional or departmental level, is
      of major importance in order to detect and explain possible differences in terms of
      prognosis. These data may be of great interest to health authorities or to potential future
      investigators who will be committed to conducting new prospective projects based on solid and
      up-to-date data.
