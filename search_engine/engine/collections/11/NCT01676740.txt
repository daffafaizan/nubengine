    
      Patients with mild anemia will be identified at preoperative clinic visit

        -  Patients will be screened for inclusion and exclusion criteria

        -  Eligible patients will have laboratory testing performed as follows: CBC, liver and
           kidney function tests, serum iron, transferrin, ferritin, serum folic acid, vitamin B12
           and C-reactive protein

        -  Patients will be assigned to a deficient group or non-deficient group depending upon
           laboratory hematinic values

        -  Patients in the "non-deficient' group will be randomized using a computer-generated code
           to treatment or no treatment

        -  Treatment will begin within 2 weeks of laboratory testing and 4-6 weeks prior to
           surgery.

        -  Hematinic therapy will consist of oral ferric hydrochloride polymaltose 200 mg/d and
           folic acid 0.4 mg/d; sublingual vitamin B12 1000 Âµg three times a week

        -  On the day of surgery laboratory testing will be performed as follows: CBC, kidney and
           liver function tests, serum iron, transferrin, ferritin, serum folic acid, vitamin B12
           and C-reactive protein.

        -  The same surgical team in each center will operate on all study patients and will be
           blinded to the preoperative hemoglobin

        -  Routine postoperative management will be provided as determined by the treating
           physicians

        -  Blood transfusion will be decided upon by a study physician at each center blinded to
           the patients' group assignment and preoperative hemoglobin

        -  The primary outcome will be perioperative blood transfusion (from 24 hours prior to
           surgery until hospital discharge)

        -  Secondary outcomes will be length of hospitalization, postoperative wound infection,
           walking ability across room at 30 days
