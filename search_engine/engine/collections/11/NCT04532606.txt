      bladder cancers are nonmuscle invasive, including those of Ta-T1 stage and carcinoma in situ.
      Transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) is the standard therapy for nonmuscle
      invasive bladder cancer. However, patients after TURBT are at a high risk of recurrence and
      progression.

      Recently, impacts of anesthetic agents on tumor cells have attracted more attention.
      Benzodiazepines are found to inhibit proliferation of lymphoma, neural tumor, lung cancer,
      rectal cancer and breast cancer cells in vitro. Midazolam may have anti-tumor effects through
      induction of apoptosis and inhibition of inflammatory reaction. However, clinical evidence
      regarding effects of benzodiazepines on outcomes after cancer surgery remains lacking.

      Remimazolam is a new benzodiazepine with rapid onset and ultra-short activity. It is rapidly
      metabolized by tissue esterases to inactive metabolite and can be reversed by flumazenil.
      Therefore, patients wake up rapidly even after prolonged infusions. It is also found to
      produce less respiratory and circulatory depression when compared with propofol.

      Delirium is an acute onset and transient cerebral dysfunction, and is associated with worse
      outcomes including prolonged hospitalization, worse functional recovery, cognitive decline,
      and increased mortality rate. Previous studies indicated that benzodiazepines increase
      incidence of postoperative delirium, possibly due to prolonged action. With the property of
      ultra-short activity, remimazolam may not increase the incidence of delirium. But evidence is
      lacking in this aspect.

      The aims of this study are to explore the impact of remimazolam on emergency delirium and
      recurrence-free survival in patients undergoing bladder cancer surgery.
