    
      Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is painful in 6.8% of men and 11.4% of women age 63-93, with over 20
      million Americans affected nationwide, and may lead to a variety of untoward consequences
      including limitations in physical function, postural instability, sleep disturbance,
      psychosocial disability, and substantial utilization of health care resources. While oral
      analgesics represent the mainstay of treatment for chronic pain associated with knee OA,
      non-responders with limiting comorbidities may have few therapeutic alternatives.

      The aims of this research study are to (1) reduce pain severity and disability in
      community-dwelling older adults with OA-associated chronic knee pain using periosteal
      electroacupuncture (osteopuncture), and (2) improve the physical performance, psychosocial
      function, sleep, and appetite of these individuals. 88 older adults with persistent knee pain
      and x-ray evidence of OA, no other rheumatologic disorders, no history of knee surgery, and
      no prominent pain in sites other than the knee(s) will be randomized to receive either
      osteopuncture or control osteopuncture once a week for 6 weeks. All outcome measures for pain
      and disability, as well as physical performance, psychosocial function, sleep, and appetite,
      will be collected pre-treatment, at the completion of the 6-week protocol, and 3 months
      later.
