      Aim 1: To evaluate the maturation of cognitive functions in adolescents with TS compared to
      typically developing adolescents.

      To achieve this aim, three distinct cognitive dimensions will be assessed in all subjects
      (patients and controls): (i) reward sensitivity and habit formation; (ii) cognitive
      impulsivity and action control and (iii) self-agency.

      Aim 2: To identify neuronal correlates of cognitive function and brain development in health
      and disease. To achieve this aim, we will use a combined behavioural (as described in Aim 1),
      (i) neuroimaging and (ii) TMS approaches.

      Aim 3: To predict clinical outcome . In this part of the project we aim to identify
      behavioural, imaging or neurophysiological markers of clinical outcome in patients with TS.
