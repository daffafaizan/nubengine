      colic, the condition that affects around 1 of 4-5 infants. The interest for dietary
      supplementation has been evoked by a line of earlier studies, indicating that infants with
      colic had an increased number of gas-forming E.coli in the intestines and potential
      interference between lactobacilli and E.coli. Systematic review of evidence, based on the 6
      randomized controlled dietary studies, conducted in Italy, Poland, Australia, Canada, and
      Finland, has concluded of the decrease of the mean time cry of infant by -55 minutes a day
      after the 3 weeks dietary course with lactobacilli . In the mentioned studies most commonly
      used lactobacilli were L. reuteri, however, the effect of combination of L. reuteri with
      other lactobacilli remains unknown.
