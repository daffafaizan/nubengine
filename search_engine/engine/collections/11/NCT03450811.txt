      rate of 28 per 100,000 of the population in the USA. The incidence of post operative
      inability voiding in males following open or laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair varies from
      3 to 25%. Evaluating risk factors to reduce the occurence of this complications after one of
      the most commonly performed surgery by general surgeons could help reduce that high rate of
      that complication. Although some authors recommend prophylactic alpha blockers, there is no
      consensus on whether these can decrease rate of urinary retention or voiding dysfunction in
      male patients.

      In current study, investigators aimed to determinate the uroflowmetric parametric changes of
      patients after elective inguinal hernia repair.
