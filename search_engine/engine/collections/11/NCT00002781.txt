      in combination with borophenylalanine-fructose complex (BPA-F) in patients with stage III
      melanoma. II. Evaluate the safety of this regimen. III. Evaluate tumor response to this
      regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-finding study. Patients receive a test dose of
      borophenylalanine-fructose complex (BPA-F) for biodistribution studies and undergo punch
      biopses of tumor and normal tissue to measure B-10 concentration. Later, a treatment dose of
      BPA-F over 1 hour is followed by neutron irradiation. Groups of 3 patients receive escalated
      doses of neutron irradiation until the maximum tolerated dose is determined. Patients who
      complete protocol treatment and continue to meet the eligibility criteria may re-enter the
      study, provided at least 6 months has elapsed since the completion of prior therapy and the
      field boundary for the new irradiation site is seperated from the boundary of the previously
      irradiated site. Patients are followed monthly for 12 months, then every 3-6 months as
      needed.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 15 patients will be entered.
