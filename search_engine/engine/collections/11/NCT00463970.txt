      have changed dramatically over the last 10 to 15 years; from traditional treatment like bed
      rest and inactivity to more active treatment strategies ("the back pain revolution"; Waddell
      et al 1997). Norwegian research has been in the forefront, particularly in demonstrating the
      clinical and cost effective brief interventions (BI) (Indahl et al., 1995, 1998; Hagen et al
      2000, 2004, Brox et al 2003, Storheim et al 2003). However, about 30% of the patients do not
      recover or return to normal social and working life. The aim of this study is therefore to
      see if a longer cognitive behavioural intervention (CBT) has an additional benefit to BI, and
      to compare this with a potentially beneficial dietary supplement.
