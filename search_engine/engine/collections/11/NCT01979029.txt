      receive the radical resection of rectal carcinoma. We preserve the left colic artery and
      resect the No. 253 lymph node specifically in Group A and divide at the root of the inferior
      mesenteric artery in Group B, We insert a trocar into the arterial arcade at the proximal
      site of the anastomosis and measure the blood pressure of the arterial arcade in the
      operation, which can reflect the blood supply of the anastomosis. Besides, We will measure
      the length of the colon from the anastomosis to the level of the root of the IMA. Expecting
      Resultsï¼šThe blood pressure of the arterial arcade in Group A will be higher than that in
      Group B. And the patients in Group A will have less chance to get anastomotic fistula.
      Expecting Conclusions: Preserving the LCA and resecting the No. 253 lymph node specifically
      in the radical resection of rectal carcinoma can improve the blood supply of the anastomosis
      and decrease the incidence of anastomotic fistula, and won't affect the harvest of the No.
      253 lymph node.
