      Primary:

      â€¢ To assess the effect of Interferon Gamma-1b (IFN-g) on increasing frataxin expression and
      protein in children with FRDA.

      Secondary:

        -  To assess the effect of IFN-g on neurological outcomes (FARS, performance measures, and
           hearing) in subjects with FRDA.

        -  To assess the effectiveness of IFN-g on quality of life in subjects with FRDA.

        -  To assess the safety and tolerability of IFN-g at the currently approved dose in the
           FRDA population.

      Study Phases:

      Screening - During screening, subjects will be assessed for inclusion and exclusion criteria.

      Intervention - Subjects will begin treatment at baseline visit and the dose of study
      medication will be increased to the maximum dose over four weeks. The subjects will be
      maintained at the maximum dose for 8 weeks. After 12 weeks, treatment will stop. Study
      medication will be administered via subcutaneous injections three times per week for 12
      weeks.

      Follow-up - Follow-up visits will occur at 7 and 28 days after the subject has completed the
      12 weeks of active treatment.
