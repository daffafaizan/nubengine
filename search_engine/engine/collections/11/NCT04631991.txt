    
      Non-pathological high myopia patients and controls undergoing a comprehensive ophthalmologic
      examination, including measurements of best-corrected visual acuity, refractive error;
      intraocular pressure, axial length, slit lamp examination of the anterior segment, dilated
      fundus examination and OCTA imaging are included. The best-corrected visual acuity is convert
      into the logarithm of minimal angle resolution. The OCTA images are independently graded and
      assessed by two retinal specialists. The software automatically segmented these
      full-thickness retinal scans into the superficial and deep inner retinal vascular plexuses,
      outer retina, and choriocapillaris (CC). The vascular density in the superficial and deep
      retinal vascular zones is calculated automatically by the software, and the foveal avascular
      zone (FAZ) and foveal density (FD) are also automatically determined. Choroidal thickness is
      calculated manually by two retinal specialists, and the average value was used.

      Right eye of each participant is included in the study. If the right eye shows any exclusion
      criteria, then the left eye is selected for enrollment. Eyes with an AL longer than 26 mm are
      included in the HM group. The classification of myopic maculopathy is applied in
      identification of fundus alterations. Patients with category 0 (no myopic retinopathy
      lesions) and category 1 (tessellated fundus) are included in the study.
