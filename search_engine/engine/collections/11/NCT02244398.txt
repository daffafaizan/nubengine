      volunteers, called VHTs, provide a government-endorsed platform for all community-based
      health programming. Where trained, VHTs already offered family planning services, including
      injectable contraceptives. In this project, VHTs already providing family planning services
      are trained to offer HIV testing and counseling services (HTC). The goal is to reach
      individuals whose sexual and reproductive health needs may be underserved by clinic-based
      services, while also attempting to mitigate some of the barriers to HTC like access and
      stigma.

      The study uses a two-arm post-test only randomized cluster design, with eight pair-matched
      health centers in two districts randomly assigned to intervention or control arm. VHTs
      supported by health centers in the intervention arm receive classroom training and supervised
      practical experience in HTC. Supervision and commodity supply occur through health centers,
      building on support mechanisms for family planning. External quality assurance is conducted
      quarterly through health centers as part of program implementation. VHTs receive refresher
      training after 8 months. VHTs in the intervention arm provide both family planning and HTC
      services during the study period, and then return to providing family planning only at the
      end of the project. VHTs in the control arm only provide family planning. HTC and/or family
      planning services, as applicable, are available to all adults in the communities served by
      the VHTs.
