pleuropneumonia-like organismsdespite their small size, the pplo carrythe full complement of the chemical com-pounds and enzymes contained in largerbacteria and in cells.  they contain bothdna and rna, and in their independentmetabolism they are essentially like other freeliving cells in contrast to the viruses whichhave no independent metabolism outside theliving host cell.  several strains of pplo havebeen cultivated from the mucous membranesof apparently normal human subjects, espe-cially from the respiratory and urinary tracts.until recently, however, definite evidence ofthe association between the pplo and clear-ly defined clinical disease in the human sub-ject was lacking.  in 1962 it became evidentthat the so-called eaton "virus," originallyisolated by eaton and his associates in 1944from patients with primary atypical pneu-monia, was in reality a pleuropneumonia-likeorganism.  typical pplo colonies are pro-duced on a cell-free agar medium which isenriched by the addition of blood serum oryeast.  a number of strains of pplo has nowbeen identified, and in recognition of theirunique characteristics, they have been classi-fied in a separate order, the mycoplasmatales,genus mycoplasma.
