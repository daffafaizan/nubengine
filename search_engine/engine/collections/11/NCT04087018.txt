      as described by the StrataNGS test (to be performed outside of this study protocol).
      Participants with any advanced tumor type will be stratified evenly by tumor biomarker status
      as follows: TMB-H or Strata Immune Signature positive. Each cohort may enroll approximately
      40 participants. Following completion of and/or discontinuation from investigational product
      and follow-up, all participants will be followed for survival.
