    
      The TactiCath Quartz PAS is a prospective, non-randomized, multicenter, interventional study
      to evaluate the continued safety and effectiveness of the TactiCath Quartz Set for the
      treatment of symptomatic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) using contact force assisted
      irrigated RF ablation.

      Patients undergoing elective catheter ablation for symptomatic PAF who are refractory or
      intolerant to at least one antiarrhythmic drug (Class I-IV) will be screened for enrollment.
      Patients who meet the study entry criteria and sign the patient informed consent form will be
      enrolled and treated following the standard of care at each study site.

      After the index procedure, subjects will be followed for a total of 60 months. During the
      3-month blanking period following ablation, subjects may undergo up to 2 repeat ablation
      procedures (up to 10 days prior to end of the blanking period) using the same device used
      during ablation. Subjects will be evaluated at pre-discharge, at 7 days, at 3, 6 and 12
      months post-index procedure and then yearly thereafter. Subjects will complete Holter
      monitoring at 3- and 6- months post index ablation procedure and at yearly intervals
      beginning at 12 months post-index ablation procedure.
