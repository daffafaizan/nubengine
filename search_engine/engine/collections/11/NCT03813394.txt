      intravenous pembrolizumab alone, 21-day cycle. For Treatment Arm B, patients will receive
      intravenous pembrolizumab preceded by an infusion of bevacizumab (Day 1 of 21-day cycle).
      Each treatment cycle is 3 weeks. Up to 48 patients will be enrolled in this study in 2
      stages. The first stage will consist of 30 patients and the remaining 18 patients will be
      added if interim data looks promising.

      Eligible patients will be randomized 1:1 into either Treatment Arm A or Arm B. Treatment will
      continue until tumor progression, intolerance to treatment, or up to 2 years (32 doses of
      pembrolizumab/bevacizumab). For patients who have progressed on pembrolizumab alone, cross
      over to Arm B is allowed, with repeat biopsy of the lesions before and 1 week after starting
      bevacizumab. Patients who discontinue from the trial will not be replaced.

      The study will collect serial samples of tumor tissue and blood to determine the PD
      biomarkers of immune activation, in the tumor and systemically, following treatment. This is
      expected to provide preliminary evidence for immune stimulation using both pembrolizumab and
      bevacizumab in NPC. The tumor biopsies will also present an opportunity to determine the
      molecular details of tissue and tumor response to anti-angiogenic therapy.
