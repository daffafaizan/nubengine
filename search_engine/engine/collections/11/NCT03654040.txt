      receive a single dose of Treg product (arTreg). The target dose is 90 to 500 x 10^6 total
      cells. However, if a minimum arTreg dose of 30 to < 90 x 10^6 cells is manufactured, the
      product will be infused in a maximum of 4 participants. Participants who receive at least the
      minimum arTreg dose referenced, as a result of low cell yield, will be included in
      intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis.

      Participants who successfully withdraw from all immunosuppression will undergo a research
      biopsy at 52 weeks following drug discontinuation to determine whether they meet the primary
      efficacy outcome of operational tolerance. Participants determined to be operationally
      tolerant will be followed until 104 weeks following drug discontinuation and have a research
      biopsy at that time to confirm that they remain operationally tolerant. Participants who fail
      drug withdrawal after 52 weeks but before 104 weeks will be followed until week 104 or 12
      weeks after resuming immunosuppression, whichever is longer.

      Participants who do not successfully withdraw from all immunosuppression will complete 104
      weeks of High Intensity Safety Follow-up after failing immunosuppression withdrawal.

      *** IMPORTANT NOTICE: *** The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the
      Immune Tolerance Network do not recommend the discontinuation of immunosuppressive therapy
      for recipients of cell, organ, or tissue transplants outside of physician-directed,
      controlled clinical studies. Discontinuation of prescribed immunosuppressive therapy can
      result in serious health consequences and should only be performed in certain rare
      circumstances, upon the recommendation and with the guidance of your health care provider.
