      HD through some sort of arterio-venous fistula (AVF). An AVF is a subcutaneous, permanent
      vascular access created surgically by connecting a vein with an artery and is the preferred
      mode of access due to lower rates of infection or thrombosis compared to prosthetic grafts or
      tunneled lines. An AVF is mature if it can sustain high quality HD. However, rates of primary
      failure (the inability of an AVF to sustain HD) are high, ranging from 40-70%. Traditional
      coronary risk factors such as hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and diabetes mellitus, have
      limited ability to allow surgeons to predict which AVFs will mature.

      One possible explanation involves vascular remodeling, the structural changes which occur in
      a blood vessel in response to hemodynamic stimuli. The endothelial, lying at the interface of
      the vessel wall and flowing blood, is a "biosensor", responding to changes in blood flow and
      pressure. It initiates a complex biological response including cellular proliferation and
      migration, matrix degradation, and cellular apoptosis. This longitudinal, observational study
      hypothesizes that endothelial function is a critical modulator of AVF maturation.
      Specifically, that patients with inflammation will have impaired endothelial function and
      demonstrate less significant remodeling than others.
