      selected are 30 in no and are selected based on having gingival inflammation due to plaque
      accumulation. All other cases related to gingival inflammation along with patients with
      underlying systemic disease are excluded from the study.

      At baseline, plaque and gingival scores are recorded, followed by giving one of the
      dentifrice to the patient for brushing. The patients are asked to brush twice a day and asked
      to report after 72 hrs, following which another recording of plaque and gingival scores are
      recorded.

      The patients are then asked to use their own tooth paste for a period of 2 weeks as a wash
      out period and recalled after this 2 week interval.

      The patients are then given the second dentifrice and asked to brush for 72 hrs and then
      asked to report again for a plaque and gingival score evaluation.
