      using a Smart Catheter biosensor can provide rapid diagnosis of impending catheter associated
      urinary tract infection (CAUTI). The primary research question will then be: "Does the Smart
      Catheter device reduce the time to diagnosis of CAUTI?"

      This will be accomplished through four studies: The aim of the first study will be to show
      the reliability and robustness of the Smart Catheter device through the question: "Is there
      any difference between the biochemical measurements from the Smart catheter device and a
      gold-standard laboratory measurement?"

      The aim of the second and third studies aim to demonstrate the different biochemical profiles
      of infected and healthy urine by addressing the research question: "What is the difference in
      biochemical concentrations in healthy urine as compared to infected urine?" Study 3 will
      accomplish this by comparing infected human catheter-acquired urine as compared to uninfected
      human catheter-urine. Study 3 will monitor the changes in biochemical changes in an artifical
      bladder with artificial urine over time while an infection is induced.

      The final study will demonstrate the reduced time to diagnosis in a clinical setting by
      addressing the research question: " What is the time difference in diagnosis of CAUTI from
      the CAUTI as compared to the current standard of clinical monitoring?"
