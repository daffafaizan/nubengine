      prevalence of 1.63% in China. OCD usually begins in adolescence or young adulthood , it will
      become a chronic disabling disease, if it is not treated in timeand.OCD can be so severe that
      it can seriously impact on some or all areas of a person's life, bring huge economic burden.
      At present, there is only one article on the cost of OCD in the United States in the 1990s,
      and this part of the data in China is blank.A cross-sectional study recruited 600 patients
      with OCD from 13 hospitals in eastern, western, southern, and northern China. A structured
      questionnaire was used for face-to-face interviewing to collect costs related to OCD. The
      direct costs for each patient and indirect costs ffor each patient and their caregivers were
      calculated . The human capital method is used to calculate indirect costs. Through weighting,
      the cost of OCD in China is estimated from a social perspective using a bottom-up
      methodology.
