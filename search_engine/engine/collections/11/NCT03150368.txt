    
      This is an open label extended use programme, designed to make extended use treatment with
      weekly ModraDoc006/r available for patients who completed treatment in one of the phase I
      trials with ModraDoc006/r, who might have clinical benefit of continued treatment with the
      oral docetaxel formulation.

      Patients will receive oral docetaxel (as ModraDoc006 10 mg tablets) and ritonavir (100 mg
      tablet) once- or bi-daily, once a week in a fasted condition. Treatment can be continued
      weekly as long as the patient experiences clinical benefit from the treatment as judged by
      the treating oncologist, unless unacceptable toxicity despite dose modifications and
      supportive measures occurs.
