      erythrocytes.Transfusion of allogeneic erythrocytes is not free of adverse events and has
      been associated with transmission of infectious diseases, increased postoperative bacterial
      infection, immune sensitization, and transfusion related acute lung injury. Measures taken to
      allay concerns about the safety of blood transfusions have translated into the increasing
      cost of allogeneic blood units. Blood banks regularly undergo blood shortages. For these
      reasons, there is a need to reduce allogeneic blood transfusions. A number of effective
      interventions have been developed, such as preoperative autologous donation, cell salvage, or
      the use of erythropoietin. Pharmacologic agents such as aprotinin, tranexamic acid, or
      epsilon-aminocaproic acid (EACA) could reduce perioperative blood loss by interfering with
      fibrinolysis.
