      a sample of adult cancer survivors. Currently, there is a lack of comprehensive information
      about pain in the cancer survivor population. Although prior studies have assessed pain
      syndromes in breast and lung cancer survivors (e.g., post-mastectomy and post-thoracotomy
      pain), there is a lack of information about the prevalence and characteristics of
      post-treatment pain in other subpopulations of survivors. To address this knowledge gap, a
      random sample of cancer survivors who are from 1 to 10 years post-treatment completion and
      who were treated at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center will complete a
      telephone-administered pain interview and assessment battery focusing on pain, quality of
      life, and psychological distress. Our initial recruitment and evaluation will begin in 50
      breast cancer survivors and then will expand 50 survivors in each of the other services
      Colorectal, Genitourinary, Head and Neck, and Thoracic in allotments of 50 participants each.
      We estimate that the completion time for the interview and assessment battery will range from
      45 to 60 minutes. This telephone-based survey will identify vulnerable subgroups of patients
      with persistent pain and provide a knowledge base for future research on the prevalence and
      risk factors for post-treatment pain in the cancer survivor population.
