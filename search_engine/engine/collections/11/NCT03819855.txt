    
      Septic arthritis is a diagnostic emergency for acute arthritis because it is accompanied by
      an excess of mortality of 11% and frequent functional sequelae in about 50% of cases in the
      year. However, it remains rare with an estimated annual incidence of 1 to 5/100000, and a
      prevalence of about 10% in front of an acute arthritis table sent to an emergency department.

      The diagnosis is based on the bacteriological culture which finds the presence of a
      microorganism within the joint. However, only 80% of septic arthritis is bacteriologically
      documented due to low inoculum, the presence of fragile bacteria (Neisseria sp) or especially
      untimely antibiotherapy prior to joint puncture.

      In addition, the bacteriological culture takes an average of 3 days to become positive, which
      may delay the implementation of appropriate antibiotic therapy.

      It is therefore essential that the clinician can rely on other clinical or biological
      parameters, reliable and fast for better diagnostic orientation.

      A first study: SYNOLACTATES showed the interest of the measurement of glucose and synovial
      lactate for the diagnosis of septic arthritis with very good performances. A RESAS score
      (REnnes Septic Arthritis Score) was constructed from these results to assess the likelihood
      of septic arthritis.
