      have increased over the past several years.

      Children and infants represent one-third of patients with scabies. Diagnostic features
      comprise pruritus, skin burrows and the delta jet wing dermoscopic sign.

      In many countries, topical permethrin is the first line therapy. Moreover, oral treatment
      with ivermectin represents an interesting alternative therapy, usually used as one dose of
      200Î¼g/kg, and more and more frequently recommended as two doses (one on day 1 and one between
      day 8 and day 15) without strong evidence. Management of scabies requires giving a treatment
      not only to the patient but also to the patient's close contacts.

      The objective of our study is to compare efficacy and safety of topical permethrin applied
      twice at day 1 and day 10 versus oral ivermectin given twice at day 1 and day 10 to treat
      scabies in children and their close contacts. Children (2 to15 years) with scabies and their
      close contacts - or first circle- will be randomized 1:1 to receive permethrin or ivermectin.

      A clinical follow-up will be performed 28 days (V2) and 56 days (V3) after the inclusion,
      including a dermatological examination and to collect safety data.
