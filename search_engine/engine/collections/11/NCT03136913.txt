      study, to compare the bone dimensional changes following extraction and ridge preservation in
      surgical techniques that leave the flap open and closed.

      The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the bone dimensional changes following
      extraction and ridge preservation with primary coverage (closed flap technique) in comparison
      to secondary intention (open flap technique).

      The investigators hypothesize that the closed flap technique will have more potential to
      maintain vertical bone height when compared with the open flap technique, due to less
      susceptibility from infection and inflammation.

      Secondary aim is to evaluate patients' self-report of postoperative discomfort. The
      investigators hypothesize that open flap technique will have less post-operative
      pain/discomfort due to less flap dissection and elevation when compared to closed flaps.

      Tertiary aim is to have a histomorphometric examination and to assess the formation of new
      bone.

      The investigators hypothesize that better bone volume percentage will be observed in closed
      flap technique when compared to open flap technique.

      The primary outcome is the mean difference in alveolar bone height change between groups.
