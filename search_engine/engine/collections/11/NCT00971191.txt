      termination was triggered by feasibility of further conduct of this trial as only 22 of the
      protocol-specified 75 patients were enrolled since the study initiated in February 2010.
      Based on this low accrual rate it was determined that the study was highly unlikely to
      complete accrual and provide meaningful data. The discontinuation of the study is not due to
      any safety issue.
