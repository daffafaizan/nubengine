      randomized controlled clinical trial. Each subject contributed matched pairs of two- or
      three-walled intrabony defects. Each pair of periodontal defects were randomly assigned into
      the experimental group; periosteal pedicle graft guided tissue membrane or the positive
      control group; bioresorbable collagen guided tissue regeneration membrane. Clinical and
      radiographic parameters were recorded at baseline and at 6 months postoperatively.
