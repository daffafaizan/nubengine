      (40 Gy) and volume (involved echelons + 1) for oropharynx and larynx cancer. In INRT-AIR
      (Involved Nodal Radiotherapy using AI-based Radiomics), we are eliminating the elective neck
      treatment altogether, using radiologic and radiomic-based criteria to focus treatment on the
      nodes themselves. Eligible patients include previously untreated patients with stage I-IVB
      oropharynx, larynx and hypopharynx cancer, excluding T1-2 glottic carcinoma. Patients
      requiring chemotherapy may receive cisplatin, cetuximab, or carboplatin-paclitexel.
