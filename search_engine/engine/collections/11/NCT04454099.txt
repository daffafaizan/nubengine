      of cancer-associated mortality. CRC screening has been shown to be effective in reducing the
      incidence of, and mortality from, CRC. There are several recommended screening options for
      screening population of CRC, including colonoscopy and fecal occult blood testing (FOBT)
      .Colonoscopy has higher sensitivity and specificity than FOBT for detecting advanced
      colorectal neoplasia but also has several disadvantages, including higher cost and poorer
      compliance. Therefore, many patients prefer FOBT to colonoscopy. FOBT includes guaiac-based
      fecal occult blood test (gFOBT) and fecal immunochemical test (FIT). FIT includes
      quantitative FIT (qFIT) and qualitative FIT. qFIT can provide a value of concentration of
      hemoglobin in stool and are increasingly recommended for CRC. In China, the most common use
      FOBT is qualitative FIT and the comparison of quantitative and qualitative FIT is lack in
      screening population of CRC in Chinese. To add to the evidence on FIT performance
      characteristics for detection of CRC, the investigators design this research to compare qFIT
      with other 3 qualitative FOBT（two of them are colloidal gold qualitative FITs and one of them
      is chemical and immunologic combined detection）in medium and high risk screening population.
