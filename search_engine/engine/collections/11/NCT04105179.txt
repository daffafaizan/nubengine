      lateral step down, level walking, and single leg balance tasks up to 1 month before surgery,
      and 6 and 12 months after surgery. They will also undergo MRI imaging up to 1 month before
      surgery and 12 months after surgery to assess muscle quality. A secondary outcome will also
      be to analyze the immunological response in the patients who received femoral components made
      of oxidized zirconium versus contemporary components made of cobalt chrome. Fifteen healthy
      controls will also participate in the study and will undergo the biomechanical, MRI and blood
      draws at a single visit.
