    
      This is a multi-center, active-controlled, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group
      comparative study. After a screening period followed by a placebo run-in period under the
      single-blind condition, subjects will be randomized to either the ASP1941 or the acarbose
      group. Subjects will take the study drug under the double-blind condition in the treatment
      period. After completion of the study drug administration, a follow-up period will be
      provided.
