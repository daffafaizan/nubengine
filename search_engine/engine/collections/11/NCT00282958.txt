    
      Subjects diagnosed with subacute (2-6 months post-onset) bilateral cervical/ upper back pain
      will be recruited in this double-blind control study.

      A total of 30 subjects with subacute cervical/upper back pain will be recruited. If patients
      are qualified as participants and agreed to participate in the study by signing the consent
      form, they will be randomized into either (A) control group (injection of normal saline
      injection) or (B) study group (injection of BOTOX). The initial history taking step will
      include medical history including medication and surgery history, duration of pain,
      pre-injection neck disability index (NDI) and visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain. VAS score
      will be collected for 4 weeks before injection to ensure stable VAS, otherwise medical
      records will be reviewed to ensure stable feature of pain. Short Form (SF) -36 Health Survey
      will be used to assess functional status, and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) will be
      applied to assess psychological aspect. Physical examination will be performed to determine
      the most tender cervical/ upper back muscles, and rule out operative condition. A simple
      swallowing test (3-oz water swallowing test) will be applied for dysphagia screening.

      The patients will be maintained with routine, standardized physical therapy, oral medication,
      and stretch exercise after the injection. NDI, VAS, and SF-36 questionnaire will be
      re-collected at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 months after the injection session.
