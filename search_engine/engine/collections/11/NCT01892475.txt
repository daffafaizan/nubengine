      assigned to 1 of 2 groups where they will receive either cash or taxi rental credits for
      meeting specified monthly step goals measured via a step counter. Subsequently, for an
      additional 3 months, drivers will be incentivized to wear step counters to test if effects of
      the rewards are sustained once the reward is no longer in place. Effects will be quantified
      in terms of step activity; and in terms of changes in Body Mass Index (BMI), Resting Heart
      Rate (HR), Blood Pressure (BP), self-reported General Health, Health-Related Quality of Life
      (HR-QOL) and work productivity.
