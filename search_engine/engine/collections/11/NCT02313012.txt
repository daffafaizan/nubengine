    
      CC-90003-ST -001 is an open-label, multicenter, Phase 1a study in subjects with
      locally-advanced or metastatic, solid tumors who are intolerant of, resistant to, or have
      relapsed after at least one line of therapy and for whom no standard therapy exists. The
      study will be conducted in two parts: Dose Escalation (Part 1) and Cohort Expansion (Part 2).
      Subjects may continue CC-90003 until progression of their underlying malignancy, the
      occurrence of intolerable toxicity, or physician/subject decision to discontinue CC-90003. In
      Part 1, cohorts of subjects with relapsed or refractory solid tumors will receive increasing
      doses of CC-90003 in order to assess its safety and tolerability, the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD), and PK profile. In Part 2, cohorts of subjects with specific tumors that harbor
      mutations involving the Mitogen -Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) pathway will receive
      CC-90003 at or below the MTD until progression of disease, intolerable toxicity, or
      physician/subject decision to discontinue CC-90003.
