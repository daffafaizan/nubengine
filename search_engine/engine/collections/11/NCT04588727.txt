      and female subjects.

      Up to 72 healthy volunteers (48 in Part A and 24 in Part B) and 10 Japanese subjects will be
      randomized into the study.

      This study will be conducted at a single study center in United States of America (USA).

      Part A of the study will investigate the safety, tolerability, PK, and PD (inhibition of
      platelet aggregation and capillary bleeding time [CBT]) of an IV administration of single
      ascending doses (SAD) of AZD3366 in male and female non-Asian healthy volunteers and Japanese
      subjects.

      Part B of the study will investigate the safety, tolerability, and PD (inhibition of platelet
      aggregation and CBT) of a single IV dose of AZD3366 or placebo with concomitant
      administration of ticagrelor and ASA by a parallel group cohort consisting of male and female
      healthy volunteers. Furthermore, the potential effect of AZD3366 on the PK of ticagrelor will
      be investigated. Co-medication with ASA and ticagrelor is chosen based on the Standard of
      Care anti-platelet treatment regimen in patients with myocardial infarction.
