    
      There are multiple secondary objectives in this trial:

        -  To estimate the overall event-free survival of patients treated with risk-directed
           therapy

        -  To identify the plasma methotrexate (MTX) concentrations that produce maximum
           intracellular accumulation of active metabolites (methotrexate polyglutamates, MTXPG) in
           vivo, in relation to major cell lineage and genotype

        -  To determine the relation between MTXPG accumulation in leukemic lymphoblasts and
           antileukemic effects, as measured by the inhibition of de novo purine synthesis, and by
           the decrease in circulating blasts during the 4 days after initiation of single-agent
           high-dose methotrexate treatment

        -  To determine if plasma MTX concentrations exceeding those required for maximum MTXPG
           accumulation cause a paradoxical decrease in the accumulation of long-chain MTXPG in
           lymphoblasts, (e.g., due to "feedback inhibition" of folypolyglutamate synthetase)

        -  To determine if there are significant differences in lymphoblast uptake of MTX and
           expression of the reduced folate carrier in T-lineage vs B-lineage lymphoblasts, and in
           hyperdiploid vs non-hyperdiploid B-lineage lymphoblasts

        -  To investigate whether atovaquone (ATQ) is as effective as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole
           (TMP-SMZ) in preventing Pneumocystis carinii pneumonitis (PCP)

        -  To investigate whether or not the administration of G-CSF at the onset of febrile
           episodes in neutropenia patients after induction or any of the two reinductions will
           affect the extent and duration of fever.

        -  To determine whether levels of minimal residual disease in peripheral blood (PB) reflect
           those measured in the bone marrow (BM) by immunologic or molecular techniques

        -  To assess the degree of DNA damage in somatic cells (leukocytes) during treatment

        -  To explore whether genetic polymorphisms of enzymes important in metabolism of
           antileukemic agents (e.g. methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase, thiopurine
           methyltransferase, glutathione transferases) are correlated with MTX pharmacology in
           lymphoblasts, acute toxicities and long-term outcome

        -  To explore whether the development of anti-asparaginase antibodies or CSF depletion of
           asparaginase is correlated with acute toxicities and long-term outcome

        -  To assess the relation between MRI changes of brain (especially white matter
           abnormalities) from HDMTX and intrathecal treatment, neurologic and cognitive deficits,
           CSF levels of homocysteines and diminished quality of life

        -  To investigate whether early MRI changes are related to late MRI abnormalities,
           neurologic and cognitive deficits, and diminished quality of life

        -  To correlate changes in MRI, neurologic or cognitive deficits and diminished quality of
           life with selected pharmacokinetic variables

        -  To determine the prevalence of low bone density and to correlate this complication with
           potential risk factors

      Details of Treatment Interventions:

      Treatment will consist of three main phases, Remission Induction (including an Upfront HDMTX
      Window), Consolidation, and Continuation.

      Window Therapy Upfront HDMTX is considered the first part of remission induction treatment.
      HDMTX will be given by vein over 24 hours (one day). MTX 500 mg/m2 for standard risk and 250
      mg/m2 for low-risk cases will be given over 1 hour, followed immediately by maintenance
      infusion (4500 mg/m2 for standard/high-risk or 2250 mg/m2 for low-risk cases) over 23 hours.

      Remission Induction Therapy (6-7 weeks) The remaining induction treatment will begin with
      Prednisone 40 mg/m2/day PO (tid) Days 5-32, Vincristine 1.5 mg/m2/week IV days 5, 12, 19, 26,
      Daunorubicin 25 mg/m2/week IV days 5, 12, L-asparaginase 10,000 U/m2/dose IM (thrice weekly)
      days 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16 (19, 21, 23), and triple intrathecal treatment, followed by
      Etoposide 300 mg/m2/dose IV over 2 hr days 26, 29, 33, plus Cytarabine 300 mg/m2/dose IV over
      2 hr Days 26, 29, 33.

      Triple intrathecal chemotherapy (MHA) is used for the remaining treatment with dosages based
      on age Frequency and total number of triple intrathecal treatment for Remission Induction are
      based on the patient's risk of CNS relapse.

      Consolidation (2 weeks) Patients receive High dose Methotrexate (HDMTX) 2.5 gm/m2 (low-risk)
      or 5 gm/m2 (standard-or-high-risk) IV over 24 hr days 1 and 8 and 6-Mercaptopurine 25
      mg/m2/day PO days 1 to 14. All patients will receive triple intrathecal therapy weekly for
      two doses on Days 1 and 8.

      Continuation treatment (120 weeks for girls and 146 weeks for boys) Post-remission
      continuation treatment begins 7 days after the second course of HDMTX of the consolidation
      treatment, provided that the ANC ≥300/mm3 and platelet count ≥ 50 x 109/L. Continuation
      treatment will be 120 weeks for girls and 146 weeks for boys and differs according to the
      risk classification.

      Reinduction Treatment This phase of treatment will be started at weeks 12 and 28 after bone
      marrow examination confirms complete remission.

      Reinduction treatment will be given twice:

      Weeks 12 to 16 and week 28 to 32 for standard/high risk cases; weeks 12 to 15 and weeks 28-31
      for low-risk cases. Leucovorin rescue (5 mg/m2) will be given at 24 and 30 hours after the
      intrathecal treatment during both remission reinduction treatments. No chemotherapy will be
      given weeks 16 and 32 for standard/high risk patients.
