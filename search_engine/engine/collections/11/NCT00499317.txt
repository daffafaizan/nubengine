      a genetic cause. We will be attempting to further describe the symptoms of CP/CPPS and to
      correlate them with changes in your genes. We will use several types of genetic testing;
      linkage analysis, whole exome sequencing and candidate gene studies. Each individual
      participant will be required to give a DNA sample (via Blood/Saliva), a urine sample and
      answer questionnaires. Affected participants will also be asked to provide a bladder sample
      from a clinical biopsy. All samples will be stored. Travel to Boston NOT required.
