      symptoms, and the nasal examination and olfactory evaluation were done at the Department of
      Otorhinolaryngology. OB volume was evaluated by a single blinded radiologist. Control group
      patients that had similar demographical characteristics with the Acromegaly Group were
      recruited in the study.

      The CCCRC test is composed of n-butanol odor threshold test and odor identification test.
      Olfactory tests were scored out of 7 (0: worst, 7: best olfaction) and mean score was
      calculated as the total CCCRC test score. OB measurements were done individually on the right
      and left olfactory bulbs and the mean OB volume was calculated in cubic millimeters.
