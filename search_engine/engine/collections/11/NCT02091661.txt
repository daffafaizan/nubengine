      biopsy-proven adenocarcinoma of the prostate and were randomly treated with RRP or EBRT.
      Exclusion criteria included prior treatment for prostate cancer, the presence of metastatic
      disease on imaging studies, the receipt of neoadjuvant androgen ablation before registration,
      and an inability to read or understand Italian language. The institutional review boards of
      every participating centre approved the study design. Every patient enrolled signed an
      informed-consent form approved by the institutional review boards. Clinical information
      collected from the medical record included pre-treatment serum prostate-specific antigen
      (PSA) level, clinical T classification, and biopsy Gleason score. Follow-up assessments were
      completed before treatment and every 3 months after treatment. Subjects who sought primary
      treatment elsewhere or did not return follow-up questionnaires beyond the initial assessment
      were excluded from this analysis.
