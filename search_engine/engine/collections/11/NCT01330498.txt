      Tysabri as a therapeutic agent in the treatment of multiple sclerosis. The etiologic agent is
      the human polyomavirus JC. PML can result from lytic infection of glial cells via a mutant JC
      virus in multiple sclerosis patients being actively treated with Tysabri. The mutated JC
      virus is a neurotrophic virus that infects only humans. "The regulatory region sequence of
      the JC virus is hypervariable and contains determinants for neurotropism and neurovirulence."
      (Jensen and Major, 2001). In patients initially infected for the most part in childhood the
      virus tends to remain quiescent in kidneys, bone marrow and lymphoid tissue. The true
      incidence of JC virus seroprevalance is currently being assessed via two Biogen Idec clinical
      trials (STRATIFY 1 101JC401 and STRATIFY 2 101JC402). Application has been made to the FDA
      regarding a label change for Tysabri which will incorporate the use of the JC antibody assay.
      Upon FDA approval of the label change, the JC assay will serve as a primary risk
      stratification tool in the clinical use of Tysabri. Secondary and tertiary risk
      stratification markers would greatly aid in the clinical management of patients who are JC
      antibody positive.
