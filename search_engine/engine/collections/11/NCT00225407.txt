      (becoming "high" or "stoned"). The active compound in cannabis is THC (tetrahydrocannabinol).
      In recent years the strength of cannabis (marihuana) available on the market in the
      Netherland has increased (especially "netherweed"). The THC-content has increased from on
      average 8.6% in 2000 to on average 20.3% in 2004. Experienced users adapt their habit of
      smoking to the strength of the cannabis sigaret (joint). However, there is also a group of
      people, mainly young ones, who intent to smoke the joint entirely, and can therefore be
      exposed to higher levels of THC. Information is lacking about the effects of cannabis at
      higher levels of exposure. Because of this, the Ministry of Health, Welfare, and Sports of
      the Netherlands ordered the investigators to perform a study to gain more insight in this
      issue.
