      However, some RCTs indicate that enlarging the FE causes postoperative pain, flare-up, and
      destroy the apical constriction, whilst some RCTs pointed out there is no difference in terms
      of pain when a FE has been performed in maxillary anterior teeth with apical periodontitis.
      We will assess the risk of postoperative pain as risk ratio (RR). The binary (dichotomous)
      data: 0-44 mm: Mild or no pain; 45-100 mm: Moderate to severe pain.
