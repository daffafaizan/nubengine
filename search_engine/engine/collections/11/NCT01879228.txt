      insufficient incretin action and impaired insulin secretion in CFRD as in T2D, the present
      study will determine whether early intervention with incretin-based therapy using the DPP-4
      inhibitor sitagliptin (JanuviaÂ®) to raise endogenous levels of the incretin
      hormones--i.e.--glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotrophic
      polypeptide (GIP) for a 6-month period will improve insulin secretion in CF patients with
      indeterminate glucose tolerance, impaired glucose tolerance or early CFRD.
