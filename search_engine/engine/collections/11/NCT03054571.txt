      teeth, rather than delayed or accelerated growth. The more time deviation of teeth eruption
      from normal, the more possible the presence of a problem in development of teeth. For these
      reasons having a non-invasive tool such as body mass index to determine if development will
      be slower than average, could be helpful to the practitioner.
