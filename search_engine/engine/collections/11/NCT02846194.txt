      expenditure on the healthcare system . In addition, it many patients of chronic pain were
      found to also suffer from depression .

      Guided imagery was found to be an effective technique to reduce chronic pain deriving from
      muscle or skeletal pain and from fibromyalgia. Guided imagery treatment carries low
      therapeutic costs and is noninvasive. It also puts the main emphasis of the process on the
      patient's satisfaction .Furthermore, a quantitative study by Kaplan et al. in 2014 found that
      daily exercises of guided imagery improved the sense of wellbeing among university students.

      However, the improvement in the sense of wellbeing due to the practice of daily guided
      imagery was not tested empirically. Therefore, the investigators suggested research will look
      into the empirical effect of Brief Guided Imagery on chronic pain. The investigators will
      study the Colette technique for Brief Guided Imagery using short one to two minutes guided
      imagery exercises to try and determine the empiric effect brief exercises have on pain
      sensation and quality of life when performed by fibromyalgia patients with chronic pain.
