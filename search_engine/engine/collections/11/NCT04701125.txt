      persistent symptoms and, particularly if repeated, to e.g. depression, accelerated dementia
      onset, and development of chronic traumatic encephalopathy. Here, we addressed the hypotheses
      that immediate controlled head- and neck cooling could hasten return-to-play in a Swedish
      cohort of concussed professional ice hockey players. Over three seasons, 15 teams used either
      immediate head- and neck cooling or standard management for SRC. All players followed the
      same return-to-play management protocol. Using a baseline questionnaire, no difference in the
      number of previous SRCs between groups was observed. In total, 92 SRCs were recorded. Eleven
      players did not complete the study protocol, and thus 81 players were included. Of these, 29
      were treated by immediate selective head- and neck cooling for â‰¥ 30 min, and 52 controls
      received standard acute SRC management.
