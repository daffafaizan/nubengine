    
      The specific objective of this study is to recruit a cohort of 240 current exclusive daily
      SMHC (diagnosed using the MINI International Neuropsychiatric Interview) and to measure a
      comprehensive battery of behavioral and health indicators at 4, 8, 12 and 16 weeks after
      being randomized to use either normal nicotine content (NNC) Spectrum cigarettes (11.6 mg
      nicotine/cigarette) or very low nicotine content (VLNC) Spectrum cigarettes (0.2 mg
      nicotine/cigarette) while also having access to an electronic cigarette (containing either 0
      nicotine or high nicotine e-liquid) in a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2 by 2
      design. All participants will be followed up with a study visit 4 weeks after the final
      randomized visit to identify whether they have continued to use e-cigs/cigarettes and to
      assess their motivation in smoking abstinence.

      Our central hypothesis is that key markers of harms to health (e.g. urinary NNAL, exhaled CO,
      measures of addiction, and mental distress) will be significantly improved among SMHC who are
      provided VLNC cigarettes and high nicotine e-cigs.
