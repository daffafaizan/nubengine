      patients already under high flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy because of acute hypoxemic
      respiratory failure. A nasal catheter is positioned to ensure a low oxygen flow during
      laryngoscopy. Whether or not all patients should benefit from high flow nasal cannula oxygen
      therapy for pre-oxygenation remains unknown. In order to improve quality of care delivered to
      our patients and in anticipation of a change in our practice, we decided to record
      prospectively oxygen parameters during and immediately of intubation using a facemask and to
      compare them with parameters obtained in patients intubated after our change in practice. The
      change of practice consists in the systematic use of high flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy
      to ensure pre and during procedure (tracheal intubation)oxygenation.
