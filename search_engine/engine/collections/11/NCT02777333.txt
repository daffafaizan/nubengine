    
      This single blinded randomised controlled study of junior orthopaedic trainees aims to assess
      whether the addition of simulation training improves arthroscopic technical skills
      performance of junior orthopaedic trainees during knee arthroscopy in the operating theatre
      compared to their usual clinical training programme. This will be assessed using objective
      motion analysis parameters recorded from wireless elbow-mounted motion sensors during
      surgery.
