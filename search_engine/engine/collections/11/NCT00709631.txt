      healing (no change or increase of ulcer area) despite 3 months of adequate treatment The
      study population consisted of consecutive patients with one or more leg ulcers, diagnosed as
      related to venous insufficiency, associated or not with concomitant arterial insufficiency.
      All patients undergo a standard treatment including compression therapy adapted to the ankle
      brachial index and a local treatment depending on the wound stage.At inclusion, systematic
      punch biopsies (5-6 mm) are taken as part of routine clinical care under local anaesthetic by
      an experienced clinician: 1 to 2 biopsies in the edges and 1 to 2 biopsies in the wound
      bedSpecimens are transported in formalin solution to the usual pathology laboratory of the
      investigator. At the end of the study, specimens will be sent for immunostainings in a single
      pathology laboratory (Rouen, France)Treatments and/or other investigations are decided by the
      investigatorAt 12 months of usual follow-up, final diagnosis and prognosis are noted in the
      study file by the investigator.
