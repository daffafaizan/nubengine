      with age ranged from ten to twelve, they had spasticity grade 1 and 1+ according to modified
      ashworth scale and they were able to walk with assistance (level II on Gross Motor
      Classification System).Evaluation was held by the Biodex gait trainer for measuring weight
      distribution on both lower limbs and speed during gait to determine if there was a relation
      between weight distribution asymmetry and the speed of gait of those children
