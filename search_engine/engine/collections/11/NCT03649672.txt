      TOF-Watch SX® monitor on both arms. By randomization it will be chosen on which arm the awake
      calibration will be done. 5 minutes before the awake calibration process the patients will
      receive 0.2 µg/kg of sufentanil intravenously. Immediately after the end of the calibration
      process the patients will rate the pain of the calibration process on a visual analog scale
      from 0 to 10. Anesthesia will then be induced and immediately at loss of consciousness
      continuous TOF stimulation will be continued every 12s. Then the calibration process on the
      other arm will be started, followed by continuous TOF stimulation. After having obtained
      stable baseline measurements with the TOF-Watch SX® monitor, a bolus dose of rocuronium 0.6
      mg kg-1 will be administered intravenously. The trachea will be intubated when full
      neuromuscular block is reached. No additional rocuronium will be given. Both neuromuscular
      monitors will be linked via a fiber-optic (TOF-Link®) cable with UBS port to a laptop.
      Specific software will be used to record the measurements (TOF watch SX® monitor, version
      2.2). Neuromuscular monitoring will be continued until a normalized TOF ratio of 0.9 has been
      obtained on both arms. The onset of neuromuscular block and its spontaneous recovery will be
      recorded and the results obtained on each arm will be compared. Every patient is his own
      control.
