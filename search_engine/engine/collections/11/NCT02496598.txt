      known as in vitro activation (IVA) of dormant ovarian follicles, for infertility in women
      diagnosed with primary ovarian insufficiency (POI; also known as premature ovarian failure).
      Patients diagnosed with POI are infertile due to a lack of follicle growth and ovulation;
      oocyte donation is the only treatment option currently available to enable these women to
      have a child. IVA treatment may result in the rescue of the remaining primordial follicles
      within the ovary, thus making oocytes available for IVF, embryo production, transfer and
      pregnancy. In this experimental treatment, ovarian tissue is removed from the patient and
      cultured in vitro for 48 hours with specific compounds to activate dormant primordial
      follicles. Following activation ovarian tissue is auto-grafted to the serosa of the fallopian
      tube, and the patient is monitored for signs of follicle growth. Growing follicles are
      stimulated with exogenous hormones, followed by oocyte retrieval and IVF.
