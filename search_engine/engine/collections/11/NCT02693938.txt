      not well treated. While females and males are equally affected by T1D, diabetes places
      additional burdens of care on females. Characteristically, females with T1D have worse
      glycemic control, a higher incidence of diabetic ketoacidosis, and a greater risk of
      cardiovascular complications as compared to their male peers. It has been hypothesized that
      variations in responsiveness to pre-meal bolus doses of insulin during menstrual cycling is
      an important underlying cause for increased management problems in females with T1D, but the
      hypothesis has not been adequately tested. Consequently, insulin treatment of females during
      the different cycles of menstruation remains a guessing game that often results in major
      swings in blood glucose from high to low levels. The unfavorable impact of this gap in
      knowledge extends to the efficiency and accuracy of artificial pancreas closed-loop (CL)
      system insulin delivery algorithms designed based on insulin action parameters. The proposed
      study addresses this unmet need in diabetes management for females both in open-loop (OL) and
      CL therapies.
