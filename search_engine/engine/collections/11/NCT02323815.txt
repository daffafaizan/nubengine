      to help prevent child undernutrition and enhance the coverage of screening, referral and
      treatment of SAM/MAM, it is necessary to combine two study designs to rigorously evaluate the
      impact of the proposed intervention and to tease out the contribution of prevention and
      enhanced coverage/treatment to the overall impact on child malnutrition.

      The proposed study will therefore use two types of study designs. The first one is a repeated
      cross-sectional design that will compare select study outcomes between intervention and
      control groups at endline, after 24 months of program implementation. These cross-sectional
      surveys among children 6-23 months, at baseline and after 24 months (on different children)
      will be used to assess the impact of the intervention on the prevalence of several outcomes,
      including the prevalence of MAM/SAM and stunting, the coverage of MAM/SAM screening and
      maternal ENA/IYCF/WASH knowledge and practices. The second study design entails a
      longitudinal design whereby individual children will be recruited at 6 months of age and
      followed-up monthly until they reach 24 months of age.This design will allow us to assess the
      intervention's effects on the incidence, recovery and recurrence rates of MAM/SAM.
