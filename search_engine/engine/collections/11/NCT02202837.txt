      dependent variable as the remission at Month 12 and the 5 independent variables as CDAI,
      SDAI, DAS28, DAS28 and Ultrasound, and EULAR Boolean definition for clinical practice and
      clinical studies.

      This analysis will be conducted in each arm of the study as well as after a pooling of both
      patient groups.

      In this context it seems reasonable to ensure the completion of the study by a total
      approximate number of 100 patients (approximately 50 patients per arm). In order to ensure 50
      completers in each arm, 70 patients will be recruited at baseline, taking into account a drop
      out rate of 30% over 1 year period.
