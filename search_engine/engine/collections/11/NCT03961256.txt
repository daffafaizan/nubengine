      recipient's overall health. Currently, patients who are pre-diabetic are encouraged to
      exercise and lose weight. Researchers are planning to test whether an addition of this
      medication will lead to better results and more effectively prevent diabetes in patients who
      already have high blood sugars.

      Exenatide SR is medication given by weekly injection. It increases insulin release in
      response to a meal and slows digestion. This medicine is already in use and approved by the
      US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in patients with diabetes. However, it has not been
      approved for this indication; the FDA has allowed the use of this drug in this research
      study.
