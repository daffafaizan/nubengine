      surgery using VisuMax Femtosecond Laser.The residual myopic refractive power is between
      -0.75D till -5.50D.The optical zone(lenticule diameter) and cap diameter were 6.5 and 7.5 mm
      respectively.After dissection of both anterior and posterior planes, the lenticule was
      extracted through 120 degree superior 3.5mm incision and marked with a sterile
      marker(Viscot-Medster)
