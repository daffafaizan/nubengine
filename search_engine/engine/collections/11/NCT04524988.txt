      were block randomized into two laparoscopic simulation training groups: Essentials in
      Minimally Invasive Gynecology (EMIG) or Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery (FLS).
      Demographic data was collected from all participants. Participants watched instructional
      videos specific to their simulation trainer, as well as a video for the vaginal cuff suturing
      task. Participants then completed a pre-test on a vaginal cuff laparoscopic suturing model.
      They underwent EMIG or FLS training for approximately 2.5 hours. After training, they
      completed a post-test on the same vaginal cuff laparoscopic suturing model. Both pre- and
      post-test tasks were recorded. Video recordings were reviewed and graded by two expert
      high-volume MIGS surgeons who were masked to participant group (EMIG or FLS) and test phase
      (pre- or post-test). A modified version of the previously validated GOALS tool was used for
      grading. Participants also completed a survey rating their confidence level in performing
      laparoscopic tasks using a 5-point Likert scale after completion of their post-test vaginal
      cuff suturing task.
