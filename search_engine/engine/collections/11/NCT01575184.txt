      surgery for fluid management and vasoactive drug therapy. Compared to subclavian vein,
      internal jugular vein (IJV) is generally preferred for catheterization because of the low
      incidence of serious complications, such as pneumothorax and hemothorax. However, especially
      in infants, IJV catheterization is still technically difficult because of the small size of
      the vein and anatomical variation.

      In previous studies, ultrasound guidance and keeping in neutral head position have been
      recommended to increase the success rate and to decrease the overlap between carotid artery
      (CA) and IJV, respectively. However, devices for ultrasonography are not always available.
      Moreover, IJV catheterization without head rotation could be extremely difficult in infants
      because of relative the larger skull and the smaller neck than those of adults. Therefore, a
      simple method to relieve the overlap between CA and IJV would be needed.

      During head rotation to the contralateral side, the cephalic part of IJV is moved to the same
      direction. Accordingly, the investigators thought that the counter traction of the caudal
      part of IJV using the caudo-lateral traction of the ipsilateral arm might relieve the overlap
      caused from head rotation. Therefore, the investigators evaluated the effect of the
      caudo-lateral traction of the ipsilateral arm on the overlap between common CA and IJV in
      infants.
