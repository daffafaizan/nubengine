      with and without multiple-dose administration of 4 g Epanova™ for 13 consecutive days in
      order to detect a possible interaction between rosuvastatin and Epanova™. The PK of total
      EPA, total DHA and total EPA+DHA will also be monitored following multiple-dose
      administration of Epanova™ with and without single-dose administration of 40 mg rosuvastatin.
      A single dose administration for rosuvastatin has been judged sufficient to yield plasma
      concentrations that will be detectable with an adequate validated analytical method and
      characterize adequately the PK of rosuvastatin.
