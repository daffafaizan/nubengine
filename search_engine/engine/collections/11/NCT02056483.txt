      intervention optimizing and integrating rehabilitation for breast cancer on psychological and
      physical symptoms as well as health behavior after breast cancer. In the intervention group,
      we systematically screen for psychological and physical symptoms as well as health behavior
      (smoking alcohol and physical activity) not in line with the recommendations. Patients who
      screen positive are offered a sequence of sessions with a navigator nurse who monitor
      rehabilitation needs, supports the patient, educate in self-management of symptoms and refer
      to existing rehabilitation services as well as to up to 6 free sessions with a psychologist
      specialized in cancer patients. The rehabilitation services that the nurse refers to include
      several hospital departments and municipality services as well as general practice and by
      thorough follow-up on the patients use of these, the intervention aims at developing an
      integrated treatment and rehabilitation trajectory. The control group receives standard care.
