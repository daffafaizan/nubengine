    
      This is an observational, un-blinded, non-significant risk, non-interventional study designed
      to collect ECG data on at least one subject out of a pool of up to three (3) healthy male
      subjects at one clinical site (Clinical Trials of Texas). If acceptable data is acquired from
      one (1) subject the remaining subjects will not be entered into the study. Three (3) to six
      (6) researchers will record data, but all direct contact with the subject will be done by the
      study coordinator or principal investigator (PI).

      The purpose of this study is to validate a Heartbeat Sensitivity calibration process
      utilizing the Cyberonics ECG Accessory. The non-invasive, passive collection of ECG signals
      from a resting healthy subject will be used to validate the use of the ECG Accessory with the
      Model 201 Programming Wand, Model 250 VNS Programming Software Version 9.0, Model 106
      Generator, and ECG monitor (DRE True ECG-12), as well as the associated Instructions for Use.
      The data generated from this exercise will be used in future clinical trials utilizing this
      device.
