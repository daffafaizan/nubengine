      specific immune response against the B cell idiotype of the malignant clone that constitutes
      the tumor in patients with previously untreated aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. II.
      Determine the safety and toxicity of this treatment regimen using Genitope Corporation's
      molecular rescue technology in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive induction chemotherapy consisting of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin,
      vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP) or cyclophosphamide, mitoxantrone, vincristine, and
      prednisone (CNOP). Treatment repeats every 3 weeks until the maximal clinical response is
      achieved followed by 2 additional courses of consolidation therapy for up to a maximum of 6
      courses. At 2-6 months following completion of chemotherapy, patients achieving adequate
      disease response receive vaccination consisting of recombinant tumor derived immunoglobulin
      idiotype with keyhole limpet hemocyanin conjugate subcutaneously (SQ) followed by
      sargramostim (GM-CSF) SQ, each at 2 separate sites on day 1. Patients receive GM-CSF alone on
      days 2-4. Vaccination repeats every 4 weeks for 4 doses, followed 3 months later by the fifth
      and final dose. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 2 years,
      and then annually thereafter until disease progression.
