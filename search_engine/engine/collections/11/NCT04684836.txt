      providing outpatient care in many regions with shelter-in-place and social distancing
      policies. It is critical to understand the impact of this rapid and widespread transition
      from in-person to remote visits on disparities in access to primary care, especially in
      chronic disease where ongoing communication between providers and patients is essential.
      Also, these newly developed or expanded telemedicine programs vary widely, raising important
      questions about the effect of these differences on uptake of telemedicine among different
      patient populations and on patient-centered outcomes. Leveraging a natural experiment
      approach, the investigators will examine rapidly changing telemedicine and in-person models
      of care during and after the COVID-19 crisis to determine whether certain patients could
      safely choose to continue telemedicine or telemedicine-supplemented care, rather than return
      to in-person care. The overarching goals of this study are to describe the features of
      telemedicine programs in primary care during the COVID-19 pandemic and to use natural
      experiment methods to provide rigorous evidence on the effects of these programs.
