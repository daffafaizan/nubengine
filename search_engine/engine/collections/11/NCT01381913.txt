      was approved in Japan in 1999 after a large-scale clinical trial, adjuvant chemotherapy with
      S-1 has been the standard treatment for stage II/III gastric cancer. However, for
      far-advanced gastric cancer, various adjuvant chemotherapies, including S-1, have not
      achieved satisfactory results. Therefore, Japan Clinical Oncology Group (JCOG) is currently
      performing phase 2 and 3 clinical trials of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) for locally
      far-advanced gastric cancer. However, previous studies of NAC have reported a pathological
      response rate of 15-50% for the main lesion, indicating no significant effect on local tumor
      control.

      On the other hand, other studies have reported that anticancer drugs, including S-1, have a
      radiosensitizing effect, and that neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NACRT) achieves superior
      local tumor control compared with NAC. Therefore, we conducted a feasibility trial of NACRT
      with S-1 for locally far-advanced gastric cancer combined with adjacent tissue invasion.
