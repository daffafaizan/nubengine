    
      Tourette Syndrome (TS) is a neuro-developmental disorder characterized by motor and vocal
      tics, frequently associated with behavioral and functional problems, impacting significantly
      on children's quality of life . Current evidence supports the contribution of individual
      behavioral treatment for TS both for reducing tics and improving children's quality of life.
      The most studied and promising intervention is Habit Reversal Training (HRT) and its
      variations: Behavioral Comprehensive Intervention for Tics (CBIT). One of the developments of
      behavioral treatments is group interventions, supported in various types of psychological
      difficulties, adding benefit of providing peer support. However, group intervention for
      children with TS has not been empirically evaluated.

      The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of CBIT group intervention. We hypothesize
      that CBIT group intervention will be more effective than Psycho-Educational-Supportive (PES)
      group in terms of tic severity, and that both groups will be effective in quality of life
      measures.
