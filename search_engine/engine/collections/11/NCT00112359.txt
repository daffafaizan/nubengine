      infections are often caused by a bacteria called Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA). Treatment with
      antibiotics can stop or slow down the growth of the bacteria. The antibiotics may be given by
      mouth, intravenously (IV), or by inhalation as a mist. The purpose of this study was to
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of AZLI, an investigational formulation of the antibiotic
      aztreonam and administered TID using the PARI eFlowÂ® electronic nebulizer, in CF patients
      with PA.

      In this study, participant eligibility was assessed at a screening visit 7 to 14 days prior
      to the baseline visit (Day 0). Those participants who continued to meet eligibility criteria
      at Day 0 were randomized and began a 28-day course of blinded study treatment (AZLI TID or
      placebo TID). Participants returned for clinic visits at Day 14, an end of treatment visit at
      Day 28, and a follow-up visit 14 days after the last dose of study drug (Day 42).
