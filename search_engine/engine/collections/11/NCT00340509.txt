      and risk of coronary artery disease (CAD). We carried out a genome-wide scan for quantitative
      trait loci of serum bilirubin through the 330 extended Framingham families and found
      significant evidence of linkage of serum bilirubin to chromosome 2q telomere where an
      important candidate gene, Uridine diphosphate glycosyltransferase 1 gene (UGT1A1), resides.
      The purposes of this protocol are to confirm linkage between serum bilirubin and UGT1A1,
      mathematical modeling and association studies between the genotypes of UGT1A1 and CAD.
