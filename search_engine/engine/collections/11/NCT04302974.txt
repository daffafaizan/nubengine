    
      A naturalistic cohort study with a maximum follow-up period of 10 years, and retrospective
      extraction of relevant data from the HA clinical management system (CMS) database, designed
      as four sub-studies:-

        1. A trajectory study on all HA primary care patients with HT and/or DM receiving care from
           2006 to 2019, to explore the trajectory patterns for clinical, treatment and
           complication profiles and investigate the impact of multi-morbidity, continuity-of-care,
           different service delivery models and management strategies (including investigation
           frequency and specific drug regimens) on outcomes and health service utilization.

        2. A 10-year effectiveness and cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) of RAMP-DM. A cohort of
           RAMP-DM patients will be compared against a propensity score matched cohort of 'usual
           care' only DM patients to determine the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of RAMP-DM
           on reducing complications and mortality and gain in quality adjusted life years (QALY).
           The optimal criteria and frequency of repeating RAMP-DM will be determined.

        3. A 10-year effectiveness and CEA of RAMP-HT. A cohort of RAMP-HT will be compared against
           a propensity score matched cohort of 'usual care' only HT patients to determine the
           effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of RAMP-HT on reducing complications and mortality
           and gain in QALY. The optimal criteria and frequency of repeating RAMP-HT will be
           determined

        4. An evaluation on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of PSCC. A cohort of RAMP-DM
           plus PSCC (RAMP-DM+PSCC) will be compared against a propensity score matched cohort of
           RAMP-DM only patients to evaluate the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of PSCC on
           the reduction of complications and mortality and gain in QALY.
