      I. To conduct a pilot study of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) (omega-3 fatty acid)
      supplementation in a group of patients with advanced prostate cancer to assess the dose of
      omega-3 PUFA necessary to achieve an omega-6 to -3 ratio of 1:1 on an individual basis and to
      assess the clinical impact of omega-3 supplementation on disease progression

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive long-term omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) supplementation orally
      (PO).
