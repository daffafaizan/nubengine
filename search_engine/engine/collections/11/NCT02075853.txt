    
      Primary Outcome Measures:

        1. Measurement on radiographs of distance between heme clips located in calcaneous bone of
           the foot. Within the patient's own calcaneous bone, a heme clip will be placed on each
           side of the osteotomy. From radiographs, the amount of collapse will be determined by
           measuring the distance from one heme clip to the other. Changes in the distance between
           the clips indicate collapse of the graft.

        2. Radiographic measurements of weight bearing feet of the bovine xenograft group and iliac
           crest allograft group (tricortical and bicortical), pre-operatively and
           post-operatively.

             1. Lateral Radiographs: Talocalcaneal angle, Talo first metatarsal angle, Talo
                horizontal angle, and Calcaneal pitch

             2. Anterior-Posterior Radiographs: Talocalcaneal angle, Talo first metatarsal angle,
                and Talonavicular coverage

        3. Comparison of ligamentous laxity between the two grafting material groups, as measured
           by the Beighton measurements at patient's pre-operative orthopaedic clinical
           appointment.

      Secondary Outcome Measures:

      1. Plantar pressures values of interest are of six segments: medial heel, lateral heel,
      medial midfoot, lateral midfoot, first metatarsal and second metatarsal. The center of
      pressure index, total contact area, mean pressure, peak pressure, and pressure time intervals
      will also be collected and assessed to determine pressure distribution of the foot.

      Tertiary Outcome Measures:

      1. Health related quality of life assessments between the two groups, pre-operative and
      post-operative as measured by the Pediatric Orthopaedic Data Collection Instrument (PODCI)
      questionnaire.
