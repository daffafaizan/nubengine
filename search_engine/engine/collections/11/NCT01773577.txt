      information. Substantial work flow efficiencies and cost reductions may be realized by
      reducing these barriers, and integrating information exchange among different providers and
      healthcare systems. Some of the avenues in which these efficiencies and cost reductions are
      likely to be achieved are through easier access to test results, reduction in medication
      errors, quality monitoring and improvement methodologies, and increased consumer choice. In
      recognition of the potential for these improvements, New York State has provided funding to
      regional entities (Regional Health Information Organizations-RHIO'S) whose role is to assist
      practice providers in the development, implementation, and integration of these interoperable
      IT systems. New York State has also provided funding to evaluate the technology
      implementations facilitated by the RHIOs. The investigators will be working with health care
      providers that have been assisted by the Greater Rochester RHIO.

      Depending on the unique characteristics of the hardware and software that is developed and
      implemented, there may be variations in operational flow that effect efficiency in the
      ambulatory care setting. The goal of our study is to measure and evaluate the effects of
      interoperable IT systems in the work flow practices of providers that have implemented them
      in the ambulatory care setting.
