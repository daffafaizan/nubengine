      Pertuzumab (TCHP) in women with early-stage (local/locally advanced) HER2+ breast cancer with
      a selective escalation of targeted HER2 directed therapy in the high risk group in the
      adjuvant setting. Participants with any residual disease after four cycles of TCHP will
      receive Trastuzumab Emtansine (TDM1) plus Pertuzumab while those with complete pathological
      response will receive Trastuzumab in the adjuvant settings.
