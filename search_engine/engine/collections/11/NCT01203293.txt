      advancement of CBT based treatments for GAD among Spanish-speaking Latinos, particularly
      Puerto Ricans. This area of research is important in light of the limited treatment options
      currently available for Spanish-speakers with GAD and the long-term negative consequences of
      this condition. Participants in this study are recruited in general health settings. Patients
      meeting criteria for enrollment will be randomly assigned to receive either cognitive
      behavior based therapy or treatment as usual. Assessments for all participants will be
      collected at baseline, post-treatment, and at two months follow-up visits.
