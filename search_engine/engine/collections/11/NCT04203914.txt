      hospitalizations rates for heart failure according to the Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial
      in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients (EMPA-REG OUTCOME) trial raise some question in the
      mechanism of myocardial action. The investigators conducted this study in a population of
      non-diabetic hypertensive patients in order to look for a short-term effect on left
      ventricular relaxation.

      Methods: The investigators carried out a single arm non- randomized clinical trial and
      assigned patients to receive 25mg of empagliflozin once daily in additional therapy for six
      weeks at the National Center for Obesity and in the cardiology department of Yaounde Central
      Hospital in hypertensive patients with cardiac relaxation disorder. The objectives were to
      evaluate the left ventricular diastolic function and nycthemeral blood pressure profile.
