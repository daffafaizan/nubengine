      sex, and educational level in this research at the University of Texas Southwestern(UTSW)
      Medical Center Dallas and Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas - Institute for Exercise
      an Environmental Medicine (IEEM).

      To help decide if you qualify to be in this study, the researchers may ask you questions
      about your health, including medications you take and any surgical procedures you have had.
      You may also have to fill out certain forms or have the following exams, tests or procedures.
      The screening process usually takes 2-3 hours.

      You will be required to come for 7-9 visits including the initial screening for eligibility
      to participate in this study. The experiments will measure your brain perfusion, vascular
      function and exercise capacity.

      For the healthy controls, the expected length of this study will be about 2-3 months
      including all the test visits. Your participation in this study will end following completion
      of your testing.

      For those with Mild Cognitive Impairment, the expected length of this study will be about 18
      months including all the test visits and exercise training. Your participation in this study
      will end following completion of your repeat testing after one-year exercise training or
      control intervention. On occasion, training may be delayed due to injury, illness or personal
      matters. If this is the case, your enrollment in the study may last longer than one year as
      we attempt to complete the training and testing.
