      AKI who are detected by the use of AKI sniffer. The investigators chose to assess all
      inpatient serum creatinine results using a combination of "KDIGO" criteria.

      The investigators randomly divided the patients into two groups:

        1. Usual care : patients will receive standard clinical care by the primary physicians

        2. AKI alert : an AKI alert will be sent to the the doctor in charge. Our team of kidney
           experts would give a suggestion if the the doctor in charge issue consultation
           applications.
