    
      The enrollment of an initial patient cohort of 3 or 6 patients will follow the traditional "3
      + 3" dose escalation scheme (see table below). The patients will be treated with palbociclib,
      cetuximab, and IMRT at starting at Dose Level (DL) 1. Subsequent patient cohort(s) will be
      enrolled depending on the safety and tolerability of the initial cohort. If <33% patients
      treated at Dose Level 1 experience DLT (see definition below) by the end of treatment (56
      days), then next cohort of 3 patients will be enrolled and treated at Dose Level 2. If 2
      treatment-related DLTs are observed at Dose Level 1, patients will be accrued to Dose Level
      -1. The MTD is defined as the maximum dose level at which â‰¤1/6 patients have DLTs.

      At the MTD or RP2D, we will accrue up to 15 locally advanced unresectable p16-negative SCCHN
      patients to allow for definitive evaluation of tolerability, correlative endpoints and
      preliminary efficacy. CT/PET scan will be performed at 3 months after the last dose of
      radiation to evaluate residual disease. Patients with residual disease will be considered for
      salvage surgery following standard of care.

        -  IMRT will be administered 5 days on/2 days off with a total dose of 70 Gy for 33-35
           fractions.

        -  Cetuximab will be administered 400 mg/m2 IV at 7 days before (day -7) starting radiation
           and then 250 mg/m2 IV weekly for 7 weeks.

        -  Palbociclib will be administered orally daily 3 week-on and 1-week of during IMRT (Day
           1-21 and Day 29-49).
