    
      1. To assess the impact of HSCT on the immune response to HIV by measuring HIV specific
           antigens in peripheral blood (via immune assays such as ELISA and Western blot)
           longitudinally.

        2. To measure the decay of persisting HIV by sequencing and quantitating HIV RNA in plasma,
           and HIV DNA and RNA in peripheral blood cells including CD4+ T cells and CD4+ T cell
           subsets, as well as in tissue cells derived from fine needle lymph node aspirates,
           and/or bone marrow aspirates, and/or rectal tissue.

        3. To determine the presence of the CCR5 delta 32 allele in the patient prior to and
           following HSCT which will provide information regarding the presence of this gene in the
           donor cells.

        4. To correlate these findings to the clinical outcome of the individuals enrolled in this
           study based on their clinical standard of care assessments following HSCT.
