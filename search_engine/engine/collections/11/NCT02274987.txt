      approach by comparing overall survival at 12 months (OS12) to historical controls. Newly
      diagnosed patients will receive an individualized treatment recommendation including up to
      four FDA approved drugs based on the molecular profile of the patient's tumor as determined
      by gene expression analysis, Whole-exome sequencing (WES) and predictive modeling, age of the
      patient and other existing medical conditions. Initial therapy will consist of standard
      radiation therapy per institutional guidelines followed by molecular based therapy with FDA
      approved drugs.
