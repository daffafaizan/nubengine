      I. Determine the objective response rate of irinotecan and trastuzumab in patients with stage
      IV colorectal cancer and p185 HER2 overexpression.

      II. Evaluate the safety and toxic effects of this treatment regimen in these patients.

      III. Determine the overall survival and time to progression in these patients in response to
      this treatment regimen.

      IV. Determine the pharmacokinetics of trastuzumab in combination with irinotecan and
      antibodies to trastuzumab in these patients.

      V. Determine the expression of HER2/neu in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive a loading dose of trastuzumab IV over 90 minutes on week 1, and over 30-90
      minutes weekly thereafter. Patients receive irinotecan IV over 90 minutes following
      trastuzumab weekly for 4 weeks. Courses are repeated every 6 weeks in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months.
