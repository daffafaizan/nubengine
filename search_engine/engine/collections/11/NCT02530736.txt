      using the 4 metre gait speed (4MGS) test in patients with a lung disease called Idiopathic
      Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF). Drug development for this disease is slow in part because there is
      a lack of reliable measurements that can assess effectiveness of treatment. Slow walking
      speed has been shown to relate to poor outcomes in older adults and people with another lung
      disease called Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). The investigators are interested
      to see whether usual walking speed in IPF patients changes following a treatment called
      pulmonary rehabilitation (an exercise and education programme for patients with lung disease)
      and if it changes, what is the smallest change that is meaningful to patients (the minimum
      important difference - MID). The investigators are also investigating whether the change in
      walking speed can predict survival, number of hospital admissions and lung disease
      progression. This will help inform us of the potential use of 4MGS as an outcome measure. To
      do this, participants who consent to taking part in the study will be timed walking at their
      usual walking speed over a distance of 4 metres (13.12 feet) before and after a course of
      pulmonary rehabilitation and follow-up 1 year after completing pulmonary rehabilitation.
