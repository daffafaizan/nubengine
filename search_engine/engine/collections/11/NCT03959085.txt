    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine in a randomized manner if the addition of 2 blocks of inotuzumab ozogamicin
      to modified Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster (mBFM) chemotherapy will improve 5-year disease-free
      survival (DFS) in children and young adults with high-risk B-cell acute lymphoblastic
      leukemia (HR B-ALL).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the 5-year DFS for a favorable risk subset of National Cancer Institute (NCI)
      HR B-ALL (HR-Fav) when treated with mBFM chemotherapy with a single high-dose methotrexate
      (HD-MTX) interim maintenance (IM) phase and treatment duration of 2 years from the start of
      IM regardless of sex.

      II. To determine the toxicity and tolerability of inotuzumab ozogamicin integrated into the
      mBFM chemotherapy backbone in HR B-ALL.

      III. To describe the 5-year event-free survival (EFS) for patients with mixed phenotype acute
      leukemia (MPAL) receiving mBFM HR B-ALL therapy that includes a second IM phase with Capizzi
      escalating intravenous (IV) methotrexate (MTX) without leucovorin rescue plus pegaspargase
      (C-MTX).

      IV. To describe the 5-year EFS for patients with disseminated (Murphy stage III-IV) B-cell
      lymphoblastic lymphoma (B-LLy) receiving mBFM HR B-ALL therapy that includes a second IM
      phase with C-MTX.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the therapy administered, disease response, and survival outcomes of patients
      with MPAL who come off protocol therapy due to poor disease response to ALL therapy either
      during Induction, at end of induction (EOI), or at end of consolidation (EOC).

      II. To define the prevalence and significance of minimal marrow disease (MMD) at diagnosis
      and bone marrow minimal residual disease (MRD) at EOI in disseminated B-LLy.

      III. To determine the impact of proposed adherence-enhancing interventions on adherence to
      oral 6-mercaptopurine in patients with ALL.

      OUTLINE: All patients receive the same Induction and Consolidation chemotherapy. Patients
      with HR-Fav B-ALL are assigned to Arm I. Patients with HR B-ALL are randomized to Arm II or
      III. Patients with MPAL are assigned to Arm IV, and patients with B-LLy are assigned to Arm
      V.

      All patients with B-ALL receive Induction and Consolidation therapy:

      INDUCTION: Patients receive cytarabine intrathecally (IT) on day 1 and central nervous system
      (CNS)2 patients also receive cytarabine IT on days 4, 5 or 6 and 11 or 12. Patients also
      receive vincristine intravenously (IV) or IV push over 1 minute on days 1, 8, 15, and 22,
      daunorubicin IV over 1-15 minutes days 1, 8, 15, and 22, pegaspargase intramuscularly (IM) or
      IV over 1-2 hours on day 4, and methotrexate IT on days 8 and 29 (and on days 15 and 22 for
      CNS3 patients). Patients < 10 years old receive dexamethasone orally (PO) twice daily (BID)
      or IV on days 1-14; patients >= 10 years old receive prednis(ol)one PO BID or IV on days
      1-28. Treatment continues for 5 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      CONSOLIDATION: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 30-60 minutes on days 1 and 29,

      mercaptopurine PO once daily (QD) on days 1-14 and 29-42, and methotrexate IT on days 1, 8,
      15, and 22 (CNS3 patients receive methotrexate IT on days 1 and 8). Patients also receive
      vincristine IV or IV push over 1 minute on days 15, 22, 43, and 50, and pegaspargase IV over
      1-2 hours or IM on days 15 and 43. Treatment continues for 8 weeks in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Additionally, patients with testicular disease at
      diagnosis that does not resolve by the end of induction will undergo radiation therapy over
      12 once daily fractions.

      POST-CONSOLIDATION THERAPY: After Consolidation, based on clinical features and response,
      patients with B-ALL are designated as HR-Fav or HR B-ALL. Patients with HR-Fav B-ALL are
      assigned to Arm I. Patients with HR B-ALL are randomized to Arm II or III. Patients with MPAL
      and B-LLy are assigned to therapy arms (Arms IV and V) that are identical to Arm II. Patients
      that are < 10 years, have CNS1, no testicular leukemia, with favorable cytogenetics (ETV6
      RUNX1 fusion or double trisomies [4 and 10]), =< 24 hours of steroids in the two weeks prior
      to diagnosis, and EOI MRD < 0.01% are assigned to Arm I. Patients with HR B-ALL who are
      surface CD22 positive at diagnosis and have MRD < 0.01% by the end of Consolidation, are
      randomized to either Arm II or III.
