      vitality and failure rate of placed restorations. Tooth vitality is an indicator for the
      health status of the dental pulp. A vitality test is performed to acquire information about
      the vitality of teeth. A healthy dental pulp offers a positive response to the vitality test.
      Once the dental pulp is injured an irreversible inflammatory reaction starts with a possible
      necrosis of the dental pulp. Pulpa necrosis is followed by a negative response to the
      vitality test.
