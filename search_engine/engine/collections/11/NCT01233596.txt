      eyes) through the inferior canaliculus or bicanalicular intubations (BCI; n=35 eyes) were
      performed under general anaeshesia in children between 10 and 36 months of age suffering from
      congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction (CNLDO). The tubes were removed 3-4 months after the
      tube placement. Thereafter, the children were followed up for 6 months after the removal of
      tubes. The therapeutic success was defined as the fluorescein dye disappearance test grade
      0-1 corresponding with a complete resolution of previous symptoms. The partial success was
      defined as improvement with some residual symptoms.

      The complete and partial improvement was achieved in 31/35(88.57%) in group I with BCI and in
      34/35 (97.14%) in group II with MCI, respectively, and it was not significantly higher
      (p=0,584).

      Complications occurred in both groups. Dislodgement of the tube and premature removal was
      observed in four cases in group I (BCI), the loss of the tube was observed twice in group II
      with MCI.. Canalicular slitting was observed in 5 eyes in the group with BCI. Granuloma
      pyogenicum observed in 2 cases with MCI revealed in a few weeks after the tube removal.
      Corneal erosion in the inferior medial quadrant was observed in 1 eye with MCI and revealed
      in a few days after the local treatment without tube removal.

      Conclusions: Both MCI and the BCI are effective methods how to treat CNLDO. The advantage of
      the MCI shows the lower incidence of the canalicular slit and easy placement.
