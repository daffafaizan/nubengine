      brexpiprazole or placebo combined with intranasal ketamine added to ongoing, stable, and
      adequate antidepressant therapy (ADT) in the treatment of adults with MDD with TRD. Adequate
      ADT is defined as a therapeutically sufficient dose for a sufficient treatment period, which
      would be expected to be effective as listed in the MGH ATRQ.
