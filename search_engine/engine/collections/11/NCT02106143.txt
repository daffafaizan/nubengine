      undergo lobectomy/pneomonectomy for peripheral lung lesions suspicious for or known to be
      cancer. The intention is that the spray cryotherapy dosing will be performed at the same
      surgical session as the intended surgery. Bronchoscopy is routinely performed just prior to
      the start of the lung resection and it is anticipated that the spray cryotherapy dose will be
      delivered at that time. Care will be taken to avoid administration of the spray cryotherapy
      dose at or near the surgical resection margin or near the lung lesion itself.

      A secondary endpoint beyond the safety and ease of delivery of the spray cryotherapy dose
      will be an analysis of the local tissue effect of the spray cryotherapy dose. Given that this
      area will reside within the anticipated resected surgical specimen, the treatment site will
      be inspected for evidence of depth of tissue effect using routine hematoxylin and eosin
      staining and light microscopy evaluation.
