      affecting approximately 1% of individuals older than 60 years. There are 2 major
      neuropathologic findings: the loss of pigmented dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra
      pars compacta (SNpc) and the presence of Lewy bodies.

      Parkinson's disease affects an estimated 1.5 million persons in the United States, with over
      ten million affected worldwide, and these estimates are expected to increase substantially in
      the next few decades. Despite the increasing prevalence, the approved agents for the early
      management of Parkinson's disease have changed little in the past decade; however, there have
      been advances in drug delivery, dosing, and the use of combination therapy in an attempt to
      reduce adverse events. The most important, unmet medical need in targeting Parkinson's
      disease is developing agents with neuroprotective potential. So far, no drug has been shown
      to reduce or slow down the progression of PD.

      DA-9805 is a botanical drug product composed of three main raw herbal materials. It is
      expected that DA-9805 will help treat PD by prevention of dopaminergic neurodegeneration via
      recovery of mitochondrial dysfunction, anti-inflammatory effect and relief from Endoplasmic
      reticulum (ER) stress and oxidative stress.
