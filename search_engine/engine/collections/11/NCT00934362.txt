    
      This single-center pilot study is designed as a double-blind, randomized, cross-over clinical
      trial to evaluate the effects of inhaled lucinactant, an investigational peptide-containing
      synthetic surfactant (6 ml of 20 mg total phospholipid (TPL)/mL solution x 5 doses) in
      patients with mild to moderate CF lung disease. Lucinactant and vehicle will be delivered via
      a 510k approved vibrating mesh nebulizer, the Pari eFlowTM. The study duration corresponds to
      a 2-10 day screening phase, followed by a 20 day post-randomization phase that consists of
      two treatment periods (3 days each) and a washout period (14 days). A total of 16 patients
      will be enrolled and randomly assigned to one of two treatment sequences (Lucinactant
      followed by vehicle or vehicle followed by lucinactant). The primary outcome will be the rate
      of MC, as assessed via gamma scintigraphy, post-lucinactant and post vehicle. Secondary
      outcomes will include the rate of cough clearance (CC), lung clearance index (LCI), absolute
      change from baseline in FEV1 after 5 doses of study medication, CF-specific quality of life
      score (via CFQ-R instrument), in vitro assessments of sputum rheology, and various safety
      parameters.
