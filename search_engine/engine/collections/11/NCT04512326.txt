    
      Ileorectal (IRA) or ileosigmoid anastomosis (ISA) following Total or Subtotal Colectomy (TSC)
      are frequently performed in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (CrohnÂ´s disease, ulcerative
      colitis and indeterminate colitis), familiar adenomatous polyposis or colonic polyposis
      syndromes and colorectal cancer (CRC). TSC is less frequently performed in refractory
      constipation and ischemic colitis.

      Anastomotic leakage (AL) is a significant complication associate with increased mortality,
      reoperation and derivative morbidity and is also related to poor long term outcomes in
      oncological resections. Although, the formation of IRA or ISA is anatomically easy to
      performed, pelvic dissection is not mandatory, there is no tension at the anastomosis and a
      blood supply is theoretically ensured, higher AL risk is reported after IRA or ISA (6.5-21%)
      compared to colonic or colorectal anastomosis with lower AL rate, mainly under 15%.
      Regardless of the indication, similar AL rates are seen after TSC in IBD (4-12%), polyposis
      (20%) and colon cancer (6-21%). Reducing AL rates might improve short, long term and
      functional outcomes after IRA or ISA There is not a wide evidence about determinants for AL
      following colectomy with IRA or ISA.

      The impact of the anastomosis (ISA or ISA) on AL is controversial with no findings any in the
      most recent studies. Great number of studies have been published about risk factors for AL
      after colectomy, but the majority are focused in colorectal cancer patients. IRA or ISA
      results after TSC are mixed with other anastomosis sites and the reported results are hardly
      clear and conclusive.

      For this reason, The investigators aim to assess potential risk factors to AL in restorative
      TSC, including every surgical main reason.
