      treatment on the acupoint San Yin Jiao (SP6) were performed so that the mechanism led to the
      pain can be understood more clearly and one may have a better idea to treat the disease in
      the future.

      Methods: Fifteen women participated in the study voluntarily. They have first to fill in the
      form of Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for pain. Then the pulse of the subjects were measured by
      ANSWatch before and after acupuncture. All meridians can be assessed by analyzing the pulse
      spectra through Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of the original pulse data. The significant
      change of amplitude in certain harmonics which corresponds to a specific meridian after
      acupuncture treatment can be selected out.
