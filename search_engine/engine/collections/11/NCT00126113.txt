      technology has improved dramatically over the last 10 years or so. Unfortunately, the results
      of most commonly used self-report measures cannot be directly compared with the results from
      performance measures since the modes of testing are very different. Thus, it is hard for
      clinicians to reconcile data from individuals reporting more handicap or less hearing aid
      satisfaction than would be expected from their performance.

      In this study, the investigators use a test known as the Performance-Perceptual Test (PPT) to
      determine whether simple counseling based upon discussion of PPT results can be used to
      better align perceived and measured ability to understand speech-in-noise; and, more
      importantly, whether such counseling can decrease reported handicap and improve hearing aid
      satisfaction.

      Hearing aid users complete the PPT for aided and unaided listening, along with standardized
      questionnaires measuring reported auditory disability, handicap and hearing aid satisfaction.
      Following this, subjects are randomly assigned to one of two groups. Subjects in Group 1
      receive counseling from the experimenter in the form of an explanation and discussion of
      their PPT results. Subjects in Group 2 also participate in a discussion with the
      experimenter, but it does not include an explanation of the PPT. Two weeks after enrollment
      in the study subjects complete a second set of questionnaires. Ten weeks after study
      enrollment subjects return to the laboratory to rerun the test battery. The impact of the
      counseling upon PPT values, reported handicap and hearing aid satisfaction and benefit will
      be compared across the two groups.
