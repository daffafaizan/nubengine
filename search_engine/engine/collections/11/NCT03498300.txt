      toxin antibodies (anti-PT IgG) among pregnant Thai women. The secondary objectives were to
      evaluate antibody response after Tdap vaccination between seronegative and seropositive
      participants and to compare the different antibody titers at delivery among seropositive
      participants who received Tdap to those who received tetanus-diphtheria vaccine (Td). The
      sample size calculation was based on the primary objective. Randomized clinical trial was
      performed for the latter secondary objective.
