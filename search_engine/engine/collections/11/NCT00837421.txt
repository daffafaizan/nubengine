      we hope that, by collecting a cohort of patients with sepsis, we will provide information for
      future studies with data of specific relevance to sepsis (the Clinical Registry). Second, by
      following survivors of sepsis for a more prolonged period than prior studies, we will better
      understand the disease process and the duration of recovery (the Follow-up Registry). We will
      contact hospital survivors every six months to assess their vital status, living situation
      and employment. Furthermore, subjects will have the opportunity to find out about new studies
      as they arise. Finally, we will ask subjects for permission to collect a blood sample (10 cc)
      to use for future studies analyzing genetic and protein data. There will be a step-wise
      consent process that will allow subjects to opt out of any or all parts of the study.
