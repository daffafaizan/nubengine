        -  Completing screening questionnaire

        -  Measuring height, weight, blood pressure, and waist size

        -  Drawing about 30mL blood for blood glucose and lipids and comprehensive metabolic panel
           All subjects will be asked to follow usual diet and lifestyle, and refrain from other
           sources of berries and related products while on the study. Subjects will also maintain
           3-day food records at screen, 4, 9, and 14 weeks of the study. Height, weight, blood
           pressure and waist circumference will be measured by trained personnel at MPE 326 (KNS
           facility for clinical research). Blood draws will be performed by trained phlebotomists
           (to be hired) at MPE 326, and all procedures will be performed by trained research
           personnel [PI &Co-PI: Basu, Izuora and graduate student]. In case of blood pressure, an
           average of at least three readings, 10 min apart, will be measured at each visit for
           each participant. Blood glucose (fasting and postprandial at two hours) will be
           determined at each time point. The oral glucose tolerance tests will be conducted at MPE
           326 and blood samples will be sent to Quest Diagnostics, Las Vegas. Insulin resistance
           will be calculated using the homoeostatic model assessment (HOMA-IR). The HOMA-IR is a
           standard and widely used formula in calculating insulin resistance based on fasting
           glucose values. Screening and follow-up tests will include clinical laboratory tests for
           blood glucose, lipids, NMR profiles, C-reactive protein and metabolic panel to determine
           effects of the intervention.
