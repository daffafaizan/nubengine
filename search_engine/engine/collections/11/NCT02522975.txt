    
      This is a prospective, randomized, double blind, parallel group two arm study to establish
      the therapeutic equivalence, safety and tolerability of EPIAO® as compared to EPREX® in the
      treatment of CKD related anaemia in subjects who are not yet on dialysis (pre-dialysis). A
      total of 96 subjects will be randomized into two groups in a 1:1ratio. Treatment arm A will
      receive EPIAO® once a week, subcutaneously for period of 52 weeks and treatment arm B will
      receive EPREX, weight once a week, subcutaneously for period of 52 weeks.
