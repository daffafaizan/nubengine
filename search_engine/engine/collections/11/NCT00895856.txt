      evaluation of the activities of daily living (ADL) using the Katz Index, with 62
      institutionalized elderly people from Casa do Pobre de Macei√≥, Alagoas, both genders, average
      age of 77.03 years old and different levels of functions. Activities related to the self care
      were emphasized. At first, people were classified as independent, partially dependent and
      totally dependent. According to the Katz Index score, they were classified regarding their
      functional dependency, which varies from level 0 (a totally independent person) to level 6 (a
      totally dependent person in the six evaluated functions).
