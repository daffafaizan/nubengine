      abdominal surgery with diagnosis of gastric and colorectal cancer were assessed for
      eligibility. This research sample consisted of 48 patients who underwent abdominal surgery
      with a midline incision. The patients were randomized into three groups, the first
      intervention group, which used TENS (around the incision), the second intervention group,
      which used TAES (ST25, P6, ST36, LÄ°4 acupuncture points) and the control group, which did
      not. Electric stimulation was performed at the 30th minute, second, 18th, 21st, 40th, and
      45th hours after the operation. Pain scores and analgesic consumption were assessed in the
      first 48 hours after surgical intervention.
