      performed by clinical officers (equivalent to US physician assistants) and nurse midwives,
      using the Mogen clamp.

      This was a randomized, blinded trial of circumcision using the Mogen clamp under topical
      anesthesia in healthy male infants aged 1-28 days, with normal birth weight and gestational
      age, performed by trained clinical officers or nurse midwives, randomized 1:1 in Rakai
      District, Uganda.

      Mothers of male infants born in 4 health centers were invited to participate and signed an
      informed consent for screening and enrollment. Infants were screened on enrollment prior to
      randomization (1;1) to clinical officer and nurse midwife circumcision providers.

      Follow up was via a phone call at 24 hours, 7 days and 4 weeks post-circumcision.
