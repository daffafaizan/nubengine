      hallucinations are frequent. The hallucinations often leads to massive distress and
      impairments in social functioning and sometimes even order patients to commit acts of
      violence against themselves or others. The standard treatment for auditory hallucinations is
      antipsychotic medication. However, side-effects can be severe and about 25-30% of the
      patients do not respond to the medication. Transcranial direct current stimulation is a
      non-invasive brain stimulation technique, which modulates cortical excitability in a
      pain-free free with mild transient adverse effects, if any. Typically, cortical excitability
      underneath the anode is boosted while cathodal stimulation has inhibitory effects. Previous
      studies found that 2 daily sessions of 20 min tDCS for five subsequent days may reduce
      auditory hallucinations. Investigators want to further assess the efficacy of tDCS in sample
      that is large enough to detect medium to large effects. In addition, investigators want to
      investigate the neural mechanisms that underlie the tDCS treatment by examining various
      neuroimaging parameters before, immediately after treatment, and 3 months after treatment.
