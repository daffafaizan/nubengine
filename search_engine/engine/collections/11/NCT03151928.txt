    
      The primary goals of this study are to:

        1. Compare the level of agreement of clinician diagnosed bacterial vaginosis (BV) to
           vaginal swab samples evaluated for BV using Nugent's criteria and the BD MAX Vaginal
           Panel

        2. Compare the level of agreement of clinician diagnosed trichomonas vaginalis (TV) to the
           laboratory diagnosis of TV identified by quantitative PCR using the GeneXpert system by
           Cepheid and the BD MAX Vaginal Panel.

        3. Compare the level of agreement of clinician diagnosed yeast vaginitis to laboratory
           diagnosis of yeast identified with culture and the BD MAX Vaginal Panel.

      The secondary goals of this study include:

        1. Being able to describe the patterns of testing among clinicians in community practices
           providing routine care for women presenting with symptoms of vaginitis.

        2. Describe the treatments prescribed for women presenting with vaginitis and how these
           prescribed treatments are distributed in women with laboratory-confirmed diagnoses.
