      related to facemask positive pressure ventilation with unprotected airway. Even with low peak
      airway pressure (<15 cm H2O) gastric insufflation may occur. Since gastric content and volume
      assessment is a new point-of-care ultrasound recommended application, the cross-sectional
      antra area will be measured using ultrasonography before, continuously during facemask
      ventilation and after intubation.
