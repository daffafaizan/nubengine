      treat and prevent relapse, to prevent infections and to establish full donor chimerism. The
      addition of mature T cells which exhibit a broad repertoire of T cell immunity against viral
      and cancer antigens, might provide a clinical benefit. However, an expected side effect of
      the presence of mature T cells is the potential occurrence of acute graft-versus-host disease
      (aGVHD). BPX-501 contains genetically modified donor T cells that have an inducible safety
      switch iCasp9 suicide gene. Evidence has emerged that escalating DLI has achieved higher
      clinical response rate with lower GVHD occurrence. Optimization of DLI dose and schedule as
      well as strategies of donor T-cell manipulation may lead to the consistent ability to
      separate GVHD from GvL (graft-versus-leukemia) activity and improve the safety of DLI
      treatment.
