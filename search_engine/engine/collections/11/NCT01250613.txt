      plus more than 900,000 CNV probes in a single chip, can provide high density makers
      information for the human genome. The median inter-marker distance is 670 bases and the
      average inter-marker distance is 1.67 kb, and the resolution can be as high as 200 kb. The
      Affymetrix® Cytogenetics Whole-Genome 2.7M Array gives the greatest power to detect known and
      novel chromosome aberrations across the entire genome. In addition, the whole-genome array
      includes 400,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to enable the detection of loss of
      heterozygosity (LOH), uniparental disomy (UPD), and regions identical-by-descent.

      If we are able to identify the candidate genomic regions that are associated with the
      congenital malformation/syndrome, we may have a better chance to understand the pathogenesis
      of congenital malformation/syndrome as well as the mechanisms underlying the abnormal
      chromosome rare diseases. The results from this study can also facilitate the clinical
      diagnosis and provide genetic basis for consultation.
