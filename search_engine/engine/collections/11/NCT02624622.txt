      countries, with little improvement over the past several decades. Neonatal infections and
      sepsis are a leading cause of neonatal deaths. Three fourths of these deaths occur in the
      first week of life. Many deliveries in rural Kenya take place at home in unhygienic
      conditions and the umbilical cord is cut with unsterile instruments, increasing the risk of
      infection. Studies in several countries with a high neonatal mortality rate have found a
      reduction in infection and mortality when chlorhexidine is applied to the umbilical cord
      stump by a health worker within 24 hours of birth. This randomized noninferiority study in
      rural Kenya will compare the effectiveness of a newborn home visitation program that includes
      application of chlorhexidine to the umbilical cord by a visiting community health worker
      (CHW) to the provision of chlorhexidine to the mother during a prenatal care visit for cord
      application on the rate of omphalitis (infection of the umbilical cord stump) during the
      first week of life. Pregnant women will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ration to be given or
      not be given chlorhexidine digluconate 7.1% gel during a prenatal care visit with instruction
      to apply the product as soon as possible after birth. The pregnant women who do not receive
      the chlorhexidine will be assigned a CHW with instruction to apply the product during a home
      visit within 24 hours of birth. The rate of omphalitis will be determined during home visits
      by the CHW on days three and seven after birth, and by a visiting research nurse on the
      seventh day. The time from birth to chlorhexidine application will also be recorded and
      compared in the two groups.
