      I. To determine the safety and efficacy of maintenance lenalidomide post autologous
      peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) for elderly patients with AML (AML).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To define maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and establish therapeutic dose level (TDL) of
      lenalidomide given post autologous transplant for AML.

      II. To determine the progression free survival for patients treated with this approach.

      III. To determine the overall survival for patients treated with this approach. IV. To
      determine the role of residual AML stem cells on efficacy of lenalidomide maintenance after
      autologous PBSCT.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study followed by a phase II study.

      Patients receive lenalidomide orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21. Courses repeat 4
      weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 6
      months thereafter.
