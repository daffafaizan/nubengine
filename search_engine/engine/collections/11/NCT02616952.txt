      Yiqi Suoquan Tang, a Chinese Herbal decoction, in the treatment of female stress urinary
      incontinence (SUI). Eligible participants will be randomly allocated to receiving Yiqi
      Suoquan Tang or pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) using a random number generator in a 1:1
      ratio. To minimize the evaluation bias, the outcome assessors and statisticians will be
      masked to treatment allocation.

      Assuming a two-sided alpha of 0.05, power of 90%, and a 20% drop-out, a sample size of 36
      would be needed for each group. The statistical analysis will be performed based on the
      intention-to-treat principle, which is defined as patients that have received at least one
      treatment. Missing data will be replaced by the last observed value. Continuous variables
      will be compared by Student t test or Mann-Whitney U test; categorical variables will be
      analyzed by chi-square test, Fisher's exact test or Kruskal-Wallis H test as appropriate. For
      comparison between two time points, paired t-test or Wilcoxon signed rank test will be used
      as appropriate. A statistically significant difference was set at P<0.05.
