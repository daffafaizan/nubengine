      above the age of 65 years. The use of percutaneous catheter ablation for symptomatic
      management has increased over the last decade. It is well established that AF ablation is
      superior to anti-arrhythmic drugs for symptomatic recurrence of AF. Despite this, success
      rates with a single procedure for paroxysmal AF is approximately 80% with the majority of
      recurrence due to recovery of lesions or "gaps" found at repeat procedures.

      In this study, patients with symptomatic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) will undergo
      ablation using a newly Health Canada approved catheter with SmartTouch technology that
      enables the measurement of catheter tip contact force and direction inside the heart. The
      purpose of Phase I of the study is to assess the current force being used for ablation of
      symptomatic paroxysmal AF in a wide range of operators in different Canadian centres with the
      operators being blinded to the contact force data.

      The secondary objective will be to assess whether lesion recovery, as assessed in redo
      procedures, corresponds to contact force measurements. It is hypothesized that gaps found on
      repeat procedures will correspond to ablation lesions associated with a lower contact force.

      In Phase II, operators will have open use of the force contact data. Phase I and II data will
      be compared in order to assess the efficiency of using the SmartTouch catheter. It is
      hypothesized that the open use of contact force data will decrease the procedural time and
      number of lesions to achieve bidirectional pulmonary vein isolation.
