      rehabilitation program is superior to usual care in the treatment of patients with HFpEF
      discharged after an acute heart failure event, and will result in a 25% reduction in the
      composite outcome of all cause hospitalizations and all-cause mortality after 1-year of
      follow-up. This objective represents both safety and efficacy end-point in a patient
      population with a high rate of co-morbidities, which may be affected as well. Previous
      observation has shown that these patients have a high rate of non-cardiac death in comparison
      with HFrEF, thus enhancing the importance of all-cause hospitalization and mortality as a
      primary end-point.

      Secondary end-points that will be recorded include separate components of the primary
      end-point, time to first hospitalization, functional capacity measured by NYHA class,
      6-minute walk test (6MWT), blood pressure during rest and exercise, fasting glucose and Hb
      A1C levels, BNP values and quality of life EQ5-D questionnaire.
