      Phase 1b portion is to test the safety and tolerability of retaspimycin HCl (IPI-504) in
      combination with everolimus and determine the highest dose of retaspimycin HCl (IPI-504) and
      everolimus that can safely be given in combination. The Phase 2 portion of this study will
      continue the evaluation of safety of retaspimycin HCl (IPI-504) in combination with
      everolimus and compare the effect of the study drugs on tumor response and life expectancy in
      patients with KRAS mutant NSCLC.
