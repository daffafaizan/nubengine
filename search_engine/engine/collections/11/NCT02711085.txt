    
      Purpose: The purpose of this protocol is to establish a longitudinal database of data
      collected from people having experienced an acute traumatic injury to their musculoskeletal
      system. This includes injuries commonly considered 'non-catastrophic' or 'minor' soft tissue
      injuries such as whiplash, low back injuries, sports or slip and fall-type injuries that
      result in sprain/strain of muscle, tendon, ligament or other such soft tissues. Uncomplicated
      bony fractures (those that are managed through casting only, non-surgical) will also comprise
      this cohort. The data will include biological specimens, psychological and cognitive
      profiles, and social/environmental indicators. This protocol represents the start of the
      SYStematic Merging of Biology, Mental health and Environment (SYMBIOME) project from the
      emerging Solving Traumatic pain and disability through Advanced Research Translation (START)
      research group centred at Western. Over time, this database will allow rich exploration of
      complex interactions between biology, psychology and environment as they relate to the
      resolution of traumatic pain and disability, or similarly the persistence thereof. Additional
      research ethics board (REB) applications will be submitted as those projects are ready to be
      formally conducted.
