      medium-high risk of febrile neutropenia (FN) according to NCCN and ASCO guideline are
      recruited, receiving the first level prophylactic use of PEG-rhG-CSF or the second level
      prophylactic use of PEG-rhG-CSF according to real-world clinical judgement and choice by
      physicians in local cancer center for at least two cycles of chemotherapy. The primary
      outcome is FN rate, the second outcomes are rate of 3-4 grade decrease of ANC, FN-caused
      hospitalization, FN-caused antibiotic use rate, rate of reduction of chemotherapy dose, delay
      of chemotherapy, safety and pharmacoeconomics.
