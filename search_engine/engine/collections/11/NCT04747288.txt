    
      Objective: To explore the association with TCM pattern and TCM tongue diagnosis for
      Autoimmune disease and Dry eye syndrome.

      Method:

      This study wants to include the 1000 Autoimmune disease (AID) subjects as 800 Sjögren's
      syndrome (SJS) and 200 Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) for comparing with the 500 Dry eye
      syndrome (DES) subjects. AID and DES subjects will be enrolled to evaluate at V1 Baseline and
      follow-up for 6 times evaluation with one month interval during one year. And the
      non-AID-non-DES healthy control subjects will be also included in our study for comparison
      with the dry eye syndrome and healthy control. This study want to use objective measurement
      and questionnaires as TCM pattern, OSDI, ESSPRI, SF-36, Schirmer's test, TCM heart rate
      variability, and TCM tongue diagnosis to differentiate AID, DES and healthy control.

      Expected Results:

        1. To evaluate the difference among TCM pattern, OSDI, ESSPRI, SF-36, Schirmer's test, TCM
           heart rate variability, and TCM tongue diagnosis to differentiate between AID and DES.

        2. To evaluate the difference among TCM pattern and TCM tongue diagnosis among the AID
           groups, DES group, and healthy control.
