      lean tissue is at least in part the consequence of inadequate protein intake or ingestion of
      a poor-quality protein rather than total caloric intake. Dietary sources of protein are
      presumably inadequate to meet the high metabolic needs caused by HIV infection. To achieve a
      target protein intake in the range (1.5 to 2.0 g/kg/day) demonstrated in other catabolic
      diseases necessary to achieve positive nitrogen balance and to generate substantial anabolic
      effects, this study will administer a supplement containing high-quality protein.

      Two groups of 28 patients each are randomly chosen to receive either an oral nutritional
      supplement (Optimune) containing increased amounts of high-quality protein (whey), which is
      rich in cysteine and glutamine, or an isocaloric, identical-tasting supplement without added
      whey protein or amino acid supplementation. Weight, body composition, anthropometry, dietary
      intake, and general physical health are assessed at baseline and at Weeks 6 and 12. Plasma
      cysteine, glutathione, C-reactive protein, and prealbumin, along with urine IL-6, sTNFrII,
      and IL-1ra, are assessed at baseline and at Week 12.
