      the markers of the response in the first weeks of chemo-therapy.

      The oxyhemoglobin flare response can predictive of overall pathological response to
      chemotherapy in human subjects. These vascular changes can indicate the rapid transient
      increase and then decrease in oxyhemoglobin concentration in the first hours and days after
      therapeutic administration. The magnitude and time course of the flare response in patients
      receiving cytotoxic therapy will differ between pathological responders and non-responders.
      This oxyhemoglobin "flare response" can be observed In tumors where vascular dynamics are
      intact.
