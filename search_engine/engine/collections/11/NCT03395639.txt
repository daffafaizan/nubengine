      pediatric subjects with cardiac diseases at risk of thromboembolic complications who need
      primary or secondary anticoagulant prophylaxis with regard to the combination of major and
      clinically relevant non-major (CRNM) bleeding per International Society on Thrombosis and
      Haemostasis [ISTH] definition.

      The key secondary objective is to compare the efficacy of edoxaban against SOC with regard to
      the development of symptomatic thromboembolic events (TE) in the systemic arterial or venous
      pathways including deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), stroke, intracardiac
      thrombus and myocardial infarction (MI), and asymptomatic intracardiac thrombus identified by
      cardiac imaging.
