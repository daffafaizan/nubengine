      population. However, more than half of all patients on dialysis suffer from breathing
      problems related to sleep. Sleep apnea is associated with high blood pressure, excessive
      sleepiness, fatigue, poor memory and concentration as well as depression in those with normal
      kidneys.

      Hemodiafiltration is a new kind of dialysis that is more efficient at clearing toxins that
      accumulate in kidney failure. It has been used successfully in Europe for over 15 years.
      However, the effects of hemodiafiltration on sleep apnea in dialysis patients have never been
      assessed.

      We are conducting a clinical trial to examine the effects of hemodiafiltration on sleep apnea
      in dialysis patients. Fifteen patients with sleep apnea, already on dialysis will be treated
      with hemodiafiltration 3 times a week, instead of their regular hemodialysis treatment for a
      period of 3 months. We will repeat sleep studies in these patients before and after the
      hemodiafiltration period and assess their quality of life.

      We hope to decrease the severity of sleep apnea with hemodiafiltration. This could result in
      better sleep, improved energy level, mood, memory, concentration and blood pressure control
      in those afflicted by sleep apnea and on dialysis. Our findings would also give us better
      insight into the cause of sleep apnea in patients with end stage kidney disease.
