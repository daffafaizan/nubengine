      daily, Monday through Friday, except for holidays. 5-FU will be delivered at a dose of 225
      mg/m² daily through a catheter in a large vein continuously until the last day of radiation.
      In addition, sorafenib will be taken by mouth twice daily every day until the last day of
      radiation. The dose of sorafenib participants may receive will be one of the following: 200
      mg every other day, 200 mg daily, 400 mg daily, or 800 mg daily. Following completion of this
      phase of the study, participants will receive no study drug or radiation for one month. At 4
      to 5 weeks after stopping study drug and radiation, participants will have another CT scan or
      MRI to assess their cancer. About 6 to 8 weeks after the end of radiation, participants will
      undergo surgery and every effort will be made to remove the tumor. The surgery will occur
      just as it would if participants were not in the study, except that a portion of their tumor
      obtained during surgery will be used for research biomarker testing (as described in the
      consent form).

      Approximately 6 -10 weeks after participants' surgery, when they have adequately healed, they
      may receive additional chemotherapy at their study doctor's discretion.
