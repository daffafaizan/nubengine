    
      Specific Aims/Objectives

      Aim 1. Develop a free iPhone app ("C TRACKER") designed to anonymously record and report
      Hepatitis C related health data to study investigators via periodic patient-reported surveys.

      Aim 2. Examine the feasibility of enrolling a large cohort of geographically dispersed cohort
      of subjects with hepatitis C who download and install the C TRACKER app, provide informed
      consent using the app, and complete study surveys using the app. The app will be made
      available to the public via the Apple App Store at no cost.

      Aim 3. Pilot usage of the app to track and analyze longitudinal measures of hepatitis C
      related health concerns, physical function, and physical activity via selected
      disease-specific as well as more broadly applicable patient-reported instruments, including
      regarding work productivity (WPAI-Hepatitis C), physical functioning (subsets/subscales of
      the MOS SF-36), physical activity (collected through Apple HealthKit), and prescribed
      medications.
