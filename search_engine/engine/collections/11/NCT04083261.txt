      ultra-rapid, intermediate and poor metabolizers of various formulations of Columbia Care's
      medical cannabis products in order to identify genetic factors that may affect the efficacy
      and safety of medical marijuana, regardless of condition. The goal of the research is to
      establish relationships between cannabis consumers, cannabinoids, and consumer outcomes. The
      study is expected to enroll 150 subjects across three cohorts, high daily dose users (poor
      metabolizers) that take more than 50 mg of cannabinoids daily (n=50), low daily dose users
      (ultra-rapid metabolizers) that take less than 10 mg of cannabinoids daily (n=50), and a
      control group (intermediate metabolizers) that represents the median daily dose user taking
      between 11-21 mg of cannabinoids daily (n=50).

      Columbia Care Inc. has identified trends amongst its medical cannabis users suggesting that
      there are some patients who are "high daily dose users" and others who are "low daily dose
      users", with both groups assumed to have similar satisfaction with the products. The
      complexity of the endocannabinoid system combined with individual genetic predisposition and
      gene-environment interactions likely result in the variation in response seen with
      cannabinoid treatment.
