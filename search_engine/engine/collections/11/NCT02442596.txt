    
      To investigate microbiology and/or drug resistance patterns related to: Geographical region,
      Source of IAI, Upper GI tract perforation (stomach & duodenum), Lower GI tract perforation
      (jejunum, ileum, colon, rectum), Primary peritonitis, Peritoneal dialysis-related
      peritonitis, Intra-abdominal abscess, Pancreatic infection, Biliary tract infection,
      Typhlitis, Toxic megacolon.

      To check the Origin of IAI: community-acquired, early-onset healthcare-associated, late-onset
      healthcare-associated.

      To describe physician's antimicrobial prescription patterns related to a classification grid
      that stratifies IAIs according to disease expression, community or healthcare origin, and
      anatomical disruption.

      To investigate outcomes (clinical response, need for surgical revision, length of
      hospitalization, and mortality) related to: Classification of IAI, Severity of acute illness
      at time of diagnosis (SOFA score) and clinical response after 48-72 hrs. (SOFA score),
      Processes of care (Time to 1st antimicrobial dose, Time to source control, Type of source
      control intervention (laparotomy, percutaneous drainage, high volume peritoneal lavage,
      restoration of anatomy and function), Need for (unplanned) surgical revision (uncontrolled
      infection source), Frequency of microbiological sampling and delay of results)), Pathogens
      involved and empirical antimicrobial coverage; special emphasis will be given, to coverage of
      multidrug resistant Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococci and Candida
      species, Duration of antimicrobial therapy, Underlying conditions
