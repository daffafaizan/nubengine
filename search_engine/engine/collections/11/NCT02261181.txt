    
      The patients will be treated with XONRID + standard of care (SOC) preemptive treatment
      adopted during radiation treatment for head and neck cancer patients in the Institution.

      Patients will be planned to receive Intensity-Modulated Radiotherapy Techniques (IMRT or
      volumetric modulated radiotherapy, VMAT) with conventional fractionation at total dose of
      50-66 GY in postoperative setting and 66-70 Gy in radical setting. Radiotherapy will be
      planned with simultaneous boost (SIB) approaches, using conventional fractionation (1.8-2.12
      Gy/die). According to histology, stage and pathology reports, patients could receive
      concomitant platinum based chemotherapy.

      The patients will be evaluated at baseline, at weekly intervals during RT and six months
      after treatment completion by 2 different treating physicians for each visit. The evaluation
      will consist of a physician-assessed toxicity assessment using the Radiation Therapy Oncology
      Group (RTOG), and patient-reported outcome measured using the Skindex-16 questionnaire.

      In addition objective in vivo measurements of skin erythema and pigmentation based on
      reflectance spectrometry (RS) will be performed.

      Measurements will be performed before RT, every 5 RT fractions (once a week) up to the end of
      RT and 6 months after RT completion (same timing as clinical evaluation). Instrumental RS
      measurement will be performed at five different fixed regions within the area treated with
      RT, in any cases only on flat skin regions of the neck in an area corresponding to the second
      node level and in absence of hair or nevus.
