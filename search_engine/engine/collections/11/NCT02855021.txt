      Parkinson's disease. The prediction of dementia in any given patient may be useful for
      prognosis but also for discussion of setting up heavy therapeutic techniques, especially
      surgical. Currently, known predictors are disease severity, age and existence of
      pre-cognitive disorders; other assumptions are discussed. Among these, morphological imaging
      techniques (MRI) and functional techniques (MRI, PET) are proposed.

      Use increasingly early of heavy, expensive and potentially ineffective surgical treatment in
      dementia makes it necessary to find independent, early and reliable markers of the onset of
      dementia in Parkinson's Disease.
