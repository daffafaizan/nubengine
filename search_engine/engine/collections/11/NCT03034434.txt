      signing an informed consent.

      The goal of the study is to examine cervical length after vaginal delivery at 3 different
      time intervals:

        1. 8 hours post delivery.

        2. 24 hours post delivery.

        3. 48 hours post delivery. At each interval a trans-vaginal ultrasound will be performed,
           evaluating cervical length. At the end of the 3rd and final ultrasound, the patient will
           finish her participation in the study/ Information regarding obstetric conditions such
           as labor induction, gestational age at the time of delivery etc. will be collected from
           patients' electronic files.
