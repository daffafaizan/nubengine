    
      KRAS is one of the most frequently mutated genes in human cancer. KRAS mutations lead to
      activation of cellular signaling that promotes tumor growth, and KRAS may therefore be a
      candidate target for anticancer therapy. This study will evaluate JNJ-74699157, a potent and
      specific, orally bioavailable inhibitor of the glycine-to-cysteine (G12C) mutant KRAS
      protein, which is found in non-small cell lung cancers and other solid tumor types. This
      study will enroll participants with advanced solid tumors harboring the KRAS G12C mutation
      and will be conducted in 2 parts. Part 1 (Dose Escalation) will be carried out in sequential
      cohorts of single or multiple participants at doses assigned by the study evaluation team to
      determine the MTD and RP2D of JNJ-74699157. Participants in Part 2 (Dose Expansion) will
      receive JNJ-74699157 at the RP2D determined in Part 1 to determine the safety and preliminary
      antitumor activity of the RP2D. Key efficacy assessments include radiographic imaging
      evaluations, physical examination, and tumor markers. Safety evaluations will include
      monitoring of adverse events, vital signs, laboratory evaluations, cardiac monitoring and
      physical examination findings. The study consists of a screening phase, treatment phase, and
      a post-treatment follow-up phase. An end-of-treatment visit will occur within 30 days of the
      last dose of study drug or prior to the start of a subsequent anticancer therapy, whichever
      comes first. The study duration will be up to 4 years.
