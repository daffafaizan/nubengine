      lumbar epidural analgesia compared to the combined spinal-epidural analgesia. The primary
      outcome of interest will be duration of the active phase of the first stage of labor.
      Secondary outcomes include the cesarean delivery rate, operative vaginal delivery rate,
      analgesia requirements, maternal and neonatal safety profiles (incidence of maternal
      hypotension, post puncture dural headache, fetal acidemia and NICU admissions, respectively),
      Adequacy of maternal pain relief will also be measured using visual analog scores (VAS). The
      investigators hypothesize that the instantaneous pain relief that is achieved with combined
      spinal-epidural analgesia reduces catecholamines quickly and to a greater degree than the
      conventional epidural, leading to a more effective uterine contraction pattern thus
      decreasing the duration of the active phase of the first stage of labor.
