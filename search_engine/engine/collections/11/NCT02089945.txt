      all deaths over the age of 70. In particular, severe aortic stenosis is the most common
      valvular heart disease in the elderly in the Western world and is associated with reduced
      quality of life and increased mortality. TAVI has been shown to improve survival, with an
      all-cause mortality at 1 year similar to surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) with
      favourable outcomes long-term including improved functional capacity and quality of life.
      Recent evidence from randomized controlled trials suggests an increased risk of neurological
      events (e.g. cognitive decline) up to 1 year after TAVI in comparison to both SAVR and
      medical treatment. Studies have shown no change in short-term memory, working memory, verbal
      learning, delayed recognition and verbal fluency 3 months after TAVI. In addition, patients
      with severe aortic stenosis have an increased risk of mortality and future health
      complications. This study will be an observational, prospective cohort pilot study to examine
      changes in cognitive performance and functional outcomes after TAVI. We propose to recruit 34
      patients for this study. Cognitive performance will be measured using a standardized
      cognitive battery prior to TAVI and 6 months post-TAVI. Functional capacity, changes in
      neuropsychiatric symptoms and quality of life will also be assessed prior to TAVI and 6
      months post-TAVI. We hypothesize there will a change in cognitive performance, functional
      capacity, mood outcomes and quality of life over 6 months after TAVI.
