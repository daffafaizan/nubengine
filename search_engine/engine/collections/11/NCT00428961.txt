      consent, patients underwent coronary angiography and/or percutaneous coronary intervention.
      This project was funded by an institution grant, philanthropy, industry, and a grant from the
      American Diabetes Association. The long-term goal is to better understand the biological
      underpinnings associated with diabetic atherosclerosis and vascular risk attributable to
      diabetes. All patients also provided informed consent for blood banking. Blood samples were
      collected at baseline (fasting) and in patients undergoing PCI (random) at 2,8 and 16 hours
      following arterial injury. These samples were separated in aliquots of 12 x1000µL, 10x500µL
      EDTA plasma, 2x1,000 µL and 20x200 µL of buffy coat (baseline only) and 2x1,000 µL of RBCs
      (baseline only). This protocol was designed to perform multiple biomarker studies as it
      avoids multiple freeze thaw cycles. A plaque imaging sub-study using the IVUS-VH software
      platform to characterize plaque tissue enrolled 209 patients.
