      and renal failure, which etiologies include atherosclerosis, fibromuscular dysplasia and
      takayasu arteritis. Endovascular treatment under digital subtraction angiography (DSA) is an
      option to treat this disease. However, the technical success of this procedure is mainly
      based on morphology of its targeting renal artery without any quantified data towards renal
      blood perfusion. Thus, this study will try to solve how renal blood perfusion changes before
      and after endovascular treatment of renal artery stenosis.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      This prospective cohort study will recruit patients with renal artery stenosis. PBV data will
      be obtained before and after their endovascular treatments. The volume of target kidney and
      its mean density of contrast from PBV data will be calculated as indicators for renal
      perfusion. And the relation between the percentage of stenosis and renal perfusion will be
      analyzed. The follow-up will last for one year. At 6-month and 12-month follow-up, DSA and
      PBV acquisition protocol will be undertaken again to evaluate renal blood perfusion in the
      long term.
