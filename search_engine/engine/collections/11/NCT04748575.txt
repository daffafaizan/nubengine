    
      Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) is a group of chronic metabolic disorders, characterised by
      insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency, that results in hyperglycaemia. In the UK
      an estimated 4.3m people live with T2DM, and it is a major cause of kidney failure, heart
      attacks, stroke, blindness and lower limb amputation. The primary digestive enzymes that
      affect carbohydrate digestion and hence postprandial glycaemic levels have been identified as
      α-amylase and α-glucosidase. Inhibition of these enzymes therefore reduces the rate of
      glucose absorption and is the principle behind T2DM medications such as acarbose, miglitol
      and voglibose. Whilst acai berries have been found to be rich in α-amylase and α-glucosidase,
      no research has been conducted on healthy adults to ascertain whether the consumption of acai
      berries in conjunction with carbohydrate mitigates the rise in postprandial glycaemia.

      10 participants were recruited for a double blind randomised crossover study where
      participants consumed smoothies containing either acai or placebo after 10 hours of fasting.
      Capillary blood samples were taken at baseline then at 30 minutes intervals until 2 hours
      after consumption. The study included data for sex (female/male), age (years), weight (kg),
      height (cm), body mass index (kg/m2) and blood glucose (mmol/l). All data collection,
      smoothies preparation, smoothies consumption and blood sampling procedures were completed at
      St Mary's University during the period November-December 2020. Statistical analysis was
      conducted on the data for postprandial glycaemic response to ascertain whether the
      consumption of acai mitigated the glycaemic response relative to the placebo.
