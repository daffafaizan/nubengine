      HIV infection, although disease progression or drug intolerance is associated with its
      long-term use. In preliminary studies in children, d4T, another HIV inhibitor, has been well
      tolerated, although an optimum dose has not been determined.

      Patients are randomized to receive either oral AZT or oral d4T. Treatment continues until the
      last patient enrolled has received 52 weeks of therapy, or until the study is terminated.
