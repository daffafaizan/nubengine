      acetate) and add-back therapy (hormone and non-hormone) were prescribed in the usual manner
      in accordance with the terms of the local marketing authorization with regards to dose,
      population and indication (for leuprorelin acetate) and with regards to the local guidelines
      or therapeutic recommendation (for add-back therapy).

      The rationale for the study was the necessity to characterize the patient population and
      long-term leuprorelin acetate administration in the Russian Federation. Further, it was
      important to characterize the compliance, tolerability, and safety profile of this therapy in
      the routine clinical care setting in the Russian Federation.
