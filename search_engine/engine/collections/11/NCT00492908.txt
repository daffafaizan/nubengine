    
      Objectives: The purpose of this study is to compare the Titanium-Nitride-Oxide Coated Stent
      (Helistent Titan2, Hexacath) with a Zotarolimus-Eluting Stent (EndeavorTm, Medtronic) in a
      non-inferiority trial.

      Design: Prospective, multi-center, randomized, non-inferiority trial to be conducted at 3
      Swiss interventional cardiology centers. Patients will be randomized in a single-blind
      fashion (1:1 randomization) to either the Titanium-Nitride-Oxide Coated Stent (Helistent
      Titan2, Hexacath) or the Zotarolimus-Eluting Stent (EndeavorTm, Medtronic).

      Study Population: Patients with symptomatic coronary artery disease including patients with
      chronic stable angina, silent ischemia, unstable angina, and non-ST elevation myocardial
      infarction, who qualify for percutaneous coronary interventions

      Antiplatelet Therapy: Aspirin 100 mg qd indefinitely; Clopidogrel 75 mg qd for 3 months

      Enrollment: A total of 300 patients will be enrolled

      All patients will undergo repeat angiography at 6-8 months.

      All patients will be followed for up to 5 years.
