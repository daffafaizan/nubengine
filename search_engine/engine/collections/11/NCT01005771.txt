    
      200 eligible patients will be included in the double-blind phase (50 in each group,
      randomised 1:1:1:1 to GF-001001-00 at a concentration of 0.25%, 1% or 2% or placebo).

      Randomised patients will apply the study medication as follows depending on their assigned
      treatment group.

        -  GF-001001-00 2%, 2 times daily, for 7 days

        -  GF-001001-00 1%, 2 times daily, for 7 days

        -  GF-001001-00 0.25%, 2 times daily, for 7 days

        -  Placebo, 2 times daily, for 7 days

      The first application will be done after randomisation at Visit 1 under the guidance of the
      investigator. Patients will return for control visits: Visit 2 (Day 5) and Visit 3 (Day 7),
      after randomisation. Patients will return for the Final Visit (Visit 4, Day 14 after
      initiation of treatment).

      Primary objective:
