      efficacy and safety of RAL BID in combination with ABC/3TC QD in antiretroviral-na√Øve HIV-1
      infected individuals with a presumptive or confirmed diagnosis of tuberculosis, without
      planned comparative analyses.

      A goal of 40 subjects will be enrolled from 3 sites in the Russian Federation, including in
      our site, and receive RAL BID + 3TC/ABC QD for 48 weeks.

      This study will include screening, treatment and follow-up periods. Screening period up to 28
      days includes initial visits at Day -28 (screening) and Day -14 (switch to rifabutin). The
      second visit will be required if patient is initially on rifampin-based TB regimen that will
      need to be switched to rifabutin-based regimen.

      Patients receiving rifampin-containing TB therapy will be switched to rifabutin (300 mg
      daily) a minimum of 14 days prior to initiation of antiretroviral therapy. Patients must not
      have received more than 45 days of tuberculosis therapy.

      Treatment period from Day 1 to Week 48 includes 7 visits and a follow-up period (2-4 weeks
      after the Week 48 visit or Withdrawal visit) includes one visit for resolution of ongoing AEs
      and new SAEs. Patients will therefore have 10 scheduled assessments: screening (Day -28; Day
      -14), baseline (Day 1), Weeks 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, and 48, and follow-up visit.
