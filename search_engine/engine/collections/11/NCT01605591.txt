      anesthesiologists. Although new upper airway devices, such as GlideScope(R)
      videolaryngoscope, had been developed for facilitating airway management, the larger size and
      the complexity of DLT than single-lumen tube (SLT) makes the difficulties for DLT intubation.
      Therefore, the investigators designed this study to investigate the effects of different
      bending type of DLT in tracheal intubation.
