      Primary

        -  Determine the efficacy, in terms of maintenance of target hemoglobin and hematocrit
           levels, of interval dosing with epoetin alfa in patients with anemia undergoing
           chemotherapy for nonmyeloid cancer.

        -  Determine the safety of this drug in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the quality of life of patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified
      according to participating center. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I (early intervention): Patients receive epoetin alfa subcutaneously on day 1.
           Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 5 courses.

        -  Arm II (standard intervention): Patients receive epoetin alfa as in arm I once their
           hemoglobin level is â‰¤ 10.5 g/dL.

      Quality of life is assessed prior to start of study treatment, at week 7 during study
      treatment, and after completion of study treatment.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 4 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 180 patients will be accrued for this study.
