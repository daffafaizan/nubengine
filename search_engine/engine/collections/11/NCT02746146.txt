      A. To show that the systematic use of the score at the initiation of dialysis can shorten the
      registration delay on a kidney transplant waiting list; to evaluate the time between
      initiation of dialysis and registration on a national waiting list for kidney transplants,
      while assessing the duration of the pre-transplant assessment.

      B. To identify barriers to registration on the kidney transplant waiting list as well as the
      related time delay in this population (medical and non-medical factors), the rates and causes
      of patient refusal for registration and the possible evolution this refusal over time.

      C. To evaluate the economic impact of the introduction of the renal transplant clinical
      prognostic score.
