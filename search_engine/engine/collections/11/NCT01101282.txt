    
      This study aims to identify whether the addition of positive expiratory pressure (PEP) mask
      therapy to standard medical care improves symptoms, quality of life and risk of
      re-exacerbation in individuals with acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary
      disease.

      A PEP mask is a small hand-held device that is self-applied over the nose and mouth. It
      creates a resistance against exhalation (outward) breaths which helps facilitate movement of
      sputum from the lungs towards the mouth.

      Participants will be recruited from two tertiary metropolitan hospitals in Melbourne,
      Australia and randomised to receive either 'usual care' (comprising medical management,
      non-invasive ventilation if required, rehabilitation and allied health interventions) or
      'usual care' plus PEP mask therapy for the duration of their hospital admission. All
      participants will then complete daily diaries for six months after discharge.

      The effect of PEP mask therapy will be evaluated using a range of outcomes important to both
      patients and health care providers.
