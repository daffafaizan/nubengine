      30, and 45-degree head tilt to the left and right side while they are standing. In every
      position, 3 measurements will be done. In the second experiment, 40 health subjects will make
      the same head maneuvers on the 20 cm thick soft surface. We will compare the effects of both
      head tilt and soft surface. All measurements will be done with a virtual SVV
      system(Interacoustics).
