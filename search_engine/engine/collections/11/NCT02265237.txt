    
      This is a Phase 3, randomized, open-label, multicenter study evaluating the safety and
      efficacy of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir coadministered with RBV for 12, 16, or 24 weeks
      in HCV genotype 4 (GT4)-infected participants with compensated cirrhosis who are either
      treatment-na√Øve or who had previously received only IFN/RBV treatment for HCV.

      The study also enrolled HCV GT4-infected participants with compensated cirrhosis who had
      previously experienced virologic failure with either SOF/pegIFN/RBV or sofosbuvir (SOF)/RBV
      treatment. These participants were treated with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir
      coadministered with RBV for 24 weeks in this study.

      This study was divided into 2 parts with approximately 184 total participants. Part I
      included participants who were randomized to receive either 12 or 16 weeks of treatment and
      Part II included participants who received 24 weeks of treatment. Enrollment into Part II
      opened once randomization in Part I was completed.
