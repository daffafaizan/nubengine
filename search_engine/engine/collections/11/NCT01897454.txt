      I. To assess the efficacy, measured as the proportion of R0 resections, of
      fluorouracil-leucovorin calcium-irinotecan hydrochloride-oxaliplatin (FOLFIRINOX)
      chemotherapy regimen followed by gemcitabine based chemoradiotherapy when used as
      preoperative therapy in patients with borderline resectable adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To measure the overall response rate (ORR). II. To evaluate overall survival (OS). III. To
      evaluate progression free survival (PFS). IV. To evaluate safety and toxicity associated with
      chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

      V. To assess adverse events related to surgery. VI. To assess the proportion of patients able
      to undergo resection. VII. To assess proportion of patients requiring vascular
      reconstruction.

      OUTLINE:

      CHEMOTHERAPY REGIMEN: Patients receive oxaliplatin intravenously (IV) over 2 hours,
      leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours, and irinotecan hydrochloride IV over 90 minutes on day 1,
      and fluorouracil IV over 46 hours on days 1-3. Treatment repeats every 14 days for 4 courses
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients not achieving
      disease progression proceed to chemoradiotherapy.

      CHEMORADIOTHERAPY REGIMEN: Beginning 4-6 weeks after completion of chemotherapy, patients
      undergo intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) on 5 consecutive days per week for a
      total of 28 fractions and receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8,
      15, 22, 29, and 36. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 30 months.
