      and efficacy data. Safety analyses include AE's, AE's related to the drug, SAE's, laboratory
      values, vitals/ ECG and dose limiting toxicity (DLT). PK include measurement of peak plasma
      concentration (Cmax), area under the plasma concentration versus the time curve (AUC), time
      of maximum concentration observed (Tmax). Efficacy analyses include overall response rate
      (ORR) and duration of response (DOR).
