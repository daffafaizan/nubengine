    
      This is a 2-arm randomized controlled feasibility trial among 40 overweight or obese men
      newly diagnosed with prostate cancer who are scheduled for prostatectomy. This study will use
      the presurgical period to explore the potential impact of weight loss via a healthy
      energy-restricted diet and increased physical activity on circulating hormones, cytokines,
      and growth factors, as well as effects on tumor biology and other clinical outcomes.
      Consenting patients will be block randomized to 1-of-2 study arms: 1) a healthful diet +
      exercise intervention to promote a weight loss of up to 2 pounds/week; or 2) a wait-list
      control who will receive the intervention once the study period is complete. Both groups will
      receive nutritional counseling during the study period to correct nutritional deficiencies
      with food sources. This study will explore and contrast changes in body mass index (BMI)
      observed over the study period (minimum of 3.5 weeks) in the intervention vs. wait-list
      control arms, and also monitor changes in body composition, energy intake and physical
      activity; these changes will be studied in relation to the following endpoints: a) changes in
      select circulating biomarkers and gene expression related to cancer progression, hormonal
      status, inflammation and other energy-related factors; b) rates of tumor proliferation and
      apoptosis; c) tumor immunohistochemical markers of insulin receptor, vascular endothelial
      growth factor (VEGF), AKT, and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells
      (NFkB); and d) functional and health-related outcomes, i.e., side-effects and medical
      outcomes, quality of life (QoL), and functional status.
