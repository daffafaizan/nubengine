      Canada and in the United States. Hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia are
      significant risk factors for the development of cardiovascular disease.

      The investigational product used in this trial, has been specially formulated to help reduce
      elevated triglycerides and LDL cholesterol levels, and may provide a natural alternative in
      the prevention of CVD.

      the treatment, placebo, or a comparator product for a period of 12 weeks. Blood lipids will
