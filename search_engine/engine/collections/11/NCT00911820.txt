      Primary

      * To evaluate progression-free survival at 7 months in metastatic esophageal and gastric
      patients treated with either PCA or TPCA

      Secondary

        -  To determine overall survival

        -  To determine the response rate (RECIST) in measurable disease patients

        -  To evaluate type and severity of toxicities associated with each regimen

      Exploratory:

        -  To correlate expression of tumoral and serum VEGF with response and survival

        -  To correlate TGF alpha levels and tumor microvessel density with clinical activity of
           the combination of PCA or TPCA

        -  To examine circulating endothelial cells (CECs) as surrogate markers of antitumor
           activity of bevacizumab

        -  To explore if 7/7 and 7/6 UGT1A1 polymorphisms correlate with grade III/IV
           irinotecan-related diarrhea and neutropenia when irinotecan is given at relatively low
           dose to patients with esophageal and gastric cancer

      DESIGN:

      This trial was designed to compare 7-month progression-free survival between arms. The
      hypothesis was that TPCA would have superior outcome over PCA (70% vs 50%). With 40 eligible
      patients per arm followed for 1 year there was 80% power to detect a hazard ratio of 0.48
      using the log-rank test at a one-sided type I error rate of 5%. Stratification factors were
      ECOG performance status 0/1 vs 2 and site of primary tumor (gastric vs GE
      junction/esophageal).
