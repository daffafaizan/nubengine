      methotrexate vs methotrexate plus baseline Depomedrol in patients with SLE and >/= 3 tender
      and 3 swollen joints in the hands and wrists. Patients who are already taking methotrexate
      </= 15 mg/week may qualify and will have a >/= 2.5 mg/week dose increase at baseline,
      receiving subcutaneous dosing whether on oral or sc dosing prior to entry. Those not taking
      methotrexate at baseline will initiate open label treatment in ascending doses beginning at
      15 mg/week. All patients will increase methotrexate weekly up to 25 mg as tolerated or until
      resolution of arthritis. Decreases are allowed as needed.

      After randomization, patients may choose to stop or continue any NSAIDs, hydroxychloroquine,
      or up to 10 mg prednisone if these were being used at screening. All other lupus-specific
      treatments or medications will be withdrawn. Optimization of methotrexate dose must be
      completed by Month 2. If additional immune- suppressive medications or steroids become
      necessary during the trial, patients remain evaluable for the primary endpoint, which is
      defined by clinical response regardless of treatment. In secondary analyses of Depomedrol vs.
      placebo, patients treated with rescue interventions will be censored when comparing changes
      in mean/median synovitis, osteitis RAMRIS or tendinitis scores in the two treatment groups,
      and they will be included as non- responders in dichotomous endpoints (SRI-4, BICLA). These
      analyses will also provide useful data for many of the other endpoints (comparisons of MRI vs
      joint counts and other measures which are valid regardless of treatment). Thus, although off
      protocol medications will not be encouraged, they will not require removal from the study.
