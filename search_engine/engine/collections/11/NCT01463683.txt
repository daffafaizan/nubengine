    
      2XP HEPTAVAX™-II is manufactured using a modified process in which the composition of the
      amorphous aluminum hydroxyphosphate sulfate adjuvant has been modified by increasing the
      phosphate content by approximately 2-fold. Thus the modified process HEPTAVAX™-II is referred
      to as 2XP HEPTAVAX™-II.
