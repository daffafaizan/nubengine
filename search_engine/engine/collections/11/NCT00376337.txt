        -  Intolerant to previous antifungal therapy

        -  Refractory to previous antifungal therapy; progression of infection

        -  Refractory to previous antifungal therapy; failure to improve In case, criteria for both
           intolerant and refractory are fulfilled at the same time the patient will be considered
           as refractory.

        -  Neutropenic (absolute neutrophil count (ANC < 500 cells/mm3)

        -  Non neutropenic (ANC >= 500 cells/mm3)
