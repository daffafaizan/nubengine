      syndrome. Most often, a single extremity is affected. The diagnosis is subdivided in CRPS
      type I where no nerve injury has been identified, and CRPS type II when a major nerve injury
      has been verified. With the exception of spontaneous pain, several of the symptoms related to
      CRPS may be connected to the inactivity and immobilization often seen in the history of CRPS
      patients.

      Exposure in vivo, a form of behaviour therapy where the patient is gradually confronted with
      the avoided movements and activities, has been shown safe and effective for patients with
      CRPS type I. The present study uses a combination of exposure in vivo and interventions
      targeting a supposed cortical reorganisation with the hypothesis that the functional
      impairments would decrease, independent of possible changes in pain levels.

      Consecutive patients with long-standing CRPS-II, diagnosed according to the Budapest
      criteria, in a lower limb are included. Treatment comprises daily graded exposure therapy in
      vivo, in combination with methods targeting cortical reorganisation: mirror therapy,
      desensibilisation training, and sensory re-education. The treatment is implemented at an
      in-patient ward during four plus four weeks, separated by a home training period of 6-8
      weeks.
