        -  Subjects will be implanted with the EndoPass device for up to 36 months.

        -  Body weight, adverse events and device function will be monitored at monthly visits for
           the first year after implant and quarterly visits thereafter.

        -  Additional follow-up data will include vital signs, hip and waist circumference, blood
           lab tests, endoscopic and esophagram assessments of the condition of the implanted
           device, quality of life and eating behavior questionnaires.

        -  All subjects will be followed for 12 months after device removal.

        -  A single device renewal may take place as needed after the initial implant.

        -  Subject study participation may last up to four years, but is expected to vary with
           implant duration, which will be determined on a case-by-case basis.
