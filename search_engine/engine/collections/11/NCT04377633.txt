      handover each year worldwide. Verbal handover from one anesthesiologist to another during
      surgery are being used in many hospitals; and there is no unified patient handover guideline
      at present.

      It is well recognized that the transfer-of-care is a point of vulnerability where valuable
      patient information can be distorted and omitted. A previous study of the investigators
      showed that handover of anesthesia care was associated with a higher risk of delirium in
      elderly patients after major noncardiac surgery. The World Health Organization has included
      communication during patient care handovers among its top 5 patient safety initiatives.

      It is possible that an improved anesthesia-handover protocol may reduce the related adverse
      events. Many efforts have performed to optimize handover processes. However, handover quality
      between anesthesiologists has rarely been investigated. The investigators hypothesize that a
      well-designed, structured handover-checklist will improve handover quality and reduce the
      occurrence of postoperative complications.
