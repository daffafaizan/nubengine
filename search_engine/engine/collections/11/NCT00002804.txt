    
      OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the response to vincristine/ifosfamide/doxorubicin (VID) with
      granulocyte colony-stimulating factor support in children with newly diagnosed, inoperable or
      metastatic non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcomas. II. Estimate the 2-year and event-free
      survival rates in children treated with VID plus radiotherapy and/or surgery. III. Establish
      a bank of frozen tumor and peripheral blood tissue for use in further molecular studies.

      OUTLINE: The following acronyms are used: DOX Doxorubicin, NSC-123127 G-CSF Granulocyte
      Colony-Stimulating Factor (Amgen), NSC-614629 IFF Ifosfamide, NSC-109724 Mesna Mercaptoethane
      sulfonate, NSC-113891 VCR Vincristine, NSC-67574 VID VCR/IFF/DOX Induction: 3-Drug
      Combination Chemotherapy. VID. Local Control: Surgery and/or Radiotherapy plus 3-Drug
      Combination Chemotherapy. Excision of the primary tumor and pulmonary metastases; and/or
      irradiation of the primary tumor and pulmonary metastases using x-rays or Co60 beam energies
      of at least 4 MV (electrons or iridium-192 implant allowed for boost); plus VID.
      Continuation: 3-Drug Combination Chemotherapy. VID.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be entered over 2.7 years if there are at
      least 7 responses in the first 20 patients.
