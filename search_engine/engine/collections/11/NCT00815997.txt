      pulse with a sufficient palmar arch, as evidenced by the absence of digital ischemia
      according to the Allen's test. Exclusion criteria for the current study included planned use
      of a cutting balloon, rotational atherectomy, directional coronary atherectomy, and
      intravascular ultrasound, which were not compatible with 4-Fr catheter.

      Patency of the radial artery after TRI will be evaluated by pulsation of the radial artery,
      and frequencies of which will be compared between those receiving 4Fr vs 6 Fr coronary
      interventions.
