      atraumatic extraction, sockets are filled with a "one-piece" dual tissue graft harvested from
      the tuberosity using an adjusted trephine. CBCTs are performed before the extraction and 4
      months after ridge preservation, to analyze the vertical and horizontal alterations of the
      ridge, using 'ITK-Snap' software.

      Clinical measurements of both soft and hard tissues are also assessed during the extraction
      and implant placement.
