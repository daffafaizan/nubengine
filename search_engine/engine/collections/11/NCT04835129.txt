      Part 1 (Run-in safety phase): In this safety-run in phase a total of six subjects will be
      enrolled at the coordinating site (Medical College of Wisconsin) to assess potential
      dose-limiting toxicities that may be associated with the addition of isatuximab with
      pomalidomide, elotuzumab and dexamethasone.

      Part 2 (Expansion phase): In this part, up to 47 additional subjects will be enrolled.

      The study hypothesis is that the isatuximab in combination with elotuzumab, pomalidomide, and
      dexamethasone (Isa-EPD) will be safe and lead to superior response rates than seen with
      either isatuximab with pomalidomide and dexamethasone or elotuzumab with pomalidomide and
      dexamethasone in subjects with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma.
