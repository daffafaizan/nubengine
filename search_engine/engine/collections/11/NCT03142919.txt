      subtypes of depression, patients with and without inflammation as defined by c-reactive
      protein (CRP). Using a double-blinded, parallel group, placebo-controlled design,
      participants will be phenotyped before and after a low-dose lipopolysaccharide (LPS)
      challenge designed to perturb the immune system and trigger a transient, mild inflammatory
      response. This experimental design will allow for the delineation of the homeostatic
      mechanisms underlying sensitivity to inflammation-related depression. Low-dose LPS has been
      used by multiple groups to safely induce transient inflammatory responses in humans. The
      pilot study is expected to take approximately one year to complete.
