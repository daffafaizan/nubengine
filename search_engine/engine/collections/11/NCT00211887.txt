      single agent therapy with three-year follow-up on the last patient randomized. All patients
      will remain on therapy until the last patient completes the study. All patients will then be
      transitioned, based on the findings, to open label of combination with continued follow-up or
      some recommendation about single agent therapy. While the study design benefits from having
      two arms of single agent therapy to examine the important question of whether there are
      differences between the single agents, the primary interest is in combination therapy.
      Therefore, a two-group combination versus single agent concept was used - splitting the
      population into single agent and combination therapy equally. The single agent arm is divided
      into two groups, IFN and GA providing for 3 treatment arms: IFN intramuscularly (IM) and GA
      subcutaneously (SC) (50% of the patients), IFN IM and placebo SC (25% of the patients) and GA
      SC and placebo IM (25% of the patients).
