      causes of cerebral palsy, whose incidence, despite improvements in perinatal practice and
      neonatal care, has remained essentially unchanged over the recent past decades. It occurs
      approximately in 2-3 newborns every 1000 live births with a mortality rate of 10% for mild
      degrees and 60% for severe degrees. About 30% of survivors with mild hypoxic-ischemic
      encephalopathy and 100% with severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy exhibit variable degrees
      of neurological disability.

      Several studies have demonstrated the therapeutic effects of whole-body or selective head
      cooling to treat neonates with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. Mild hypothermia, (rectal or
      esophageal temperature 33-34Â°C), started within 6 h after birth and protracted for 48-72 h,
      can significantly improve primary outcome measures such as death or disability at 18 months
      or improve the neurological outcome in survivors. Consequently, mild hypothermia is at
      present recommended for the treatment of moderate degrees of encephalopathy.

      Topiramate an anticonvulsant agent widely used in adults and children, has been demonstrated
      to posses neuroprotective properties against hypoxic ischemic brain damage, both in vitro and
      in animal models and has been included in neuroprotective strategies for ischemic stroke and
      neonatal hypoxic-ischemic cerebral injury. Recently, topiramate treatment in asphyxiated
      newborns has been reported safe.

      Aim of the present study is to confirm the safety and to evaluate whether the association of
      topiramate enhances the neuroprotective properties of hypothermia for the treatment of
      neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy.
