      place a dental implant. The primary objective of the study is to determine whether there is
      any difference in the gain of horizontal alveolar ridge width following guided bone
      regeneration surgery using a combined autogenous/allogenic particulate bone graft versus a
      particulate allograft alone. Autogenous bone has historically been considered the gold
      standard for alveolar ridge grafting; however, other materials including allografts and
      xenografts have also been used with excellent results. This study evaluates the potential
      benefits, or lack thereof, for using a combined autogenous/allograft approach versus an
      allograft alone. The investigators will clinically evaluate the efficacy of this technique
      and determine the difference in bone formation between groups following healing at 5 months
      by observing bone growth relative to heads of the tenting screws placed horizontally in the
      locations of greatest defect in the alveolar ridge. A biopsy of the healed site will be taken
      at the time of implant placement. The null hypothesis is that there will be no difference in
      the amount of horizontal ridge width gain at 5 months post-grafting between the two different
      grafting materials (allograft alone versus allograft combined with autogenous bone).
      Furthermore, the null hypothesis is that histologically, the combination graft
      (MinerOss®/particulate autograft) will have a similar percentage of vital bone present at 5
      months compared to the allograft-alone group (MinerOss®).
