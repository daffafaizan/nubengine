      evaluated. We want to perform a monocentric prospective ex-vivo pilot in order to evaluate
      the diagnostic performance of fluorescence in the detection of surgical margins compared to
      pathologic analysis. This study will be conducted in 37 patients operated on for a radical
      prostatectomy after systemic injection of 0, 25 mg/Kg of ICG 24 h before the surgery. The
      fluorescence analysis will be performed in the operation room and then specimen will be sent
      to the laboratory for an analysis as usual. Two pieces of prostate will be prelevated
      according to a protocol. The histopathological procedure will be performed without knowledge
      of fluorescence analysis. Except the ICG injection the medical procedure won't be changed.
