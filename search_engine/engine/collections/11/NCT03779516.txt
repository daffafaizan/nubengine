    
      Adult patients undergoing video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) requiring double lumen tube
      (DLT) endotracheal intubation for one-lung ventilation (OLV) were enrolled in the study.
      Patients were randomized by means of computer-generated order randomization into two groups:
      Group C (those who received a saline solution as placebo delivered by nebulization) and Group
      L (those who received lidocaine delivered by nebulization).

      At 1, 6 and 24 h after tracheal extubation, an observer blinded to treatments evaluated the
      patients in terms of sore throat and hoarseness. In addition, Patients' satisfaction,
      intraoperative and postoperative opioid and analgesics consumption and complaints such as
      dysphagia, nausea and vomiting were recorded. Hemodynamic variables such as blood pressure
      and heart rate were also recorded.
