    
      This single-center, randomized, open label trial will compare (i) 0.9% normal saline infusion
      and boluses of mannitol (control group) with (ii) 3% hypertonic saline, with intermittent
      boluses as needed, to treat elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) following severe traumatic
      brain injury.

      Patients will be randomized to one of the two study arms following placement of an ICP
      monitor. Raised ICP will be defined as an ICP greater than 20 mmHG for 20 minutes or longer.
      In the event of such an event, the appropriate treatment will be administered.

      The primary endpoint will be success in ICP control, operationalized as the proportion of
      time during which ICP is less than or equal to 20 mmHg during the first 120 hours following
      initiation of monitoring. Secondary endpoints include therapy intensity level, incidence of
      pre-determined severe adverse events, and long-term outcomes measured at 3 and 6 months
      post-injury.
