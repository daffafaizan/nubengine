      Centre at Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham (QEHB) and Birmingham Children's Hospital
      (BCH). The cohort will be comprised of patients with moderate and severe burns (injury to
      more than 15% of the body surface area [TBSA] in adults and 20% TBSA in children). The
      investigators currently treat between 30-40 patients in this category each year. In order to
      thoroughly characterise the longitudinal neutrophil response to burn injury and to
      investigate its potential relationship with outcome post-burn, the ivestigators will measure
      the genomic, phenotypic and functional response of peripheral blood neutrophils across time
      in burn-injured patients.
