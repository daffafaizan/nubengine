    
      This is a open label dose selection study to investigate the safety, tolerability, immune
      response and preliminary clinical effect of different doses of the TENDU vaccine. TENDU is a
      synthetic therapeutic peptide conjugate vaccine intended for treatment of prostate cancer.

      The patients enrolled in this study is adults with documented progressive disease after
      radical prostatectomy and who are eligible for salvage radiotherapy and short-term (6 months)
      androgen deprivation therapy.

      All patients taking part at the study must be vaccinated with a Boostrix vaccine (including
      tetanus antigen) one week prior to the first TENDU vaccine treatment.

      Three different doses, 40, 400 and 960 Î¼g of the TENDU vaccine are to be investigated.

      The vaccine is administrated by subcutaneous injections with one injection per drug substance
      (four separate injections) consecutively. The TENDU vaccine will be given four times during a
      treatment period lasting for 6 weeks and followed up for 6 months after the last treatment.

      In total between 12 to 18 patients will be enrolled with a 3+3 design in each dose cohort.
      The first patient will receive the lowest dose of the TENDU vaccine, and after the treatment
      is completed, a safety evaluation will be done to evaluate enrolment of the next patients in
      this cohort. If one patient develops a dose limiting toxicity at a specific dose, an
      additional three patients are to be enrolled into that same dose cohort, and on the
      recommended dose an addition of 3 patients will be enrolled.
