      Community Intervention group. The Early Intervention group receives parent training and
      assessment-based behavioral and academic intervention for 1 year, followed by either a high
      or a low intensity maintenance intervention for an additional 18 months. The Community
      Intervention group members receive psychotropic medication, special education services, and
      monthly sessions to obtain information about child development and medical functioning for 2
      years. Participants are assessed on six occasions over 4 years. Parents and teachers assess
      children's behavior, academic performance, and archival data, including medical and school
      records.
