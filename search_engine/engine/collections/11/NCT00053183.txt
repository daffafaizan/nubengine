        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of brachytherapy administered via GliaSite RTS™
           applicator followed by external beam radiotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed
           glioblastoma multiforme.

        -  Determine the acute and chronic toxicity of brachytherapy administered via GliaSite RTS™
           in these patients.

        -  Determine the survival rate of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of brachytherapy.

      Patients undergo craniotomy for histologic confirmation of glioblastoma multiforme, surgical
      resection, and placement of a GliaSite RTS™ applicator that includes Iotrex™.

      Beginning 3-21 days after surgery, patients undergo brachytherapy via the GliaSite RTS™
      applicator. Within 30 days of brachytherapy (no more than 60 days after resection) patients
      undergo external beam radiotherapy 5 days a week for 6 weeks in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 5-10 patients receive escalating doses of brachytherapy until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at
      least 2 of 5 or 3 of 10 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 21-35 days, every 2 months for 1 year, and then for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-100 patients will be accrued for this study.
