    
      An observational prospective multidirectional study on the safety of antimicrobial
      pharmacotherapy in ICU children aged 0-17. The endpoints of the safety assessment are the
      frequency of adverse events with antimicrobial agents (AMA); electrocardiography (ECG),
      fibrinogen concentration, international normalized ratio (INR) and prothrombin index (IPT) at
      screening and at the end of the treatment course, and pharmacogenetic indicators (a more
      detailed study of the safety profile). A demonstration of the effectiveness of each of these
      comparisons of inequality will be based on the hypothesis testing approach, according to
      which the null hypothesis concludes that there is no difference between groups receiving
      different AMA combinations for the endpoint of interest; and an alternative hypothesis
      supposes a difference between treatment groups receiving different AMA combinations. Changes
      in the sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) scale in dynamics compared to the baseline
      will be analyzed using the Mixed-Effect Model Repeated Measure (MMRM) model which assume the
      baseline, gender, age, AMA combination, and the duration of the AMA course. For a population
      of subjects aged 0-3 months, the analysis will be performed using the analysis of covariance
      (ANCOVA) model with the effects of INR, fibrinogen, and IPT values at the initial level for
      gender, age, and AMA combination in the treatment groups.

      To assess the secondary endpoint for the general population - the frequency and timing of the
      transition to de-escalation at ICU, cluster analysis will be conducted to identify the
      relationship of specific AMA combinations with the possibility of de-escalation in ICU
      children.

      Studies will be conducted to reveal the relationship in gene polymorphism encoding isoenzymes
      of the cytochrome P-450 biotransformation, and the relationship between the activity of
      transport proteins with the indicators of effectiveness and safety of antimicrobial
      pharmacotherapy. The lack of pharmacological safety studies in children administered medicine
      combinations to overcome pan-resistant gram-negative infection provides relevant
      prerequisites for this study.
