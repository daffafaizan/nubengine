      and lipid metabolism disorder it brings is still unclear. Based on the previous studies, the
      investigators found that the CB1 gene has a close connection with the metabolism disorder.The
      investigators suppose that the CB1 also has a significant role in regulation of energy and
      metabolism in hypothalamus. In this study ,the investigators will recruit 300 Patients with
      schizophrenia who defined by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-5 (DSM-5), aged 18 to 60,and
      all the participants will receive a 6-week systematic treatment by one of the SGAs(including
      olanzapine, risperidone oral solution, ziprasidone capsules), and a battery of assessments of
      treatment effect and safety. Plasma concentration will be tested regularly, and these genes
      polymorphisms of CB1 and other associated with energy metabolism will be conducted by the
      second generation of gene detection techniques.This study could provide evidence and data to
      achieve the aim of individualized medication, reduce the drugs' side effect, also throw light
      on the production of medication for correct the metabolism disorder.
