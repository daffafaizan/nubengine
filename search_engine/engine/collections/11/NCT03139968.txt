      randomly assigned to the radiation-attenuating (RADPAD®), a dummy drape or a control group in
      a 1:1:1 ratio. The drapes will be used in addition to conventional shielding material.
      Primary radiation exposure is measured blindly by a dose aware meter (Philips) positioned at
      a set location on the operator. Radiation exposure is measured by the X-ray systems (DAP in
      Gy·cm2). The primary outcome is the effective dose received by the first operator
      (mSv/Gy·cm2).
