      association between strategies of therapy (maximal therapy, withhold, withdraw) and treatment
      success in three endpoint related initial risk groups (high, intermediate, low risk)
      regarding three endpoints (burden, mortality and supply costs).

      The 3 endpoints and 3 respective risk groups (high, intermediate, low) are

        1. Endpoint burden of care due to Clinical Frailty Scale (Frailty) high 7 - 9 intermediate
           5 - 6 low 1 - 4

        2. Endpoint mortality due to severity of disease regarding Simplified Acute Physiology
           Score (SAPS) II score values high SAPS II > 70, suspected mortality > 40% intermediate
           SAPS II > 40 - 70, suspected mortality 10 - 40% low SAPS II ≤ 40, suspected mortality <
           10%

        3. Endpoint supply costs due to number of organ systems to be supported or replaced high ≥
           3 organ systems replaced intermediate 1 - 2 organ systems replaced low 0 - 2 organ
           systems replaced
