    
      This is a multicentre, open-label, single-arm, phase I/II clinical study with a
      dose-escalation stage (part 1) and a dose-expansion stage (part 2). In part 1, patients with
      treatment-naïve, relapsed/refractory extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma (nasal type)
      will be assigned to receive sequentially higher doses of liposomal mitoxantrone hydrochloride
      plus a standard dose of pegaspargase every 21 days (a cycle). The dose escalation initially
      will follow an accelerated titration design for the first two dosing groups, then follow a
      classic 3+3 design. All dose-escalation decisions will be based on the safety data generated
      from the currently highest dose group. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended
      Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of liposomal mitoxantrone hydrochloride will be determined in part 1. In
      part 2, additional patients will be recruited into two groups,the treatment-naïve group and
      the relapsed or refractory group, to receive liposomal mitoxantrone hydrochloride at the RP2D
      combined with a standard dose of pegaspargase. All patients will receive the treatment until
      disease progression, or observation of unacceptable grade 3 drug-related adverse events (a
      maximum of 6 cycles).
