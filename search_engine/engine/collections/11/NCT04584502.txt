    
      In this R33 project, the study team will conduct a randomized controlled trial to evaluate
      the efficacy and implementation of the Mindful Moms intervention (MMORE) with a group of
      pregnant women with identified OUD receiving medication treatment for OUD at partner
      maternity care practices. The study team will evaluate the impact of Mindful Moms as an
      adjunct to treatment as usual on retention in medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD)
      treatment, substance use, and relapse-related risks.

      This study has three Specific Aims:

      Aim 1: Evaluate MMORE in a randomized controlled study with pregnant women as an adjunct to
      MOUD treatment as usual care for impact on treatment retention, opioid abstinence, and
      relapse risks.

      Aim 2: Examine mechanisms of effect of MMORE on outcomes.

      Aim 3: Evaluate barriers and facilitators to sustainable implementation of MMORE as an
      adjunct to MOUD for pregnant and parenting women.
