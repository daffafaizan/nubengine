    
      Objective: The purpose of this protocol is two-fold: 1) to determine how individual
      differences in evoked brain responses relate to generalized trait personality and behavior
      differences (as assessed by psychometric questionnaire instruments and behavioral measures),
      and 2) to determine whether individual differences in evoked brain responses relate
      specifically to genetic polymorphisms in genes governing neurotransmitter activity.

      Study population: Healthy non-alcoholic adult volunteers, healthy adolescents aged 12 to 17
      years (with or without a family history of alcohol use disorder), inpatient or outpatient
      alcoholics, and recovering alcoholics.

      Design: In this event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study we will
      attempt to evoke positive and negative affect via several different standardized methods
      including: (1) pictures of emotion-arousing stimuli; (2) pictures of emotional facial
      expression; (3) cues signaling reward or punishment. This protocol is designed to cover many
      different functional magnetic imaging studies all using similar techniques to evoke and
      measure positive and negative affect in the brain. Most subjects will not participate in
      studies involving all the methods described in the protocol.

      Outcome measures: The outcome measure is differences in blood oxygenation dependent level
      (BOLD) signal measured using standard fMRI techniques and analyzed using AFNI software.
