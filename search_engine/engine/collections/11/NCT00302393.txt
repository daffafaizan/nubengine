      pharmacokinetic curve). It was designed to replace IR-MPH TID treatment. The main target of
      MPH in the brain is the dopamine transporter (DAT). We have an exquisitely sensitive
      methodology to measure DAT occupancy using C-11 Altropane and Positron Emission Tomography
      (PET). The time course of decay of the C-11 Altropane permits repeated imaging, thus allowing
      documentation of the pharmacokinetics of DAT receptor occupancy.

      We will test all combinations of initial administration and then delayed (repeated)
      administration of the two formulations: IR-MPH to IR-MPH; IR-MPH to OROS-MPH; OROS-MPH to
      IR-MPH; and OROS-MPH to OROS-MPH.
