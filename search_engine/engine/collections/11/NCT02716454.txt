      treatment becomes ineffective. The principles of so-called step-up therapy (STUP) where
      surgery represents the last therapeutical option are still followed.

      Early surgical intervention (Early Surgery - ES) can be an alternative even in patients with
      uncomplicated type of CD before all medical therapy is used (Top-down approach). Limited
      resection under these conditions will lead to immediate remission. Moreover, laparoscopic
      ileocaecal resection is safe with low morbidity and regarding potential complications of
      step-up treatment might be beneficial for the patient.

      Before wide introduction of ES approach into clinical practice, it is necessary to perform a
      randomized trial comparing early resection with the standard step-up medical therapy.

      The potential effect of early, intensive therapy (ileocaecal resection) on biological
      behavior of the disease has not been studied that is why patients with uncomplicated
      ileocaecal form are the most suitable for such a trial. Significant number of these patients
      will indeed progress into more unfavorable course of the disease (relapse, complicated form,
      early recurrence).

      Other potential benefit of early resection is the extended period without necessary
      medication. Even pharmacological recurrence prevention is not needed after surgery in
      uncomplicated CD patient if other risk factors are excluded. Rapid remission induced by
      surgery can lead to faster improvement of quality of life than long-term medication.
