      loading of implants. Platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) is widely used to accelerate soft and hard
      tissue healing. Activated platelets in PRF release growth factors resulting in cellular
      proliferation, collagen synthesis and osteoid production. The aim of this study was to
      compare the stability of dental implants inserted with one-stage surgical protocol with or
      without PRF application.

      Design: Non-randomized, Active Controlled Trial. Material and Methods: Twenty healthy
      patients (n=10 test group, n= control group) with adequate alveolar bone, having 2 or more
      adjacent missing teeth, extracted at least 6 months ago were included in this study. Minimum
      two tapered implants (Ankylosis, DentsplyFriadent) were placed to each patient. After
      surgical preparation of implant sockets, PRF that was prepared preoperatively was placed
      randomly to one of the sockets (PRF+). Acellular plasma portion of PRF was used to wet the
      implant placed into the PRF-coated socket. Resonance frequency measurements were made by
      Osstell ISQ after placement of implants, at 1 week and one month postoperatively.
