    
      In the dose-escalation phase, escalating doses of etrumadenant in combination with
      zimberelimab will be assessed in participants with advanced malignancies. Eligible
      participants will receive oral administration of etrumadenant as well as IV infusion of
      zimberelimab. The recommended dose for expansion (RDE) of etrumadenant will be determined
      upon completion of the dose-escalation phase.

      In the dose-expansion phase, etrumadenant at RDE in combination with zimberelimab may be
      assessed in participants with advanced clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC) or metastatic
      castrate-resistant adenocarcinoma of the prostate (mCRPC).

      Overall duration of treatment will depend on how well the treatment is tolerated. Treatment
      may continue until unacceptable toxicity or progressive disease or other reasons specified in
      the protocol.
