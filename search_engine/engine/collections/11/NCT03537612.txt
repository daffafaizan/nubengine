      patients will have high pain intensity peri-operatively and at 6 months post-operatively.
      Evaluation of the intensity and chronicity of pain and the function of the descending
      inhibitory system through a short QST procedure before surgery and six months after surgery
      will be carried out. In addition, evaluation of the patient's physical and emotional
      functioning, and exploration of the potential biological underlying mechanisms will also be
      assessed at the same time points.

      The secondary objective of this study is to determine if the peri-operative use of an alpha-2
      adrenergic receptor agonist enhances the efficacy of the descending inhibitory system of
      patients with sub-optimal CPM efficacy before surgery by decreasing pain after surgery.
      Consequently, this pharmacological intervention may also reduce the incidence of acute and
      chronic pain after surgery. Evaluation of the pain intensity and the function of the
      descending inhibitory system through a short QST procedure six weeks after surgery and six
      months after surgery in patients receiving Clonidine or placebo during the perioperative
      period will be done. In addition, evaluation of the patient's physical and emotional
      functioning, and exploration the potential biological underlying mechanisms at the same time
      points will be assessed.

      Lastly, evaluation of potential biomechanical alterations in 3D related to pain in children
      reporting presence of back pain pre and post spine surgery will be looked at.

      The hypothesis is that patients undergoing spine surgery with poor inhibitory pain response
      will have less pain in the immediate and long-term period when treated prophylactically with
      Clonidine in the perioperative period.
