      anterior horn cells and brain stem motor nuclei. It is followed by programmed cell death. It
      progresses with symmetrical weakness and atrophy of voluntary muscles throughout the body. It
      leads to a decrease in mobility with progressive loss of power, and pulmonary function
      impairment with the involvement of the respiratory muscles.

      Families who are confronted with these problems that arise after the birth of the baby or
      shortly after birth have a serious adaptation problem. When the course of the disease and its
      incurability are explained, patients and their families are under severe stress. Physical and
      emotional health is worse than normal healthy growing children's parents.

      They need information, psychological and social support. The role of the family is very
      important in the life of children with disabilities. Family-oriented care; has been developed
      to facilitate the care process of children with special needs and to help their families. The
      main characteristics of the family-oriented approach are that families know their children in
      the best way, that each family is unique and different, and that family and community support
      is provided for the child's functionality. The assessment of family function helps the
      planning and management of treatment according to the concerns of the family. The education
      of the family, the socio-cultural structure and the psychological approach of the parents
      play an important role in the development of the child with SMA.

      The aim of this study was to evaluate the care burden, needs and expectations of SMA parents
      and to reveal the problems clearly; so that this information can be used in rehabilitation
      planning and interpretation of results.
