      neoadjuant chemotherapy generally receive chemotherapy alone before operation, followed by
      adjuvant endocrine therapy. Because endocrine therapy is primarily delivered in the
      postoperative setting, the ability to add the efficacy of aromatase inhibitors combined with
      chemotherapy is lost. This study offers the unique opportunity to assess the synergistic or
      additive responsiveness of breast tumors to endocrine therapy plus chemotherapy while the
      tumors are still in vivo by treating patients with an aromatast inhibitor combined with
      chemotherapy before surgery and assessing pCR rates.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: The primary objective is to determine the frequency of pCR in breast and
      axilla.
