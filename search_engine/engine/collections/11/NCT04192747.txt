    
      The Bioadaptor RCT Study is a prospective, 2:1 randomized study of parallel designed, that
      will enroll up to 474 patients requiring treatment of up to two de novo coronary lesions of ≤
      24 mm in length in vessels of ≥ 2.5 mm and ≤ 3.5 mm in diameter.

      One or two designated target lesions, located in separate epicardial vessels (RCA, LCX or
      LAD), and meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria may be treated with the ELX1805J (DynamX
      Bioadaptor) or Resolute Onyx stent

      The primary safety endpoint is Target Lesion Failure (TLF) at 12 months. TLF is a composite
      endpoint defined as cardiac death, target vessel MI, and clinically-indicated target lesion
      revascularization

      Additional secondary safety and effectiveness endpoints will be evaluated at 30 days, 6 and
      12 months and 2-5 years.

      Using visual assessment, the target lesion must measure ≥ 2.5 mm and ≤ 3.5 mm in diameter and
      ≤ 24 mm in length able to be covered by a single ELX1805J or Resolute Onyx stent including 2
      mm of healthy vessel on either side of the planned treatment area.

      The patient will be eligible for device implantation only after satisfactory lesion
      pre-dilatation defined as: ≥ TIMI 2 flow, and no dissection greater than Grade B (NHLBI) able
      to be covered with a single device
