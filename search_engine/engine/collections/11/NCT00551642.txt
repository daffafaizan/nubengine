      and relevant to term infants with persistent pulmonary hypertension, the pathophysiology of
      respiratory failure in preterm infants may be quite different. Chronic lung disease (CLD)
      represents the final pathway of a heterogeneous group of pulmonary disorders of infancy that
      usually start in the neonatal period. CLD most commonly occurs in preterm (<30 weeks of
      gestational age (GA) infants with birth weights less than 1,500 grams (g), and especially in
      those very preterm (<26 weeks GA) with birth weights less than 1,000 g, and who have been
      treated for respiratory distress syndrome (RDS).
