      fracture fixation.

      The gold standard is the infrapatellar approach (below the knee cap). This approach has the
      patient positioned with the knee flexed at 90 degrees or greater on the operating table.
      However, there are challenges with this approach, including imaging, placement of
      supplemental fixation, conversion to open reduction when necessary and malunion with apex
      anterior angulation for proximal tibial fractures. The positioning of the patient causes
      tension on the structures and soft tissues around the knee which can hinder the placement of
      the nail and can cause damage to the soft tissues that can result in significant long-term
      anterior knee pain for many patients.

      The semi-extended suprapatellar approach has the patient positioned in approximately 15-20
      degrees of flexion, putting less tension on the structures and soft tissues about the knee
      and enables the surgeon to insert the nail in an optimal position with relative ease.
