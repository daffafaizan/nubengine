    
      OUTLINE: This is a multi-center study.

      NEOADJUVANT TREATMENT:

      All subjects will receive concurrent chemoradiation and pembrolizumab neoadjuvant treatment
      for 6 weeks:

        -  Pembrolizumab 200 mg Intravenously (IV) Days 1, 22 and 43

        -  Capecitabine 825 mg/m2 PO (by mouth) in twice daily doses (daily total 1650 mg/m2) on 5
           consecutive days / week Monday-Friday given on the radiation days for 28 days

        -  Radiation 50.4 Gy (Gray) in daily fractions of 1.8 Gy over a 6 week interval,excludes
           weekends

      POST NEOADJUVANT TREATMENT:

        -  End of treatment (EOT) 6-8 weeks after last dose of neoadjuvant treatment, all subjects
           will be assessed to determine resectability. Those with resectable disease will undergo
           surgery within 2-4 weeks of imaging, 8-12 weeks after completion of chemoradiation.
           Subjects who are found to have unresectable or metastatic disease post treatment with
           the combination of CRT+ pembrolizumab should receive standard of care definitive
           treatment per the discretion of their treating physician.

        -  Surgical Resection ( 2-4 weeks after restaging imaging and 8-12 weeks after completion
           of chemoradiation)

        -  Follow Up

        -  Post Operative Visit (4-6 weeks after surgery)

        -  Disease Follow Up -Years 1-2 (per site investigator discretion; suggested every 3-6
           months)

        -  Survival Follow Up - Years 3-5

      To demonstrate adequate organ function, all screening labs should be performed within 7 days
      of treatment initiation:

      Hematological:

        -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1,500 /mcL

        -  Platelets ≥100,000 / mcL

        -  Hemoglobin ≥9 g/dL without transfusion or erythropoietin (EPO) dependency (within 7 days
           of assessment)

      Renal:

        -  Serum creatinine ≤1.5 X upper limit of normal (ULN) OR

        -  Measured or calculated creatinine clearance ≥60 mL/min for subject with creatinine
           levels > 1.5 X institutional ULN Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) can also be used in
           place of creatinine or CrCl

      Hepatic:

        -  Serum total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 X ULN

        -  Aspartate transaminase (AST) / Serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) ≤ 2.5 X
           ULN

        -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) / Serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) ≤ 2.5 X ULN

        -  Albumin ≥2.5 mg/dL

      Coagulation:

        -  International Normalized Ratio (INR) or Prothrombin Time (PT) ≤1.5 X ULN unless subject
           is receiving anticoagulant therapy (as long as PT or PTT is within therapeutic range of
           intended use of anticoagulants)

        -  Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) ≤1.5 X ULN unless subject is receiving
           anticoagulant therapy (as long as PT or PTT is within therapeutic range of intended use
           of anticoagulants)
