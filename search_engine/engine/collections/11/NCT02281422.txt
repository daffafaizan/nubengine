      groups of subjects with various degrees of renal function based on creatinine clearance
      (stages of renal function according to the Food and Drug Administration and the European
      Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products Guidelines) for the evaluation of
      pharmacokinetics in patients with impaired renal function.

      The trial commenced with Groups 1 and 2. An interim safety evaluation was conducted and, as
      there were no safety concerns, the trial continued with Groups 3 and 4. After another interim
      safety evaluation with the data from Groups 3 and 4, the trial commenced with Group 5.
