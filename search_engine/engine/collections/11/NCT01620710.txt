      cancer is accumulating, data on postoperative hypofractionated treatment of the prostate bed
      and of the pelvic lymph nodes is still scarce. This phase II trial was initiated to
      investigate safety and feasibility of hypofractionated treatment of the prostate bed alone or
      with the pelvic lymph nodes.

      A total of 80 prostate cancer patients with the indication for adjuvant radiotherapy will be
      enrolled, where 40 patients with a low risk of lymph node involvement (arm 1) and another 40
      patients with a high risk of lymph node involvement (arm 2) will each receive 54 Gy in 18
      fractions to the prostate bed. Arm 2 will be given 45 Gy to the pelvic lymph nodes
      additionally. Helical Tomotherapy and daily image guidance wil be used.
