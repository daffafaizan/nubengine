      breast cancer survivors. This pilot study examined changes in anthropometric measures as a
      result of and feasibility/ acceptability of a mindful eating intervention for overweight and
      obese postmenopausal breast cancer survivors. The one-group pre-posttest study design
      included eight weekly group-based mindful eating sessions on strategies to intentionally and
      attentively consume food. Anthropometrics, blood pressure, mindfulness, nutritional intake,
      and physical activity were collected at baseline and 12-weeks follow-up. Data on feasibility
      and acceptability were collected at study completion.
