    
      Subjects with abnormal uterine bleeding and scheduled for dilatation and curettage (D&C) with
      diagnostic or treatment purpose will be randomized to two intervention arms.
      Multimedia-education Group (MME group) and verbal information group (Control Group). Both
      groups will receive State-Trait Anxiety Inventory before and after education and then will
      undergo D&C at an office setting. State-Trait Anxiety Inventory will be asked by the nursing
      staff. Multimedia-based education will be carried out using a 5 minutes video explaining the
      details of D&C. D&C will be carried out at office setting by an experienced gynecologist
      under sedation and analgesia.
