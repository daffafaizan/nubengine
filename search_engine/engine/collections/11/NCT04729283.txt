      results with onset of fecal incontinence or in contrast constipation, and in term of
      genitourinary results with occurrence of dysuria, erectile dysfunction, or vaginal dryness.
      The low anterior resection syndrome is defined by the occurrence after rectal resection, of
      gastrointestinal symptoms like fecal incontinence or stool evacuation difficulties, which
      affect quality of life, despite conservation of anal sphincter. This syndrome is now well
      known and used in many countries.

      However, there is a lack of data concerning gastrointestinal functional results after sigmoid
      surgery whether it is for cancer or diverticulitis. Some studies highlighted symptoms
      persistence in many patients after sigmoidectomy. Lately, the LARS score was used after
      sigmoidectomy for cancer. This study reveals symptoms of low anterior resection syndrome for
      41 % of patients. The correlation between rectal resection and sigmoidectomy could be explain
      by the resection of the upper part of rectum in case of sigmoidectomy.

      The issue of genito-urinary disorders after sigmoidectomy are poorly researched. Previous
      studies demonstrate a higher risk of erectile disorders after pelvic surgery and especially
      for cancer.

      Currently, there is a lack of data on functional results and quality of life for patients who
      are going into sigmoid surgery, whether for cancer or diverticulitis. The aim of this
      longitudinal study is to compare digestive functional outcome, genitourinary outcomes and
      quality of life in patients who undergo sigmoid resection for diverticulitis and cancer.
