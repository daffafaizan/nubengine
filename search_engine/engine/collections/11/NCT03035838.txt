    
      All severe traumatic brain injury patients admitted to the Cambridge University Hospital's
      Neurosciences Critical Care Unit who require insertion of a triple bolt for multimodal
      neuromonitoring (intracranial pressure-ICP, microdialysis-MD and brain tissue oxygen partial
      pressure-PbtO2) will be screened for participation in this study. Eligible patients will have
      an initial MRI scan in the first 24 hours from injury. Following this, and within 24 hours
      from injury, IVAMEND (the intravenous formulation of the NK-1 antagonist fosaprepitant)will
      be administered at a dose of 300 mg, intravenously over 1 hour. Patients will then have a
      follow up MRI scan in the 24 hour following IVAMEND administration. Continuous ICP and PbtO2
      monitoring as well as hourly microdialysis sampling will start immediately following
      insertion of monitors and at least 6 hours before and will continue for at least 12 hours
      after IVAMEND administration. ICP will continue to be monitored continuously in the 5 days
      following administration of IVAMEND. Microdialysis samples collected over the period of 6
      hours before and 12 hours after the administration of Fosaprepitant will be stored and
      consequently used to measure the concentration of Substance P, nitric oxide (NO) and
      inflammatory cytokines.
