      measurements of carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) when the scans are performed in CC
      Radiology and read using a computerized edge reader. Up to 50 volunteers will have two
      ultrasounds performed within a 6-month period. IMT thickness is used as a surrogate marker
      for atherosclerosis and may be of value in clinical trials.
