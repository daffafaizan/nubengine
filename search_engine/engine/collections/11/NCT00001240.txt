      with suspected abnormalities of gastric acid secretion. Gastric acid secretion is measured by
      means of analysis of gastric juices obtained by nasogastric suction. Other clinically
      indicated diagnostic procedures are performed depending on the patient's clinical state in
      order to reach a diagnosis.
