      more and more feasible and efficient. On the one hand, telemedicine can conserve and optimize
      medical resources, providing high-quality medical services to unbalanced areas, such as rural
      areas, stricken areas and battlefields. On the other hand, telemedicine can reduce the time
      spent by patients waiting for examination and treatment and thus prevent diseases from
      worsening.

      Magnetically controlled capsule endoscopy (MCE) has been confirmed to have comparable
      accuracy with conventional gastroscopy with the advantages of comfort and convenience. 5G
      communication technology has been applied to several fields in telemedicine, but its
      effectiveness, safety, and stability in remote magnetically controlled capsule endoscopy for
      upper gastrointestinal tract examination have not been established.

      The 5G-MCE system was provided by Ankon Technologies Co, Ltd (Shanghai, China), this system
      consists of three parts: remote console, remote control software (NaviRemoteCtrl), and remote
      connection software (NaviRemoteConn). The remote console (based in Shanghai), takes the
      endoscopist's input and translates it into a control signal. After network transmission, the
      patient side cart (based in Yinchuan) translates the control signal into actual instrument
      manipulation. The images captured by the capsule are simultaneously sent back to the screen
      of the remote console, and thus provide guidance for better control of the capsule.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the diagnostic utility, safety, feasibility and
      patient's acceptability of remote magnetically controlled capsule endoscopy system under 5G
      network.
