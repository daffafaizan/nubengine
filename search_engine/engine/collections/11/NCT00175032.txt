      gastroduodenal ulcers between lansoprazole 30mg QD + naproxen 500mg BID vs celecoxib 200mg QD
      in subjects with osteoarthritis taking low dose aspirin. Approximately 100 sites across the
      U.S. will enroll subjects with normal endoscopic findings and negative H.pylori. The duration
      of the study will be a maximum of 14 weeks including a screening period of up to 2 weeks and
      a 12 week treatment period. Gelusil will be provided for dyspepsia symptom rescue.
