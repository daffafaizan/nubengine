      retrospective component to test the hypothesis that the power of suggestion will reduce the
      frequency and severity of emergence reactions, even in the setting of the emergency
      department.

      The study will be conducted in the emergency department at CHRISTU Spohn Shoreline Hospital.
      CHRISTUS Spohn Shore hospital is the region's primary acute care center. It houses the Chest
      Pain, Stroke, and Cancer Centers of CHRISTUS Spohn, and the only level II trauma center in
      south Texas. It is a major teaching affiliate of Texas A&M medical school, and serves an
      inner-city population.
