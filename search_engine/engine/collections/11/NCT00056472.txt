      psychotic depression. People with psychotic depression experience hallucinations,and, more
      commonly delusions, in addition to major depression. Psychotic experiences may be either
      congruent with the theme of depression or incongruent, without an apparent relationship to
      feeling depressed. This study will determine the effectiveness of combining a selective
      serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) with antipsychotic medication in the treatment of
      psychotic depression accompanied by at least one identifiable delusion. The study will also
      evaluate the difference in treatment response of young adults versus geriatric patients.

      This double-blind study will last a total of 12 weeks. Participants will be randomly assigned
      to receive either olanzapine, an atypical antipsychotic drug, combined with sertraline, an
      SSRI, or olanzapine alone. Following baseline assessments, study visits will occur weekly
      until Week 6, and then bi-weekly until Week 12. Participants who do not respond to either
      treatment may leave the study at any time. Participants who achieve either partial or full
      response may participate in an additional 20-week study.
