      trapezitis. The trapezius muscle is postural muscle diamond shape highly susceptible to
      overuse. It helps in extension, neck rotation, and side bending. Trapezitis is frequently
      caused by bad posture, watching TV or working on computer for a long and use of thick pillo.
      Passive ROM may be painful and restricted due to protective spasm in muscle. This study will
      be a Randomized controlled study and will be conducted in Met Life Rehablitation center
      Lahore. The study will be completed within the time duration of six months . Consecutive
      sampling technique will be used to collect the data. The sample size of 48 patients will be
      taken in this study to find the effect of positional release technique in subacute unilateral
      trapezitis. Patient will be divided into two groups. Mayoficial release therapy and
      ultrasound will be given to both groups as a baseline treatment. (Group A will be treated
      with positional release technique, mayofascial release technique and ultrasound while Group B
      will be treated with mayofascial release technique and ultrasound). All measurements will be
      taken at baseline and at the end of 2nd week.Each group will be given 3 sessions per week for
      2 weeks. Neck disability index will be used to measure function, Numeric pain rating scale
      will be used to measure pain intensity and goniometer will be used to measure cervical
      lateral flexion and extension and rotation range of motion. Data will be analyzed on SPSS 25.
