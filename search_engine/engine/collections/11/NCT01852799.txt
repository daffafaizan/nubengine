      14-day screening period. Eligible subjects will receive 4 cycles PAD treatment prior to ASCT.
      Bisphosphonate therapy can be administered as medically indicated and according to local
      practice.

      After the end of the treatment phase, there will be 18 months follow-up period for every
      patient with visits at 4, 6, 12 and 18 months after the end of the treatment phase. In case
      the disease progresses before completing the 18 months of follow-up and once the subject
      started alternative MM treatment, study assessments will stop, except for survival follow-up
      which will be collected every 6 months by either a telephone call or a visit to the study
      site. The follow-up for survival will continue for all subjects until the last subject has
      completed follow-up. One interim analysis of efficacy and safety will be performed when all
      subjects have achieved the end of treatment. Safety will be assessed by the monitoring of
      adverse events, physical examination, vital signs measurements and clinical laboratory tests.
