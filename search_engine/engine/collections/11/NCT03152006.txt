      effectiveness of ACT, a coordinated protocol for transitioning adolescents living with HIV
      (ALHIV) from pediatric to adult care (Intervention Group; IG) versus the usual abrupt
      transfer to adult care (Control group; CG) on rates of retention in care and viral
      suppression, and differences in perceived psychosocial wellbeing. Twelve health facilities,
      two in each of the six geopolitical zones of Nigeria will be pair-matched and randomly
      assigned to either IG (N=6 health facilities) or CG (N=6 health facilities). A total of 216
      ALHIV will be enrolled in the study over a 36-month period. The primary outcome will be the
      difference in the rate of retention between the groups. Secondary outcomes will be difference
      in the rate of viral suppression and the difference in perceived psychosocial wellbeing.
      Additionally, the investigators will conduct mediation/moderation analysis to examine the
      role of intermediate variables such as transition readiness, perceived mental health, social
      support, health locus of control, self-esteem and sexual risk behavior self-efficacy on the
      primary outcomes. Implementation factors will be assessed using the hybrid 2 model.
