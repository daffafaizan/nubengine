      intervention that improves gait performance in the elderly. Among patients with Alzheimer's
      disease, it seems that physical exercice also improves cognitive performance, reduces the
      loss of autonomy and independence in activities of daily living. All these effects may reduce
      the caregiver burden.

      Despite several initiatives in France, no study has been carried out to test the adherence to
      postural balance exercises and to examine the benefits on older AD patients and their
      caregiver.

      The main objective of this study is to measure the adherence to "Siel bleu" balance exercises
      in patients with Alzheimer's disease, while taking into account the disease stages.
