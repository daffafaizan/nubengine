    
      the ABSORB FIRST Registry is intended to provide an assessment of the safety and performance
      of the Absorb BVS device in accordance to the IFU in real world use involving more complex
      patients, lesions and use (examples: longer lesions, overlapping use, bailout, patients at
      high risks for cardiac events, etc.).

      The ABSORB FIRST study will register a minimum of 1800 patients in approximately 90 sites
      throughout multiple countries worldwide where Absorb BVS has regulatory approval or is
      commercially available.
