    
      To assess the safety and feasibility of use in humans of the TAXUS Petal Paclitaxel-Eluting
      Bifurcation Coronary Stent System (TAXUS® Petal™) for the treatment of de novo
      atherosclerotic bifurcation lesions (by visual estimate):

        -  Phase 1:

             -  Main branch: 3.0 to 3.5 mm RVD and lesion length ≤20 mm

             -  Side branch: 2.5 to 3.5 mm RVD and lesion length ≤14 mm

        -  Phase 2:

             -  Main branch: 3.0 to 3.5 mm RVD and lesion length ≤28 mm

             -  Side branch: 2.25 to 3.5 mm RVD and lesion length ≤14 mm

      Bifurcation main branch (MB) lesion length will be measured from the proximal shoulder of the
      most proximal lesion to the distal shoulder of the most distal lesion. Bifurcation side
      branch (SB) lesion length will be measured from the proximal shoulder of the side branch (if
      the ostium is disease-free) or the side branch ostium (if the disease continues into the main
      branch) to the distal side branch shoulder of the most distal lesion. At follow-up, the
      entire stented region will be used to determine MLD and %DS.
