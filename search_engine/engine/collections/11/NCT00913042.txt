    
      Evaluation criteria are 1) proportion of microbiologically documented infections 2) time
      elapsed from bed side sampling to microbiological diagnostic, in case of positive sample.

      The assessed procedures included a large volume of blood, an early incubation made possible
      by the availability of a culture device in the hematology department, an early warning in
      case of positive blood culture, bacterial DNA detection in blood, and an early identification
      of the positive strains and their resistance profile.

      We hypothesize that the combination of these different procedures will improve the proportion
      of microbiologically blood culture from 30 to 45%. One hundred and 20 episodes of febrile
      neutropenia are necessary to achieve this goal.
