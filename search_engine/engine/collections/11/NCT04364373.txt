      last 15 years, when in Europe was presented concept of complete mesocolic excision. However,
      this concepts is very close to Japanese D3 lymph node dissection and in the first view it
      seems the same but principal differences were found. Japanese concept is partial resection of
      the bowel according feeding artery (short bowel specimen, long lymphovascular pedicle),
      opposite European concept is wide resection of the bowel like hemicolectomy or extended
      hemicolectomy, sigmoidectomy. In complete mesocolic excision anatomical landmarks are still
      unclear but in Japanese guidelines it has anatomical margins which can standardize this
      procedure. Also nerve sparing technique around root of inferior mesenteric artery was
      described. One more difference is in histological examination of the specimen. European
      concept is to pay more attention to the quality of complete mesocolic excision and less - to
      the number of investigated lymph nodes. In Japan lymph node extraction is performed by
      surgical team from the fresh specimen and send to pathologist separately (each group of lymph
      nodes). Considering the absence of randomized control trials for patients with left colon
      cancer DILEMMA trial was started using Japanese approach
