      Additionally, aberrant DNA methylation has been identified in high risk childhood ALL, and
      therefore, DNA hypomethylating agents, such as decitabine, have been identified as
      therapeutic agents. Moreover, decitabine has immunomodulatory effects by enhancement of class
      I human leukocyte antigen (HLA) antigen expression on cancer cells, which increases their
      susceptibility to immune surveillance mechanisms, such as graft-versus-leukemia effect of
      donor cells in allogeneic transplantation and by augmentation of natural killer (NK), T and B
      lymphocyte reactivity. We hypothesize that decitabine delivered after allo-HSCT in patients
      with leukemia will enhance disease control by the allogeneic immune system and lead to a
      longer disease free survival. However, a safety study is needed to determine appropriate
      decitabine dosing in the post-transplant period. Low doses of decitabine are likely better
      tolerated in the post-transplant setting given risks of myelosuppression. In addition, when
      administered at lower doses, decitabine's hypomethylation effects are more pronounced in
      relation to its pyrimidine analog cytotoxic effects. In this study low doses of decitabine
      will be administered beginning 6 weeks to 100 days post-transplant. Measures of gene
      methylation and immune reconstitution will be conducted to define biologically active doses.
      Results from this trial will provide new clinical data regarding the effects of decitabine on
      gene methylation and immunoreactivity, will establish a maximally tolerated dose in the
      post-transplant setting, will define biologically active doses, and will serve as a basis for
      future efficacy trials.
