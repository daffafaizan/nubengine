    
      This study is designed to primarily examine how pregabalin affects the autonomic nerve or
      sympathetic-parasympathetic regulation in patients with diabetic neuropathy and its
      relationship to neuropathic pain. The goals of this study include (1) assessing the change of
      parameters of autonomic nerve function such as heart rate variability (HRV), respiratory
      sinus arrhythmia (RSA), minute ventilation, and changes in objective sleep parameters
      measured by means of the LifeShirt, upon treatment of pregabalin in comparison to placebo;
      (2) assessing the symptom change of neuropathic pain upon treatment of pregabalin in
      comparison to placebo; (3) assessing the change of anxiety symptoms upon treatment of
      pregabalin in comparison to placebo; (4) assessing the change of depressive symptoms upon
      treatment of pregabalin in comparison to placebo; (5) assessing the relationship of autonomic
      nerve function with neuropathic pain at baseline prior to treatment and the correspondences
      to the study drug; (6) assessing the relationship of autonomic nerve function with anxiety
      and depressive symptoms at baseline prior to treatment and their correspondences to the study
      drug; (7) identifying sensitive and reliable parameters of autonomic nerve regulation as
      predictor(s) of the severity and improvement of neuropathic pain and/or anxiety; and (8) to
      assess the change in objective sleep parameters (EEG/EOG) by means of the LifeShirt, upon
      treatment of pregabalin in comparison to placebo
