    
      This is an observational, non-interventional study that will include two cohorts of patients
      with schizophrenia who initiated maintenance treatment during a schizophrenia-related
      hospitalisation or during the immediate three months after hospital discharge: patients who
      initiated maintenance treatment with AOM and patients who initiated maintenance treatment
      with any daily oral atypical AP.

      The date of maintenance treatment initiation will be considered the index date (see
      definition of maintenance treatment initiation in Section 3.1). Baseline data will be
      collected immediately after the inclusion of the patient in the study (including
      retrospective data from the index date to the date of informed consent and from the past 5
      years). From the index date, each patient will be followed up until discontinuation of the
      maintenance treatment of interest and up to a maximum of 12 months. Especially after the
      implementation of the Global Amendment nยบ1, it is possible that the complete follow-up of the
      patient took place in the past (retrospective data), i.e. before the inclusion of the subject
      in the study. Data will be collected from the patient file and from information obtained
      during routine visits scheduled according to clinical practice.
