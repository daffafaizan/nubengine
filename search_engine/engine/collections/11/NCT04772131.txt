    
      This study is a prospective, non-randomized, parallel cohort, multi-center study of Desara®
      One single incision sling (SIS) compared to Desara® Blue sling systems implanted via the
      transobturator-route (TOR) for the treatment of women with stress urinary incontinence (SUI).
      The study will compare results from SIS patients (N=150) and TOR patients (N=150) at up to 40
      sites for a total period of 36 months, with follow-up visits at 6, 12, 18, 24 and 36 months.
      This study will enroll adult females who are clinically indicated for a mid-urethral implant
      for the treatment of female stress urinary incontinence (SUI) resulting from urethral
      hypermobility and/or intrinsic sphincter deficiency (ISD).
