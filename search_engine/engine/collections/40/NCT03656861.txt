      Centre during the recruiting period in 2014-2015. Final data analysis consisted of 151
      Caucasian subjects who met the inclusion criteria.

      All subjects underwent two-dimensional (2D) transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) procedure.
      Prior to performing 2D TTE, subjects' arterial blood pressure, heart rate, height, weight,
      and self-reported physical activity levels were measured.

      The Ultrasound system CX50 (Philips Ultrasound, Philips Healthcare, Philips Medical Systems
      Nederland, USA) - with transducer S5-1 was used in this study. Two physicians performed 2D
      TTE and averages for all variables of interest were computed. The measurements of aortic root
      and the left ventricle were drawn upon the guidelines of the American Society of
      Echocardiography and the European Association of Cardiovascular Imaging.

      The maximal diameter of the sinuses of Valsalva was measured at end-diastole, in a strictly
      perpendicular plane to that of the long axis of the aorta using the edge to leading edge
      (L-L) convention. The aortic annulus was measured at midsystole from inner edge to inner edge
      (I-I). This was done in order to obtain the rounder shape and bigger diameter of aortic
      annulus.
