    
      This is a randomized, 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study in
      patients with IBS-C. Patients will undergo a Screening Period to determine eligibility. After
      completing a Screening Visit patients will undergo a 2-week Pre-Treatment assessment using
      the Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS) during which they will complete daily
      assessments of bowel movements (BMs), stool consistency (Bristol Stool Form Scale- BSFS),
      abdominal pain or abdominal discomfort and other symptoms associated with IBS-C. Data from
      the two-week IVRS Pre-treatment assessment are used to define the patient's baseline from
      which change will be determined. Patients who meet all entry criteria will be randomized to
      one of five treatment groups ( 0.3mg,1.0mg,3.0mg,9mg,or Placebo) on Day 1 of the Treatment
      Period. Patients will take an oral dose of study drug daily (QD) for 12 weeks and continue
      the daily IVRS diaries (BMs, abdominal pain, other symptoms). On Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12,
      patients will return to the clinic to undergo safety and efficacy assessments. For 2 weeks
      after completing dosing, (i.e., Post-Treatment Period), patients will continue to complete
      daily IVRS diaries. Patients will then return to the clinical site for a final follow-up
      visit (End of Study Visit). The planned duration of participation in this study will be
      approximately 112 days from signing of informed consent through post-treatment or 145 days if
      30 day washout of a prohibited concomitant medication or stabilization of a medical condition
      is required before Pre-Treatment (up to 148 days, with all windows considered).
