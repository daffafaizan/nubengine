    
      Observational simulation (hypothetical) study of intensivist decisions for selected real
      patients.

      Each patient writes advance directives (AD) after receiving clear information (videos and
      interview with an independent intensivist).

      Intensivists answer to 5 questions for two simulations (hypothetical) models (scenario) on
      pneumonia and occlusive syndrome, in 3 times: without the AD, with AD, and with AD by knowing
      the drafting conditions (information from intensivist).
