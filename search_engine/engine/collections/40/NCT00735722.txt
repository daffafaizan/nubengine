    
      Primary Objective

      â€¢ To compare the efficacy of concomitant AF ablation using HIFU to no ablation at 12 months
      in patients with persistent or long standing persistent AF undergoing CABG according to
      ACC/AHA/ESC 2006 guidelines and HRS/EHRA/ECAS Consensus Statement on Catheter and Surgical
      Ablation .

      Secondary Objectives

        -  To compare the safety of concomitant AF ablation using HIFU to no ablation in patients
           with persistent or long standing persistent AF undergoing CABG.

        -  To compare AF burden in patients with persistent or long standing persistent AF treated
           with concomitant HIFU AF ablation undergoing CABG to those receiving no ablation.

        -  To compare the quality of life of patients with persistent or long standing persistent
           AF treated with concomitant HIFU AF ablation undergoing CABG to those receiving no
           ablation.

        -  To compare the health economic impact of concomitant AF ablation with HIFU in patients
           with persistent or long standing persistent AF undergoing CABG to those receiving no
           ablation.

        -  To compare the morbidity associated with persistent or long standing persistent AF in
           patients following CABG and ablation compared to those receiving no ablation.

        -  To compare cardiac function and left atrial transport associated with persistent or long
           standing persistent AF patients following CABG and ablation compared to those receiving
           no ablation.

        -  To document the incidence of immediate post ablation bidirectional conduction block
           through the pulmonary venous cinch and mitral lines.

        -  To document the effect of Intra-operative pre and post ablation stimulation and ablation
           of the autonomic ganglia.
