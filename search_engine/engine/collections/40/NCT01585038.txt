    
      This is a randomized, controlled, open-label, single-center study comparing the effects of
      efavirenz (EFV) versus rilpivirine (RPV) on endothelial function in a total of 40
      HIV-uninfected healthy volunteers (20 in each arm) at the Indiana University Medical Center.
      Enrolled subjects will have their brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD), a measure of
      endothelial function, and other cardiovascular, inflammatory, and oxidative stress parameters
      measured at baseline and again after 4 weeks of study treatment.
