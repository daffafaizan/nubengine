      population will be patients with advanced, dry AMD with evidence of significant geographic
      atrophy involving the fovea. These patients will have significant central vision loss with
      best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of the eye to be implanted of BCVA of 20/200 or worse.
      Each of these patients will have substantial RPE and photoreceptor loss. Patients will be
      screened for overall health status to minimize risks associated with retinal surgery and any
      subsequent immunosuppression.

      As the safety and tolerability of CPCB-RPE1 is demonstrated in the first cohort, patients
      with less advanced disease will be recruited into a second cohort in this Phase I/IIa
      clinical trial. In this second cohort patients will have significant central vision loss with
      BCVA of the eye to be implanted of 20/80 or worse, but better than or equal to 20/400 with
      comparably less damage to the RPE/photoreceptor complex than Cohort 1. These patients will be
      screened in the same manner for overall health status to minimize risks associated with
      retinal surgery and any subsequent immunosuppression. Assessments of visual function will be
      the same as in Cohort 1.
