      chemotherapy consisting of melphalan, topotecan, and etoposide phosphate followed by
      autologous stem cell transplantation in patients with stage II or III multiple myeloma or
      stage I with evidence of progressive disease. II. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of
      topotecan in combination with melphalan and etoposide phosphate in this patient population.
      III. Determine response rates and time to treatment failure in these patients when treated
      with this regimen. IV. Determine the pharmacokinetic profiles of these drugs and investigate
      the pharmacodynamic relationships with respect to the efficacy and toxicity of this regimen
      in these patients. V. Determine whether the sequencing of this chemotherapy regimen is
      appropriate and optimal in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of topotecan. Patients are primed with
      cyclophosphamide IV over 2 hours for 2 days. Peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) are
      collected. Approximately 4 weeks after PBSC collection, patients receive melphalan IV over 30
      minutes and topotecan IV over 30 minutes on days -7 to -5. Etoposide phosphate IV is
      administered over 4 hours on days -4 and -3. PBSC are reinfused on day 0. Cohorts of 4-12
      patients receive escalating doses of topotecan until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is
      determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 6 of 12 patients
      experience dose limiting toxicities. Patients are followed 2-3 times a week for approximately
      1 month, then at 3, 6, and 12 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 34-60 patients will be accrued for this study within 24-36
      months.
