      that provides a combination of cognitive as well as motor skill training in an engaging and
      repetitive manner [1]. This project objective is to assess the feasibility and clinical
      benefit of utilizing the BBVR to augment the rehabilitation of service members with TBI. The
      BrightBrainerTM Virtual Reality (BBVR) Rehabilitation System is unique because it is designed
      to provide integrative, customized, intensive and self-guided therapy that simultaneously
      addresses the cognitive, emotive and motor deficits. Early evidence suggests that it has been
      effective for patients with cognitive deficits as the result of cerebrovascular accident or
      dementia, but has not yet been evaluated in a therapeutic intervention for patients with TBI.
      In addition to assessing the system's effect on patient's symptoms, we will also evaluate the
      feasibility of utilizing this system in a military environment by obtaining feedback from the
      patients and therapists, regarding system acceptance, reliability and ease of use.
