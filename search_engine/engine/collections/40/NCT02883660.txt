    
      Genetic variations in the CYP2B6, CYP2D6, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4/5+ drug metabolizing enzymes
      are responsible for metabolism of a large number of psychiatric and nonpsychiatric
      medications. Variations in the genes encoding for these enzymes can alter their activity
      resulting in unexpectedly high or low serum levels of the drug leading potentially to change
      in both efficacy and adverse events. The serotonin transporter protein is a presynaptic
      transmembrane protein responsible for serotonin reuptake. The "short" form of the serotonin
      transporter promoter (SLC6A4) is associated with reduced activity of the of the transporter.
      Patients who are homozygous for the "short" alleles of SLC6A4 may be more likely to have with
      poor response, slow response, and greater adverse events with serotonergic medications. The
      target medications being studied include escitalopram, citalopram, paroxetine, fluvoxamine,
      venlafaxine, duloxetine, bupropion, vortioxetine, vilazodone, and levomilnacipran only.
