      neurological impairments including postural stability and coordination. Virtual reality
      training has also been shown to increase motivation and attention through its use of novel
      goal-directed challenges. The Xbox Kinect gaming system allows the Veteran to perform
      challenging full-body and goal-oriented activities. Balance improvements using laboratory
      developed games have been demonstrated in those with a history of TBI. However, the
      investigators are specifically interested if improvements can be made using commercial games
      which can be utilized in physical therapy clinics more readily. Exercise gaming has been
      shown to provide adequate intensity exercise to improve heart health in the healthy
      population. However, such benefits have not yet been investigated using the Xbox Kinect for
      individuals with a history of TBI.
