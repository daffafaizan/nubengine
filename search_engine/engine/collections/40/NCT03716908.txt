      underrepresentation of presymptomatic affected subjects and the calculation of vestibular
      deterioration were based on just one vestibular parameter, whereas the combined evaluation of
      a complete vestibular test battery, covering the complete vestibular sensitivity range and
      all labyrinthine compartments separately, is nowadays considered standard practice in
      determining more accurate assessment of the vestibular function.

      For this reason, a prospective cross-sectional study on pre- as well as symptomatic DFNA9
      patients carrying the Pro51Ser (P51S) mutation in COCH gene is being carried out, in order to
      gain more realistic data on vestibular dysfunction, consisting of pure tone audiometry and a
      comprehensive vestibular test battery, including electro- or videonystagmography (VNG), C-
      and O-Vestibular-evoked myogenic potential (VEMP) tests, video Head Impulse Test (vHIT) and
      questionnaires (DHI (Dizziness handicap Index), oscillopsia questionnaire (OS), Quality of
      Life Questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L), activities-specific balance confidence (ABC) scale.
