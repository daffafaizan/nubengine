      mental and physical functioning, including possible exacerbation of cognitive deficits.
      Initial investigations document the effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral therapy for the
      treatment of insomnia in HF. However, the high symptom burden of HF necessitates alternative
      interventions for these patients with fewer time and physical endurance demands.

      Brief Behavioral Treatment for Insomnia (BBTI) is a four-session behavioral intervention that
      emphasizes stimulus control and sleep restriction techniques, along with providing education
      to patients about healthy sleep practices and behaviors that adversely affect sleep. The
      efficacy of BBTI has been previously documented in samples of older adults with insomnia, but
      the intervention has yet to be applied to a disease-specific patient population.

      This study was designed to 1) evaluate the treatment effects of BBTI on insomnia among HF
      patients, 2) examine the relationship between insomnia, cognitive function, and
      decision-making in HF patients at baseline, and 3) evaluate the effects of BBTI on relevant
      correlates of insomnia in HF patients, including cognitive functioning, decision-making,
      distress, self-care, quality of life, and functional status.

      Participants will be randomized to either the four-session behavioral intervention (BBTI) or
      a sleep monitoring condition. Measures of sleep (insomnia, sleep efficiency, sleep quality),
      cognitive functioning (memory, attention, executive functioning, and decision making),
      distress (anxiety and depression), HF-related quality of life, HF self-care, and functional
      status will be obtained from participants at baseline, post-intervention, and 6 months
      post-intervention. Repeated measures multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) will serve as
      the primary mode of data analysis.
