      cerebrovascular insults. Paroxysmal AF is defined as an episode of AF that terminates
      spontaneously or with intervention within 7 days. Patients with AF may present with
      palpitations, shortness of breath or sensation of light-headedness but asymptomatic episodes
      are also possible, especially in paroxysmal AF. The lack of continuous heart rate monitoring
      options makes early diagnosis of paroxysmal AF challenging. In this prospective single-center
      trial, the PPG wearable Corsano CardioWatch 287 sensor will be used to conduct continuous
      heart rate and -rhythm monitoring in patients with known paroxysmal AF. Collected data will
      then be analysed using a Cloud Analytics Service (Preventicus Heartbeats algorithm) and
      compared with data from simultaneously obtained 48-hour Holter ECG. Correctly identified AF
      episodes, their cumulative duration per 48 hours (AF burden) and the number of asymptomatic
      episodes will be assessed. In the primary analyses, the sensitivity of the PPG analysing
      algorithm to detect AF episodes is estimated by performing a logistic regression on detection
      (yes/no) with only an intercept as predictor, which is then translated to a proportion (the
      sensitivity). In the secondary analyses we are comparing the cumulative duration of AF
      episodes over 48 hours (AF burden) obtained with the PPG-sensor and Holter-ECG. In summary,
      the purpose of the study is to evaluate the performance and efficacy of the wearable PPG
      sensor and the cloud analytics service in detecting and quantifying AF episodes in patients
      with known history of paroxysmal AF.
