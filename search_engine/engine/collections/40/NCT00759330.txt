      with daily low back pain below the 12th thoracic vertebra of greater than 3 months duration.
      Patients also had an average daily pain score of 4 or greater on an 11-point categorical pain
      scale for the last 3 days of the baseline phase. The study began with a 14-day washout period
      of previously used pain medications. At the end of the 14-day baseline phase, patients were
      randomized to 1 of 4 treatments: Flurbiprofen tape applied once daily for 12 hours,
      Flurbiprofen tape applied once daily for 24 hours, placebo tape applied once daily for 12
      hours, or placebo tape applied once daily for 24 hours. During the 7-day treatment phase,
      patients applied 2 treatment tapes once daily for 7 days. The tapes remained on for 12 or 24
      hours of continuous treatment, depending on the treatment to which they were randomized.
      Patients were provided with rescue medication. After 7 days of tape treatment, patients
      returned to the clinic for a study exit visit.
