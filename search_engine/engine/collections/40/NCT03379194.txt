      e.g. the top 75% antibiotic prescribers. The trial is based on routinely collected individual
      reimbursement claims data of the three largest Swiss health insurers covering an estimated
      number of 3.8 million Swiss residents, and on routinely collected surveillance data on
      antibiotic resistance. A pragmatic trial design is used. Physicians in the intervention group
      will not have to provide informed consent but they may opt out and decline receiving any
      interventional information. Physicians in the control group will not be notified. This
      approach is justifiable and has previously been approved by all Swiss ethical committees.
      Investigators will take any measures to guarantee the confidentiality of all collected data.
      Data provided by health insurers on physicians and patients will be completely anonymized.

      This is a nationwide study enrolling all registered primary care physicians (general internal
      medicine and pediatrics) with more than 100 patient contacts in the year prior to the start
      of the trial. All primary care providers with shared ZSR (Zahlstellenregister) numbers (e.g.
      ambulatory settings in hospitals where individual physicians cannot be identified) and with
      less than 100 patient contacts per year will be excluded.
