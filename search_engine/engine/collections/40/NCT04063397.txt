      Epidemiologic studies have shown a significant association between PE and future
      cardiovascular disease (CVD) in women. Despite recognition of this relationship, there are no
      good markers to help determine which women are at highest risk, in particular as this relates
      to long-term cardiovascular risk, the number one cause of mortality in U.S. born women. As
      such, the study of PE and cardiovascular outcomes, in particular to identify early markers
      for the development of late CVD, provide insight into critical opportunities for early
      treatment and modification of disease trajectory in women.

      The investigators plan to enroll women with PE prospectively to evaluate incremental
      cardiovascular risk in those who have PE with severe features. This study includes detailed
      echocardiographic evaluation at several time points. With the current proposal, the
      investigators aim to collect blood to evaluate several biomarkers to determine if there is a
      correlation with short and medium-term cardiovascular risk. This opens the door to earlier
      detection, treatment and improved cardiovascular outcomes.

      The investigators hypothesize that preeclampsia with severe features confers a much higher
      risk of cardiovascular impairment compared to milder form of preeclampsia and healthy
      controls. If the hypothesis proves correct, these findings may change clinical practice by
      warranting routine echocardiogram for these patients for early recognition, intervention and
      treatment of cardiac dysfunction.
