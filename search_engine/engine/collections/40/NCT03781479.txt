      outpatient study is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of
      amifampridine phosphate in ambulatory patients diagnosed with SMA Type 3. The study is
      planned to include approximately 12 male and female SMA Type 3 patients. The planned duration
      of participation for each patient is approximately 2 months, based upon length of dose
      titration and excluding the screening period, which can last up to 14 days. Patients should
      only be taking the assigned investigational product (amifampridine phosphate 10 mg tablets or
      matching placebo tablets), no new therapies are permitted during the study.
