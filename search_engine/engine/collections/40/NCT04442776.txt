      for mental health nursing in people with Severe Dual Diagnosis admitted to a psychiatric
      hospitalization unit, assessing change motivation, insight, medication adherence, drug
      consumption abstinence or reduction, therapeutic alliance, hopelessness and anxiety, which
      this context generates. For this purpose, a randomized, prospective, one-year-longitudinal
      clinical trial will be conducted. This study will be applied on patients with diagnosis of
      schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder and bipolar disorder types I and II who, after
      accepting to participate in the study and signing the informed consent, answer the PRISM
      questionnaire of admission in the hospitalization unit and fulfill the dual pathology
      criteria. After, they will be randomized in control group and intervention group (only the
      later will complete the D-AIP).

      The D-AIP will consist on 6 individualized sessions with the psychiatric inpatients, and
      during follow-up up to one year after discharge in which 4 individual sessions and 3
      telephone contacts will be made. In both groups, a different person from the one who performs
      the intervention and without knowledge of the group belonging will assess them with
      questionnaires in 9 moments during the whole follow-up year (Socrates 8D, Scale of
      Unawareness of Mental Disorder "SUMD", Morisky Medication Adherence Scale "MMAS-8", Working
      Alliance Inventory "WAI", Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale "HARS" y Hopelessness Scale "HS") and
      will collect a urine sample in each evaluation. The sample size will be 86 subjects, for
      Î±=0.05 and power=0.80.
