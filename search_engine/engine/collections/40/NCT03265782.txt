      ibuprofen in treatment of hemodyamically significant pda in preterm neonates. 30 preterm
      neonates were included in the study 15 per each group. echo was done in the beginning and
      during treatment with both drugs to follow up the closure of the duct.

      Ibuprofen was given as 10 mg/kg/dose in the 1st day followed by 5 mg/kg/dose in the 2nd and
      3rd days with follow up echo was done after finishing the course paracetamol was given as 15
      mglkg/6 hrs for three days with follow up echo to check the ductal closure.
