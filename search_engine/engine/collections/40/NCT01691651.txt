      and temporal extent of the orbicularis muscle of a group of patients with keratoconus
      (Botulinum toxin A group).The idea is to evaluate the change in palpebral fissure in patients
      from group botulinum toxin A over a period of 18 months.The measurements of the palpebral
      fissure will be performed by the Image J (version 1.34s) program, developed by the National
      Institutes of Health (USA).The unit of measure is the millimetre.The patients of the
      botulinum toxin A group will be compared with a control group, without any intervention.
