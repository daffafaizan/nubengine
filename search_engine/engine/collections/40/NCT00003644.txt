        -  Compare the progression-free interval and overall survival of patients with early stage
           ovarian epithelial cancer treated with carboplatin and paclitaxel with or without
           low-dose paclitaxel.

        -  Assess the frequency and severity of toxic effects of these regimens in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment
      arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours followed by carboplatin IV over 30
           minutes. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 3 courses. Four weeks after the completion
           of paclitaxel and carboplatin, patients receive low-dose paclitaxel IV over 1 hour once
           a week for 24 weeks.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours followed by carboplatin IV over 30
           minutes. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 3 courses. Patients then undergo
           observation.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 500 patients will be accrued for this study within 5.5 years.
