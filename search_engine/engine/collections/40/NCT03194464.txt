      overall objective of this proposal is to improve the investigators' understanding of neural
      mechanisms contributing to inter-limb and inter-hemispheric transfer following non-paretic
      limb exercise to task failure. The investigators will use transcranial magnetic stimulation
      to probe acute adaptations in cortical excitability, intracortical and inter-hemispheric
      circuits that accompany behavioral facilitation of the paretic hand.

      The work proposed in this two year project will enable the investigators to obtain three data
      elements critical to complete the working hypothesis:

        1. . Changes in intracortical and interhemispheric inhibition in both hemispheres following
           non-paretic limb exercise to task-failure.

        2. . Behavioral effects using a motor task involving manipulation and dexterity.

        3. . Determine the persistence and consistency of neural and behavioral facilitation.
