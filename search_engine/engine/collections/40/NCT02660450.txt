      will be carried on treadmill to determine the maximum oxygen intake and maximum heart rate.
      Second, the subjects are placed (in a blinded fashion) in 3 situations of moderate effort (60
      to 65%) for a total of 5 min and 3 min interval between conditions. In situation 1) will be
      used to speed regarding the particular metabolic demand from the maximum oxygen intake; In
      the second situation the reserve of heart rate will be used as reference for prescription
      aiming to achieve 60-65%; On the last visit will be shown to subjects a perceived effort
      characterized as moderate and asked to adjust their speed according to the application
      effort. The final will be recorded each time the FC and the speed and perception of effort
      that the subject was.
