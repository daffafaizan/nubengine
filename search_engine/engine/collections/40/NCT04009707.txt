      patients with UAS: BEARNI (Brief Evaluation of Alcohol-Related Neuropsychological
      Impairments). Since the BEARNI is presented as the reference test, the investigators have
      systematically proposed it to hospitalized patients, in combination with the usual check-up.
      In practice, at admission, patients were therefore given two screening tests, the MoCA and
      the BEARNI. In the event of an anomaly in at least one of these tests, a battery of
      confirmatory neuropsychological tests was performed.
