      Intermountain Medical Center will be invited to participate in this study. The patient's
      history and medical records will be reviewed and data gathered will be used to evaluate the
      patient's relationship to inclusion and exclusion criteria. After a written informed consent
      is obtained, subjects will be randomized 1:1 to the treatment arm or placebo/control arm.
      Those randomized to the treatment arm will receive three 50,000 unit oral doses of vitamin D3
      supplementation. The first dose will be given the evening before surgery. The second and
      third doses will be given either orally or per NG tube on the mornings of post-op days 1 and
      2. Approximately 15-20 ml (about one tablespoon) of blood will be obtained at the following
      time periods (+/- 4 hours): 1) At baseline pre-procedure 12 to 18 hours before planned
      surgery; 2) Post-operative day 1, 12 to 24 hours after surgery; 3) 48 hours after surgery; 4)
      72 hours after surgery; 5) At discharge (estimated to be between 5-8 days after surgery); and
      6) At the 6-month follow-up visit (post-surgery). Each blood sample will be transported to
      The Center for Molecular and Genetic Research at LDS Hospital Cardiovascular Genetics
      Laboratory for preparation and storage. Plasma levels of 25(OH) vitamin D will be measured on
      each sample.
