      persons. The clinical trial had two stages: the first stage selected 60 subjects to be
      administered test vaccine for preliminary safety study; 840 subjects were selected at the
      second stage for the observation of the safety and immunogenicity against the test vaccine
      administered on large population on the basis of the first stage. There were 560 subjects and
      280 subjects in the test group and control group respectively.

      Venous blood from subjects was collected before immunization and 4 weeks after the whole
      immunization for the analysis of the immunogenicity. The information about adverse
      reactions/time was reported to the SFDA every month during the trial under the status of
      blinding. Unblinding was conducted after the subject follow-up and observation.
