        -  Estimate dietary heterocyclic amine (HA) exposure in African American men who use
           HA-forming meats and cooking methods.

        -  Correlate dietary HA exposure with prostate-specific antigen and digital rectal exam
           screening results (i.e., higher HA exposure with increased abnormality in prostate
           cancer screening results) in these participants.

      OUTLINE: This is a prospective study.

      Participants complete a routine medical questionnaire and undergo a detailed dietary
      interview that focuses on meat consumption, cooking preferences, and other factors that may
      be associated with prostate cancer risk. Participants then undergo a digital rectal exam
      (DRE) and blood collection for prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing (total PSA and % free
      PSA). Results of PSA testing and DRE, including follow-up instructions (if needed), are sent
      to the participant 3-4 weeks later.

      Blood samples are also examined by phenotypic assays for UV-damage induced nucleotide
      excision-repair capacity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 800 participants will be accrued for this study.
