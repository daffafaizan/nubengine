      with HNPCC. This method appeared cost-effective and feasible. Using this new method 70% of
      the HNPCC patients will be identified as compared to less than 30% when the current method is
      used. However, this new method does not implement itself; large gaps exists between best
      evidence and daily practice. This study will compare an intensive strategy, consisting of
      distribution of educational materials, education, feedback and reminders, with a minimal
      strategy, only consisting of distribution of a critical care pathway. The aim is to find the
      most cost-effective strategy to implement the new method to identify patients with HNPCC in
      the Netherlands.
