      growing. The main objective of the parent trial (VITAL) is to evaluate the effects of vitamin
      D on cardiac events but is focused on atherothrombotic events and does not specifically
      address vitamin D effects on LV mass. In ambulatory individuals, LV mass is a key cardiac
      structural feature and increases in LV mass are frequently accompanied by diastolic
      dysfunction. This study leverages the existing infrastructure of the parent VITAL trial to
      perform cardiac imaging studies on a subset of subjects who will be randomized to vitamin D3
      (n=500) or placebo (n=500). Echocardiography is a noninvasive, widely accessible tool to
      evaluate cardiac structure and function. Cardiac echo imaging visits will take place at
      baseline (pre-randomization), and then after 2 years, at the Massachusetts General Hospital
      (MGH). The acronym VITAL-Echo reflects the link to the parent VITAL trial and an ancillary
      investigation of vitamin D versus placebo on LV mass and function as measured by
      echocardiography. The effect of fish oil supplementation on these parameters will be
      evaluated as a secondary endpoint, thereby taking advantage of the factorial design of the
      parent trial.
