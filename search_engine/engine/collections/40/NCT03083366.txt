    
      AIM 1: To determine the effect of sacral neuromodulation on urodynamic parameters following
      acute spinal cord injury. The following outcomes will be evaluated by urodynamic assessment
      at one year post-SCI: (1) maximum cystometric capacity, (2) bladder compliance, (3) presence
      of detrusor overactivity, and (4) volume and pressure for first detrusor contraction.

      AIM 2: To assess the impact of sacral neuromodulation on patient-reported quality of life
      after acute spinal cord injury. Patient-reported QoL will be assessed using the SCI-QOL
      bladder question bank and bladder/voiding diaries. Mean SCI-QOL score, daily number of
      catheterizations, average catheterization volume, and episodes of incontinence per day will
      be compared between groups at one year post-SCI.

      AIM 3: To examine the impact of sacral neuromodulation on quantifiable clinical outcomes.
      Patients will be followed longitudinally during the study period and assessed for the
      following: (1) need for anti-cholinergic medications and/or onabotulinum toxin A treatment,
      (2) number of symptomatic UTIs per year, (3) complications attributable to the device, (4)
      need for revision of device or leads due to lead migration or failure, (5) development of
      hydronephrosis.
