      describing general aspects of design and conduct of randomised clinical trials were
      developed. The materials varied in length, reading ability level, and reader appeal. Their
      influence on knowledge about and attitude toward randomised clinical trials was assessed in a
      randomised, parallel group, evaluator-blinded trial among 415 outpatients recruited from four
      departments at a university hospital in Copenhagen. The patients were randomised to the
      following groups: control (no intervention), leaflet, brochure, or booklet in a 1:1:1:1
      ratio. Knowledge (KN) was assessed by a 17-item multiple-choice questionnaire and attitude
      (AT) was assessed by a 32-item Likert questionnaire at entry and 2 weeks after the
      intervention. The interventions and the questionnaires were pilot tested and power
      calculations were performed.

      Assessment of scales for knowledge and attitudes was performed using Rasch analysis and
      Cronbach 's alpha. Associations between demographic variables, knowledge score and attitude
      score were examined using analysis of variance.
