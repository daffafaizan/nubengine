      diarrhoea and Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT)-negative fever. It will involve the recruitment and
      training of a volunteer to implement the CIME model in each village.

      The primary outcome of the trial is blood examination rate as determined by number of RDTs
      for malaria performed per week per village. 140 villages in 8 townships across Ayeyarwaddy,
      Bago and Yangon Regions and Kayah State in Myanmar will be sampled at random with probability
      proportional to size. Study populations include villages with ICMVs who will be re-trained as
      CIME volunteers (intervention phase) and the community members in the service catchment areas
      of those volunteers. An open stepped-wedge cluster-randomised controlled trial, randomized at
      the volunteer level (i.e. the volunteer and the village / workplaces they service), will be
      conducted over 6-months to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the CIME
      model intervention. The stepped-wedge design will comprises 24 weekly measurements of the
      number of malaria blood examinations performed by each village, with villages grouped into 10
      blocks of 14 villages and transitioned from control to intervention phases at bi-weekly
      intervals following a universal two-week control period. Differences in the per weekly rate
      of blood examination (primary outcome), will be estimated across intervention and control
      phases using a generalised linear (e.g. Poisson or negative-binomial link functions) mixed
      modelling analytical approach with maximum likelihood estimation.
