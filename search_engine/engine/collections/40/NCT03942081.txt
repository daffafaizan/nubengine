      ulcer (for ulcer patients), b) patients having pictures of their feet taken with a smart
      phone under 4 conditions- 1) photos taken by researchers, 2) photos taken by the patient by
      hand, 3) photos taken by the patient with a selfie stick, and 4) photos taken by a 3rd party
      (e.g., friend/family member of patient). If the patient is not able to take photographs under
      any of the conditions, that condition will be excluded. In addition to photos being taken
      with a smart phone, additional photos will be taken with a thermal camera by the research
      team to determine if there is a difference in ulcer size depending on type of camera used. It
      is anticipated that procedures will last between 15 and 45 minutes. There is no long-term
      follow-up. If a patient returns to the clinic they will be asked if they wish to complete all
      study procedures again. Once the patient has left the clinic, the research team will check
      the medical record for: age, sex, race, ethnicity, BMI, co-morbidities, and zip code (to
      determine if patient lives in an urban or rural location).
