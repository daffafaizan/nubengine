    
      This is a first-in-human, open-label, sequential dose escalation study to evaluate AB0024 in
      patients with advanced solid tumors. The study will consist of two parts: Part A will be a
      dose escalation, and Part B will be a dose expansion.The primary objective of this study is
      to characterize the safety, tolerability, and PK of AB0024 after multiple IV administrations
      in patients with advanced solid tumors. The secondary objectives are to measure the tumor
      response by modified RECIST and to evaluate the formation of anti-AB0024 antibodies.

      Patients will receive infusions of AB0024 every two weeks. Patients will be seen weekly for
      safety assessments and collection of blood samples. Patients who do not show evidence of
      disease progression by clinical assessment or by CT or MRI may continue receiving AB0024
      every 2 weeks until disease progression (clinical or radiographic), study drug intolerance,
      or withdrawal of consent.
