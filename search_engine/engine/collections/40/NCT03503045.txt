      health problems and a significant economic burden worldwide. The prevalence of diabetes in
      elderly patients is very high and is predicted to increase dramatically.

      Prior studies have generally been concerned with the inadequate treatment of diabetes
      however, over the last few years the overtreatment of diabetes has also come to the fore.
      Unfortunately, there are very few data worldwide and no data in Turkey about the
      overtreatment of patients with type 2 diabetes.

      This study aimed to assess the rates and predictors of overtreatment and undertreatment of
      glycemia and blood pressure in older adults with T2DM. Treatment deintensification or
      intensification by the physicians were also investigated.
