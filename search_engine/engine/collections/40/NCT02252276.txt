      previous phase of the chronic ankle stability (CAI), which involves between 20 - 41% of all
      ankle sprains.

      Residual pain concerns the first symptom after instability in most of the cases, but patients
      also show reduced ankle joint position sense, ankle range of motion, and strength of ankle
      inversion muscles.

      Proprioception exercises on multiplane and unstable platforms, as well as strengthening
      through eccentric exercises report benefits in pain and function, suggesting the active
      therapy as the most effective treatment instead of passive manual therapy in chronic phases.

      However, several studies analyzed the effects of the manual therapy in the management of the
      ankle sprain recurrence: the posterior gliding of astragalus and the tibiotarsal joint
      coaptation improved the ankle range of motion, which was related with recurrent ankle sprain
      and its residual symptoms.

      Despite the benefits from active and passive therapy, very few authors up to date
      investigated the combination of both clinical approach in the recurrent ankle sprain.
      Literature analyzed the effects of a combined program including exercises to the manual
      therapy in acute ankle sprain and concluded that the variety in the manual therapy techniques
      reported more pain release and improved function.

      Besides, based on the effects of joint mobilization techniques, the neurodynamic mobilization
      could be an appropriate therapy, due to the neural distribution of fibular nerve through the
      ankle joint, but no studies to date to our knowledge included this technique as part of the
      recurrent ankle sprain management.

      This study aimed to analyze the effects of proprioceptive and strengthening exercises versus
      the same exercises and manual therapy on the recurrent ankle sprain management.
