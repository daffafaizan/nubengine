    
      The aim of the study is to investigate the non-inferiority of the new sirolimus-coated
      balloon catheters in comparison to the paclitaxel-coated SQP with regard to acute tolerance,
      safety and efficacy in coronary DES in-stent restenosis.

      Patient population will consist of male and female adults suffering from coronary
      drug-eluting stent (DES) restenosis, which is to be treated by a study balloon according to
      the inclusion and exclusion criteria as defined below.

      In Late lumen loss lesion (difference between the angiographic in-lesion MLD post procedural
      and at 6 months follow-up) will be evaluated by quantitative coronary angiography (QCA).

      The study will be performed as a single-blind, SQP controlled study in 4 - 6 study centers in
      50 patients.
