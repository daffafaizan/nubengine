      Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in sterile vials for intravitreal (IVT) injection. Vials must
      be used (defined as entered with needle) only once. All drug supplies are to be kept under
      recommended storage conditions.

      The injection volume will be 50Î¼L (0.05 mL) and will be administered to the subjects by IVT
      injection.

      Study eyes will be assigned randomly (1:1 ratio) to one of the following 2 treatment arms:

        -  Group 1- aflibercept 2 mg every 4 weeks (defined as every 28 days (+ 7 days) and at
           least 21 days between injections) through week 48. Subjects will have a mandatory Year 1
           visit at week 48. Subjects have a mandatory visit at week 52 & will not receive
           treatment. During the second year of follow-up, subjects will be monitored and treated
           every 12 weeks (Week 60, 72, 84 and 96) with an end of study visit at week 100. If NV or
           PDR are worse per the pre-specified criteria at week 60, or at any study visit
           thereafter, the subject will be treated monthly through the end of the study.

        -  Group 2 - aflibercept 2 mg every 12-weeks for 48 weeks. Subjects will be followed every
           4 weeks through week 12, and can be treated if the pre-specified criteria are met.
           Starting at week 12 if NV or PDR are stable or improved (as assessed by investigator)
           the subject will be monitored and treated at a 12-week interval through week 48. If NV
           or PDR are worse per the pre-specified criteria at week 12, or at any study visit
           thereafter, the subject will be treated monthly through week 48. At week 52 -

             -  For subjects without any retinal non-perfusion, monitoring and treatment will
                continue at every 12 weeks (Week 60, 72, 84, 96) with an end of study visit at week
                100.

             -  For subjects with visible retinal non-perfusion, monitoring and treatment will be
                at a 4-week interval (defined as every 28 days + 7 days and at least 21 days
                between injections). If retinal non-perfusion has completely resolved at week 72,
                the subject will be switched back to monitoring and treatment every 12 weeks (Week
                72, 84, 96).

      Pre-specified criteria (subject must meet at least one criterion, which must be documented
      with imaging):

        1. Increased neovascularization

        2. Decrease in BCVA by 5 or more letters due to progressive DME or PDR

        3. Worsening central subfield diabetic macular edema causing vision loss, with principal
           investigator or other delegated investigator confirmation

        4. Total area of retinal ischemia increases by 10% as determined by the central reading
           center

      Rescue Treatment At any point throughout the study, for either treatment arm, if PDR
      progresses despite 3 monthly IAI, a fluorescein angiogram will be performed to evaluate PDR
      progression. PRP will only be permitted after confirmation of PDR progression with the
      primary
