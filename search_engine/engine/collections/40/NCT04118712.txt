      surgery involving the ovary. This may include patients with different conditions for
      comparison, such as ovarian cysts or masses and ovarian torsion. For each patient, the
      investigators will obtain the discarded tissue from the operating room after the affected
      ovarian tissue is resected. The tissue sample will only be taken for the tissue library from
      ovarian tissue that would otherwise be discarded.

      No additional tissue will be collected other than that which is already removed as part of
      the ovarian procedure. No additional surgery or other procedures will be performed for the
      purposes of this study. The tissue will be assigned a study ID number and the age, gender and
      diagnosis of the child will be entered on the tissue library log and maintained for the
      duration of the study.
