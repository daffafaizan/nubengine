      reward (PairLo; n=24); Paired no reward (PairNone; n=23); Unpaired, high reward (UnpHi; n=7);
      and Unpaired, low-reward (UnpLo; n=9). Each participant attends an orientation session,
      followed by four 4h conditioning sessions separated by at least 48h, and a 2h test session.
      During the initial orientation session, subjects practice the computer tasks together with
      the environmental stimuli to be paired during the conditioning sessions, and carry out a
      series of choices for the tasks and images (see below). All subjects receive methamphetamine
      (20 mg) on two conditioning sessions and placebo on the other two sessions, administered
      under double-blind conditions. Subjects differ in whether environmental stimuli are
      consistently paired with the drug administration. The three paired groups consistently
      receive drug and placebo in combination with one of the two sets of visual and auditory
      background stimuli (see below). The two unpaired groups receive each treatment in combination
      with one of the stimuli sets on one session, and the other on the other.

      During all four conditioning sessions, subjects perform a series of computer tasks. Depending
      on group assignment, subjects are able to earn high ( PairHi, UnpHi) or low monetary reward (
      PairLo, UnpLo), but this is not contingent on subjects' performance. Each run for each game
      begins with a credit to prevent a negative outcome early in the run. The PairNone group play
      the same games without monetary reward. The order of the three games and the background
      images used are randomized across subjects, but remain constant within subjects.

      Tasks are presented in the presence of the two distinctive compound stimuli consisting of a
      background screen visible behind the task presentation and accompanied by a corresponding
      sound. One set of stimuli depicts a summer beach view accompanied by the sound of ocean
      waves. The other depicts summer alpine scenery accompanied by birdsong.

      The primary outcome measure is the change in preference ratings for the study stimuli, from
      before to after conditioning. This is a behavioral study, designed to develop a novel
      procedure for future imaging studies.
