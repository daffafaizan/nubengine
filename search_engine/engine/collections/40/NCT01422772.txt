      participation in the clinical study. Subjects who signed the informed consent will receive
      all the screening tests within 21 days before surgery (Day 0). VM202RY will be injected into
      4 sites or 8 sites on the coronary artery where complete revascularization was not done since
      vascular anastomosis could not be performed due to the bad vascular condition during surgery.
      VM202RY will be administered to Group1 (0.5mg), Group 2 (1mg) and Group 3 (2mg) at different
      concentrations. Subjects will be scheduled to get inpatient treatment during the gene therapy
      period (7 days) and follow-up tests at Week 2, 4, 8, 12 and 24 based on surgery day (Day 0).
      Adverse events and concomitant drugs will be checked.
