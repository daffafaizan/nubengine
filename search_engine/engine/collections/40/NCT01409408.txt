      and mortality. Endothelial dysfunction and vascular rigidity are two pathophysiological
      mechanisms that may explain this relationship. Recent publications showed that both ACEi
      (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor) and ARB (angiotensin receptor blocker) were capable
      of improving vascular stiffness and endothelial function, and that these effects occurred
      despite blood pressure reduction. The major debate that persists is which drug to associate
      with ACEi or ARB to achieve blood pressure control in diabetic patients. Recent studies
      showed that even in patients under ACEi or ARB therapy there may be residual activity in the
      renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RASS). Direct renin inhibitors (DRI) are a new class of
      anti-hypertensive drugs that may complement the blockade of the RASS. Aliskiren was the first
      drug of this class that completed phase 3 studies and marketed in the 21th century. It's main
      advantage is that DRI may reduce angiotensin II and aldosterone synthesis without increasing
      renin levels. This study main objective is to assess if aliskiren is capable of enhancing
      vascular stiffness and endothelial function and compare theses effects to those obtained with
      a calcium channel blocker, amlodipine, in patients with diabetes mellitus type 2 and blood
      pressure not controlled by 100 mg per day of losartan. Vascular stiffness and endothelial
      function will be measured by: pulse wave velocity, augmentation index, brachial artery
      flow-mediated vasodilation, peripheral arterial tonometry (EndoPat). Another main objective
      is to compare plasma renin activity and concentration between those groups.
