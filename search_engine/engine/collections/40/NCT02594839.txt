      to new drugs, such as pirfenidone and nintedanib, there are many patients for whom these
      drugs are not available or poorly tolerated. In addition significant evidence of their
      effectiveness and safety is valid only for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. The transplantation
      of allogeneic stem cells is a promising direction in the modern medicine with the proven
      safety for different diseases. But the effectiveness of this therapy is still under research.
      We believe that in most severe cases of a rapidly progressive interstitial lung disease the
      transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells may be an effective technology due to their
      immunomodulatory properties.
