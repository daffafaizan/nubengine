      patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, plasma cell leukemia or B cell
      lymphoma will be given a relatively low dose. If tolerated, a second group will receive a
      higher dose. If tolerated by the second group, a third and then a fourth group will receive
      higher doses. Treatment-related adverse events (side effects), changes in vital signs,
      physical examination, and laboratory values will be monitored. Patients will receive twice
      weekly infusions for 6 weeks and then will be followed monthly for 6 months. A secondary
      purpose is to explore whether SNS01-T is an effective treatment for multiple myeloma, B cell
      lymphoma and plasma cell leukemia.
