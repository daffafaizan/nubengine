      duration, and intensity of anger episodes. According to the Integrative Cognitive Model (ICM)
      of anger, three cognitive processes jointly contribute to an individual's level of trait
      anger and reactive aggression: hostile attributions, ruminative attention, and effortful
      control processes. Specifically, individuals high in trait anger are more prone to interpret
      ambiguous situations as hostile; are more likely to ruminate about anger-related events; and
      have a more limited capacity to employ control processes when they become angry.

      One means of evaluating unconscious biases that has become increasingly popular is cognitive
      bias modification (CBM). CBM programs are computerized training paradigms, which aim to train
      more adaptive cognitive biases by repeatedly exposing participants to an experimental
      contingency between an emotional stimulus and a response.Previous researchers have begun to
      investigate the impact of CBMs targeting cognitive control and hostile attribution bias in
      relation to anger. However, these studies have been conducted exclusively in samples
      reporting low trait anger.

      This study will examine the effectiveness of a short-term interpretation bias modification
      program (CBM-I) on hostile attribution biases and reactive aggression in a sample of
      undergraduate students eporting high trait anger.
