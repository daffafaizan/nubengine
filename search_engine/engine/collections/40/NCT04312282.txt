    
      Cohort 1:

      Cohort 1 is a 2-period, 2-sequence, crossover study designed to assess the effect of food on
      the PK of tesetaxel and tesetaxel metabolites. Patients were randomized in a 1:2 ratio to
      receive tesetaxel on Day 1 of two 21-day cycles under fed and fasting conditions in one of
      two opposing sequences (Sequence 1A and Sequence 1B).

      Cohort 2:

      Cohort 2 is a 2-period, single-sequence, crossover study designed to assess the potential PK
      drug-drug interaction (DDI) of a strong CYP3A inhibitor (itraconazole) on tesetaxel and
      tesetaxel metabolites. Patients receive tesetaxel during Cycle 1 followed by a reduced dose
      of tesetaxel plus itraconazole during Cycle 2.

      Cohort 3:

      Cohort 3 is a 2-period, single-sequence, crossover study designed to assess the potential PK
      DDI of a strong CYP3A inducer (rifampin) on tesetaxel and tesetaxel metabolites. Patients
      receive tesetaxel during Cycle 1 followed by tesetaxel plus rifampin during Cycle 2.

      Patients in all cohorts also participate in a study designed to assess the effect of
      tesetaxel and tesetaxel metabolites on cardiac repolarization as measured by the change from
      baseline in the QTc interval over the first cycle of treatment. Patients who are tolerating
      and benefitting from treatment with tesetaxel have the opportunity to continue onto an
      optional treatment extension.
