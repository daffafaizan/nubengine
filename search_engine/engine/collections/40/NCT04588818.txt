      impairment due to ocular complications, severe drug adverse effects are disturbing. There is
      a high rate of chronic disorder of ocular inflammation and unresponsiveness of therapy drugs
      in pediatric uveitis, which result in structure destruction and functional impairment
      including band keratopathy, posterior synechiae, cataract, and so on. The systemic and
      topical glucocorticoid are advocated to control inflammation but carry a high risk of lots of
      advert events.

      Methotrexate is now highly recommended to control uveitis and most commonly prescribed in
      pediatric uveitis. it was benefit to prolong remission and reduce recurrence. However,
      despite early intervention 27-48% children do not achieve control of inflammation and 20%
      experience adverse events. Adalimumab, a fully human anti-tumor necrosis factor Î± monoclonal
      antibody, is effective in the treatment of many rheumatic diseases. ADA as the initial
      treatment in adult patients of uveitis lead to a more optimistic prognosis, a better visual
      acuity and a lower dose of dosage of daily glucocorticoid.

      The investigators propose to test the efficacy and safety of ADA plus MTX for the treatment
      in non-infectious pediatric panuveitis who were followed up for 1 year.
