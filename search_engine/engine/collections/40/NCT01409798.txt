      parathyroidectomy with intra-operative PTH assessment. The success of minimally invasive
      parathyroidectomy without and with intra-operative PTH will be assessed for each patient.
      Success for exploration without intra-operative PTH will be defined as directed exploration
      with detection of an abnormal parathyroid in the location suggested by imaging. Success with
      intra-operative PTH will be defined as per standard protocols (50% or > decrease in
      intra-operative PTH following excision).
