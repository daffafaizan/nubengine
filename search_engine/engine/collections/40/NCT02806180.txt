      department (ED). IV access is needed to deliver drugs, enable fluid resuscitation and sample
      blood, and delays in gaining access can lead to patient harm. Ultrasound (US) is a commonly
      used tool in the ED, and the utility of ultrasound in the placement of IVs in patients with
      difficult access has been well described. This study aims to further guide the use of this
      evidence based tool by ED Registered Nurses. The focus will be comparing single-operator
      technique, in which the same provider manipulates the ultrasound probe while simultaneously
      placing the IV, to a dual-operator technique whereby a second provider manipulates the probe.
      Any measured advantage has implications in guiding education and practice, as well as
      informing future ED policy.
