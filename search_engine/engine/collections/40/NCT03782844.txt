      efficacy of simple device of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) in the treatment of
      obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Methods: A randomized, cross-over and double blind study would
      be performed on 100 OSA patients using both simple CPAP and traditional CPAP during overnight
      polysomnography. Pressure for CPAP treatment would be manual titrated. The sleep apnea
      hypopnea index (AHI), arousal index (ArI), Oxygen desaturation Index (ODI), sleep structure
      and the preference of CPAP model were to be observed.
