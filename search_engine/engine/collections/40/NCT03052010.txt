      according to national guidelines, in staged fashion, stratified by region (a stepped wedge
      design). Monitoring and evaluation activities will identify implementation barriers and
      solutions, characterize costs, and provide best practices for further scale-up. A research
      component will establish prospective open cohorts of couples at each clinic (up to 200) to
      study how the program is effectively implemented. Follow-up in the cohorts will be for up to
      36 months at each care center and will evaluate impact, costs, and facilitators and barriers
      to implementation at patient, provider and health system levels.
