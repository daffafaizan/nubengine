    
      Patients 18-years and older with and without heart failure (across all left ventricular
      ejection fraction) will be enrolled in this single center, longitudinal observational
      Registry.

      Baseline and one-year follow up blood samples including DNA as well as clinical
      characteristics, events leading up to heart failure diagnosis, etiology of heart failure, the
      presence and duration of other medical problems, laboratory, echocardiographic data and
      images, and therapy information will be obtained.

      Clinical outcomes of interest include major adverse cardiovascular events (a combination of
      all-cause death and heart failure hospitalizations), individual endpoints of all-cause death,
      cardiovascular death, all-cause hospitalization, cardiovascular hospitalization, heart
      failure hospitalization, right-sided heart failure, and kidney injury.

      Results from the Preserved vs. Reduced Ejection Fraction Biomarker Registry and Precision
      Medicine Database for Ambulatory Heart Failure Patients (PREFER-HF) trial will
      comprehensively examine longitudinal clinical characteristics, proteomic, metabolomic,
      genomic and imaging data to better understand pathophysiology of heart failure and phenotypes
      in heart failure with an ultimate goal of improving precision medicine in heart failure.
