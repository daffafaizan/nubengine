           time, Electromyographic recording system is used to record the Masseter (MM) and
           Anterior Temporalis (TA) muscles' surface electromyographic (SEMG) in the two time
           points: before the treatment and 4-weeks follow-up after treatment.

           After recording, several parameters is taken to indicate the occlusal changes when
           researchers set the T-Scan occlusal parameters as 100% intercuspal position (ICP)
           maximum voluntary clenching (MVC), 75% ICP-MVC, 50% ICP-MVC, 25% ICP-MVC, and the number
           of occlusal contact and the values of the the Masseter (MM) and Anterior Temporalis (TA)
           muscles' surface electromyographic (SEMG) values is acquired by the software in the
           screen.

        2. Occlusal imprints which indicates the their occlusal relationships is made by
           researchers when the volunteers ICP clenching in the two time points: before the
           treatment and 4-weeks follow-up after treatment.

           Break-over and the sub-break-over point of the occlusal imprints is amplified by
           software. The investigators compute the number and area about that.

        3. The investigators also recorded frequency of attack and score of visual analogue scale
           (VAS), the dosage of drug, and short form-McGill-2 in the follow-ups time frame:
           immediately after the first treatment, 1-, 4-, 12- and 24-weeks after treatment.
