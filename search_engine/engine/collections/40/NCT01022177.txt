      causing reduction in retinal perfusion. Acupuncture is supposed to regulate the perfusion. We
      propose a study to evaluate the effect of acupuncture to the vascular auto regulation in
      patient with Diabetes, compared to healthy people without vascular or retinal diseases. The
      perfusion of the retinal vessel will be examined by Retinal vessel analyzer (RVA), Heidelberg
      retinal Flowmeter (HRF) and the Ocular blood Flowmeter (OBF) before, during and after
      standardized specific acupuncture at healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes.
