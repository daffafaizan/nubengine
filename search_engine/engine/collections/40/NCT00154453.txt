      advantage of the discarded soft tissue in the blepharoplasty surgery, samples of bilateral
      orbicularis oculi muscle can be easily obtained from patients of various ages. This study is
      designed to objectively evaluate the age-related changes in human orbicularis oculi muscle by
      analyzing the composition of isoforms of myosin heavy chain (MHC), which is the predominant
      protein in skeletal muscle. MHC isoforms exist in different types of muscle fibers, and
      determines the maximum contraction speed of the muscle fiber. Therefore, The composition of
      MHC isoforms represents the composition of different types of muscle fiber.

      These muscle specimens are stored with liquid nitrogen right after surgery. In the lab, the
      specimens are sectioned to 40Î¼m in thickness, and soaked in special buffer solution. After
      electrophoresis and staining, bands of different types of MHC can be visualized. The gel is
      scanned and processed with an image analysis system. The density of each band can be
      determined, and the ratio of the different types of MHC can be calculated.

      By dividing the subjects who had their orbicularis oculi muscle sampled during upper
      blepharoplasty operation into age groups of 20, 30, 40, 50, 60 and 70 years, these MHC
      subtypes composition ratios can be compared among the different groups. Therefore, the
      age-related changes of the composition of different muscle types can be concluded.
