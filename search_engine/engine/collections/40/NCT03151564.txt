      routine care. This CT scan will be done at the normal radiation dose.

      During this scan, you will also have a scan of the liver at a lower radiation dose, which is
      part of the research in this study. This will add about a minute to your normal scan time.

      Information will also be collected from your medical record.

      After your scan, your participation in this study will be over.
