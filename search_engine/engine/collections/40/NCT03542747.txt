      the proposed clinical trial the primary study objective will be to determine whether there is
      a difference in time to ventilation via endotracheal tube (seconds) for the novel iLTS-D
      compared to the LMA Fastrach. Time to Ventilation will be defined from when the tip of the
      extraglottic airway device passed the incisors to the point until confirmation the first
      chest rise of the high fidelity simulator (Laerdal SimMan). Additionally, two time points
      before final tracheal placement will evaluated: time to place the EGA and time to ventilate
      with the EGA after introducing the device into the oral cavity.
