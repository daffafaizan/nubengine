      asthma susceptibility is inherited; however, it is unknown if asthma severity is heritable.
      Studies suggest that levels of interleukin-16 (IL-16) may influence asthma severity. This
      study will examine the role of differences in the control region of the IL-16 gene in a
      racially diverse group of asthmatics and nonasthmatics and will determine if the IL-16 gene
      control region is related to asthma severity.

      Participants in this study will undergo lung function and blood tests; they will also
      complete a questionnaire about their respiratory health. Asthmatic participants will complete
      a severity-of-asthma questionnaire.
