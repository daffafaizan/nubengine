      anesthesia for almost all of the upper extremity surgeries, optimal volume and concentration
      of locak anesthetic to be administered is still a subject of debate. This prospective,
      randomized, double blind study aims to determine the optimal volume for adequate sensorial
      and motor blockade following an infraclavicular block. Patients will be randomly allocated
      into three groups. 81 patients (27 in each group) are planned to be enrolled in this study
      due to a power analysis performed (G-power ver 3.1). Using a constant dose of local
      anesthetics (45mg bupivacaine 180mg prilocaine), different volumes will be used in each of
      the groups (First group; 18mL, second group; 27mL, third group; 36mL). Onset, duration and
      quality of sensory and motor block will be compared for patients between groups Researchers
      who perform the block and assess the block quality and onset will be blinded to patients'
      groups. Patients will also be blinded to groups they are assigned.
