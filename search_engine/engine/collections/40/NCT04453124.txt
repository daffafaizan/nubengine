      areas of Papua New Guinea (PNG). Systematic treatment with topical antiseptics such as
      chlorhexidine cream in theory represents a viable treatment option, but in reality, effective
      treatment of cutaneous ulcers in Papua New Guinea is greatly hindered by the remote and
      highly inaccessible areas that affected communities often live in. In a search for more
      accessible treatment options, plant medicines used by different communities in Papua New
      Guinea have been tested to identified the sap of the tree, Ficus septica, as a promising
      antibacterial agent in vitro. The sap displays comparable activity to chlorhexidine in disc
      diffusion assays with gram-positive bacterial wound pathogens. It also appears to dampen the
      pro-inflammatory responses of neutrophils by down regulating interleukin-6 expression. The
      sap forms a flexible plastic-like wound covering which may help deter flies from feeding on
      the wounds, and unlike chlorhexidine cream, the Ficus tree is easy to find where affected
      communities live. For this reason, this study aims to perform an open label clinical trial
      using an interventional approach, to compare the effect of this antiseptic plant sap and of a
      standard topical antiseptic, on the rate of wound development prevention and bacterial
      growth. If shown to be effective, this readily available plant medicine can provide a
      zero-cost treatment option in remote areas of PNG.
