        -  Although radiation has been shown to improve outcomes in patients with glioblastoma
           (GBM), median survival remains poor. Even with the addition of temozolomide (TMZ) to
           surgical resection and radiotherapy, most GBMs will recur in field or adjacent to the
           high dose radiation volume.

        -  High rates of local failure indicate that GBM cells in situ are relatively
           radioresistant and that the effectiveness of GBM radiotherapy would benefit from
           additional radiosensitization.

        -  Selinexor has recently been shown to enhance the radiosensitivity of glioma cells both
           in vitro and in vivo.

      Objectives:

      -Assess the safety, tolerability, and maximum tolerated dose of selinexor when combined with
      temozolomide and radiotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma and gliosarcoma.

      Eligibility:

        -  Men and women greater than 18 years old

        -  Histologically confirmed newly diagnosed glioblastoma or gliosarcoma

        -  Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) greater than or equal to 70

        -  Patients who have not previously been treated with chemotherapy or radiation therapy

      Design:

        -  This is a Phase I trial to determine the safety and tolerability of selinexor in
           combination with external beam radiation therapy (RT) and temozolomide in patients with
           newly diagnosed glioblastoma or gliosarcoma using a "3 plus 3 design," and three dose
           escalation levels, with 3 patients per dose level (provided no DLT), a maximum of 21
           patients will be enrolled.

        -  Patients will be treated with external beam radiation therapy in a standard manner with
           temozolomide given daily during radiation. Selinexor will be administered once weekly
           concurrent with the RT/temozolomide.

        -  We anticipate accrual of 21 evaluable patients which will take approximately 2 years.
           The accrual ceiling has been set to 24 patients
