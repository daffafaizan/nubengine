      groups:

        -  PEP group: positive expiratory pressure breathing.

        -  CONTROL group: conventional CP treatment without positive pressure brething. The period
           between day 0 and 20 days post-trauma is considered an immediate phase of CT.

      Once admitted, an initial evaluation by the doctor will be performed, and pleuro-pulmonary
      complications, the presence of respiratory failure, and pain control will be evaluated. The
      chest physiotherapist will perform a clinical and secretion assessment using the Seva test
      and a dynamic costal examination. The medical treatment of pain control will begin, and the
      treatment of CP will begin, where it will be randomized in 2 groups: 1- PEP group: positive
      expiratory pressure breathing with the help of a PEP bottle device. 2-CONTROL group:
      conventional CP treatment without positive pressure breathing will be daily FR sessions, on
      weekdays. Upon admission, hospital discharge and post-discharge, radiological checks (simple
      radiography) will be performed and forced vital capacity will be measured with forced
      spirometry.
