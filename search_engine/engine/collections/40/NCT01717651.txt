      with a mechanical device helps prevent muscle loss and weakness. In this optional portion of
      the study, the subject would have a CPM (continuous passive motion) device attached to one of
      the subject's legs intermittently over the next three days. Without any effort from the
      subject , the machine would move the subjects leg back and forth (flexing at the hip and the
      knee) repeatedly.

      This machine is approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat
      patients after they have knee replacement surgery to help preserve the range of motion of the
      joint while minimizing risk of damage to the joint from more intensive exercise. The use of
      the device for this study is investigational.
