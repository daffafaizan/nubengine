    
      The primary objective of this study is to describe a possible effect of metronidazole on PK
      of budesonide in healthy volunteers.

      Secondary objectives:

        1. Effect of budesonide on metronidazole steady-state PK (primarily described as area under
           the concentration-time-curve).

        2. Urinary 6Î²-hydroxycortisol (being a marker of CYP3A activity) and cortisol excretion
           before and during metronidazole multiple-dose co-administration.

        3. Safety parameters.
