    
      The primary endpoints of this pilot trial will be the safety and feasibility of administering
      ipilimumab with Adoptive Cell Therapy (ACT) using TIL. The data analysis will mainly be
      descriptive. All study results will be preliminary and of exploratory in nature due to the
      pilot status and small sample size of the trial. Feasibility is defined as the ability to
      deliver at least 50% (i.e., two out of four) of the planned doses of ipilimumab and
      successfully treat at least 60% (i.e., â‰¥ 6/10) of the patients with TIL. All participants
      will be evaluable for toxicity from the time of their first protocol treatment. Toxicity will
      be reported by type and severity according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity
      Criteria (NCI CTC) version 4.
