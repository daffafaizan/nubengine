      antiretroviral agent such as ddC would help increase efficacy and tolerance. This study will
      examine the possible advantages of combination AZT/ddC therapy over monotherapy with AZT
      alone.

      Patients are stratified according to duration of ongoing AZT therapy and are randomized to
      receive AZT either alone or in combination with ddC. Patients receive therapy until the last
      patient enrolled completes 32 weeks of therapy. The study may be extended for two additional
      32-week periods on an optional basis.
