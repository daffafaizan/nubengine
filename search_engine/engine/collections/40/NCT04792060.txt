      Pronation-supination is a complex movement, combining the rotation of the radius around the
      ulna with a horizontal and axial translation. If the distal ulna fails to heal in the proper
      anatomical position maintaining its original length with significant residual angulation at
      the fracture site, and separation of the DRUJ in a transverse axis, then a more severe
      limitation of forearm motion
