      epidemic proportions globally and in the United States. More than 40% of patients with
      established heart failure (HF) have diabetes.

      This study will be the first trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of dapagliflozin
      treatment in preventing readmissions/ER visits/urgent clinic visits, and death in patients
      with and without T2D after admission for heart failure. Treatment with SGLT2-i has been shown
      to reduce both heart failure hospitalizations and mortality in patients with established
      heart disease. However, the time of initiation of SGLT2-i therapy has not been evaluated in
      patients with HF. In addition, the impact of treatment on HF symptoms quality of life,
      resource utilization, and cost-effectiveness of dapagliflozin versus placebo will be
      evaluated. The results of this study have great potential to impact and facilitate care and
      to change current clinical guidelines in the management of patients with heart failure.
