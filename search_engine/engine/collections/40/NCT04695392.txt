      (PICUs) are not healing milieus. Immediately upon admission to the PICU, the child's daily
      routine and sleep patterns are replaced by a well-intended but not patient-centered PICU
      routine. The interprofessional investigative team believes that PICU care and environments
      can be modulated to sustain a young child's circadian rhythm (CR) and support their
      physiological resilience and capacity to heal. The first step in this program of research is
      to pilot-test RESTORE resilience (R2), a 7-item individualized bundle that we hypothesize
      will restore CR in critically ill children using a pre-posttest design. Two separate PICUs
      will each enroll 10 baseline subjects followed by 20 intervention subjects, 6 months to 18
      years of age, who are intubated and mechanically ventilated for acute respiratory failure.
      Specifically, as soon as possible after PICU admission, parents will be interviewed to create
      an individualized chronotherapeutic bundle to include (1) focused effort to replicate the
      child's pre-hospitalization daily routine (bedtime/wake time, bedtime/arousal routine, nap
      time, feeding schedule, active periods), (2) cycled day-night lighting and modulation of
      sound to match the child's routine, (3) minimal yet effective sedation using a
      nurse-implemented goal-directed sedation plan (RESTORE), (4) night fasting with bolus enteral
      daytime feedings, (5) early, developmentally-appropriate, progressive exercise and mobility
      (PICU Up!), (6) continuity in nursing care, and (7) parent diaries. The overall objective of
      this study is to pilot-test an intervention that can be implemented in any PICU that will
      improve sleep-wake patterns with restoration/maintenance of circadian rhythms in critically
      ill children with acute respiratory failure. Results of this pilot study will be used to
      inform the design of an adequately powered multicenter randomized trial of R2.
