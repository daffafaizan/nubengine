    
      A randomized, double-blinded study in patients scheduled for surgical repair of foot
      fractures in spinal anaesthesia where two pain treatment modalities would be compared. One
      group receives sciatic nerve block with standardized dosis od bupivacaine under ultrasound
      visualisation, while the other group receives the same block but with simultaneous i.m.
      injection of tramadol (also standardized). Both the patient and the anaesthesist are blinded,
      i.e. the control group receives simultaneously with the block a 0,9% sodium hydrochloride
      injected. Drug or control syringes do not differ, and would be prepared directly before in a
      randomised, blinded manner by trained co-investigator. Both group receive also the same
      standardised systemic analgetics with no further use of tramadol.
