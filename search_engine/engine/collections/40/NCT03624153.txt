      movement, and game practices.

      Let's see the operation of the robot system by video. First, the passive movement. Patients
      could perform a movement of full hand, or thumb/second/middle finger together.

      Second, the active movement. There were three types of active movement, including full hand
      grasp/ release/ or grasp and release together.

      The researcher chose two out of three of the movements. Third, the game mode. There were
      several games to practice the active movement, including only distal part/ or distal plus
      proximal part together.

      In the Conventional group, participants receive conventional occupational therapy.

      The intervention was conducted 1.5 hour a day, 3 days a week for consecutive 4 weeks.
