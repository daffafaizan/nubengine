      of the same systematic review summary (Infographics, PLS). The content of these two formats
      is based on the same systematic review, but the ways of data presentation will differ: visual
      presentation in plain language and plain language only. The interventions will be delivered
      online in November 2016, with members of the consumers' groups for pregnancy and parenting -
      RODA ("Roditelji u akciji", engl."Parents in action"), which gathers different types of
      consumers: pregnant women, young mothers and parenting and pregnancy advisors; and the
      members of the Association for Patients' Rights. The trial will be voluntary and anonymous.
      The survey will consist of 5 parts, in the following order: 1) one format of the summary
      (randomly assigned), 2) health numeracy, 3) demographic data 4) comprehension test of the
      information given in the summary, and 5) user friendliness of information and overall
      satisfaction with the given summary assessed by survey.
