      non-probability sampling method where each participant meeting the study's inclusion and
      exclusion criteria is selected and enrolled in the study until the pre-set sample size is
      achieved.

      Thus, in the Orange study de novo kidney transplanted participants, who were on mycophenolate
      mofetil immunosuppressive combination therapy in routine clinical practice, were selected in
      a consecutive manner (a non-probability sampling method) if they met the inclusion/exclusion
      criteria until 128 participants were recruited to the study.
