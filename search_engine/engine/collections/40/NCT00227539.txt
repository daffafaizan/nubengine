      Primary

        -  Determine the effectiveness of fludeoxyglucose F 18 positron emission tomography in
           predicting radiological and pathological response in patients treated with pemetrexed
           disodium and cisplatin with or without surgery for stage IB-IIIB non-small cell lung
           cancer (NSCLC).

      Secondary

        -  Determine the safety of cisplatin and pemetrexed disodium in these patients.

        -  Determine the radiographic response rate, duration of response, and time to progression
           in patients treated with cisplatin and pemetrexed disodium.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

        -  Fludeoxyglucose F 18 (18FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) imaging: All patients
           undergo positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of the head, neck, thorax, abdomen,
           and pelvis. Patients receive fludeoxyglucose F 18 (^18FDG) IV followed by 45 minutes of
           rest. PET imaging is done over 1 hour and 8 minutes. Patients undergo PET imaging at
           three points during the study: 4 weeks prior to treatment, after the first cycle of
           treatment, and after 3 courses of chemotherapy. Some patients then undergo surgical
           resection of the tumor.

        -  Chemotherapy: Patients receive cisplatin IV over 30 minutes and pemetrexed disodium IV
           over 10 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days for up to 3 courses in the
           absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 35 patients will be accrued for this study.
