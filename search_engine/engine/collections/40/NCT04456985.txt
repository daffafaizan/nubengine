      purine and thymine, and is an important element of the nervous system. Vitamin B12
      participates in methyl conversion and folate metabolism in the body, promoting the conversion
      of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate. It has been reported that the lack of serum
      folic acid and B12 is associated with an increased risk of cognitive impairment. The
      explanation mechanism of the relationship between folic acid deficiency and cognitive
      dysfunction may be that folic acid deficiency leads to impaired central nervous system
      methylation, resulting in insufficient methyl synthesis of myelin sheaths, neurotransmitters,
      membrane phospholipids and deoxyribonucleic acid. Our previous studies showed that
      preoperative folic acid supplementation can alleviate myelin damage and cognitive impairment
      in young rats caused by sevoflurane anesthesia. Therefore, this study further explored the
      preoperative folic acid and coenzyme B12 supplementation for children's delirium and
      long-term neurobehavioral changes after general anesthesia.
