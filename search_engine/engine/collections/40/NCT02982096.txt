      The use of epidermal blister grafting by the CellutomeTM device in the treatment of
      superficial and mid-dermal burn wounds will demonstrate a difference in time to healing
      compared to burn wounds treated with standard acellular technique.

      Primary objective:

      Determine if the use of the CellutomeTM device will demonstrate a difference in healing time
      compared to standard acellular technique. Final cosmetic outcomes (as assessed by Vancouver
      Scar Scale (VSS), Patient Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS), erythema, pigmentation,
      elasticity, thickness, and sensation) will be assessed and described at 12 months ± 6 months
      post treatment.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  Determine if donor sites have any visible scarring with the use of the CellutomeTM.

        -  Determine acute outcomes of therapy such as time to healing as assessed by ≥90%
           epithelialization.

        -  Determine chronic outcomes of therapy (as assessed by Vancouver Scar Scale (VSS),
           Patient Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS), erythema, pigmentation, elasticity,
           thickness, and sensation).
