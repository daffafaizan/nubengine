    
      This was a multi-center, open label study to collect and assess long-term safety of
      everolimus in patients being treated in current Novartis-sponsored studies and who were
      benefiting from treatment with everolimus judged by the investigator.There was no screening
      period for this study. Eligible patients were consented and started their treatment with
      everolimus as soon as they entered the study. Patients had to return to the study center on a
      yearly basis (Â± 3 months), but for resupply of study medication, the frequency of the receipt
      and dispensing followed local practice (e.g., every 2 to 3 months). The dose of everolimus
      was based on the investigator's judgment.

      Adverse events (AEs) were collected continuously throughout the study. For the safe and
      effective use of everolimus, patient could return to the clinic at any given time following
      local practice. When AEs were observed, additional visits were arranged by investigator's
      discretion.

      Patients continued to be treated until they were no longer benefiting from everolimus as
      defined in the parent protocol (disease progression), developed unacceptable toxicities,
      withdrew consent, were non-compliant to the protocol, the investigator felt it is no longer
      in the patient's best interest to continue everolimus therapy or the patient died, whichever
      came first.

      A patient reached the end of study when everolimus treatment was permanently discontinued and
      the end of treatment visit had been performed. All patients were followed for AEs for 30 days
      after the last dose of everolimus.

      The study remained open for approximately 5 years; until such time that enrolled patients no
      longer needed treatment with everolimus, whichever came first.
