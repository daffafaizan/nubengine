    
      Aim 1 is to determine which CT protocol is most effective in reducing Pain Catastrophizing
      Scale (PCS) and Coping Strategies Questionnaire Catastrophizing Subscale (CSQ-CAT) scores in
      high-risk TKR candidates. CT will consist of four-to-eight weekly 1-hr individual cognitive
      therapy sessions prior to surgery.

      Aim 2 is to compare the most efficient treatment from Aim 1 with a control group to evaluate
      pain relief at 3 months.
