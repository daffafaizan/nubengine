    
      Single center, non-blinded, randomized controlled trial. Enrollment is based on â‰¥50 MME
      within 24 hours of admission, followed by a 24 hour screening/randomization window and a
      participation period extending through the acute hospitalization period.

      A total of 122 adult trauma patients will be randomized 1:1 across 2 study arms: adjunctive
      dronabinol or systemic analgesics only. Patients randomized to the dronabinol arm should
      receive their first dose within 12 hours of randomization, starting with 5mg BID and
      adjusting within the range of 2.5mg - 10mg BID. Patients randomized to dronabinol will also
      receive PRN as needed systemic analgesics for pain. Except for the analgesia protocol, all
      other interventions are performed in the context of everyday clinical practice, and thus will
      be equivalent for participants in both arms.

      The clinical effects of analgesia treatment arm will be evaluated during the acute
      hospitalization (hospital admission through discharge or death). The primary efficacy
      endpoint will be assessed starting at 48 hours after randomization and carried through to
      discharge.

      The primary trial objective is to evaluate the efficacy of adjunctive dronabinol versus no
      adjunctive dronabinol (systemic analgesics only) on reduction in opioids in adult patients
      with traumatic injury.

      The secondary trial objectives include: evaluation of the efficacy of dronabinol versus no
      dronabinol (systemic analgesics only) for pain numeric rating scale (NRS) scores, hospital
      length of stay, complications, and adverse effects associated with analgesia.
