      Likelihood of vaginal delivery depends on the degree of ripeness of cervix. Majority of women
      undergoing induction of labor are candidates for cervical ripening. Dilapan is an osmotic
      hygroscopic dilator of cervix commonly used for cervical preparation for mid trimester
      abortions. It has been proven safe for use for induction of Labor (IOL) at term. Misoprostol
      is a synthetic prostaglandin E1 analogue, widely used for cervical ripening and IOL in United
      States and is considered as standard of care.

      This is a non-inferiority, unblinded randomized, controlled trial where 322 eligible
      participants undergoing IOL at >37 weeks gestation and admitted to labor and delivery unit
      will be enrolled and randomly assigned in a ratio 1:1 to either receive Dilapan or
      Misoprostol for cervical ripening.

      After randomization all participants will undergo assessment as per standard of care.
      Participants will have either 1-5 Dilapan rods inserted into their cervix by the providers or
      receive 25 mcg of misoprostol orally every 2 hours to a maximum of 6 doses over 12 hours.
      Participants will be evaluated for artificial rupture of membranes and initiation of oxytocin
      for inducing uterine contraction. A diagnosis of failed IOL will be made if patient does not
      go into active labor within 24 hours after initiation of Oxytocin and Artificial Rupture Of
      Membranes (AROM). Intrapartum management will be according to institutional guidelines. All
      participants will be followed up and contacted by phone 2 weeks after discharge regarding
      their experience with the method of induction.
