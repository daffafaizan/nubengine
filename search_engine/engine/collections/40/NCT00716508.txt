      bone (knee cap). The quadriceps muscle (an important tight muscle) attaches to the patella
      bone and allows for extension and flexion of the leg. Rupture of the patella tendon occurs
      mainly in people under the age of 40 years old with an active lifestyle. Normally, surgical
      repair is needed to fix this injury. The widely accepted surgery for this injury consists in
      drilling 2 holes in the patella bone that are used to anchor the patella tendon in place.
      This surgery has some complications such as re-rupture of the tendon, breakage of the bone,
      etc. Some investigators have tried different techniques to avoid these complications with
      variable results. We want to use 2 anchors in the bone to avoid making holes in the patella
      bone, decreasing complications and surgical time, and hopefully, allowing for a better
      surgical repair. We will have 2 arms. One group will have the standard of care technique and
      the second group will have the anchors technique. We will follow up with our patients after
      the surgery to record their progress, and complications, if any. We will also have a
      standardized physical therapy program for consistency and to avoid any problems.
