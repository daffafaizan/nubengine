      I. Determine the 1-year survival rate in patients with locally advanced, unresectable
      adenocarcinoma of the pancreas treated with concurrent external beam radiotherapy,
      oxaliplatin, and fluorouracil followed by gemcitabine.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine overall survival, time to disease progression, and confirmed response rate in
      patients treated with this regimen.

      II. Determine toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients undergo radiotherapy once daily, 5 days a week, for 5.5 weeks. Beginning
      concurrently with radiotherapy, patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on days 1, 15,
      and 29 and fluorouracil IV continuously for 5.5 weeks. Beginning 4-6 weeks after the
      completion of chemoradiotherapy, patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1
      and 8. Treatment with gemcitabine repeats every 21 days for 4 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 1 year.
