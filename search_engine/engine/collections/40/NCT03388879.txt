      of the fibula) are a common injury. According to our fracture register 95 patients with
      closed tibia fractures were operated the last 3 years at our department. Fractures with
      moderate or no displacement can be successfully treated with a cast and subsequent Sarmiento
      brace. Displaced fractures are commonly treated with an intramedullary nail. Intramedullary
      nailing yields a high rate of union. More than 50 % of operated patients do, however, develop
      chronic anterior knee pain and one third of the patients have pain at rest. This contributes
      a big problem for many patients both at spare time and at work. Another problem is
      significant rates of malunion.

      The use of ring fixators utilizing rings and 1,8 mm. wires was introduced by Gavril Ilizarov
      more than 50 years ago, and the technique has been further developed through the introduction
      of six adjustable struts (Taylor Spatial Frame). This hexapod circular frame allows accurate
      reduction as well as a high stability. The ring fixator is less invasive and allows early
      weight bearing, but may be cumbersome to the patient. There is also concern about pin-tract
      infection, osteomyelitis and joint contracture.

      Only one prior study has compared ring fixator (Ilizarov) and intramedullar nail in closed
      tibia fractures. The results showed significant less anterior knee pain in the patients
      operated with ring fixator, but the study design did not allow clear conclusion.
