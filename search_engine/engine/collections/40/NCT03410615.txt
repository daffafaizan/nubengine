      during the initial treatment, (instead of cisplatin) and also afterwards as additional
      therapy. Durvalumab is an immunotherapy drug . It has been tested in many different types of
      cancers. Durvalumab works by allowing the immune system to detect the cancer and reactivate
      the immune response. This may help to slow down the growth of cancer or may cause cancer
      cells to die. Durvalumab has been shown to shrink tumours in animals. It has been studied in
      more than 5000 people, approved for use in other cancers and seems promising.

      This clinical trial will also test another type of immunotherapy drug called tremelimumab,
      which would also be given as additional treatment. Tremelimumab works in a different way to
      durvalumab to enhance the immune system reaction against cancer cells and may improve the
      effect of durvalumab. Tremelimumab may also help slow the growth of the cancer cells or may
      cause cancer cells to die. It has been shown to shrink tumours in animals. Tremelimumab has
      been studied in over 1200 people, approved for use in other cancers and seems promising.

      As of February 2019, tremelimumab will no longer be tested with new participants joining the
      study.
