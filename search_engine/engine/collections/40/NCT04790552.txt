      longevity continues to grow. The short-term fasting (e.g. 12 to 48 hours in duration)
      utilized in many intermittent fasting programs are considered safe, but some individuals may
      find them subjectively difficult. As such, the question of whether the benefits of fasting
      can be obtained while small amounts of food are consumed is of substantial interest.

      One commercially available product that is designed to be consumed during periods of
      intermittent fasting is the Fast Bar™, which stems out of the well-researched
      fasting-mimicking diet to assist prolonged fasting. The unique formulation of the Fast Bar™
      is hypothesized to minimize deviations in metabolic biomarkers associated with a fasting
      state. This may ease the burdens associated with extended period of fasting. The objective of
      this study is to evaluate the metabolic and subjective effects of Fast Bar, when consumed
      with coffee or tea, after a prolonged period of fasting.
