      characteristics of patients were selected. 75% of the data is used to build the model, and
      25% of the data is used to verify the validity of the model. Five classification models of
      one-dimensional convolution (CNN), naive Bayesian (NB), support vector machine (SVM), random
      forest (RF) and ensemble learning were constructed to identify and diagnose NSTEMI and UA
      patients. Multi-fold cross-validation and ROC-AUC curve are used to measure the advantages
      and disadvantages of the models.
