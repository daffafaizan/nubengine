      advanced or metastatic gastrointestinal leiomyosarcomas or other soft tissue sarcomas.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified by disease (gastrointestinal leiomyosarcomas vs other soft
      tissue sarcomas). Patients receive oral nitrocamptothecin daily on days 1-5. Treatment
      continues weekly in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Responding
      patients who undergo surgery then receive an additional 4-6 courses (4 weeks/course).

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 34-78 patients (17-39 per stratum) will be accrued for this
      study.
