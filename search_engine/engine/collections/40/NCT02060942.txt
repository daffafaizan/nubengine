      difficulties in terms of the fact that several hemodynamic parameters, for example mean
      arterial blood pressure (MAP) and cardiac output (CO) supply insufficient information about
      the circulating volume and cardiac performance. There is a clinical need to adequate
      determination of intravascular volume status and therefore reliable predictors of fluid
      responsiveness are highly relevant. However, in determining the fluid status of a patient,
      the lack of appreciation of the venous side of the circulation persists today, which is
      greatly due to the inability to appropriately assess the venous side of the circulation. The
      importance of the venous part of the circulation is moreover reflected by the fact that an
      increase in venous resistance does reduce CO many times more than a similar increase in
      arterial resistance. Mean systemic filling pressure (Pms), which is defined as the pressure
      equal to the pressure which would be measured if the heart should suddenly stop pumping and
      all (arterial and venous) the pressures in the entire circulatory system should be brought to
      equilibrium instantaneously, is a good, complete and reliable reflection of the total
      intravascular fluid compartment. Passive leg raising (PLR) represents a "self-volume
      challenge" that predicts preload responsiveness and the transient hemodynamic changes on
      venous return can be directly monitored in ventilated patients, provided that there is an
      intact circulation, in order to test the amount of volume responsiveness.
