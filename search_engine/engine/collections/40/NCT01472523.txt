      validation of the IONA non-invasive prenatal screening test for Downs, Edwards and Patau
      syndrome. The IONA Test was CE marked Feb 2013. We are now recruiting a further 800
      participants to provide blood samples to further develop and verify the test for other
      chromosomal abnormalities and to improve test efficiency.
