      consisting of six modules. The themes include introduction, psychological detachment,
      distancing, mastery, control, and keeping the change alive. These themes were chosen after
      considering topics that might be the most useful for healthcare staff experiencing high
      levels of stress. Each module consists of psychoeducation and exercise parts. Psychologist
      provide individual feedback on completed exercises as well as can be reached on demand.

      The effect of the intervention will be compared against a waiting list control group.
      Intervention is in Lithuanian.
