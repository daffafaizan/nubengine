    
      This is an open label (all people know the identity of the intervention.), multicenter (study
      conducted at multiple sites), observational study (individuals are observed for certain
      outcomes) of darunavir and etravirine in patients infected with HIV-1 who are naïve to these
      medications and who have experienced tolerability issues on their current or prior
      combination antiretroviral therapy (medicines used for treatment of HIV). PREZISTA is
      indicated for naïve HIV patients (someone who has never used HIV drugs) and
      treatment-experienced HIV patients and INTELENCE is indicated for treatment-experienced
      patients who have failed prior therapy and have HIV-1 strains resistant to multiple
      antiretroviral agents (HIV-1 strains are able to survive the exposure of the multiple
      antiretroviral agents), including Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NNRTIs).
      In this study patients will receive either darunavir (PREZISTA) or etravirine (INTELENCE) and
      physician selected optimized background agents (other antiretroviral medicines), as permitted
      by the local formulary and supported by the current Canadian Product Monograph. 90 patients
      will participate in this study (75 Patients planned for the darunavir group and 15 patients
      planned for the etravirine group). The total duration of the study will be 24 weeks. Safety
      and tolerability will be evaluated at screening (14 days prior to Day 1), baseline (patient's
      medical status before any treatment or research is done) at Day 1, Week 4, Week 12 and Week
      24. Tolerability will be evaluated using HIV Symptom Distress Module (HIV-SDM) also referred
      to as the HIV Symptom Index (HSI) which is a self-completed questionnaire to evaluate
      symptoms and measure the presence and bothersomeness of side effects commonly seen with HIV
      and antiretroviral treatment over the last 4 weeks (20 questions about all symptoms which the
      patient might have had during the past four weeks). Higher scores indicate the presence of
      more symptoms and/or a greater degree of distress related to the 20 symptoms. In HIV-SDM data
      is collected to see the benefit of switching to either darunavir or etravirine.
