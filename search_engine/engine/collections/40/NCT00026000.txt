      in patients with tic disorders including Tourette's Syndrome and Chronic Motor or Vocal Tic
      Disorder. Previous studies have been done looking at brain activity during tics using
      electroencephalography (EEG) and positron emission tomography (PET). 16 adult patients with
      DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association 2000) diagnosis of a tic disorder and frequent
      tics will be studied. We will utilize blood oxygenation level dependent functional magnetic
      resonance imaging (BOLD fMRI) on patients with tics while they are experiencing spontaneous
      tics and while they are voluntarily imitating those tics. The differential activation between
      the tics and the voluntary movements may shed light on the regions of the brain responsible
      for generation of tics.
