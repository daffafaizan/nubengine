        -  Test the hypothesis that the clinical decision support system will improve the rate at
           which physicians assist their patients with smoking cessation by providing information
           and recommendations on smoking cessation resources.

        -  Assess whether exposure to information and recommendations facilitated by the smoking
           cessation-personal digital assistant (SC-PDA) will increase the rate at which patients
           make at least 1 attempt to quit smoking in the month following the physician visit.

        -  Assess whether exposure to information and recommendations facilitated by the SC-PDA
           will increase the reported use of counseling and pharmacotherapy during those attempts
           over that observed with a smoking status identification system alone.

        -  Evaluate the acceptance of the SC-PDA into the workflow of ambulatory care clinics.

      OUTLINE: In weeks 1-12, physicians have access to a smoking status identification system
      (SSID) that reminds the physician the smoking status of the patient they are evaluating. In
      weeks 6-12, physicians have access to a computerized smoking cessation clinical decision
      support system using a hand-held personal digital assistant (SC-PDA) that they can use in the
      exam room with their patients who smoke. The SC-PDA system assists physicians in recommending
      and prescribing approved pharmacotherapy; facilitates referral of patients to local
      counseling resources; prints a tailored handout for a patient listing specific
      recommendations, instructions, and cessation resources; and generates the necessary
      documentation to support billing for this intervention.

      Patients who visit their physician in weeks 2-6 or weeks 8-12 complete a survey after their
      clinic visit and undergo a telephone interview 1 month later. Physicians undergo interviews
      and focus groups are conducted with clinic staff in weeks 12-16.
