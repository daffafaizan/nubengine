      To compare the efficacy of gabapentin/B-complex versus pregabalin administered for 12 weeks
      in the treatment of pain in mild to moderate diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) of acute or
      chronic presentation.

      Secondary Objectives:

      To determine the safety and tolerability of gabapentin/B-complex versus pregabalin
      administered for 12 weeks in the treatment of pain in mild to moderate DPN of acute or
      chronic presentation.

      Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive gabapentin/B-complex or pregabalin.

      The duration of treatment per subject will be 12 weeks.
