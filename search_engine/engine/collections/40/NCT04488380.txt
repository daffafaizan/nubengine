    
      Occlusal carious lesions on the right and left mandibular second molars of 56 patients (26
      females, 30 males) were restored in a split-mouth design. A high-viscosity glass ionomer
      (Hv-GIC) (Equia, GC) was used to restore the carious lesions in patients in the treatment
      group, while a nano-hybrid composite resin (GSO) (GrandioSO, Voco) was used for patients in
      the control group. Clinical evaluations of the restorations were performed at 1-week,
      6-month, 1-year, and 2-year follow-up appointments, according to the FDI criteria. Data were
      analysed using the Friedman's analysis of variance and Mann-Whitney U tests (Î±=0.05).
