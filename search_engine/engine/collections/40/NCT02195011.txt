      however, elimination of disease remains a challenge once spread to the liver.
      Radioembolization using SIR-SpheresÂ® microspheres (SIR-Spheres) to treat liver-only or
      liver-dominant metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) has been successful in this refractory
      setting. In this open-label study we will compare the safety of two treatment cohorts in
      which radioembolization will be administered using the device SIR-Spheres microspheres (90Y
      resin microspheres) in combination with regorafenib to patients with mCRC with liver
      metastases. The two treatment cohorts will be evaluated for safety, overall response (OR),
      progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS).
