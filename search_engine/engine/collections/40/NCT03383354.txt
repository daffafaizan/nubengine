      administrative data (based at ICES) and clinical sleep data from the Sunnybrook Health
      Sciences Centre Sleep Laboratory.

      ICES holds an individual-level, longitudinal, coded, linkable and secure and privacy
      protected health databases on most publicly funded health services for the Ontario population
      eligible for universal health coverage since 1991
      (http://www.ices.on.ca/Data-and-Privacy/ICES-data). The records in ICES data include
      information on physician claims submitted to the Ontario Health Insurance Plan, discharge
      summaries of emergency department visits and hospital stays and for those 65 years and older
      medical drug claims to the Ontario Drug Benefit Program. These databases will be linked using
      unique encoded identifiers and analysed at ICES.

      In Ontario, details on physician and hospital services are captured in several health
      administrative databases; of these databases, the investigators plan to use the following
      datasets among others: (i) the Ontario Health Insurance Plan (OHIP) physician services
      database; (ii) the Canadian Institute for Health Information Discharge Abstract Database;
      (iii) the Ontario Registered Persons Database; (iv) Ontario Registrar General - Death (Vital
      Stats); and (v) the Ontario Stroke Registry.

      ICES is a prescribed entity under section 45 of Ontario's Personal Health Information
      Protection Act (PHIPA). Section 45 is the provision that enables analysis and compilation of
      statistical information related to the management, evaluation and monitoring of, allocation
      of resources to, and planning for the health system. Section 45 authorizes health information
      custodians to disclose personal health information to a prescribed entity, like ICES, without
      consent for such purposes.
