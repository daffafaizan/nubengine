      Primary

        -  To evaluate the response rate to sunitinib malate with vs without gemcitabine
           hydrochloride in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma with sarcomatoid features.

      Secondary

        -  To evaluate progression-free survival of these patients.

        -  To evaluate overall survival of these patients.

        -  To describe the toxic effects of both sunitinib malate alone and in combination with
           gemcitabine hydrochloride in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to risk (good risk
      [clear cell and < 20% sarcomatoid and performance status (PS) 0] vs intermediate risk [20-50%
      sarcomatoid and PS 0] vs poor risk [non-clear cell or > 50% sarcomatoid or PS 1 or non-clear
      cell]). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm A: Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, 22,
           and 29 and oral sunitinib malate once daily on days 1-14 and 22-35.

        -  Arm B: Patients receive oral sunitinib malate once daily on days 1-14 and 22-35.

      In both arms, courses repeat every 42 days for up to 1 year in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for 1 year.

      ACTUAL ACCRUAL: A total of 87 patients (47 in arm A and 40 in arm B) were accrued to this
      study.
