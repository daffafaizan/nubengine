    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the progression-free survival hazard ratio of the combination of oral
      everolimus (RAD001) and bevacizumab compared to oral placebo and bevacizumab in patients with
      persistent or recurrent ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the nature and degree of toxicity of oral everolimus (or placebo) plus
      bevacizumab.

      II. To characterize and compare progression-free survival and overall survival in patients
      with measurable disease (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] criteria) and
      patients with detectable (non-measurable) disease.

      III. To estimate the proportion of patients with measurable disease who have objective tumor
      responses by treatment.

      IV. To provide descriptive information about cancer antigen (CA)-125 responses by regimen and
      where possible by objective tumor responses.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive bevacizumab intravenously (IV) over 30-90 minutes on days 1 and 15
      and everolimus orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28.

      ARM II: Patients receive bevacizumab as in Arm I and placebo PO QD on days 1-28.

      In both arms, courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for 3 years.
