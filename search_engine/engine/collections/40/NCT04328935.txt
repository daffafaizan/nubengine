      non-inferior to a gold standard CBT treatment. In comparison to other trauma-focused CBT
      protocols, WET generally demands less therapist-time, and specifically, less than half
      compared to CBT that consists of 12 weekly sessions รก 60 minutes. The aim of this study is to
      translate and replicate these results in a Swedish context. This first step is a small
      feasibility trial which will guide a subsequent large-scale trial.
