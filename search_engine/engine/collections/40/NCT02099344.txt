    
      Approximately 50 eligible patients with End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) requiring hemodialysis
      will be randomized to receive one of these two grafts as part of their standard care.
      Patients will be assessed at 2-3 weeks post-operatively and again at 6 and 12 months for flow
      characteristics, dialysis adequacy and graft associated complications such as stenosis,
      infection and thrombosis. Data on urea reduction ratio (URR), kinetic modeling (Kt/V), and
      access flow (QB) will be collected at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months via phone call to the
      hemodialysis center in order to evaluate patency and function.

      Access complications (stenosis, thrombosis, infection) will be treated per our standard
      protocol. These data will be recorded and then primary, assisted primary and secondary
      patency rates will be calculated and the graft arms compared using life table analysis.
