      Control-IQ Technology) or to standard of care where the children will continue to use his or
      her personal insulin pump or multiple daily injections. Both groups will use a continuous
      glucose monitor (CGM) throughout the study. The study system will also use a study insulin
      pump and a software algorithm to automatically give insulin and control blood glucose. This
      system is also sometimes called a "closed-loop" system.

      This study will take about 6-7 months for the child to complete. Study visits can be
      completed from home via videoconference (e.g. Zoom) without visiting the clinic or in-person
      at the clinic.
