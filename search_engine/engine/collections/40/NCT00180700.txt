    
      Hypothesis: This investigation is based upon the hypothesis that psychological intervention
      may counteract the detrimental effects of stress both on psychological well-being and on
      general health.

      Background: HIV infection may be considered to be a life-long biological and psychological
      stressor leading to detrimental outcomes associated with disease progression. Stress
      reduction in these patients may have beneficial effects through delaying disease progression
      via the proposed interactive psycho-neuro-endocrine-immune network.

      Inclusion Criteria:

      HIV infected individuals CD4 T-cell counts above 200 cells/mcl Receiving no anti-retroviral
      drugs Individuals who signed the informed consent form

      Investigative approach: Self-hypnosis and a Japanese non-touching, laying-on-of hands-like
      technique, called Johrei, were used to investigate the effects of psychological intervention
      upon immune parameters (especially in CD4 counts) associated with disease progression along
      with phenomenological associations between stress perception and stress hormone levels in
      HIV-infected patients receiving no medication.
