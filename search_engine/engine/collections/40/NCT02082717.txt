    
      The specific aim of the study is:

      Aim 1: To compare patient outcomes (phlebitis, pain at peripheral IV insertion site,
      frequency of changing IV access, and time for administration) between the experimental (4%
      sodium bicarbonate additive during peripheral intravenous potassium chloride replacement
      therapy) and control (standard of practice of no 4% sodium bicarbonate additive during
      peripheral intravenous potassium chloride replacement therapy) groups.

      Aim 2: To compare number and type of nursing interventions done during peripheral intravenous
      potassium chloride replacement therapy between the experimental (4% sodium bicarbonate
      additive during peripheral intravenous potassium chloride replacement therapy) and control
      (standard of practice of no 4% sodium bicarbonate additive during peripheral intravenous
      potassium chloride replacement therapy) groups.

      Aim 3: To compare attrition rates and reasons between the experimental (4% sodium bicarbonate
      additive during peripheral intravenous potassium chloride replacement therapy) and control
      (standard of practice of no 4% sodium bicarbonate additive during peripheral intravenous
      potassium chloride replacement therapy) groups.
