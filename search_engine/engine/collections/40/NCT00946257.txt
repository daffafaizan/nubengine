    
      Otelixizumab is a humanized, aglycosyl, non-mitogenic, anti CD3 monoclonal antibody (MAb)
      directed against the Îµ domain of the human lymphocyte antigen CD3, which is currently
      undergoing phase III clinical trials in adult new-onset type I diabetes mellitus patients and
      has been evaluated in rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis patients in small exploratory
      studies. In previous studies, otelixizumab has been administered by intravenous infusion.
      This study is a randomised, single-blind, placebo-controlled, study of otelixizumab
      administered subcutaneously in Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) subjects.

      The assessment of otelixizumab in T1DM subjects will provide safety, tolerability,
      pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic information following subcutaneous administration which
      will enable the identification of appropriate safe and well-tolerated subcutaneous dosage
      regimens to be used in subsequent clinical studies. This study will consist of a screening
      phase, followed by an in-house phase whereby otelixizumab will be administered to cohorts
      that will be staggered at each dose level. Approximately 6 dose levels, covering up to a
      10-fold dose range, will be evaluated. A single subcutaneous dose of otelixizumab will be
      administered on Day 1 and, serial blood samples will be obtained for clinical laboratory
      testing, determination of pharmacodynamic markers, serum otelixizumab PK parameters, and
      immunogenicity. Safety and pharmacodynamic data from the previous dose(s) will be evaluated
      prior to dose escalation or modification to ensure safety and to achieve target systemic
      peripheral blood pharmacology. Adverse events, laboratory values, vital signs and ECG's will
      be monitored closely during this study. All subjects in the study will undergo long-term
      follow-up out to 48 months to monitor and ensure patient safety.
