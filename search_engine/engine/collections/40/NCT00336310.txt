      in comparison to Novonorm速 for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus patients. Mentally
      competent patients with age of 30 to 75 years old in Taiwan of either sex with type 2
      diabetes mellitus will be included. All eligible subjects will be randomized into treatment
      groups in 1:1 ratio. The treatment will consist of either X速 or Novonorm速 tid before meal for
      12 weeks of treatment. The primary endpoints include the net change of HbA!c, fasting plasma
      glucose(FPG)and postprandial plasma glucose(PPG)at the end of 12th week evaluation compared
      to the baseline visit. Also, safety profiles including adverse event (such as hypoglycemia)
      incidences, blood pressure, liver, kidney function test will be monitored.
