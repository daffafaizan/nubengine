      3-7% and by ultrasound (US) in about 50% of the general population. The majority of thyroid
      nodules are benign and asymptomatic. The main management of benign thyroid nodules is
      observation and follow-up; however, a minority of them (10-15%) increase in size over time
      and may induce symptoms or cosmetic issues. Surgical excision has been established as a
      treatment for symptomatic benign thyroid nodules. thyroidectomy for benign thyroid disease
      continues to remain controversial, as there are many conflicting data published in the
      literature regarding the risk of hypothyroidism and recurrent laryngeal nerve injury
      stratified to indications for surgery, extent of thyroid resection and surgical volume .It
      carries a 2-10% risk of complications and neck scarring .Thyroid surgery is also costly and
      may not be appropriate for patients who have a high risk of surgical morbidity.Therefore,
      image-guided nonsurgical procedures such as ethanol ablation (EA) and thermal ablation have
      been proposed as alternative and less invasive approaches for the management of benign
      symptomatic thyroid nodules .These so-called thermoablative methods induce local
      thermodestruction, leading to nodule shrinkage and improvement of local symptoms. Monopolar
      radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and EA is widely used as a nonsurgical treatment usually for
      cystic (i.e., pure cyst) or predominantly cystic benign thyroid nodules (i.e., cystic portion
      > 50%). There is another method called US-guided percutaneous laser ablation (PLA) is a safe
      and effective therapeutic option as an alternative to surgery for benign symptomatic nodules
