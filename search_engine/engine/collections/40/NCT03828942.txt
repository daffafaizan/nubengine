      responsible of a wide range of hematological side effects. Those are poorly described, due to
      the modification of the pharmacopeia, and the recent recognition of several of these adverse
      events. This study investigates the main characteristics of patients affected by rare
      hematological side effects imputed to drugs. A causality assessment according to the WHO-UMC
      (World Health Organization - Uppsala Monitoring Center) is systematically applied.
