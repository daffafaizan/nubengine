      neurological and functional effects of ischemic cerebral infarction, the first ischemic
      stroke (diagnosed within 1 year through brain MRI / CT) patients will be randomly assigned to
      intermittent fasting group or control group. In both groups, physical therapy, occupational
      therapy and speech therapy will be provided during 3 hours in total a day. The intermittent
      fasting group should maintain intermittent fasting for no less than 12 hours or more every
      day during the rehabilitation period (at least 1 week), and the control group is able to eat
      all of the hospital meals and all the participants want without any time limit. The efficacy
      of intermittent fasting is to be verified by performing the electro-physiological tests and
      functional evaluations before participation, 1st week, 2nd weeks after participation, before
      discharge, 3 months, and 6 months after the stroke onset.
