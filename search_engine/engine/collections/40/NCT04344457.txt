      that the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is both highly contagious (estimated reproductive
      rate, 2-3) and five to fifty-fold more lethal than seasonal influenza (estimated mortality
      rate, 0.5-5%); therefore, interventions to decrease the incidence and severity of COVID-19
      are emergently needed. In Maricopa County there has yet to be a clinical trial to evaluate
      people who are SARS-CoV-2 positive with mild symptoms. This study will measure the
      improvement of COVID-19 disease status as measured by time (days) required from initiation of
      treatment to improvement of clinical status from mild to symptom free on 14 days of a
      cocktail therapy of Hydroxychloroquine, Indomethacin and Zithromax.
