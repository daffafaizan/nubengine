      of 65 pregnant women and newborns (intervention=32, control=33) who applied for delivery at
      Ege University Medical Hospital Gynecology and Obstetrics Clinic at the time of the study. In
      this study, "Descriptive Data Form of Impact of Umbilical Cord Clamping Time on Infant
      Anemia" was used as a data collection tool. In the intervention group waited 60 seconds for
      umbilical cord clamping in the second stage of labor, in the control group the umbilical cord
      was clamped in the first 15 seconds. For the data of the first stage of the study, the
      neonatal hematocrit and bilirubin measurements and the need for phototherapy due to
      hyperbilirubinemia were evaluated 48 hours after birth. In the second stage of the study,
      data on anaemia screening performed in family medicine at the end of the fourth month of
      birth were examined. Statistical analysis of the data from the study was performed using IBM
      SPSS Statistics 25.0 package program. Parametric tests were used for statistical analysis of
      the data with a normal distribution. The level of statistical significance was determined as
      p<0.05.
