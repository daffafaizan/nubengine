      as Diffuse Optical Spectroscopy Imaging in predicting the success of chemotherapy treatment
      (shrinkage of tumor).

      Diffuse optical spectroscopic imaging measurements are made with a laser breast scanner. This
      bedside-capable system combines frequency-domain photon migration with steady-state tissue
      spectroscopy to measure complete(broadband) near-infrared absorption and reduced scattering
      spectra of breast tissue in vivo. Diffuse Optical Spectroscopy Imaging measurements are made
      by placing the hand-held probe on the tissue surface and moving the probe to discrete
      locations along a grid pattern at 1.0 cm intervals. The portable high-bandwidth
      Frequency-Domain Photon Migration instrument employs intensity-modulated diode lasers and
      conventional steady-state lamps as sources and an avalanche photodiode as the detector. The
      time required to perform an Frequency-Domain Photon Migration measurement depends on the
      desired precision and number of sweeps.
