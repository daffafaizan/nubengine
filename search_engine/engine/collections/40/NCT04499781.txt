    
      To achieve these aims, a longitudinal (12 and 24- week study outcomes), two-group, randomized
      control trial (RCT) is proposed in a sample population of 120 perinatally and behaviorally,
      HIV-infected youth (ages 18-29 years). Participants in the intervention condition will use
      videoconferencing to connect synchronously with trained HIV+ peer health coaches who will
      deliver eight weekly, 60-minute cognitive behavioral47-50 motivational18 sessions for
      improved ART adherence. Participants in the control will connect asynchronously to a
      web-based HIV ART adherence education condition.

      Study participants will access the intervention and control conditions outside of the
      clinical setting using study funded smart phones. Self-reported adherence and viral load
      (extracted from the medical records) of study participants will be measured, and uploaded to
      RedCAP. ART knowledge, adherence self-efficacy, HIV stigma, social support, psychological
      distress, and substance use will be measured using survey measures. Statistical analyses will
      be computed to assess the potential impact of ACCESS on adherence and HIV viral suppression,
      and will also be computed to assess changes in ART knowledge, adherence self-efficacy, HIV
      stigma, social support, psychological distress, and substance use among participants in both
      the intervention and control conditions.
