    
      Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) is a new non-invasive imaging technique that
      employs motion contrast imaging to high-resolution volumetric blood flow information. OCTA
      compares the decorrelation signal between sequential OCT b-scans taken at precisely the same
      cross-section in order to construct a map of blood flow. At present, level 1 evidence of the
      technology's clinical applications doesn't exist. The investigators plan to compare OCTA as
      an imaging modality to conventional imaging modalities used in clinical routine.
