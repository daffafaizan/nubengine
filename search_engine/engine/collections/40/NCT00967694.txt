    
      An initial pre-anesthetic evaluation and physical examination will be performed by an
      attending anesthesiologist, and an eye exam will be performed by an attending ophthalmologist
      to determine suitability for inclusion according to the above criteria. Ideally the eye exam
      will take place immediately prior to conduction of the study. However, logistical restraints
      may require that the eye exam take place at a separate time/date prior to conduction of the
      study. IOPs will be measured by the attending ophthalmologist (B.E.) who will be blinded to
      the actual readings of the Tonopen by means of a small screen, and a single trained observer
      (E.F.) will record observations from the Tonopen. The nitrous oxide sedation will be managed
      by the attending anesthesiologist (K.L.). All patients will be monitored throughout using
      standardized monitoring (continuous EKG, non-invasive BP, and continuous pulse oximetry).
