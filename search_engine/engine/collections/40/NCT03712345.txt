      systemic v anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV), a
      potentially life-threatening disease.

      GPA is a necrotizing vasculitis predominantly involving small- to medium-sized vessels (e.g.,
      capillaries, venules, arterioles, arteries, and veins). MPA is a necrotizing vasculitis that
      primarily affects capillaries, venules, or arterioles, most commonly manifesting as
      necrotizing glomerulonephritis and/or pulmonary capillaritis. MPA.

      Primed neutrophils are activated by ANCA and generate C5a that engages C5a receptors on
      neutrophils. Therefore, patients with ANCA-related disease have elevated plasma and urine
      levels of C5a in active disease and not in remission.

      IFX-1 is a monoclonal antibody specifically binding to the soluble human complement split
      product C5a and the resulting nearly complete blockade of C5a-induced biological effects may
      be effective in the treatment of subjects with AAV.
