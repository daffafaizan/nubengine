      old who were cared for at UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital Oakland (UCSFBCHO) presenting to
      the emergency department for VOC were enrolled in the study. Patients were compared to
      themselves in a time series, pre and post exposure to the study intervention (low-dose
      ketamine bolus at 0.2 mg/kg x 1 prior to second dose of IV opiate). The pediatric FACES pain
      scale was used to measure pain scales at pre-designated time points in the ED per standard
      nursing protocol (FACES for younger kids, visual analog scale in adolescents/young adults).
      Opiate usage was summed in the ED, converted to mg/kg/hour of morphine equivalents (since
      different opioids agents were given to different patients based on individual historical
      efficacy, and since length of stay in the emergency room could affect total morphine
      equivalents received), and compared between the pre and post-intervention groups. In
      addition, length of stay, time to 50% pain control, presentation and discharge pain scores,
      and likelihood of discharge from the ED were compared. Data was be collected via chart review
      in the UCSFBCHO system by study investigators. Pre-intervention data from the past three
      patient encounters (e.g., the mean of the mg/kg/hour of morphine equivalents used in the last
      three patient encounters prior to receipt of ketamine) was compared to the post intervention
      data. In addition, a survey, which is attached, was given to patients/families at the time of
      the drug administration to attempt to discern if patients subjectively experienced
      improvement in their pain and if they experienced any negative side effects due to the drug
      administration. Monitoring for adverse events was recorded for each patient encounter.
