      calisthenics (jumping jacks, short relays, rapid punches) and light (no greater than 5
      pounds) weight lifting. The patients who do not receive the exercise program will be allowed
      to do what they would normally do during their neoadjuvant chemotherapy. They are allowed to
      engage in their own exercise regimens and diet modifications.

      Subjects will receive the chemotherapy as directed by their physicians, and then undergo
      surgery as planned. Randomization will occur by drawing cards entitled "exercise" or
      "control" from an envelope and then assigning the patient to this group.
