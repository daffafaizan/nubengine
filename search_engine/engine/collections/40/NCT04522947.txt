      reward sensitivity and poor food regulation - hold particular promise. However, relatively
      little is known about the modifiable factors that contribute to these neural vulnerabilities,
      thus precluding the development of potentially powerful interventions to promote healthy
      long-term weight trajectories. Further, the limited research in this area lacks critical
      developmental and environmental context. The current proposal addresses these gaps by
      examining the roles of selected modifiable cognitive (executive control), behavioral (diet,
      sleep), affective (negative affect), and environmental (obesogenic environment) factors
      throughout childhood and adolescence in predicting emerging neural vulnerabilities for
      obesity during the pivotal transition to young adulthood. The specific aims are to: 1)
      Determine the impact of executive control development across childhood and adolescence on
      food reward sensitivity and regulation in young adulthood; 2) Determine the impact of a set
      of behavioral and affective factors in adolescence (i.e., diet, sleep, negative affect) on
      food reward sensitivity and regulation in young adulthood; and 3) Explore the impact of the
      obesogenic environment encountered in adolescence on food reward sensitivity and regulation
      in young adulthood.
