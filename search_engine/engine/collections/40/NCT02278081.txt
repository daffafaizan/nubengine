      will be randomized to receive either antireflux medication lansoprazole (prevacid) and
      mometasone furonate (nasonex) or only nasonex and placebo. The diagnosis of nasal obstruction
      will be made by history and physical examination.

      The study will take place at Montreal children's hospital. After the patients or parents of
      the patients agree for their children to take part in the study and sign a consent/assent
      form, baseline information will be collected and the patients will asked to fill out three
      questionnaires for GERD symptoms and nasal symptom. After that eligible patients will undergo
      sinus x-ray, nasal endoscopy and allergy skin test (these test are routine performed for all
      patients with symptoms of nasal obstruction). Then the patients will further be sub-divided
      into two groups based on the allergic skin prick test (SPT); allergy positive and allergy
      negative group. In each group patients will randomly allocated to one of the two study arms;
      group A will receive lansoprazole (prevacid) and mometasone furonate (nasonex) and the other
      group will receive nasonex and placebo. The lansoprazole/placebo will be discontinued after 3
      months and the patients will undergo nasal endoscopy and will be asked to fill out the three
      questionnaires again to assess the improvement. The patients will be follow for another 3
      months, the patients will again undergo nasal endoscopy and will asked to fill out the three
      questionnaires to assess the improvement and sustainability.
