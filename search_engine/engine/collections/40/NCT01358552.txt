    
      Surveys used to conduct this study will be administered via telephone or online by
      InfoMedics, Inc., a company with a system for developing such patient-physician feedback
      programs. Participating physicians will ask their patients to participate in the program
      after Néevo®/NéevoDHA® has been prescribed and provide them with a patient brochure
      containing an introduction to the program and instructions on how to enroll. Patients
      interested in participating self-enroll, take a brief survey before starting their
      Néevo®/NéevoDHA® prescription, and then a follow-up survey 4 weeks after they have started
      taking Néevo®/NéevoDHA®. As patients complete surveys within the study, their physician will
      receive individualized feedback reports outlining their patient's treatment experience and
      progress. Patients will also receive a copy of their own reports, to help encourage them to
      continue taking Néevo®/NéevoDHA® as directed. Patients will also receive educational
      materials about diet and nutrition during pregnancy.
