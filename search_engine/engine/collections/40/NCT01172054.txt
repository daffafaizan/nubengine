      vaccines, designated VAX128 A, B and C. The purpose of the study is to compare the safety and
      immunogenicity of the three vaccines through a range of doses and to select one of the
      vaccines for further testing in phase II studies. We plan to assess the safety and
      immunogenicity in a dose escalating study. The study will enroll up to 100 healthy young
      adults (18-49 years) and 100 healthy adults than age 65 years. We are including the older
      adults in this phase 1 study because we have found that the elderly tolerated a vaccine
      similar to one of the candidates, VAX128A, better than young adults, but required a higher
      vaccine dose to achieve a similar antibody response. Nevertheless, because we are testing two
      other constructs (VAX128B and C), we will be making the conservative assumptions that the
      safety and immunogenicity data coming from the young adults will not predict the results in
      the elderly. Therefore, we will begin the study in the young adults and after the first three
      dose levels have been tested we will begin testing in the older adults. In this study we plan
      to enroll up to 100 young adults and up to 100 adults 65 years and older. The young adults
      will be most likely enrolled at one clinical site and the older adults will be enrolled at
      another clinical site. We plan to enroll a cohort of 10 young adults and 10 older adults
      every week. Each cohort will consist of 3 subjects to receive one of the three vaccines (9
      subjects total) and one subject in each cohort will receive placebo. Dosing for the next
      cohort will be based on a two day assessment period after vaccination. The main part of the
      study will be conducted over 28 days and there will be two follow up phone calls at 6 months
      and one year.
