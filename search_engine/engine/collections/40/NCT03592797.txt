      physical and social impairment are exist in these patients. The medical options for chronic
      condition of Bell's palsy are insufficient. Low-level laser therapy has shown a favorable
      prognosis in the regeneration of peripheral nerves. Moreover, laser acupuncture therapy (LAT)
      become widely used method to stimulate acupuncture points, but its efficacy as treatment
      method for Bell's palsy and during the chronic stage is unclear.

      Methods: This clinical trial settings are a randomized, placebo control, double blind pilot
      study including patients with the unsatisfactory recovery of Bell's palsy with the following
      two groups: LAT (N=16) and a sham LAT (N=16). The LAT will receive treatments for 6 weeks,
      compare to sham control group. The primary outcome measure will be change in the Facial
      Disability Index at week 6. Statistical analysis will also include changes in the
      House-Brackmann grading system, the Sunnybrook grading system and stiffness scale at 1, 3 and
      6 weeks after randomization.

      Expected outcome: The investigators hypothesis that LAT will have an effect on functional
      outcomes in patients with chronic facial paralysis. Moreover, changes in the S-B facial nerve
      grading system is also expected to have an improvement. Last, social subscale of FDI is
      expected to have an improvement.
