      populations in the U.S. Community Health Centers provide comprehensive primary care services,
      and usually dental services, to large numbers of low-income smokers and smokeless tobacco
      users. The typical patient has multiple dental visits, which can be used for tobacco
      cessation advice and counseling by the dental office team. This study builds on a successful
      pilot study conducted in two public health dental clinics.

      This study is a randomized clinical trial in which 14 public health dental clinics in Oregon,
      Mississippi, and New York City were stratified by state, matched within state by
      racial/ethnic composition, and then randomly assigned to either the Intervention or Usual
      Care Control condition. In the Intervention Condition, the dental team provided a brief
      intervention modeled on the "5A's" advocated by the Clinical Practice Guideline.
