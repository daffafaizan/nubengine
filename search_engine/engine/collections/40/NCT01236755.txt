      wearing single-vision spectacles (Cho et al. 2005) or soft lenses (Walline et al. 2009).
      Younger myopic children (aged 6-10 years old) may have the faster increase in myopia than old
      myopic children (aged 11-15 years old), i.e. the rate of myopic progression may be different
      in different age groups and in children with different refractive status (Edwards 1999; Fan
      et al. 2004; Cheng et al. 2007). Although the refractive correction with ortho-k has been
      well documented, it is unknown whether the efficiency and reversibility of ortho-k for myopic
      reduction as well as myopic control are similar in children of different age and refractive
      groups.

      In this 14-month study, the eyeball length in 45 younger (6-10 years old) and 45 older (11-15
      years old) myopic children before and after ortho-k will be evaluated. Eyeball elongation
      will be determined for the first 7 months when single-vision glasses will be prescribed
      (Phase I) and the next 7 months when ortho-k will be prescribed (Phase I). Rate of myopic
      progression will be determined and compared between the two groups of children in the two
      phases.
