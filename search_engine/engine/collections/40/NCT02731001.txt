      and intermediate late effects of radiotherapy do not only hamper quality of life but can, in
      the case of radiation induced pneumonitis, be potentially lethal, a reduction of these side
      effects is desirable. Patients in this trial are 1:1 randomised to intensity modulated
      radiotherapy with photons or proton therapy. The primary aim of the study is to show a
      decrease of pneumonitis and or esophagitis grade 2 or higher by proton therapy. The observed
      incidence of both these side effects is 39% with photon therapy. The estimated incidence with
      proton therapy is around 12 %. Simultaneous chemotherapy will be applied to current clinical
      standards.
