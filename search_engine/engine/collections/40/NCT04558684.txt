      days with total neoadjuvant chemotherapy and camrelizumab, an anti-PD-1 antibody drug. The
      Primary Objective is to assess clinical complete response of an organ preservation approach
      and the secondary objective to assess safety in all enrolled patients, local regrowth rate
      and other cancer specific outcomes (metastasis-free survival, colostomy-free survival and
      overall survival), longitudinal health-related quality of life of this organ preservation
      approach.
