      in the brain and guards against disease processes that are caused by oxidative stress. Since
      the brain is the most highly oxidative organ in the body and highly susceptible to oxidative
      stress, with increasing impact on diabetes, biomarkers of oxidative stress in the brain
      through the use of novel magnetic resonance imaging techniques for glutathione and vitamin C
      will be studied.
