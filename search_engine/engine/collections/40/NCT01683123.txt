      mg/m2 once daily i.v in 60 min. on days -6 to -3 (total dose 160 mg/m2), followed by Busulfan
      3,2 mg/kg once daily i.v. in 180 min. in the same days (total dose 12,8 mg/kg). No busulfan
      pharmacokinetic monitoring is performed. Graft versus host disease prophylaxis consists in
      the combination of cyclosporine and methotrexate. Graft products obtained from bone marrow or
      peripheral blood of HLA identical sibling donors are not manipulated in their cellular
      content before transplantation. Blood products were leukocyte depleted and irradiated before
      transfusion. Supportive care, including seizure prophylaxis, isolation measures, antiemetics,
      antimicrobial agents and growth factors use are followed according to standard procedures.

      The main objectives are to record data regarding engraftment, regimen related toxicity and
      outcome in different patient populations according to age, disease type, disease status at
      HSCT and comorbidities.
