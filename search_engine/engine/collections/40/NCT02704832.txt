      altered (G8 <= 14), patients will be included in the main study and randomized according to 2
      modalities: Arm A / Usual care (treatment according to on-going regimens in oncology) or Arm
      B /Case management (assessment of the patient by the nurse and the geriatrician with
      interventions as prescribed by the geriatrician). The intervention will be considered
      effective if, at one year, compared to usual care there is a significant clinical improvement
      in overall survival (OS) without a significant deterioration or/and clinical improvement of
      at least one of the targeted quality of life (QoL) scores, without significant clinical
      deterioration in at least one of the targeted QoL scores and without significant difference
      in OS in favor of usual care.

      If the resulting score is normal (G8 > 14), patients will be treated according to their
      physician-in-charge opinion. A minimal set of data will be collected (age, sex, tumor type,
      disease stage, performance status (PS), creatinine clearance, albumin and C-Reactive Protein
      (CRP) levels mainly) to allow for the characterization of the population in order to compare
      our results to those of other published series.
