      cannulation is the most common technique used for monitoring of invasive blood pressure and
      for arterial blood gas analysis.

      Perfusion index derived from pulse oximetry is a new method for monitoring of peripheral
      perfusion.

      this study aims to investigate if radial artery cannulation affects the intra-operative
      peripheral perfusion in the dominant cannulated hand
