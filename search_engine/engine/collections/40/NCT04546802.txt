      be eligible for enrollment if they fulfill the study inclusion and exclusion criteria and
      have achieved a complete tumour response (CR) 3 months (+/- 14 days) following HCC treatment

        -  Cohort A: Patients with Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage 0 or A HCC who have
           received curative therapy defined as either; liver transplantation, surgical resection
           or local ablation with curative intent and attained a radiologically confirmed CR.
           (N=50)

        -  Cohort B: Patients who are non-eligible for curative therapy but have attained a
           radiologically confirmed CR. post embolization or ablative therapy and have chronic HCV
           infection. (N=50) Given the existing uncertainty regarding the impact of direct acting
           antiviral (DAA) therapy on HCC recurrence, study participants will be randomized to
           receive DAA treatment as "immediate" ie upon study enrollment or "delayed" ie treatment
           commenced â‰¥ 6months following documentation of complete response based on radiological
           assessment indicating no residual arterial enhancing disease..
