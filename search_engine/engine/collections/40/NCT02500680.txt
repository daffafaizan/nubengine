      clinical trial, in healthy adults (18-49 years old) and ambulatory elderly subjects (aged 65
      years and older). Phase IA evaluated the safety, tolerability and hemagglutination inhibition
      assay (HAI) antibody response to MER4101 at each of four escalating doses of seasonal
      inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) hemagglutinin (HA) antigen with a fixed dose of a
      water-in-oil emulsion adjuvant MAS-1 (Mercia Adjuvant System-1), compared with licensed,
      unadjuvanted, standard dose (SD) of licensed inactivated trivalent influenza virus vaccine
      (IIV). Phase IB evaluated the optimal dose of IIV in MAS-1 selected under phase IA for
      safety, tolerability and HAI antibody response (from Phase 1A known to be 9 µg of HA antigen
      in 0.3 mL dose of MAS-1 adjuvanted emulsion) in ambulatory elderly subjects compared to high
      dose (HD) IIV. The Phase 1B extension will evaluate if the increased dose volume of MAS-1
      (0.5 mL vs 0.3 mL) at the same 9 µg/HA adjuvanted IIV vaccine is safe, well tolerated and
      immunogenic, and then whether the increased dose of 15 µg/HA in 0.5 mL MAS-1 is safe, well
      tolerated and still more immunogenic in elderly subjects.

      The ability of standard dose (SD) IIV to protect against seasonal influenza virus infection
      in the elderly is less than vaccine efficacy observed in healthy young adults. The
      MAS-1-adjuvanted influenza virus vaccine offers the potential for higher seroconversion and
      seroprotection rates, hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) antibody titers relative to
      pre-vaccination HAI titers (GMFI), hemagglutinin (HA) antigen dose-sparing and
      cross-protection against antigenically divergent viral strains, and importantly, prolonged
      duration of protective immunity lasting up to at least 6 months post-vaccination in both the
      general adult population and the elderly, thereby providing potentially protective immunity
      throughout the influenza season. This study will determine if the adjuvanted vaccine
      formulated with one or more of the reduced HA antigen doses is safe. The study will also
      determine if it is likely to induce an improved HA antibody response (HAI) when compared to
      SD IIV in healthy adults and HD IIV in elderly subjects. This trial will inform future
      clinical trials in at-risk populations of older patients.
