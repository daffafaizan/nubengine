      receive an injection of Allovectin-7Â® by needle, directly into one or more selected tumors
      once a week for the first six weeks. The injections may be given in a doctor's office. During
      a four-week observation period, your disease will be measured to see if the treatment is
      working. This will be done by general physical exams and scans (such as X-ray scans).
      Patients who show no sign of disease progression may be offered an option to repeat this
      treatment course.
