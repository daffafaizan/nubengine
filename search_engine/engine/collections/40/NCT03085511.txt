      weight loss diet of 1,200-1,500 kcal adjusted to each individual's body weight for totally 2
      weeks in each experiment. They will come to the clinic from day 1 to day 7 and consume egg
      breakfast (EB) for 5 days under our supervision. Then on weekends during this period they
      will continue this breakfast at home based on our advice. The next week they will have cereal
      breakfast (CB) and the process is similar to that in the first week.

      The 1st experiment will test the satiety from egg breakfast (EB) and following energy intake
      in both lunch and dinner, compared with CB (cereal breakfast). Lunch and dinner will be
      offered on 2 test days during each week. Anthropometric and body composition measurements,
      blood pressure, blood draw, satiety questionnaire, as well as energy intake will also be
      collected in the 2 test days and compared between 2 breakfast groups.

      The 2nd one is to test whether EB will help in resisting the intake of foods considered
      tempting, but detrimental to weight loss efforts, compared with CB. The process is similar to
      experiment 1 except no blood draw, no dinner offered. Instead, a tempting food after lunch
      will be offered.
