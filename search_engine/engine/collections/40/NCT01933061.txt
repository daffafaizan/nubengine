    
      The study will consist of the following phases:

        -  Screening (Baseline) Assessments: Performed within 21 days of randomization.

        -  Randomization: Subjects will be randomized within 21 days of starting their Baseline
           assessments.

        -  Treatment: Therapy may continue in the absence of clinically significant disease
           progression and unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Response Assessments: Subjects will be evaluated by investigators for CR, PR, stable or
           progressive disease every 6 weeks from the start of treatment until progressive disease
           is documented.

      Responders and subjects with stable disease (SD) should continue on study unless they develop
      unacceptable toxicity, they start a new anticancer therapy, withdrawal of consent, physician
      decision or death.

        -  End of Study (EOS)/Treatment Evaluation: At the time subjects are removed from study,
           laboratory and clinical evaluations will be performed.

        -  Follow-up for Disease Progression:

           - Subjects who stop treatment prior to developing disease progression should be followed
           without further treatment until progressive disease is documented or until the treating
           physician feels additional treatment is required.

        -  Follow-up for Survival:

             -  Post study, subject survival status will be monitored on a monthly basis for 6
                months from discontinuation from the study and every 3 months thereafter, until
                death or study termination in all subjects.
