      peripheral organ or tissue against cerebral I/R injury in people with mild cognitive
      impairment as well as early and middle stage dementia.

      This crossover study will be held with individuals suffering from peripheral arteriopathy
      that can cause intermittent claudication after structured exercise, thus inducing extensive
      transient leg's ischemia.
