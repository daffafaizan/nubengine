      children who survived cancer therapy were largely a function of the prophylactic therapies
      (e.g., radiation, chemotherapy) that these children had received. Regardless of the
      etiologies of these specific late effects, the data regarding the long-term outcome of these
      children are strikingly consistent. Generally, the studies to date suggest significant
      impairments in attention and concentration that result in marked declines in academic
      performance and social and behavior difficulties.

      Despite the clear evidence of problems with attention and concentration, as well as
      associated fucntional impairments (e.g., poor academic achievement and poor peer
      relationships), there have been few clinical trials designed to manage the cogntive late
      effects and neurological toxicities associated with radiation therapy and chemotherapy for
      children and adolescents who have survived cancer.
