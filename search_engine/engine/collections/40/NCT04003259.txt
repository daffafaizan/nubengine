      (BP) increasing the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Obesity-induced
      complications are increasingly encountered in the health care system and especially in
      primary care. Thus, there is a growing need for individually tailored weight management
      programs aiming to permanent lifestyle and dietary changes for the prevention and treatment
      of obesity-related health hazards.

      The study investigated weight reduction during 1-year comprehensive lifestyle programme in
      134 obese or overweight subjects (BMI>30, or BMI>25 with a comorbidity including diabetes,
      hypertension, arthrosis, asthma, chronic obstructive lung disease, sleep apnoea). The
      participants were recruited from the local diabetes centre and health care providers. The
      programme aimed at 5-10 % weight reduction utilizing exercise program supervised by personal
      trainer, advice on diet and on-location shopping behavior by a registered dietician, hands-on
      cooking classes by a professional chef, examinations by a medical doctor, and group
      discussions. The efficacy of the program was followed by measuring change in weight, BMI,
      waist circumference, fat and muscle percentage, visceral fat, and systolic and diastolic BP.

      The study protocol has been approved by the ethics committee of the Pirkanmaa Hospital
      District (R12099).
