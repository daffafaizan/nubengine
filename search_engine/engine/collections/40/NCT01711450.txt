      insertions to tumor ablation procedures. The study will randomize patients in two groups, one
      receiving a paravertebral nerve block prior to the procedure and one receiving a sham
      procedure in which saline will be injected in the paravertebral space. Pain scores and use of
      IV sedation will be monitored post procedure and both groups will be compared to assess
      whether paravetebral nerve blocks are effective at reducing pain in patients receiving such
      procedures.
