      to regeneration of infarcted myocardial muscle and increase the neovascularization of the
      ischemic tissue.

      Post-myocardial infarction heart failure secondary to ventricular remodelation it's an
      increasing problem. A novel therapeutic approach for decrease this consequence is to induce
      the angiogeneses and regeneration of myocardial cells.

      Many trials have shown benefits through the intracoronary injection of stem cell, however the
      clinical benefit is still controversial. The present trial is a randomized single blinded
      controlled trial designed to evaluate the improvement on EF and survival in post ST elevation
      myocardial infarction patients undergoing to intracoronary autologous stem cell
      transplantation.
