      204 weeks (± 14 days), with a median follow-up over all participants of approximately 91
      weeks, broken down as follows:

        -  placebo-run-in period: 7 days (+ 3 days)

        -  double-blind study treatment period: 203 weeks (± 14 days) (with about a 37 months of
           recruitment period)

        -  post-treatment follow-up period: 3 days (± 1 day)

      All participants were followed from randomization until the end of study, which should occur
      when the last randomized participant had been followed for approximately 10 months. The
      actual end date of the study was "event driven" and the study end when there were
      approximately 844 positively-adjudicated primary cardiovascular outcome events.
