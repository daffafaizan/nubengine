      quantitative and qualitative methods to evaluate the feasibility and intervention effect of
      an alternative delivery (online) of the Storytelling Through Music program (STM).

      Previous study of In-person delivery of Storytelling Through Music program STM with oncology
      nurses found it to be feasible and beneficial to coping with stress and work-related
      emotions.

      The research study procedures include: screening for eligibility and study intervention
      including follow-up surveys.

      Participants will be randomized into two (2) groups: Storytelling Through Music (STM) and
      Waitlist (Storytelling Through Music-Hybrid)

      STM group: Participants are led through a writing workshop over an online platform (i.e.,
      Zoom or an equivalent) to develop their story. Simultaneous with the writing sessions are
      10-minute self-care lessons. At the end of the development workshop, each participant will be
      paired with a songwriter who will turn participant stories into songs. A final workshop will
      be held for participants to debrief about the emotional experience of participating in the
      Storytelling Through Music program (STM)

      Waitlist control group (Storytelling Through Music-Hybrid), will listen to songs created by
      healthcare workers in the Storytelling Through Music program (STM) for 2 weeks.

      Participation length will be based on the randomized group assignment, a total of 19 weeks
      for the STM group and 13 weeks for the waitlist group.

      It is expected that about 50 people will take part in this research study.
