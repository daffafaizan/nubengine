      (VO2max and Anaerobic Threshold) and 30 day postoperative all cause morbidity in a sample
      large enough to allow (should significant associations exist) calculation of a threshold
      value. Secondary aims are to examine associations between the VO2max, AT and cardiopulmonary,
      non-cardiopulmonary complications as well as specific complications (atrial fibrillation,
      pneumonia, and anastomotic leak) as well as 30 and 90 day mortality.
