      statistics. Radiation (and chemotherapy) doses are based on phase I data and not on the
      individual's specific genetics or hidden predispositions. RadTox measures cell damage as
      early as after the 2nd but before the 4th radiotherapy dose during week 1 of radiotherapy and
      should help identify patients at high risk for radiation complications. This should allow
      physicians to adjust radiation field size and dose to minimize long-term toxicity, especially
      gastrointestinal toxicities.
