      addition, exercise program was associated with improving the QOL and functional recovery,
      decreasing a mood of depression, maintaining a muscle mass and improving the survival rate.

      However, the subject patients of previous studies were Western people. Therefore, The results
      were not disclosed whether the exercise program suited to the body characteristics of Korean
      people. Furthermore there was no exercise program studies for the gastric cancer patients.

      Medical service for cancer patients care should include not only diagnosis, treatment as like
      surgery but efforts on enhancing the quality of life. In other words, post-management
      education and management program as like exercise program are necessary for the cancer
      patients after surgery. Thus, the investigators have done the pilot study about how to
      practice the exercise program and how to evaluate the effect on the recovery. Based on the
      result of pilot study which could identify the safety and the feasibility , the investigators
      would like to do a prospective randomized controlled study to prove the effect of exercise
      program after surgery
