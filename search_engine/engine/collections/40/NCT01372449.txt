      investigators studying animal models, post-mortem brains, and single gene disorders that have
      overlapping phenotypes with autism. Abnormalities in glutamatergic function have been
      reported in disorders affecting a variety of behavioral and neurological domains, from mood
      stability, to cognitive flexibility, memory, and motor function. Numerous studies have
      reported a variety of memory and motor deficits in children with autism. Whereas the
      neurobiology of such deficits is an area of active research, there is a paucity of
      intervention research for such deficits in autism. This study will attempt to study the
      effect of an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA) inhibitor, memantine, on memory, and motor
      praxis/expressive language skills in children with autism.

      Methods: Children ages 6-12 years who are verbal and meet criteria for Autism Spectrum
      Disorder will be recruited across 2 sites. After consent, the children will be assessed for
      memory function, expressive language output and motor skills/praxis. They will then be
      randomized 1:1 to memantine versus placebo for 6 months. The effects of this medication on
      the above mentioned symptoms domains as well as its safety in this population will be studied
      over the 6 month period.
