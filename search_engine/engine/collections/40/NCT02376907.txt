    
      This is a multinational multicenter retrospective cohort study to evaluate the outcomes of
      endoscopic biliary drainage in patients with a duodenal SEMS. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided
      biliary drainage (EUS-BD), including choledochoduodenostomy, hepaticogastrostomy, antegrade
      biliary stenting or a combination, and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)
      with stenting are to be compared. Specifically, the outcomes are to be evaluated according to
      the timing of distal MBO in relation to GOO and the location of GOO.
