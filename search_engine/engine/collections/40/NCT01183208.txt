      treatment of premature ejaculation (PE). The use of anaesthetic in topical creams has been
      well established, and there is a licensed topical anaesthetic cream in the market with the
      same active ingredients as the spray (eutectic mixture of local anaesthetics cream 5%,
      lidocaine & prilocaine). The use of a cream does not result in the concentrated drug being in
      direct contact with the cells, unlike the spray.

      Six clinical studies have already been carried out for the spray; two involved the
      recruitment of 556 PE patients with some being dosed for up to 1 year. These studies have
      demonstrated a prolongation of intravaginal ejaculatory latency time and no safety concerns
      for male patients or their female partners. The partners of clinical study participants have
      been asked to report health changes during the studies. Reports of vaginal numbness were
      uncommon; however, effects of the transfer to a partner cannot be excluded. This study is
      being conducted to determine the effects of the drug on the whole body in females as well as
      local vaginal exposure to the spray. This study will be conducted in order to support a
      marketing application in the United States (US) at the request of the U.S. Food and Drug
      Administration.
