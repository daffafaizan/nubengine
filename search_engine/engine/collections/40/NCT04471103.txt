    
      Aim:

      The aim of this trial is to compare a multi-round Delphi survey method with a Real-Time
      Delphi method on prioritised outcomes included in a core outcome set (COS). This trial is
      embedded within the COHESION study which is developing a COS for interventions for the
      treatment of neonatal encephalopathy.

      Methods:

      Stakeholders (parents/ caregivers of infants diagnosed and treated with neonatal
      encephalopathy, healthcare providers and researchers) will be randomised using stratified
      randomisation to take part in either a multi-round or Real-Time Delphi. Stakeholders will
      rate the importance of the same set of outcomes in both arms. We will compare the prioritised
      outcomes at the end of both surveys as well as other parameters such as feedback, initial
      condition and iteration effects.
