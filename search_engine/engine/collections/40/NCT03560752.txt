      I. Establish the feasibility and safety of priming CMV immunity in donors by Triplex
      vaccination prior to peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) harvest.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Examine if Triplex vaccination of hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT) donors has an
      impact on CMV events.

      OUTLINE:

      Donors receive multi-peptide CMV-modified vaccinia Ankara vaccine injection between days -60
      and -10 prior to granulocyte colony stimulating factor mobilization. Participants undergo
      hematopoietic cell transplantation on day 0.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up for 1 year.
