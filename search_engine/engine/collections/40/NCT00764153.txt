      with displaced intracapsular femoral neck fractures were included and randomized by means of
      closed numbered envelopes to operation groups:

        1. Two parallel screws (Olmed).

        2. Hemiarthroplasty with Charnley/ Hastings prosthesis.

      A priori one would expect that there would be less morbidity and mortality with the less
      extensive and quicker operation with parallel screw and that a faster and better
      rehabilitation would be achieved with hemiarthroplasty.
