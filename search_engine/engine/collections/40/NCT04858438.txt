    
      This is a prospective single-blind randomized controlled trial of adult women undergoing
      robotic-assisted sacrocolpopexy for pelvic organ prolapse. Each surgery will be performed by
      a board-certified Female Pelvic Medicine & Reconstructive Surgery (FPMRS) surgeon with a
      standard technique other than pneumoperitoneum level. A sacrocolpopexy for apical prolapse
      may be performed at the same time as a hysterectomy and other clinically indicated procedures
      if desired by the patient and as part of the standard of care. Patients will be stratified by
      hysterectomy prior to randomization. Postoperatively, patients will be evaluated with a
      Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) as well as prescribed narcotic analgesic use and followed up to 2
      weeks.
