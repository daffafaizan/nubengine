      participants to wear a small thermometer on their shoe for 7 days. Ninety participants were
      recruited from Birmingham AL (urban) and 90 from rural West Central Alabama. The first two
      days participants were asked to go about their normal daily activities. During the next 5
      days of participation, participants were asked to add an additional 30 minutes of time spent
      outdoors. As a secondary outcome, steps were measured via pedometers worn by participants. A
      subgroup of participants with self-reported doctor diagnosed Type II Diabetes also recorded
      their fasting glucose each morning of participation.
