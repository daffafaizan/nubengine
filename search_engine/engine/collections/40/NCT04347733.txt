      subjects were randomly assigned into 3 groups to receive ultrasound-guided intra-articular
      injections with 20 mg (group A) and 40 mg triamcinolone acetonide (group B) and 20 mg
      acetonide combined with hyaluronidase (group C). The outcome measures included the visual
      analogue scale (VAS), the shoulder disability questionnaire (SDQ), abduction and external
      rotation range of motion, and intra-sheath fluid (ISF) before treatment and at 2, 4, 8, and
      16 weeks after treatment.
