      Cancer Hospital of Xiangya School of Medicine Central South University. Retrospective study
      of 40 patients with advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) using Crizotinib
      ROS1 rearrangement positive mutation was conducted to observe the efficacy and safety of
      Crizotinib regimen in the real world.Exploratory research contents are as follows: 1.
      Consistency between tissue gene test (NGS) and plasma gene test (NGS) at the initial
      diagnosis; 2. Consistency between NGS and plasma gene test (NGS) at the progression of
      clozotinib treatment; 3. Drug resistance mechanism of clozotinib in ROS1 rearrangement
      positive NSCLC; 4. Plasma drug resistance. Large panel dynamic driven gene mutation analysis
      was used to construct disease progression risk model.
