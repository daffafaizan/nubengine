    
      GM1 gangliosidosis is a fatal autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in the GLB1
      gene leading to accumulation of GM1 ganglioside in neurons and progressive neurodegeneration.
      There are three pediatric subtypes: early infantile, late infantile and juvenile. This is an
      interventional, multicenter, single-arm, 2-stage adaptive design study of LYS-GM101. In the
      first safety and proof-of-concept stage of the study, 4 subjects with infantile GM1
      gangliosidosis will receive a single dose of LYS-GM101 by intracisternal injection. The
      second stage of the study is confirmatory and will include additional patients with GM1
      gangliosidosis.
