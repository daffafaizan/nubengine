    
      The study aim is to assess the added diagnostic value and impact on workflow of Philips IQon
      Spectral Computed Tomography.

      The IQon Spectral CT generates two result types:

        -  Conventional CT images which are equivalent to images produced by the commercially
           available Brilliance iCT scanner

        -  Spectral CT images which are unique to this product.

      The CT examination would be a standard of care CT performed as per the clinical indication.

      In addition to the aim mentioned above, the investigators would like to develop
      recommendations for the clinical application of the spectral images in routine use. Such
      recommendations could include optimization of scanning parameters, optimization of
      reconstruction parameters to utilize the capabilities of the IQon system etc.

      The clinical system includes:

        -  The IQon Spectral CT scanner

        -  Spectral Diagnostic suite (Philips IntelliSpace Portal): includes 5 applications.
           Spectral Enhanced CT Viewer, Spectral Enhanced Advanced Analysis, Spectral Enhanced
           Comprehensive Cardiac Analysis, Spectral Enhanced Tumor Tracking, spectral magic glass
           on PACS.

      The testing will be conducted under this project plan. This is a single center research study
      that is expected to be conducted over a one year period.
