      I. To quantify fluorine F 18 Ara-G ([18F]-AraG) uptake (standardized uptake value [SUV]) in
      advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tumor (primary, nodal, and metastatic sites) at
      baseline and after 1 dose of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy in both patients treated with PD-1/PD-L1
      monotherapy and in patients treated with immunotherapy/chemotherapy combination therapy.

      II. To correlate change in [18F]-AraG uptake before and after the start of therapy with
      radiographic response in patients treated with immunotherapy.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive [18F]-AraG intravenously (IV) and then undergo PET/CT over 2 hours at
      baseline and within 2 weeks after starting immunotherapy. Patients may also undergo blood
      sample collection.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for up to 12 months.
