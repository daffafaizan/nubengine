    
      Objective: To consider the clinical outcomes of drug-coated ballon angioplasty and vein
      bypass surgery in terms of amputation-free survival, overall survival, relief of symptoms,
      quality of life and to determine if limb revascularization contributes to diabetic peripheral
      neuropathy (DPN).

      All patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and severe limb ischemia reffered to
      multidisciplinary diabetic foot team or endocrinology or vascular units can be considered.

      To be eligible for randomization, peripheral arterial occlusive disease must be located
      infra-popliteally; patients must have adequate inflow and outflow to support infrapopliteal
      interventions; have a good superficial vein for bypass surgery. If the patient is suitable
      for both treatment arms, they will be invited to enter the trial.

      If patient is suitable for both revascularization techniques randomization will be performed
      after diagnostic angiogram submission

      Patient will be randomised to one of the following groups:

      A. Vein bypass surgery first strategy B. Endovascular treatment first (drug coated balloon
      angioplasty) strategy

      Outcomes will be recorded at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24 month after revascularisation procedure.
      Information collected will include further interventions (vascular, non-vascular),
      hospitalisations (for whatever reason), other health problems, clinical and haemodinamic
      status of limbs, funcional status, quality of life, neuropathy.
