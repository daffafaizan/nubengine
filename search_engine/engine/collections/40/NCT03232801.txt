      the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of the intervention. Fifty women
      will be randomized to the mindfulness intervention or an educational control group. Both
      groups will be conducted in 3 sessions over 6 weeks in groups of 10 women. Feasibility,
      acceptability, facilitators, and barriers will be assessed by surveys after each session and
      after intervention completion. Preliminary efficacy will be assessed by measures of sexual
      desire, sexual function, and overall sexual satisfaction at 6 and 12 weeks.
