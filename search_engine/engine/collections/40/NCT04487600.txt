      urinary function prior to discharge. Total laparoscopic hysterectomy (TLH) has been
      demonstrated to be safe with a reduction in post-operative morbidity and length of hospital
      stay with no difference in cancer related outcomes in endometrial cancer. Furthermore, the
      investigators have demonstrated that following the adoption of same day discharge, there was
      no difference in composite complication rates or readmissions. Awaiting a passive void trial
      may impact time to discharge as well as same day discharge; however, this has not been
      clearly studied in this patient population. The aim of this study is to determine the
      difference in time to discharge following an active voiding trial with bladder backfill in
      the post-operative recovery unit compared to a passive voiding trial with removal of the
      Foley catheter in the operating room at the end of the procedure. Secondary outcomes include
      time to void, catheter replacement, discomfort with the voiding trial, and overnight
      admission.
