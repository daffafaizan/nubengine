      prescribed by their physician. Depression is common among patients with Type 2 DM and may be
      the reason why patients do not take their medications as prescribed. A program in which Type
      2 DM and depression are treated together in primary care would improve the health of older
      patients with both Type 2 diabetes and depression and would be practical in real world
      practices with competing demands for limited resources. There is an urgent need for research
      that can bring potentially life-extending strategies to older patients with both diabetes and
      depression. People can better control their Type 2 DM if they treat their depression and the
      same strategies can be used to help patients take their medications for both conditions. In
      this program patients were involved in identifying problems with taking their medicines and
      working on solutions. The aims of this program were to improve how patients take their
      medications for Type 2 DM and depression as well as blood glucose control and symptoms of
      depression over 3 months. To see whether this program works the investigators compared the
      results of patients receiving this program to those who do not receive the program. Findings
      may lead to the development of other programs in which depression and chronic medical
      conditions are treated together.
