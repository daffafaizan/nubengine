    
      The main objective of this study is to describe the handling of inhaler devices (Diskus®,
      Turbuhaler® and Ellipta®) in patients with asthma.

      All participants will use each inhaler device (Diskus®, Turbuhaler® and Ellipta®) daily for
      one week:

        -  Two puffs per day (Diskus® and Turbuhaler®),

        -  One puff per day (Ellipta®). At each visit (day 1, 8, 15 and 22), patients will have a
           physical exam.

      For each inhaler device, 4 video recordings will be performed:

        -  Video recording #1: Inhalation (one puff) without any instruction of use.

        -  Video recording #2: Inhalation (one puff) after reading the patient information leaflet.

        -  Video recording #3: Inhalation (one puff) after watching a standardized video
           demonstrating correct inhaler technique.

        -  Video recording #4: inhalation (one puff) after seven days of daily use. The patient
           will be asked to fulfill a satisfaction survey about each inhaler device.
