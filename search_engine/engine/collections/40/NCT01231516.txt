      group, non-inferiority study. The study will be conducted in at least 688 HIV-1 infected
      antiretroviral experienced, integrase-na√Øve subjects. Subjects will be randomized 1:1 to
      receive GSK1349572 50 mg once daily or raltegravir (RAL) 400 mg twice daily, each added to an
      investigator selected background regimen consisting of at least one fully active agent plus
      no more than one second single agent which may or may not be active. Antiviral activity,
      safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and development of viral resistance will be evaluated.

      Subjects must have documented genotypic or phenotypic resistance to at least one member of
      each of at least two antiretroviral therapy (ART) drug classes [nucleoside/nucleotide reverse
      transcriptase inhibitor (N[t]RTI), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI),
      protease inhibitor (PI), fusion inhibitor (T20), or entry inhibitor (chemokine receptor 5
      [CCR5] antagonist)].

      The primary analysis will take place after the last subject completes 48 weeks on therapy. An
      additional data cut and analysis will be conducted after the last subject completes 24 weeks
      on therapy.

      Subjects randomized to GSK1349572 who successfully complete Week 48 will continue to received
      GSK1349572 until either it is locally available, until they no longer derive clinical
      benefit, until they meet a protocol-defined reason for discontinuation, or until development
      of the compound is terminated.
