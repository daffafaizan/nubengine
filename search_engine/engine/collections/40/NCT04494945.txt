      I. Evaluate the effectiveness and sustainability of heritable cancer syndrome testing in two
      proposed screening populations compared to current guidelines.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Measure adherence to current guidelines for screening and prophylactic intervention of
      Cohorts B and C compared to Cohort A to show non-inferiority.

      II. Measure the efficiency of cascade testing (defined as the ratio of family members
      screened over total possible) for Cohorts B and C compared to Cohort A to show
      non-inferiority.

      III. Determine the costs and effectiveness, specifically quality adjusted life years (QALYs)
      associated with genetic screening models based on Cohorts B and C to estimate incremental
      cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) and show that the costs per QALY are below the acceptable
      cost effectiveness threshold.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo collection of saliva samples for genetic testing. If genetic test is
      positive, patients receive genetic counseling.
