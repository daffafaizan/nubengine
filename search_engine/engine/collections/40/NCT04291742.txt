      suspicious lesions detected in mpMRI. The two most frequently used are cognitive fusion, in
      which the physician locates the areas where the mpMRI detects suspicious lesions and directs
      the puncture by ultrasound; and software fusion, in which the images of the mpMRI are
      integrated by a software with the ultrasound allowing to direct the puncture to the lesion
      itself. Both forms of fusion biopsy have proven to be superior to systematized prostate
      biopsies in the detection of significant prostate cancer, although neither has demonstrated
      superiority over the other.
