      COVID-19. Apparently, the fact that the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
      (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein binds to Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors can lead
      to ACE2 depletion by SARS-CoV-2 favoring the "harmful" ACE1 / angiotensin II and promoting
      tissue damage, including stroke. Recent observational studies indicate a higher rate of
      thromboembolism in patients with COVID-19, especially those in severe condition. They also
      report that, in patients treated with anticoagulants, complication rates were lower as
      compared with those not receiving anticoagulant therapies.

      More recently, in a post-mortem study of patients with Covid-19 compared to recently
      published cases of influenza, the histopathological pattern on the periphery of the lungs of
      patients with Covid-19 revealed a diffuse alveolar lesion with infiltration of perivascular T
      cells and other vascular aspects, consisting of severe endothelial damage (endothelitis)
      associated with the presence of intracellular viruses and broken cell membranes. In addition,
      pulmonary vessels showed generalized thrombosis with microangiopathy, and alveolar capillary
      microthrombi were much more frequent in patients with COVID-19 than with severe influenza
      respiratory conditions.
