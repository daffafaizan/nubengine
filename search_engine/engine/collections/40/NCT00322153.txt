      treatment options. A once daily (QD) dosing regimen in an AD population would simplify
      administration for the caregiver. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of modified release memantine taken once daily in outpatients with
      moderate-to-severe AD on a concurrent AChEI.
