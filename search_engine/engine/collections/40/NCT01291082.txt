    
      About 50 patients with a proven breast cancer and bone metastases will be included.

      First step : staging

        -  nuclear bone scan

        -  Positron Emission Tomography (PET/CT)

        -  MR (whole body short tau inversion recovery (STIR)-sequence and T1-sequence and
           Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI),no contrast administration

      Aim :

        -  Validation of whole body diffusion weighted imaging in detection of bone metastases and
           visceral metastases, comparing to Bone scan en PET/CT results.

        -  To calculate cut-off values for DWI for bone and visceral metastases.

      Second step : therapy follow-up/therapy assessment.

        -  Two groups of patients (oncologist takes the decision about therapy)

             1. Patients treated by chemotherapy

             2. Patients treated by hormonal therapy

        -  on week 3, 12-16 and 52 in the chemotherapy or hormonal therapy-setting, a whole body MR
           (same protocol, no contrast) will be performed.

      End-point:

      Whole body MR with DWI is useful and reliable to assess the treatment response.
