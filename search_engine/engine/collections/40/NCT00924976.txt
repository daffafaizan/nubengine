      randomly assigning N=200 consumer-family payee dyads into one of two groups: (a) the SAFE
      intervention (n=100); or (b) a "usual care" control (n=100). The SAFE is a brief, 5 component
      educational intervention that aims to facilitate a cooperative consumer-payee relationship,
      increase accurate knowledge about representative payeeship, promote collaborative money
      management and effective budgeting, and prepare mutually developed plans for carrying out the
      payeeship in the future.

      We will interview people with psychiatric disabilities and their family payees at baseline
      and six-months. This study aims to examine the effects of the SAFE intervention on community
      participation, employment, and family support of adults with psychiatric disabilities who
      have family representative payees. Our central hypothesis, based on strong preliminary data,
      is that the SAFE will benefit consumers by enhancing autonomy, boosting motivation to work,
      and reducing family conflict.
