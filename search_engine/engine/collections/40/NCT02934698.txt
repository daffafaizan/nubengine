      therapy. In addition to measurement of usual clinical outcomes (i.e. lung function,
      nutritional status), there is great interest on the impact on nontuberculous mycobacteria
      (NTM) airways infection.

      Subjects will undergo sputum cultures at baseline and monthly during treatment, initially in
      the absence of anti-NTM therapy but with the intent to treat with antibiotics if there is
      persistence of the infection in cultures. Other clinical outcomes will include changes in
      sweat chloride, lung function and weight. Safety measures will include periodic assessment of
      liver enzymes. All serious and non-serious adverse events will be collected
