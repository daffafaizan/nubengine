      patient controlled analgesia (PCA) for 24 hours post surgery. The surgical techniques,
      postoperative medications and rehabilitation protocols were identical in both groups.
      Perioperative knee range of motion (ROM) were measured with long arm goniometer immediately
      after close the wound. Perioperative knee photographs in full flexion and extension positions
      were taken and were given to experimental group in the day after surgery. Postoperative knee
      ROM were recorded at day 3, 6 week, 3 month and 6 month. The outcome assessors were blinded
      to treatment groups during the study period.
