      modifiable risk factor. While exercise training can be effective at reducing blood pressure
      in some individuals, many people do not respond to exercise training, and many more are
      unwilling to undergo regular exercise training. Alternative options need to be explored. This
      is a clinical trial to determine whether 30 sessions of heat therapy in the form of hot water
      immersion is better than 30 sessions of traditional aerobic exercise training on blood
      pressure reduction in people with elevated or Stage 1 hypertension. The investigators will
      evaluate known biomarkers of arterial stiffness and blood vessel health. It is hypothesized
      that heat therapy will be superior to exercise training on blood pressure reduction.
