    
      A previously completed pivotal clinical study PC B305/04 demonstrated reduced recurrence
      rates for patients with papillary bladder cancer who underwent Hexvix (Cysview) and white
      light cystoscopy and transurethral resection (TURB) of the bladder compared to patients who
      underwent white light cystoscopy and TURB alone.

      The present study is intended to investigate whether the improved initial detection and
      resection of bladder cancer lesions in patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer with
      Hexvix (Cysview) fluorescence cystoscopy/TURB will also lead to a longer-term reduction in
      recurrences compared to standard white light cystoscopy/TURB.

      No safety data was collected.
