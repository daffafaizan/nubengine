      I. Determine the progression-free survival (PFS) of gemcitabine hydrochloride (gemcitabine),
      cisplatin, and nab-paclitaxel in advanced, untreated biliary cancers (intrahepatic
      cholangiocarcinomas, extrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas, and gallbladder cancers).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the response rate (RR) and disease control rate (partial response + complete
      response + stable disease) of gemcitabine, cisplatin, and nab-paclitaxel in advanced biliary
      cancers.

      II. Determine overall survival (OS) of gemcitabine, cisplatin, and nab-paclitaxel in advanced
      biliary cancers.

      III. Evaluate the toxicity of gemcitabine, cisplatin, and nab-paclitaxel in advanced biliary
      cancers.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Correlate the carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19-9 response (defined as >50% decrease from
      baseline) with tumor response, PFS and OS.

      II. Assess ribonucleotide reductase subunit MI (RRMI), excision repair cross-complementation
      group 1 (ERCC1) pre-treatment status and correlate with tumor response, PFS and OS on an
      exploratory basis.

      III. Collect optional blood and tissue at the start of treatment and at progression to
      explore mechanisms of resistance.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation intravenously (IV)
      over 30 minutes, cisplatin IV over 60 minutes, and gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30
      minutes on days 1 and 8. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 3
      months thereafter.
