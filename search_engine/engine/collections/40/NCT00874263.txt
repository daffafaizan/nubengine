      Although removal of pre-malignant polyps has been shown to reduce the risk of colorectal
      cancer, up to 50% of removed colonic polyps are hyperplastic with no malignant potential.
      Removal of these benign polyps exposes the patient to polypectomy-related complications and
      cost without any benefit. Current standard endoscopes with the use of accessory confocal
      endomicroscopy probe will allow both routine and confocal microscopy imaging. Colonoscopies
      or upper endoscopies will be performed as routine including conscious sedation. A special
      fiber through the scope, combined with a small amount of dye called fluorescein given by
      vein, will be used to obtain microscopic views during the endoscopic procedure. If a
      colorectal lesion or other GI lesion is found that would normally require biopsy, the site of
      biopsy will be evaluated by confocal imaging with the Cellvizio-GI Fiberoptic probes prior to
      biopsy or removal of the suspicious tissue. Following image acquisition, the lesion will be
      biopsied or removed as per standard clinical care. Standard endoscopic variables for each
      lesion will be recorded including: name and record number, date, time, an exact time of
      fluorescein injection and time of image acquisition, lesion location, size, and suspected
      findings (inflammation, dysplasia, type of polyp) and final histological diagnosis.
