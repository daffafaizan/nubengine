      adverse remodeling, and served in progressive heart failure with a case fatality rate of 50%
      in 5 years. The opening of the occluded vessel is the first and most important therapy, the
      reperfusion improved both the function as well as the long-term survival. At the same time,
      experimental and clinical studies show, however, that this reperfusion self-reinforced damage
      of the myocardium. An additional Intervention in this trigger phase could not only reduce the
      acute damage, but long-term protective effects. Both effects could be an approach for the
      Calcium-Sensitizer Levosimendan in the animal model. So far, no clear effect on the
      remodeling and survive was demonstrated after myocardial infarction in the clinic. This could
      be mainly due to the delayed application in relation to the reperfusion and on the selection
      of suitable methods for the presentation of the effects on myocardial structure and function.
      In the proposed project the investigators want to assess whether the approach of the
      post-conditioning by Levosimendan in patients with acute STEMI is safe and reproducible, can
      be used with a positive influence on the outcomes with respect to myocardial damage, cardiac
      left ventricular remodeling, myocardial function, the occurrence of cardiac events and
      quality of life.
