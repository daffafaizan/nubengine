      medication prazosin, can influence the levels of dopamine in the brain. We will examine the
      levels of dopamine in the the brain using Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and Magnetic
      Resonance Imaging (MRI). The study will involve three PET scans and one MRI. One PET scan
      will be performed before the participants take prazosin for approximately three weeks, and
      the last two PET scans will be performed after the prazosin medication phase. We hypothesize
      that there will be no significant changes in dopamine levels in healthy individuals taking
      prazosin.
