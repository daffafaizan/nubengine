      coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has become a global challenge. Though most cases of
      COVID-19 are mild, the disease can also be fatal. Patients with liver cirrhosis are more
      susceptible to damage from SARS-CoV-2 infection considering their immunocompromised status.
      The spectrum of disease and factors that influence the disease course in COVID-19 cases with
      liver cirrhosis are incompletely defined. This muilticentre observational study
      (COVID-Cirrhosis-CHESS2002) aims to study the clinical characteristics and risk factors
      associated with specific outcomes in COVID-19 patients with pre-existing liver cirrhosis.
