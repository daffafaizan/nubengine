      high quality in diabetes care it is necessary to rethink the way in which the care is
      organized. The investigators want to test a new model of shared care across the interface of
      primary and secondary care sector for patients with type 2 diabetes who are at risk
      stratification level 2. Based on a national and regional risk stratification model patients
      can be stratified to three levels according to risk and complexity of treatment: level 1
      (uncomplicated), level 2 (intermediate risk) and level 3 (high risk).

      The objective of the study is to show equal outcomes among the participants being treated in
      either a shared care program or an established program in a specialized outpatient clinic.

      The study is a non-inferiority randomized controlled trial. The shared care model will be
      tested during a period of three years. All participants are offered four medical visits a
      year. The shared care intervention consists of one annual comprehensive check-up at the
      outpatient clinic and three quarterly visits at a general practice. The control group is
      followed with four quarterly visits at the outpatient clinic including an annual
      comprehensive check-up. The recruitment period spans over approximately 12 months, and
      participants are randomized to intervention or control group in a 1:1 ratio.
