    
      Primary Objective

      • To determine the success of dental implants in alveolar bone augmented in the vertical
      direction with Osteon.

      Secondary Objectives • To determine the long term success of dental implants in this
      augmented bone.

      Primary Endpoint

      • Radiographically assessed vertical height of alveolar ridge formation following Osteon
      augmentation.
