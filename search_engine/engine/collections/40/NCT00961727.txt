      and frontline staff perceptions before and after the implementation of Bedside PEWS in a
      community paediatric hospital. We plan to evaluate the outcomes of patients who were admitted
      to the 22-bed paediatric inpatient unit and were less than 18 years of age at hospital
      admission, and the healthcare professionals caring for them during their inpatient stay.
