      lead to tumor induced osteomalacia/osteogenic osteomalacia (TIO/OOM). Patients with TIO/OOM
      suffer years of significant morbidity and debilitation unless their tumors, which are
      notoriously difficult to locate, are removed.

      Selective venous catheterization has been used to localize hormonally active neoplasms by
      demonstrating a gradient in the concentration of the hormone of interest between the vessel
      immediately draining the tumor site and the peripheral circulation. The primary objective of
      this protocol is to evaluate the utility of combining selective venous catheterization with
      biochemical assays that identify phosphatonins in the serum as a way to identify phosphatonin
      gradients and thereby localize phosphaturic tumors.

      Our study population will consist of TIO/OOM patients with non-localized phosphaturic tumors
      as well as five patients whose lesions have been identified with some certainty by
      conventional imaging techniques. These individuals will undergo selective venous
      catheterization during which blood samples will be obtained and processed for the presence of
      phosphatonins. The primary endpoint will be met if a gradient indicating a possible tumor is
      found, focused clinical imaging in the appropriate anatomical sub-region identifies a lesion,
      and the lesion is confirmed to be a phosphaturic mesenchymal tumor upon surgical removal.
