      periods of increased stress and as a marker of underlying medical conditions. The goal of
      this project is to collect VOCs within the breath in the initial stages of delivery in
      otherwise healthy parturients undergoing induction of labor. In addition to a panel of
      metabolites, we will obtain information on the 3400 compounds which compose the breath
      metabolome by gas mass spectrometry technology. This is the first step of a larger planned
      project to develop specialized panels of breath signatures during labor and delivery in
      parturients.

      We will collect breath samples at bedside and measure metabolites in the laboratory. This is
      a feasibility study which we will use to determine normal values for a term parturient and
      changes of VOCs during the course of labor. We will also use this data to construct a power
      analysis and perform a follow-up study to test whether VOCs are associated with different
      aspects of pregnancy.
