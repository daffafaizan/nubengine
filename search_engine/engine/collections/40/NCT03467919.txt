    
      This study will be a randomized controlled trial to compare outcomes between intra-articular
      injection of Micro Fragmented Adipose Tissue and intra-articular injection of corticosteroid
      in patients with mild to moderate osteoarthritis of the knee. Micro Fragmented Adipose Tissue
      will be harvested at the subcutaneous tissue by lipoaspiration. Once fat tissue is obtained,
      it will be processed with minimal manipulation in the clinic room.

      To be considered for participation in this study, patients must have radiographic evidence of
      mild to moderate osteoarthritis of medial and/or lateral weight-bearing compartments
      (Kellgren-Lawrence Grade 2 or 3). In addition, patients must meet several inclusion/exclusion
      criteria to be randomized and included in this study.
