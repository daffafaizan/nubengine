      common bile duct. The prognosis of patients with advanced unresectable EHCC is very poor with
      a median survival of 3 to 6 months. Active control of tumor growth is the key to extending
      stent patency and survival for patients with unresectable locally advanced EHCC. Photodynamic
      therapy (PDT) is by far the only modality that has shown to improve stent patency as well as
      over survival (OS) in patients with cholangiocarcinoma. In an attempt to improve stent
      patency placed for malignant biliary obstruction, enthusiasm for endoscopic retrograde
      cholangio-pancreatography (ERCP)-guided radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has been increasing in
      recent years. The HABIBTM EndoHBP catheter is an endoscopic bipolar RFA catheter with proven
      safety and effectiveness for biliary RFA of cholangiocarcinoma. Many studies have shown that
      endoscopic RFA extends stent patency and possibly the survival of patients with malignant
      biliary obstruction. However, there are few reports comparing the clinical efficacy and
      advers event of these two endoscopic treatment.
