      half of those who fall require medical attention for injuries. To make matters worse, a fall
      can result in activity curtailment, physiological deconditioning, and institutionalization.
      Importantly, balance dysfunction, muscle weakness, and spasticity are modifiable risk factors
      for falls among community-dwelling older adults and likely persons with MS. Indeed, there is
      evidence that these physiological risk factors can be minimized with exercise training in
      persons with MS and this might translate into a decrease in fall risk as documented in
      community-dwelling older adults. To that end, an appropriately designed exercise training
      program that targets specific, modifiable risk factors might be effective for decreasing the
      fall risk in persons with MS.

      The investigation will examine the effectiveness of a home-based exercise program that is
      designed to reduce fall risk by targeting specific fall risk factors including balance
      dysfunction and two of its latent causes, muscle weakness and spasticity in persons with
      multiple sclerosis. It is predicted that persons who receive home-based exercise program will
      have a reduction in fall risk.

      Participants will undergo multidimensional assessment of walking, balance, muscle strength,
      spasticity and fall risk prior to and immediately following the 12 week intervention.
      Following baseline assessment participants will be randomized into intervention or control
      groups. The intervention group will receive exercise instruction 4 times over 2 months. The
      home-based exercise protocol will focus on improving balance, walking, lower limb and core
      muscle strength, and spasticity, all potential determinants of falling.
