    
      Part 1: Dosing Periods 1, 2, 3, and 4:

      Single-dose, partially randomized, 4-period crossover study to evaluate 5 g OCR-002 oral
      solution administered under fed conditions, fasting conditions, or under fasting conditions
      following discontinuation of lactulose in 12 subjects with cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class A and
      C).

      The purpose is to determine the pharmacokinetics of phenylacetic acid (PAA) and
      phenylacetylglutamine (PAGN) following a single 5 g dose of OCR-002 oral solution
      administered under fed conditions, fasting conditions, or under fasting conditions following
      discontinuation of lactulose as compared to a single 5 g intravenous dose of OCR-002 under
      fasting conditions in subjects with cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class A and C).

      Analysis of pharmacokinetic data will be conducted after completion of Part 1 in order to
      determine the dose regimen of OCR-002 oral tablets to use in Part 2 of the study.

      Part 2: Dosing Periods 1, 2 and 3:

      Multiple-dose, randomized, 3-period crossover study to evaluate OCR-002 oral tablets in
      subjects with cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class B). The purpose is to characterize the PK and
      pharmacodynamic (PD) of OCR-002 tablets after TID administration for 5 days in subjects with
      cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class B).
