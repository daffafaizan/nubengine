    
      Patients with IBS of various kind (constipation-dominant, diarrhea-dominant, and mixed form)
      in large numbers are studied as regards orocecal transit time and compared to healthy
      controls.

      Inclusion criteria: IBS patients 18-80 years old, diagnosis of IBS; exclusion: Severe
      cardiac, pulmonary, liver or kidney disease, bloody stool After fasting for 12 hours, all
      subjects ingest 10 grams of lactulose. Hydrogen production, measured as hydrogen
      concentration in breath, is estimated at 10-minute intervals for a period of 240 minutes. The
      orocecal transit transit time is measured from ingestion of the lactulose solution until
      hydrogen peaks to 10 and 20 ppm when passing the ileocecal valve, being fermented by the
      cecal microflora. Data are compared to those of healthy volunteers.

      The peak value of fermentation as read by hydrogen levels (ppm) captured after passage of the
      ilecocecal valve orocecal valve signifies the gas production of the micro13flora. Comparison
      are made between IBS patients and healthy subjects as regards orocecal transit time and peak
      fermentation in the cecum.
