      (HUNT4), conducted on HUNT4 participants aged 20 to 65 years from the geographical areas
      Nord-Trøndelag and the city of Trondheim. The targeted sample size was 4,000 participants,
      and 16,602 persons from the study population of HUNT4 participants were invited to reach this
      goal. The only exclusion criterion was insufficient understanding of Norwegian or English.
      The investigators had complete lists with postal addresses and mobile phone numbers for all
      eligible participants as well as information about date of birth and gender. Potential
      participants were sampled in repeated probability sampling draws over the course of the
      data-collection period, which lasted from November 2nd 2018 to September 18th 2020. Younger
      persons were oversampled to adjust for the expected larger nonparticipation among these
      age-groups. The predesignated participants were informed about the project through postal
      letters. A week after receipt of the letter, each received an SMS with information on how to
      sign up for the psychiatric interview. One SMS reminder was sent to persons who did not
      respond to the initial invitation. The investigators made four contact attempts to schedule
      the interview amongst those who registered; three by phone and one final by SMS. All
      participants received a $30 gift card as a token of appreciation. Computer assisted
      face-to-face or telephone interviews were conducted by trained and certified interviewers at
      local field stations. The World Health Organization (WHO) Composite International Diagnostic
      Interview, fifth version (CIDI 5.0) was used as instrument in the data-collection.
