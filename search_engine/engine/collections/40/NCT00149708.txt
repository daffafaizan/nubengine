      cardiovascular risk profile, including inflammatory markers of cardiovascular relevance,
      muscle strength, bone density and bone metabolism, and thyroid status of twenty GH-na√Øve
      adult GHD subjects who are homozygous for a null GHRHR mutation and to compare them with
      twenty age- and sex- matched normal controls from the same population.

      SPECIFIC AIM 2: To observe the changes in all the above parameters that occur in GHD subjects
      after a 6-months treatment with hGH replacement, and their reversibility after a 6-months
      washout period.

      SPECIFIC AIM 3: To determine effect of heterozygosity for the GHRHR mutation. To this end, we
      propose to genotype a large number of apparently normal members of the Itabaianinha community
      with the goal of separating subjects homozygous for the wild-type allele from subjects
      heterozygous for the GHRHR mutation, and to compare their phenotype with the one observed in
      subjects homozygous for the wild type allele residing in the same geographical area.

      Together, these studies will determine the effect of lifetime absence of GH on multiple organ
      functions and their response to hGH therapy, and will tell if heterozygosity for mutations in
      the GHRHR gene is associated with a detectable phenotype.
