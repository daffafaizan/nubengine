      critical period of speech development between 2.5 and 12 years of age. During this critical
      period there is considerably greater brain plasticity for speech functioning which disappears
      following puberty. Our purpose is to determine how normal brain organization for speech
      production and perception develops during the critical period and how this normal pattern is
      altered when stuttering and phonological disorders become chronic problems, persisting
      throughout the life span. Functional MRI and magnetoencephalography (MEG) are non-invasive
      methodologies suitable for research in these disorders in children. New methodologies using
      fMRI and MEG provide the first opportunity for the study of speech production both in
      normally developing children as well as children and adults with stuttering and/or
      phonological disorders. Our hypothesis is that, with development, the brain organization for
      speech production becomes less distributed involving fewer brain regions, and that
      phonological processing mechanisms become lateralized to the left hemisphere during the
      critical period of speech development. This research will address whether the brain regions
      involved in speech are more diffuse and less selective in persons who develop chronic
      stuttering and phonological disorders, leading to a less efficient dynamic system for speech
      production.
