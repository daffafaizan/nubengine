      hyperextension group (KH group). In knee hyperextension group, investigators will include
      college athletes having knee hyperextension alignment, no lower extremity injuries in past
      three months, and participating in jump-landing activities. Control group will match the
      gender, age, height, weight and sports to KH group. Inclusion criteria is the same as KH
      group, except the knee hyperextension angle is <5⁰ in control group. Every subjects will
      receive the first time assessment and follow up by filling the injury-follow-up form every
      months for about four months.

      At the first assessment, investigators will measure lower extremity alignments include pelvic
      angle in sagittal plane, hip anteversion, tibiofemoral angle, knee hyperextension angle in
      supine and standing position, tibial rotation angle, and navicular drop; lower extremity
      muscle flexibility include rectus femoris, hamstrings, gastrocnemius, soleus, iliotibial
      band; lower extremity muscle strength include hip, knee, muscle group; dynamic control task
      will record tibio-femoral acceleration, angle change ground reaction force and EMG muscle
      firing during vertical jump and drop jump.
