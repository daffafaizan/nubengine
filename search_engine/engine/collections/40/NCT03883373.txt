      to suffer from a clef lip and palate or alveolar cleft and had to have an alveolar bone graft
      with gingivo-periosteoplasty in the pediatric plastic surgery unit of the Montpellier
      hospital from June 1999 to Mai 2016. They were divided into two groups : the first with
      patients who had a cortical and cancellous bone graft and the second with patients who had a
      cancellous graft only.

      Both groups were followed 6 mounts after the operation to look for the occurence of
      complications which lead to a graft loss. Bilateral cleft are seen as 2 graft events
