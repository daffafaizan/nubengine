      reserves are difficult to measure. This also makes an important difference related to brain
      tumor patients, who may be burdened with systemic disease, alterations in cognition, or
      affected by other comorbidities. When assessing quality of life for brain tumor patients,
      having a better predictor of postsurgical outcome would be beneficial in appropriately
      counseling these patients. Frailty is thought to estimate physiologic reserves, and its use
      has been found to predict postoperative complications, length of stay, and discharge to a
      skilled or assisted-living facility in neurosurgical patients. Frailty as an adjunct to
      preoperative assessment of neurosurgical patients has never been evaluated. This study aims
      to determine if frailty predicts neurosurgical complications in brain tumor patients and
      enhances current perioperative risk models.
