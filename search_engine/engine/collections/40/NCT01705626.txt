      progressive neurodegenerative disease, with fatal outcome occurring within ten years after
      onset. Familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP) associated with mutations in the transthyretin
      (TTR) gene is the most common form of genetic amyloidosis. It accounts several thousand cases
      worldwide, with Val30Met mutation identified in most patients and with endemic foci in
      Portugal, Sweden and Japan.

      TTR FAP is caused by the systemic deposition of amyloidogenic variants of the transthyretin
      protein ((Ttr) in the extra-cellular space of tissues and result in disruption of organ
      function.The typical presentation of TTR-FAP is a progressive sensory-motor polyneuropathy,
      which usually begins with loss of thermal and pain sensation in the feet, slowly ascends up
      the limbs and is associated with variable autonomic disturbances and extra-neurological
      manifestations (especially a cardiomyopathy).

      The goal of the TRAP2.1 Study is to investigate the prevalence of Transthyretin-Related
      Familial Amyloidotic Polyneuropathy (TTR-FAP) in a cohort of 500 subjects with small fiber
      polyneuropathy of no obvious etiology, based on the subject's clinical presentation.
