      consumed per day and per week as part of a Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern. The predominant
      protein sources include lean meats, poultry, and eggs, however, nuts, seeds, and soy products
      are also included. Ounce-equivalents (oz-eq) are used as a standard unit of measure to
      compare animal to non-animal protein sources. One oz-eq of lean meat (1 oz) is equal to 0.5
      oz of nuts (1 oz-eq), 0.25 cups (1 oz-eq) of beans, and one whole egg (1 oz-eq). One
      limitation of this unit of measure is that the protein quantity and quality of the foods are
      not considered. For example, 1 oz-eq of pork loin contains ~7 g of dietary protein whereas 1
      oz-eq of almonds contains 3 g of protein. Consequently, consuming an oz-eq portion of protein
      foods from different sources could have different effects on the anabolic response to
      feeding. The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of consuming ounce equivalent
      portions of fresh pork versus nuts, beans, and eggs on essential amino acid substrate
      availability for protein anabolism. While it would seem intuitive that this research would
      show that higher protein intakes from pork and egg will lead to higher plasma essential amino
      acid responses, this research is paramount to addressing the shortcoming of using oz-eq to
      achieve the Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommendations for Protein Foods. This research
      will serve as an important resource for future Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committees to
      reevaluate the appropriateness of equating animal- and plant-based Protein Foods on the
      current ounce-equivalent basis.
