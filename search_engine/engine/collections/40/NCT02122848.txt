      The airway pressure as adjuvant of cardiac rehabilitation has demonstrated improvement of
      functional capacity, decrease of respiratory work, increase of oxygenation and pulmonary
      compliance. Objective: to evaluate the effectiveness of the bilevel positive airway pressure
      (BILEVEL) in the increase of exercise tolerance in patients with decompensated heart failure.
      Method: this is a cross-over randomized clinical trial, with individuals who will undergo a
      submaximal progressive exercise test of the lower limbs with a cycle-ergometer using
      continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and BILEVEL in a random order. Patients will also
      be evaluated using a health related quality of life questionnaire, pulmonary function test,
      inspiratory muscle and peripheral muscle strength tests. Hypothesis: The increase in exercise
      tolerance might be greater during the use of BILEVEL.
