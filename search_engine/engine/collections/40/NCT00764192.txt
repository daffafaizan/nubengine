      patients undergoing chronic haemodialysis (HD).1 During haemodialysis (HD) the endothelium is
      the first organ to sense and to be impaired by mechanical and immunological stimuli.2
      Adequate endothelial function and integrity reduce thromboembolic events, while endothelial
      dysfunction is an early key step in the development of atherosclerosis3-5, is involved in
      plaque progression6 and has been attributed to impaired nitric oxide (NO) bioactivity and
      enhanced formation of oxygen-derived free radicals.7 Given that endothelial dysfunction is at
      least in part reversible, the assessment of altered NO availability is of important
      diagnostic and prognostic significance and may deepen the understanding of cardiovascular
      disease in HD.8 Nitric oxide bioavailability has been shown to be limited by cell-free
      hemoglobin.9 The rates of NO consumption by cell-free and intraerythrocytic hemoglobin
      suggest that only when hemoglobin is physically compartmentalized within erythrocytes will NO
      produced by endothelial cells reach concentrations within smooth muscle necessary to activate
      guanylyl cyclase and cause vasodilation.10;11 However, the rate of NO scavenging is reduced
      1,000-fold by sequestering hemoglobin within the red cell membrane.12;13 This mechanism is
      believed to be important in various conditions of health and disease.14-16 In ESRD
      intravascular hemolysis during HD has been described.17-19
