      group consisted of healthy pregnant participants. The third group consisted of healthy,
      non-pregnant women at the reproductive age. Macular, choroid and retinal nerve fiber layer
      (RNFL) thicknesses were evaluated in patients with GDM and comparisons were made among GDM,
      healthy pregnant and healthy non-pregnant subjects for these parameters by using optic
      cohorence tomography.
