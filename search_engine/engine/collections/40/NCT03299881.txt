    
      This study employs a randomized, adaptive, parallel arm study in which, cohorts of enrolled
      subjects (25 per arm) are assessed for dose response and progression to achievement of
      primary and secondary endpoints. Enrollment will be up to 300 subjects at 4 US centers.

      After signing informed consent, subjects will be screened during a one week
      screening/baseline period to determine if they meet the inclusion criteria and exhibit none
      of the exclusion criteria. Weight, blood pressure, blood lipids, HgA1c, pregnancy test (for
      women of childbearing age), and patient questionnaires will be collected. If eligible,
      subjects will be randomized to treatment or control groups. The treatment group will receive
      training on the Elira Wearable Patch System and the first TENS session will be administered
      in the investigators office. Both groups will receive an electronic scale and instructions on
      1200 calorie diet as well as diary completion requirements to be completed throughout the
      study. All subjects will be required to have in office follow-up visits every 4 weeks for 12
      weeks. Up to 2 additional follow-up visits will be permitted within that 12 week time period.
