      with hand gestures and auditory rhythmic cues on intelligibility and speech naturalness in
      Spanish-accented speakers of English in two pathology groups: ataxic dysarthria and
      hypokinetic dysarthria secondary to idiopathic Parkinson's disease; and ii) the extent to
      which speech rate and effort are control parameters of entrainment. These objectives will be
      achieved with the following specific aims:

      Specific Aim 1: Determine the effect of three rates of hand gestures and auditory rhythmic
      cues and the degree to which learning and carry-over occur.

      Specific Aim 2: Determine the effect of increased speech effort, operationalized as clear
      speech, and the interaction effect of clear speech with hand gestures and auditory rhythmic
      cues.

      Specific Aim 3: Investigate the perception of speech rhythm and its relationship to
      entrainment.

      The protocol calls for 12 talkers to participate in a single case experimental design: 6
      Spanish-accented speakers of English and 6 native English speakers, and each language group
      consisting of 2 healthy controls, 2 adults diagnosed with ataxic dysarthria and 2 adults
      diagnosed with hypokinetic dysarthria secondary to idiopathic Parkinson's disease. Sixty
      monolingual healthy adult listeners will rate intelligibility, accentedness, and ease of
      understanding.
