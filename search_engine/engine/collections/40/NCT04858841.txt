      however, the number of stroke survivors living with morbidity has increased significantly.
      Among the morbidities, seizures and epilepsy are not uncommon and post-stroke epilepsy has
      been identified as a significant clinical issue in stroke survivors. As we know, stroke is
      the most common cause of epilepsy in older adults and for patients aged more than 65,
      post-stroke epilepsy accounts for 30-50% of new-onset seizures (Tanaka and Ihara, 2017). The
      incidence of early seizures (occurring within the first 1-2 weeks of stroke) is between
      2.4-5.4% and the risk of post-stroke late seizures (seizures occur later than 14 days of
      stroke) is around 7-18% (Shetty, 2013; Tanaka and Ihara, 2017). The stroke severity, location
      and type of pathological changes, genetic factors and pre-injury and post-injury exposure to
      non-genetic factors such as exposome can divide patients with ischemic stroke into different
      susceptibility (Pitkanen et al., 2016) and the standardized morbidity rate of developing
      epilepsy is highest during the first year. Our previous study also documented seizures during
      stroke presentation and during hospitalization would worsen the overall morbidity and
      mortality (Huang et al., 2014), suggesting the importance of awareness in seizure care in
      acute ischemic stroke. In addition, studies showed higher National Institutes of Health
      Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score, cortical involvement younger age, central nervous system (CNS)
      morbidities are associated with higher risk of post-stroke epilepsy (Tanaka and Ihara, 2017).

      Occurrence of post-stroke epileptic seizure would lead to long-term poor prognosis and
      increased mortality (Bladin et al., 2000; Labovitz et al., 2001), and the post-stroke
      epilepsy has a high recurrence rate (Tanaka et al., 2017), which might lead to anxiety and
      worsen quality of life in the stroke survivors. As current treatments only focus on
      anti-seizure/anti-convulsion, based on our understanding of the epileptogenesis, we aim to
      develop a potential prophylactic treatment on patients with acute severe stroke to prevent
      from late occurrence of seizures and epilepsy.

      Process of epileptogenesis is classically thought to occur in three phases: first the
      occurrence of a precipitating injury or event; second, a 'latent' period during which changes
      set in motion by the preceding injury act to transform the previously normal brain into an
      epileptic brain; and third, chronic, established epilepsy. It is during the latent period
      that the process of acquired epileptogenesis is thought to coalesce, and it is at this point
      in the process that interventions might be used to prevent the subsequent development of
      epilepsy (Goldberg and Coulter, 2013; Kikuyama et al., 2017). We have previously done
      researches on the medications that might have potential of anti-epileptogenesis in
      pilocarpine-induced animal models, supporting the concept of anti-epileptogenesis, giving
      intervention immediately following a brain insult (Lai et al., 2018, Hung et al., 2019).

      Potential medications with potential of anti-epileptogenesis Based on our clinical
      experience, and laboratory researches (Huang et al., 2009, 2013; Lai et al., 2018; Hung et
      al., 2019), we have noted two newer AEDs with potential of anti-epileptogenesis. LEV, a
      current standard AED with a distinct synaptic vesicle modulating mechanism, has been
      demonstrated its potential in ameliorating epileptogenesis (Itoh et al., 2016; Kikuyama et
      al., 2017). Synaptic vesicle 2A (SV2A) is considered to play an important role for synaptic
      vesicle recycling and neurotransmitter excretion to the synaptic cleft, because mice lacking
      SV2A failed to grow, experienced severe seizures, and died within 3 weeks (Crowder et al.,
      1999). A clear correlation was seen between the affinity of LEV and its analogues to SV2A and
      the potency of their antiseizure protection in the mouse audiogenic model of epilepsy (Lynch
      et al., 2004). Furthermore, the LEV-treated adult male Node epileptic rats showed a
      significant increase of Bax/Bcl-2 mRNA expression ratio in the prefrontal cortex than the
      control group, but no change in the Bax/Bcl-2 mRNA expression ratio in hippocampus,
      suggesting the mechanism of acquired anti-epileptogenesis by LEV may be similar to
      spontaneous recovery of idiopathic generalized epilepsy during adolescence (Kikuyama et al.,
      2017). Our earlier study suggests its broad spectrum of modulating neuronal excitability
      (Huang et al., 2009). It is not metabolized through the P-450 hepatic cytochrome system and
      has not clinically relevant drug-drug interactions (Rosati et al., 2010). It has also been
      suggested as a first-choice drug against post-stroke seizures, based on safety and efficacy
      profiles in clinical studies (Belcastro et al., 2008). Thus, it is potentially worth
      investigation in primary prevention for patients with acute major stroke.

      Perampanel (PER), a current standard antiepileptic drug with a distinct mechanism of
      selective non-competitive antagonist of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic
      acid (AMPA)-type receptors, has also been demonstrated its efficacy in treatment
      wide-spectrum epileptic seizures with good tolerability profile (Tyrlikova et al., 2008).
      Based on its block of glutamate excitotoxicity, PER is theoretically capable of modulating
      epileptogenesis and it has been demonstrated its potential in ameliorating epileptogenesis
      (Mohammad et al., 2019; Dupuis et al., 2017). As we know, the AMPA receptor has become a
      therapeutic target due to its involvement in ictogenesis and epileptogenesis. GluA2 subunit
      plays a role in calcium permeability. Thereby, AMPA receptor-mediated calcium signaling
      increases affects brain excitability. Recent report indicated that perampanel can block both
      calcium permeable and calcium in permeable AMPA receptors (Barygin et al., 2016). Our recent
      study on PER pharmacology also revealed it, for the first time, could inhibit voltage-gated
      sodium channels, suggesting its broad-spectrum properties in modulating neuronal excitability
      (Lai et al., 2019). Thus, it is potentially justified to evaluate if early administration of
      PER in patients with acute major stroke as a prophylactic therapy could hamper the
      development of epileptogenesis and the later post-stroke epilepsy.

      Purpose of our study We aim to investigate if early administration of AEDs with potential
      anti-epileptogenesis could prevent the development of post-stroke epilepsy (primary
      prevention).
