      internal acoustic stimulus. It is a frequent problem which can interfere significantly with
      the ability to lead a normal life. Treatment remains difficult. Most available therapies
      focus on habituation rather than treating the cause. Tinnitus has been shown to be associated
      with functional reorganization of auditory neural pathways and tonotopic maps in the central
      auditory system. Consequently, low-frequency Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation
      (rTMS) applied to the temporoparietal areas has been investigated for the treatment of
      tinnitus. Additionally, there is growing evidence that a neural network of both auditory and
      non-auditory cortical areas is involved in the pathophysiology of chronic subjective
      tinnitus. Targeting several core regions of this network by rTMS might constitute a promising
      strategy to enhance treatment effects. A new multisite treatment protocol which is supposed
      to have an effect on both auditory and non-auditory cortical areas will be examined with
      regard to feasibility, safety and clinical efficacy in patients suffering from chronic
      tinnitus in a controlled pilot trial.
