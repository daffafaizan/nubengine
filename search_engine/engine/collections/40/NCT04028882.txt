      profiles of immune activation may be distinguished, each favouring particular comorbidities.
      Using a panel of 68 soluble and cell surface markers, the investigators have previously
      measured the level of activation in circulating Cluster of Differentiation 4+ (CD4+) and
      Cluster of Differentiation 8+ (CD8+), T cells, B cells, monocytes, Natural Killers (NK)
      cells, neutrophils, and endothelial cells as well as of inflammation and fibrinolysis in 120
      virologic responders over 45 years of age. Two independent hierarchical clustering analyses
      allowed the investigators to identify five patient groups, each with the same activation
      profile. One of these profiles, Profile#2, was strongly associated with hyperinsulinemia
      (Psomas et al., 2016).

      The main objective of the present study is to better define Profile#2. To this aim, the
      investigators will analyze by mass spectrometry the metabolites in the plasma of patients
      with various profiles including the one of interest. Concurrently, the investigators will
      perform an RiboNucleic Acid Sequencing (RNASeq) analysis on peripheral blood mononuclear
      cells (PBMC) from the same patients. These metabolomic and transcriptomic data will help to
      better define the immune activation profiles.

      The secondary objective is to test whether the link the investigators have observed between
      Profile#2 and insulin resistance is causative. To this aim, by following over time patients'
      insulinemia, the investigators will test whether Profile#2 is predictive of an increase in
      insulinemia. The investigators will also look for factors released by PBMC of patients with
      Profile#2 able to induce insulin resistance.
