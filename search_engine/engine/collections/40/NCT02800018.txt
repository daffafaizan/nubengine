      hypoxia-ischaemia is frequent ,1-2 per 1000 life born neonates are affected. Hypoxic
      ischaemic encephalopathy is one of the most important causes for adverse neurodevelopmental
      outcome, cerebral palsy, epilepsy and hearing and vision deficiencies in term and near term
      neonates. Til now, hypothermia therapy is the only therapy reducing the risk of adverse
      neurodevelopmental outcome and is nowadays standard of care. In this study investigators
      would like to analyse perinatal risk factors causing HIE and their influence on the Sarnat
      Score on day 1 and 3 of life (during hypothermia therapy) and on day 4 of life (after
      hypothermia therapy).
