    
      The study is designed to formally demonstrate the superiority of F8IL10 vs placebo and to
      further evaluate safety and efficacy of two different dosages of F8IL10 when administered to
      patients receiving MTX.

      Patients will be enrolled and double-blind, parallel assigned (via automated randomization
      system) in a 1:1:1 fashion to one of three different arms:

        -  Arm 1: placebo + MTX

        -  Arm 2: F8IL10 30 µg/kg + MTX

        -  Arm 3: F8IL10 160 µg/kg + MTX

      F8IL10 or placebo will be subcutaneously injected once a week for 8 weeks. Treatment will
      terminate at the earliest of the following: completion of the 8 weeks of therapy, withdrawal
      of informed consent, unacceptable toxicity/intolerability of the study drug or need to
      increase MTX, oral corticosteroids or NSAIDs dosages above baseline levels or need to
      introduce a new DMARD or biologic therapy to control rheumatoid arthritis activity. The study
      will be conducted in a double blind fashion.
