      surgery under general anesthesia with continuous infusion of 2% propofol and remifentanil.

      After dividing them into two groups, investigators monitor pain threshold index and wavelet
      index in test group and adjust remifentanil infusion to maintain both indices in desirable
      range, while monitoring only wavelet index and adjust remifentanil infusion to maintain
      wavelet index and conventional vital signs in desirable range in control group.

      Investigators compare consumption of remifentanil, time to extubation after surgery, and
      post-anesthesia care unit length of stay between both groups.
