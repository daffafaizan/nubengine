      Mild (Few papules and/or pustules; mild erythema; mild to moderate degree of telangiectasia
      may be present); 3 - Mild to moderate (Distinct number of papules and/or pustules; mild to
      moderate erythema; mild to moderate degree of telangiectasia may be present); 4 - Moderate
      (Pronounced number of papules and/or pustules; moderate erythema; mild to moderate degree of
      telangiectasia may be present); 5 - Moderate to severe (Many papules and/or pustules,
      occasionally with large inflamed lesions; moderate erythema; moderate degree of
      telangiectasia may be present); 6 - Severe (Numerous papules and/or pustules, occasionally
