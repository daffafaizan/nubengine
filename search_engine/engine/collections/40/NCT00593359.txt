      preoperatively, on the day of surgery and during surgery. Eye pressure will be measured
      before surgery, every 30 minutes throughout your surgery and every hour for 4 hours following
      surgery. Subjects will be evaluated before surgery and on days 5, 8, 15 after surgery. During
      these evaluations, the subject will be asked questions about recovery and his/her eyes will
      be checked by an ophthalmologist and vision will be tested.
