      of surgeon, anesthesiologist, and evaluator are blinded to CTCA results. We hypothesize that
      the preoperative use of noninvasive computer tomography, with the 320-row MDCT, to visualize
      the degree of coronary artery stenosis can lead to improved clinical prediction of
      perioperative cardiac complications.

      The 320-row MDCT is based on the 64-row technology with the significant addition of a larger
      detector capable of scanning the heart within 1 sec or a cardiac cycle, thereby, eliminating
      patient-related artifacts and may produce higher image quality.13, 14 The scanning time of 5
      seconds with the 320-row MDCT is significantly reduced compared to 8-10 seconds for the
      64-row MDCT
