      stimulation in the treatment of overactive bladder.The study will adopt a longitudinal
      research design with randomized quasi-experimental trial.The patients will recruited and be
      randomly assigned to Group A (Parasacral transcutaneous electrical stimulation) or Group B
      (Intravaginal electrical stimulation). There will be 30 participants in each group. Data will
      be collected 2 times.
