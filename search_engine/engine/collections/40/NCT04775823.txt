      to cover and protect weak tooth structure. In tooth wear patients, multiple factors
      attributing to destruct their teeth. The durability and strength of the resotrative material
      must be reinforced. Nanoceramic infiltrated in composite resin may enhance its mechanical
      characteristics. Therefore, hybrid composite-nanoceramic material may be effective for tooth
      wear patients.
