      I. To determine the complete hematologic response (CR)/complete response incomplete (CRi)
      rate when sapanisertib (MLN0128 [TAK-228]) is administered to adult patients with
      relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the overall response rate (CR, CRi/partial response (PR)/morphologic leukemia
      free state [MLFS]).

      II. To determine the CR/CRi duration when MLN0128 (TAK-228) is administered to adult patients
      with relapsed/refractory ALL.

      III. To determine the frequency of proceeding to allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT)
      for patients with relapsed/refractory ALL who achieve a response on MLN0128 (TAK-228).

      IV. To determine the overall survival for relapsed/refractory ALL patients on MLN0128
      (TAK-228).

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To examine the pharmacokinetics of MLN0128 (TAK-228) in ALL patients. II. To assess
      whether phosphorylation of the mTOR substrate 4EBP1 decreases in leukemic blasts harvested
      from the bone marrow on day 8 compared to baseline.

      III. To assess in an exploratory fashion whether MLN0128 (TAK-228) enhances expression of the
      pro-apoptotic proteins Bim and Puma in marrow ALL cells.

      IV. To assess in an exploratory fashion whether Mcl-1 levels decrease in blast cells during
      MLN0128 (TAK-228) treatment.

      V. To assess in an exploratory fashion whether a) the phospho-protein pattern at baseline or
      b) MLN0128 (TAK-228)-associated changes in the phospho-protein pattern differs between ALL
      samples that respond to therapy and those that do not.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive sapanisertib orally (PO) daily on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 28 days in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who are non-responders
      and in PR at the end of course 4 may receive sapanisertib PO daily on days 1-28. Courses
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months.
