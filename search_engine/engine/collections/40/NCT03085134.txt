    
      Infants with physician diagnosed CMPA, aged between birth and 6 months of age will take
      either the control or new test infant formula for 4 months and if judged suitable by
      physician, up to maximum of 12 months of age. Growth, adverse events, medication use and
      tolerance to formula will be assessed. As part of exploratory objectives, the study will also
      explore possible mode of action of the Test formula in CMPA infants, by assessing whether
      consumption of Test formula by CMPA infants affects stool microbiota and metabolic signatures
      as well as urine metabolic signatures and whether such changes can be associated to the
      intestinal inflammatory/health status, and the clinical measures.
