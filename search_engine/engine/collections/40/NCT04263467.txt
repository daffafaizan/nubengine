      and survivors both during and after anti-cancer treatment, including improved physical
      function, reduction of symptoms, reduction of side effects and improved quality of life
      (QoL). In addition, a physical active lifestyle is associated with reduced risk of some
      cancers. Recent data in mouse models have shown that tumor-bearing mice randomized to a
      voluntary wheel running group showed over 60% reduction in tumor incidence and progression in
      several tumor models. Moreover, the mouse data clearly showed homing of T and natural killer
      (NK) cells to tumors in an exercise dependent manner, underscoring that exercise may render
      patients more prone to respond to therapy. However, most of the underlying biological
      mechanisms leading to the documented beneficial effects of physical exercise in relation to
      cancer are yet unknown, but exercise-mediated changes in hormone levels, inflammation and
      immune cell function are thought to play a key role.

      Included participants will be randomized 1:1 to an intervention group and a control group.
      Participants in the intervention group will receive a six-weeks exercise-based intervention
      with supervised and group-based exercise training three times a week at the hospital setting.
      Each training session will consist of intermediate and high intensity interval training. The
      exercise-based intervention will be combined with standard oncological treatments; checkpoint
      inhibitors, checkpoint inhibitors combined with chemotherapy or oncological surveillance.
      Participants in the control group will still receive standard oncological treatments; immune
      checkpoint inhibitors, checkpoint inhibitors combined with chemotherapy or oncological
      surveillance.
