      immunotherapy of durvalumab can improve the anti-tumor activity of nab-paclitaxel in subjects
      with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have received no more than one prior
      chemotherapy regimen for their advanced disease. It will further assess efficacy and safety
      of nab-paclitaxel monotherapy in this setting. Each subject will receive study therapy as
      second- or third-line of treatment. Approximately 240 male and female subjects with advanced
      NSCLC will be assigned to one of the following treatment arms (approximately 80 subjects per
      group): nab-paclitaxel /CC-486 combination therapy, nab-paclitaxel/durvalumab combination
      therapy or nab-paclitaxel monotherapy prior to receiving first dose of Investigational
      Product. A permuted-block randomization method will be employed to assign the subjects among
      the treatment arms that are enrolling simultaneously, when applicable, stratified by the
      following baseline factors: ECOG performance status (0 versus 1), gender (males versus
      females), and smoker (yes versus no). Treatment assignments of subjects to the
      nab-paclitaxel/CC-486 combination therapy and nab-paclitaxel monotherapy arms will be
      conducted completely in a randomized fashion.
