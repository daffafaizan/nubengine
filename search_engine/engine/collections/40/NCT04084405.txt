      2017). According to the WHO, COPD would be the third leading cause of death by 2030 (WHO,
      2017). This disease is characterized by airflow limitation that is not fully reversible. The
      airflow limitation is usually progressive and associated with an abnormal inflammatory
      response of the lung to noxious particles or gases(GOLD, 2017). However, emerging data showed
      that COPD patients demonstrate important deficits in balance and control which associated to
      a high risk of fall ( Butcher et al, 2004 ; Smith et al, 2009 ; Beauchamp et al, 2009 ;
      Beauchamp et al, 2010). Inspiratory muscle training (IMT) has been shown to be an effective
      modality for COPD patients for improving the maximal inspiratory muscle strength, the dyspnea
      and health-related quality of life (GI COPD, 2016). However, the effect of inspiratory muscle
      training on balance is not studying. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of
      the inspiratory muscles training on balance in COPD patients.
