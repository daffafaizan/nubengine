    
      PaRIS-IOR is a prospective observational study that aims to collect and analyze functional
      outcomes and quality of life reported by patients undergoing elective hip, knee and shoulder
      arthroplasty at the IRCCS Rizzoli Orthopedic Institute (IOR). IOR was selected as a pilot
      center for the launch of the OECD's PaRIS Initiative in Italy, whose purpose is to accelerate
      the adoption and reporting of validated, standardised, internationally-comparable
      patient-reported indicators, particularly within patient registries.

      PaRIS-IOR's study population will consist of consecutive patients undergoing hip, knee and
      shoulder arthroplasty performed at 6 Operative Units of the IOR. The study will last 30
      months and will include a 12-month recruitment period, a 12-month follow-up and 6 months for
      data analysis and reporting. Functional outcomes and quality of life will be detected through
      the administration of validated questionnaires (EQ-5D, HOOS, KOOS, ASES). The questionnaires
      will be administered in the month preceding the surgical procedure in the clinic or in the
      ward, while the 2 follow-up questionnaires will be send by mail at patients' home. The
      collected data will be combined with those routinely collected by the Registry of Orthopedic
      Prosthetic Implantology (RIPO), already active at the IOR since year 1990.
