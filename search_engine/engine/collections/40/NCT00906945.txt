      resistance. We hypothesize that by disrupting the interaction of leukemic blasts with the
      bone marrow microenvironment, we may sensitize leukemic blasts to the effects of cytotoxic
      chemotherapy. In this study, we seek to maximize blockage of the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis through the
      following:

        1. Addition of G-CSF, which down regulates SDF-1 expression and acts synergistically with
           plerixafor in stem cell mobilization

        2. Intravenous instead of subcutaneous dosing of plerixafor to improve kinetics of
           administration.

        3. Dose escalation of plerixafor and twice daily dosing to maintain maximum CXCR4 blockade.
