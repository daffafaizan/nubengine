      this study). Physical examinations and laboratory tests, including plasma viral RNA levels
      and CD4 cell counts, are performed at Day 1 and Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 (or at
      discontinuation). The incidence of serious and drug-related adverse experiences is tabulated
      to determine drug safety. The proportion of patients achieving plasma viral RNA levels below
      50 copies/ml (by UltraSensitive assay) are estimated statistically to determine drug
      efficacy.
