    
      Design: Prospective, monocentric, pilot study. The study will be proposed to all patients
      admitted to the neurosurgical intensive care unit (ICU) at Pitié-Salpêtrière hospital,
      following a traumatic brain injury (TBI), over a period of 1 year. Around 100 patients will
      be included.

      Day 1 : In the first 24 hours after traumatic brain injury, two clinicians will respond to
      the research questionnaire assessing their patient's prognosis, including confidence in their
      prediction and experience in neurological intensive care unit. The known prognostic variables
      as the IMPACT score in the first 24 hours will be collected.

      Day 7 : The same clinicians will respond to the research questionnaire assessing their
      patient's prognosis, including confidence in their prediction and experience in neurological
      intensive care unit.

      At 6 months : After 6 months, all patients or relatives will undergo a telephone interview
      (or if applicable during a follow-up visit in standard care) to assess the Glasgow Outcome
      Scale (GOS). This interview will be blinded to the clinician's prediction and the IMPACT
      score. For patients identified as GOS 3 or 4, a second GOS telephone interview will be carry
      out in the following days (<7 days), by a committee of adjudication composed of 2 examiners.
