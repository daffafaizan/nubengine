        1. To test the efficacy of higher-dose Venlafaxine and Problem Solving Therapy for
           Depression and Pain (VEN/PST-DP) in reducing depression and pain.

        2. To test the efficacy of higher-dose VEN/PST-DP in reducing back-related disability and
           improving physical functioning.

      Primary Hypotheses:

        1. During the 14 weeks of step 2, patients receiving VEN/PST-DP, compared to those
           receiving VEN/SM, will respond faster and have a higher rate of response.

        2. During the 14 weeks of phase 2, patients receiving VEN/PST-DP, compared to those
           receiving VEN/SM, will have better self-reported physical functioning.

           Secondary Hypothesis:

        3. Self-efficacy has been shown to predict treatment outcomes for both depression and pain.
           We have observed that the self-efficacy for pain management of these patients improves
           with antidepressant pharmacotherapy. We hypothesize that for subjects assigned to
           receive treatment with VEN/PST-DP, self-efficacy will mediate treatment response.
