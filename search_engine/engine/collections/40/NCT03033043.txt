    
      This clinical trial is a prospective, multicenter, non-blinded, non-randomized study designed
      to assess the RelayPro thoracic endografts in the treatment of acute, complicated type B
      aortic dissection. The primary endpoint will measure all-cause mortality at 30 days
      post-procedure.

      Subjects will be enrolled on a first come, first serve basis; however, no single
      investigational site may enroll more than 20% of the proposed sample size of up to 80
      subjects. A subject is considered enrolled when arterial access is gained and an attempt is
      made to introduce the RelayPro Thoracic Stent-Graft. Enrollment is expected to begin in
      mid-2016 and complete by the end of 2020.

      All subjects enrolled, as defined above, will be included in the patient population for the
      primary safety analyses. All subjects implanted with the RelayPro Thoracic Stent-Graft will
      be included in the patient population for the primary effectiveness analyses.
