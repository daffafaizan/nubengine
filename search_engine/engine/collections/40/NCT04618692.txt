      end-stage liver disease and it is also established as a viable treatment option in the field
      of oncology. Living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) using the right lobe (RL) is a major
      achievement despite its technical challenges, which has created a significant increase in
      graft supply. While a secure bile duct anastomosis is one of the basic principles of a
      successful liver transplant procedure, biliary reconstruction remains the Achilles' heel of
      LDLT because of the high incidence of posttransplant biliary complications associated with
      significant recipient morbidity and mortality. Some of these complications are related to
      technical difficulties due to multiple small biliary orifices, particularly in right lobe
      grafts. In our center, we have been using microsurgical reconstruction technique for
      duct-to-duct biliary anastomosis in such grafts. The routine use of this technique has been
      shown to significantly decrease biliary complications in single-center retrospective studies.
      However, prospective controlled studies comparing microsurgical and standard biliary
      reconstruction techniques are lacking. In this study, our objective is to compare
      posttransplant complications of the two techniques of biliary reconstruction in RL LDLT.

      40 patients will be included in the study. They will be randomly allocated in the equal
      groups.İn group 1 biliary anastomosis will be performed using surgical loupes and İn group 2
      biliary anastomosis will be performed using microscope. The patients will be followed for one
      year after the transplant to compare biliary complications.
