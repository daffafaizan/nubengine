      Primary

        -  To determine the overall survival (0S) for advanced NSCLC patients receiving concurrent
           chemoradiotherapy with weekly docetaxel, carboplatin and radiation therapy followed by
           two cycles of consolidation chemotherapy with docetaxel and carboplatin.

      Secondary

        -  To determine the overall response rate in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  To determine the time to disease progression in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  To assess the safety and tolerability of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE:

        -  This is a Phase II, open label, multi-center study to determine the overall survival
           rate for patients treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy with weekly docetaxel,
           carboplatin and radiation followed by two cycles of consolidation chemotherapy with
           docetaxel and carboplatin. Eligible patients will receive concurrent therapy with
           docetaxel (20 mg/m2) administered weekly for seven weeks as a 30-minute intra-venous
           (IV) infusion followed by carboplatin (AUC 2) administered weekly for seven weeks as a
           30-minute IV infusion. Concurrent radiation therapy will be administered at a dose of
           1.8 Gy daily 5 days/week for 25 fractions followed by a dose of 2.0 Gy daily, 5
           days/week for 9 fractions (total of 34 fractions). There will be a three-week rest
           period following the end of the concurrent chemotherapy after which the consolidation
           phase will begin. During this phase of the study, patients will be treated with
           docetaxel (75 mg/m2) administered as a 1-hour IV infusion followed by carboplatin (AUC
           6) administered as a 30-minute IV infusion. Patient will be treated every three weeks
           for a total of two cycles.
