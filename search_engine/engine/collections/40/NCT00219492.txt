           non-cardiac chest pain patients. We expect to find mast cell activation, as measured by
           mast cell count or degranluation, tryptase staining, and histamine release, will be
           greater in NCCP patients compared to controls, and the increased mast cell activation
           will correlate with the severity of NCCP. These results will expand our understanding of
           the pathogenesis of esophageal originated NCCP, and allow the development of new
           diagnostic and treatment options.

        2. Study Population: (i) NCCP (ii) Reflux esophagitis (iii) Control subjects.

        3. Summary of Procedures: (i) symptom assessment by chest pain questionnaire; (ii)
           esophageal reflux evaluation by review of records of 24-hour pH monitoring; (iii)
           evidence of esophagitis by endoscopy; (iv) esophageal biopsy by endoscopy; (v) mast cell
           activation study in biopsy specimen by mast cell count, tryptase and Transient receptor
           potential vanniloid-1 (TRPV1) staining, and histamine release assay.

        4. Major Risks & Discomforts: There are no major risks & discomforts other than involved in
           standard upper GI endoscopy.
