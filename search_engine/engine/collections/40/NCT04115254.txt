    
      This research study is a feasibility study, which means it is the first-time investigators at
      this institution are examining this type of MR-guided radiation to treat cancer.

      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved this device as a treatment option
      for cancer.

      In this research study, the investigators are hoping to determine if adjusting radiation
      treatments based on daily MRI has a feasible way to deliver radiation for participants with
      pancreatic, lung or renal cancer.
