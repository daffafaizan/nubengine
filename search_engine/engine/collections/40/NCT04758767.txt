      During the CID-103 dose escalation/infusion duration phase, only patients diagnosed with
      multiple myeloma who have relapsed or are refractory to at least two prior lines of therapy
      including a proteasome inhibitor, an immunomodulatory agent and an anti-CD38 antibody will be
      enrolled. Patients will receive monotherapy CID-103. Dose escalation decisions will be based
      on dose-limiting toxicities; infusion duration decisions will be based on infusion-related
      reactions. The dose taken forward into the expansion phase will be the RP2D determined in the
      dose escalation phase.

      Expansion phase:

      The expansion phase consists of two specific cohorts of patients with relapsed/refractory
      multiple myeloma: 1) Pretreated cohort having received previous treatment with an anti-CD38
      antibody and 2) Na√Øve cohort in patients for whom an anti-CD38 antibody is unavailable. Eight
      patients will be enrolled into each cohort, and if one or more responses is observed, that
      cohort will be expanded to a total of 14 patients to further assess efficacy. Patients must
      have had at least two prior systemic therapies (mono or combo), including a proteasome
      inhibitor and an immunomodulatory agent. Patients will be treated until disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicities.
