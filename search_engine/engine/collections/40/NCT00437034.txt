      I. To evaluate the safety and efficacy of VEGF Trap (aflibercept) in patients with relapsed
      or refractory, stage II or III multiple myeloma (MM).

      II. To perform correlative studies in order to evaluate the angiogenic properties of tissue
      from patients during the course of treatment with VEGF Trap.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive aflibercept intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment repeats every
      2 weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 60 days and then periodically
      thereafter.
