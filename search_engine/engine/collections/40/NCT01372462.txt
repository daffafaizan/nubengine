      of exercises at a constant work rate while using 1) Test noninvasive ventilation (NIOV)
      system powered by compressed air, 2) Test NIOV system powered by 100% oxygen, 3) nasal
      cannula oxygen, 4) nothing (Control). Subjects were assessed during constant work rate
      exercise as reflected by exercise duration, isotime oxygenation (SpO2), and isotime dyspnea
      score (Borg). Exercise sessions took place over 4 visits with each visit lasting
      approximately 5 hours.
