      recruited. The patients will be randomly assigned to surgery plus medical therapy (surgery
      group) or medical therapy alone (control group). The primary outcome will be a composite of
      all-cause mortality, re-admission for right heart failure or the composite. Furthermore,
      echocardiography-based measurement of right heart function, New York Heart Association
      functional class, liver and kidney function, and quality of life will be compared between the
      2 groups. All outcomes will be assessed at baseline and 6, 12 and 24 months after
      randomization.
