    
      A total of 444 consecutive patients, who are referred for elective coronary angiography to
      1st Cardiology Department cathlab, with the suspicion of coronary artery disease (CAD) will
      be enrolled in this study. Exclusion criteria are acute coronary syndrome, previous
      ipsilateral transradial approach, Raynaud's syndrome, abnormal renal function with or without
      need for hemodialysis, known history of sensitivity to local anesthetics, non-palpable radial
      pulse, abnormal Barbeau's test and patient's refusal. Baseline clinical, demographic and
      procedural data of the study population were recorded.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to either the EMLA (AO) or the lidocaine group (LA),
      by a randomization table.

      Primary end-point: the perception of radial pain assessed during artery puncture and 30
      minutes after sheath removal.

      Secondary end-point: The number of puncture attempts, the total time required before
      successful sheath insertion, and the occurrence of radial artery spasm will be also
      documented in each group

      Participants will be observed for 4 hours post angiography for development of local
      complications or side effects.
