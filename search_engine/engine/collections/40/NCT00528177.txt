      has been presumed (1-2), but one study demonstrated a 3:2 ratio between those drugs (3).
      During the last years, several studies indicate that oxycodone has the potential of mediating
      pain relief through the kappa-opioid receptor (4-6), and not only on the my-opioid receptor
      like most other opioids used in the clinic. Kappa-opioid receptors are widely distributed in
      visceral organs, and this may explain why Kalso (3) found less need for oxycodone compared to
      morphine in patients undergoing abdominal surgery.

      The aim of this study is to investigate whether patients with visceral postoperative pain
      need less oxycodone compared to morphine, and whether patients receiving oxycodone experience
      better pain relief and less adverse effects compared to patients receiving morphine.

      Before start of surgery, the patients will be tested with PainMatcher, an instrument testing
      electrical pain threshold in the skin (7-10), to ensure that both groups have the same pain
      threshold before surgery.
