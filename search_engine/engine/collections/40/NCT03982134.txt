      Panobinostat in patients with metastatic melanoma and NSCLC who have failed prior Anti PD1 or
      PD-L1 therapy.

      The primary purpose of this study is to find the recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) of
      Panobinostat in combination with PDR001. Standard 3+3 design will be used for dose escalation
      or de-escalation. Depending upon tolerability and dosing, the total number of participants
      may vary from 9-24. Initially patients will start from dose level '0' and there will be 1
      dose escalation level '1' and two de-escalation levels ('-1' and '-2'). The maximum number in
      each dose level will be 6.
