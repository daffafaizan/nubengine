      blockages, is the commonest cause of heart failure. This condition is called ischaemic
      cardiomyopathy. In some patients, treating these narrowings/ blockages with by-pass surgery
      or stents, known as "revascularisation", helps improve the pumping strength of the heart but
      it is currently difficult to predict which patients will benefit. The best test the
      investigators currently have to predict who will benefit from revascularisation is an
      Magnetic Resonance Imaging scan of the heart which looks for how much the heart has been
      scarred. Hearts with no scar usually improve after revascularisation and hearts with lots of
      scar usually do not. However, lots of patients fall into the middle and have moderate amounts
      of scar. The Magnetic Resonance Imaging scan isn't good at predicting if this group of
      patients will benefit from revascularisation. Revascularisation procedures, including heart
      by-passes, are not without risk and often require time in intensive care, several days in
      hospital and a long recovery period at home. If the investigators can develop a better test
      which is more accurate at predicting whether hearts with moderate scar will improve then they
      will be able to provide better care for patients by ensuring only those patients who will get
      benefit from revascularisation are put through the procedure.

      This study will investigate whether a new high-resolution heart Magnetic Resonance Imaging
      scan, which looks at not only levels of scar but also the quality of blood supply, is more
      accurate than current MRI scans at predicting heart recovery after revascularisation in
      patients with moderate amounts of scar.
