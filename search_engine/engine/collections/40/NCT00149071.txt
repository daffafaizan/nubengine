      dorsolateral cortex relieves depressive symptoms when the treament is combined with
      antidepressive medication. The study will also be able to supply knowledge on how long any
      possible effect of the rTMS treatment lasts.

      In the first 12 weeks of the trial participants are randomised to either rTMS combined with
      escitalopram or sham rTMS combined with escitalopram. rTMS is given daily for the first 3
      weeks.

      The next phase is a relapse prevention study where the responders from the initial phase are
      randomised to either active or placebo escitalopram for 24 weeks.
