      arthroplasty. These studies report that overall MP flexion is restricted postoperatively.
      They do not usually report individual range of motion values for each digit. Therefore one
      cannot identify if the degree of MP flexion restriction differs by digit.

      We, and others, have observed that MP flexion is particularly restricted in the ring and
      litter finger following Swanson arthroplasty.

      There is a new implant (NeuFlex), which instead of being introduced in full extension, like
      the Swanson implant, has a resting position of 30 degrees of flexion. As MP flexion is
      particularly restricted in the ring and little finger, an implant that by design encourages
      flexion may be helpful. A need exists to establish if the use of the NeuFlex implant produces
      greater MP flexion in the ring and little finger where restricted flexion has been identified
      as a problem.
