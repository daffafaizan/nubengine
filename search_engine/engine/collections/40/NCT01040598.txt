      clinical symptoms and immunohistological findings in established cases of EoE. The dosage for
      Omalizumab will be based on patient's body weight and baseline IgE level. Omalizumab will be
      administered subcutaneously every 2 or 4 weeks for total duration of 12 weeks. At enrollment,
      subjects will have EGD with biopsies performed to confirm diagnosis of EoE and further
      histologic analysis and special staining. Blood will be drawn for baseline testing and
      monthly for safety labs. At the end of the 12 week period, repeat endoscopy will be performed
      and biopsies taken to stain again for various mucosal markers like IgE, IL-13, IL-5 and
      Tryptase. The patients will be followed for response to therapy with regards to resolution of
      symptoms and improvement in histology findings on biopsy.
