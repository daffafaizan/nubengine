      microcurrent application to silver nylon dressings in the treatment of donor sites for
      partial thickness thermal injuries. The primary endpoint is wound-closure time
      (re-epithelialization of 90% or more of wound surface). A secondary endpoint was infection.
      Exploratory assessments of clinical outcomes, including inflammation, and pain medication
      (type, dosage, route, timing) will also be conducted.
