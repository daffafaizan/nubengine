        -  Compare the survival, progression-free interval, and failure patterns in patients with
           optimally debulked stage I-IV carcinosarcoma of the uterus treated with whole abdominal
           radiotherapy vs ifosfamide and cisplatin.

        -  Compare the incidence and type of acute and late adverse events observed with these
           treatment regimens in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to one of two
      treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive whole abdominal radiotherapy 5 days a week for 4 weeks, followed
           by radiotherapy boost to the pelvis 5 days a week for 2.2 weeks.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive cisplatin IV followed by ifosfamide IV over 1 hour on days 1-4.
           Treatment continues every 3 weeks for 3 courses.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 216 patients will be accrued for this study within 6 years.
