      measured with conventional techniques, such as fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS),
      immunohistochemistry, or microscopic imaging methods. In FACS, cells of interest are
      isolated, extensively processed, incubated with a fluorescent-labeled antibody and sorted by
      optical recognition. In the proposed SCD biofluidic chip (SCD biochip), the interrogating
      antibody coats the microchannel surface and captures the cell population(s) of interest,
      without processing, incubation, or in vitro manipulation. The SCD biochip can also quantitate
      cellular adherence to experimental biological surfaces that are comprised of subcellular
      components. The SCD biochip is technically simple and experimentally flexible, whereby the
      population of interest is retained on the chip and quantitated in situ. The microchip system
      allows retrieval of viable isolated cells for potential downstream processing, analysis, and
      in vitro culture.
