    
      This is a multicenter, randomized (study drug assigned by chance), open-label (participants
      and researchers are aware of the treatment participants are receiving) study to evaluate the
      safety and efficacy of talacotuzumab or daratumumab. Approximately 60 participants (30 to
      receive talacotuzumab and 30 to receive daratumumab) will be enrolled and then assigned
      randomly on a 1:1 basis to receive either talacotuzumab or daratumumab. The study consists
      of: a Screening Phase of up to 28 days during which participant eligibility will be reviewed
      and approved by the sponsor prior to randomization, a Treatment Phase that will extend from
      the first dose on Cycle 1 Day 1 until study drug discontinuation, and a Post-treatment Follow
      up Phase beginning once the participant discontinues talacotuzumab or daratumumab. Study
      drugs will continue to be administered until disease progression, lack of response,
      unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or study end. Safety will be monitored
      throughout the study. The talacotuzumab arm of the study is closed for enrollment.
