      Primary

        -  Determine the 2-year progression-free survival of patients with stage III or IV squamous
           cell carcinoma of the head and neck treated with chemoradiotherapy comprising cisplatin,
           bevacizumab, and intensity-modulated radiotherapy.

        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of this regimen in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the median overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE:

        -  Chemoradiotherapy: Patients receive cisplatin IV over 1 hour on days 1, 2, 22, 23, 43,
           and 44 and bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1, 22, and 43. Patients also
           undergo intensity-modulated radiotherapy on days 1-5, 8-12, 15-19, 22-26, 29-33, 36-40,
           and 43-47. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
           toxicity.

      Between 3-4 months after completion of chemoradiotherapy, patients undergo evaluation.
      Patients with clinical evidence of residual, progressive, or persistent disease may be
      eligible to undergo neck surgery at the discretion of their physician.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every
      6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 42 patients will be accrued for this study.
