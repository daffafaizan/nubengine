    
      This study is a phase II non-randomised, multi-centre, single arm trial of image-guided
      (IG)-SABR for high-risk centrally located T1, T2 and selected T3 lung tumours. Treatment will
      consist of IG-SABR using a total of 8 fractions of 7.5 Gy per fraction adhering to organ at
      risk dose-volume histogram constraints allowing a minimum dose coverage of 77% to 95% of the
      planning target volume (PTV) coverage, and a minimum dose of 87% to 99% of the gross tumour
      volume (GTV), using dose intensity modulation.

      The primary aim of the study is to determine the safety of the 8 x 7.5 Gy treatment regimen
      on the basis of the rate of ≥ Grade 3 treatment related toxicity using NCI CTCAE V5, in
      patients with medically inoperable early stage,ultracentrally located NSCLC. This is defined
      by tumours abutting or immediately adjacent to central mediastinal structures who are not
      fulfilling the conservative hybrid DVCs of the LungTech (Adebahr et al., 2015) and RTOG 0813
      (Bezjak et al., 2015) studies with full dose coverage. Toxicities occurring between start of
      treatment and one-year from the end of treatment, which are possibly, probably or definitely
      related to radiotherapy will be assessed.

      The study is planned to be carried out in 2 stages with 91 patients evaluable patients
      required for stage 1 and 87 evaluable patients required for stage 2. In the first stage, (91
      evaluable patients), if there are 35 or fewer ≥ Grade 3 treatment related adverse events
      (TxR-AEs) in these 91 evaluable patients, the study will be stopped, and it will be concluded
      that the regime is not unsafe. If there are 43 or more ≥ Grade 3 TxR-AEs in 91 evaluable
      patients, the study will be stopped, and the conclusion will be made that the regime is not
      safe. Otherwise, 87 additional evaluable patients will be accrued for a total of 178
      evaluable patients. The conclusion will be made that the regime is not safe if 78 or more
      TxR-AEs are observed in 178 evaluable patients.

      The enrolment period is expected to be 5 years which allows for a 1-year hold on accrual
      during the analysis of stage 1.

      Toxicity assessments will be carried out weekly during radiotherapy (RT), at 2, 4 and 8-weeks
      post-treatment and at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24 months post treatment and annually thereafter to 5
      years post treatment.
