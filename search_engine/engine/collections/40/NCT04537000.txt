      resource, and meanwhile will not adversely affect the patients' clinical outcomes.
      Participants will be randomly divided into two groups, where the strategies of transfusion of
      red blood cell will be made following different principles. The strategies for patients in
      control group will be made by the attending doctors in charge according to the current
      Chinese red blood cell transfusion guidelines. For the patients in study group, the clinical
      condition will be identified every time red blood cell transfusion is considered. The
      strategies will be made according to the comparison between the score and the Hb
      concentration. The volume of the red blood cell used in these two groups will be compared.
      The number of patients who need transfusion in these two groups will be compared. The
      clinical outcomes will also be compared between the two groups.
