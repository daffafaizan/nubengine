      participants will have pharmacokinetics studies performed at baseline, following a 20 mg/kg
      oral dose of hydroxyurea. Pharmacokinetic sampling will use a sparse sampling approach,
      requiring collection of blood at 3 time points (15 minutes, 60 minutes, 180 minutes)
      following the hydroxyurea dose. Enrolled participants will be randomized to receive either
      hydroxyurea using a starting dose of 20 mg/kg/day (Standard Arm) or a personalized PK-guided
      dose (Alternative Arm) to target an area under the curve (AUC) of 115 mg*h/L based to
      approximate hydroxyurea exposure seen when patients are escalated to maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD).

      Following randomization and selection of the initial dose, participants in both arms will
      follow the same procedures of laboratory medication holds for hematological toxicity. The
      primary endpoint is fetal hemoglobin (HbF) six months following the initiation of hydroxyurea
      therapy with the hypothesis that participants starting with a PK-guided dose will achieve HbF
      at least 5% greater than those starting with a 20 mg/kg dose. Based upon the estimated number
      of new hydroxyurea starts at each site, it is anticipated that it will take 24 months to
      enroll the 116 participants required to achieve sufficient power to assess the primary
      endpoint. The study will conclude for each participant 12 months following hydroxyurea
      initiation.
