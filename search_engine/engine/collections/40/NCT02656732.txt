      chorion membrane or CAF with subepithelial connective tissue graft using a simple
      randomization procedure with a 1:1 allocation ratio. A computer generated randomization list
      was drawn up by a faculty member who was not involved in the recruitment. Allocation
      concealment was achieved by sealed coded opaque envelopes that contained the treatment to be
      performed to the enrolled subjects based on the randomized numbers. Consequently, patients
      were allocated to either AC membrane (intervention) or SCTG (control) groups. The sealed
      envelope containing treatment assignment was opened at time of the surgery and the number was
      picked by another person other than the operator.
