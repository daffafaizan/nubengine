      brochure at breast cancer survivor support groups. Participants recruited to the study will
      be contacted to set up a pre-test data collection session. Prior to any testing, informed
      consent will be obtained with a form approved by the TWU IRB. After informed consent is
      obtained participants will complete tests of Digit Span Task, FACT-Cognitive Function
      (Version 3), Quality of Life Patient/Cancer Survivor Version and Engagement in Meaningful
      Activities Survey, and issued a tablet if they prefer. Then participants will be randomly
      assigned to one of two computer-assisted cognitive programs. Participants will be sent by
      email, exercises specific to their assigned computer-assisted cognitive program from
      Happyneuron Pro (http://ie.scientificbraintrainingpro.eu/). Cognitive training on the
      computer entails 30 minutes a day, five times a week for one month. 6. At the end of the
      study, the four pretests will be repeated, a satisfaction survey administered, and any issued
      tablets collected. Pre and post testing, obtaining of written consent, and issuing and
      returning a tablet will occur at the support group location. If this location is not
      available, they will occur at TWU in a quiet room. If TWU is not convenient to the
      participant, a quiet location that is suitable to maintain confidentiality for the
      participant will be chosen in collaboration with the participant.
