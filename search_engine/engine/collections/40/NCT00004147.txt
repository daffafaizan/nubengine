        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose, dose limiting toxicity, and safety profile of oral
           COL-3 alone or when combined with anticonvulsants known to be metabolized by CYP450 in
           patients with progressive or recurrent high grade anaplastic astrocytoma, anaplastic
           oligodendroglioma, or glioblastoma multiforme.

        -  Define the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of COL-3 on this schedule and determine
           the effects of hepatic enzyme inducing drugs, such as anticonvulsants, on the
           pharmacokinetics.

        -  Determine the response rate, disease free survival, and survival in patients treated
           with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study of COL-3. Patients are stratified by
      anticonvulsant (anticonvulsants that cause induction of CYP450 vs anticonvulsants that cause
      modest or no induction of CYP450 or no anticonvulsant).

        -  Phase I: Patients receive oral COL-3 daily. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks in the
           absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of COL-3 until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients
      experience dose limiting toxicity.

        -  Phase II: Patients receive oral COL-3 daily at the MTD from the phase I portion of this
           study.

      Patients are followed every 2 months until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-18 patients will be accrued for phase I of the study and a
      total of 35 patients will be accrued for phase II of the study at a rate of 3 patients per
      month.
