    
      This is a 48-week multicentre, parallel, randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled phase 3
      safety and efficacy trial. There are two treatment arms: Tamoxifen (verum) and placebo
      (control), with treatment allocation of 1:1.

      The investigators plan to screen at least 79 and to enroll at least 71 ambulant DMD patients
      aged between 6.5 and 12 years (group A) and 6 - 20 non-ambulant DMD patients aged between 10
      and 16 years (group B). In order to reach statistical power, 60 ambulant patients (group A)
      need to complete the trial. Treatment with 20 mg Tamoxifen once daily will be given for the
      total trial duration of 48 weeks.

      Only patients with glucocorticoids (standard treatment of care) will be included in group A
      (ambulant patients) and only non-glucocorticoid users in group B. At baseline as well as at
      the end of the study clinical, laboratory, and MRI measurements will be performed. These
      include the Motor Function Measure (MFM) scale, timed function tests, the 6 minute walking
      distance, quantitative muscle testing (QMT) and quantitative thigh muscle MRI,
      questionnaires. A physical examination, an ECG, vital signs as well as safety laboratory
      blood analyses will be performed at every visit. Furthermore, an x-ray of the hand and a dual
      energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA)-scan will be performed at baseline and at the end of the
      study.

      An open label extension (OLE) trial for participants of the TAMDMD main study will be
      performed. All TAMDMD patients on TAM or placebo are offered to enter this OLE. All OLE
      patients will receive 20 mg of TAM daily during 48 weeks. The same study specific assessments
      as in the double-blind randomized phase will be performed during the OLE phase
