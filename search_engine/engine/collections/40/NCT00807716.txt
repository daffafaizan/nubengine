      exercises in only weight-bearing 12 times from 6 weeks to 12 weeks after the operation, while
      the control group had usual physiotherapy care during the same time span. The primary outcome
      was walking measured by the six minutes walk test. Other performed and self reported measures
      of physical functioning were performed, at baseline, six weeks after the operation,
      immediately after the intervention at 12-14 weeks and with a follow-up nine months after the
      intervention.
