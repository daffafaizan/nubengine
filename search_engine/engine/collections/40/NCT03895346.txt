      puzzles group as forms of mental training. Participants are adults with mild cognitive
      impairment. Participants will undergo neuropsychological testing, MRI scanning, and
      qualitative interviews to assess feasibility of conducting a larger randomized clinical trial
      in a population with mild cognitive impairment.
