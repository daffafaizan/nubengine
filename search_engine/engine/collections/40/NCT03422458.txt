      Primary hypotesis

      Placing an immediate implant into a fresh extraction site plus a bone substitute filling and
      a matrix covering could negatively modify the healing patterns and thus the tissue morphology
      of the ridge site with regard to:

        -  clinical hard tissues dimensions (bone width and height, bone volume)

        -  clinical soft tissues dimensions (soft tissues volume, keratinized tissues width and
           thickness, muco-gingival junction position's modifications, gingival color and texture,)

      Secondary hypothesis.

      Placing an immediate implant into fresh extraction site plus a bone substitute filling and a
      matrix covering could negatively influence tissue morphology of the preserved site with
      regard to:

        -  clinical hard tissues dimensions (bone width and height, bone volume)

        -  clinical soft tissues dimensions (soft tissues volume, keratinized tissues width and
           thickness, muco-gingival junction position's modifications, gingival color and texture,)

      Aims:

      The first aim of this study is to evaluate the possible impact on hard and soft tissue
      morphological changes of placing an immediate implant in post-extraction site treated by a
      bone substitute filling and a matrix covering.

      The second aim of this study is to compare hard and soft tissue morphological changes in a
      spontaneous healed extraction site versus a fresh extraction site treated by immediate
      implant placement plus a bone substitute filling and a matrix covering
