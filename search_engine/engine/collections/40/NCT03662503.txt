      neonatology services; it impacts the child's health in the short and long term. The weight
      deficit, but especially the weak growth of the cranial perimeter during the Neonatal period
      is associated with an increased risk of long-term neuro-cognitive impairment.

      The optimal nutritional strategy, during the neonatal period, of children born moderately
      premature is not known.

      The optimization of nutrition in premature children is therefore a topical issue in
      neonatology.

      Our project aims to evaluate the impact of an aggressive early nutritional strategy
      characterized by optimized caloric and protein intakes on the stature-level growth of 2000
      children born moderately premature GA from 30 WA to 32 WA + 6 days and included in the
      national cohort of follow-up of children of small gestational ages.

      Nutritional intake (calorie intake and total protein intake) during the first week of life
      will be analyzed in tertile.

      Children will be grouped according to their calorie and protein during the first week of
      life. The tertile 1 will represent the group of children with the lowest nutritional intake
      (called the "nutrition not aggressive "), the tertile 3 will define the group of children
      presenting the contributions highest nutritional levels (called the "aggressive nutrition"
      group).

      The primary endpoint will be the z-score change in weight, height and head circumference
      between birth and age (36 adjusted age WA) between the "nonaggressive nutrition" group and
      the group. "Aggressive nutrition".

      The benefits are for public health to harmonize neonatal care practices within a region and
      to better understand the impact of nutritional strategies on long-term neuro-cognitive
      development.
