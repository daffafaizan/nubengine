      e.g. green tea, have been shown to be able to increase energy expenditure and fat oxidation
      during the hours following a meal containing the bioactive ingredient. Furthermore, we will
      also look at the subjects own feelings of appetite and thereby examine whether the appetite
      is affected by the spicy food, since a few studies have suggested an effect of bioactive
      ingredients on appetite/energy intake. We expect to see some small effects on these
      parameters.
