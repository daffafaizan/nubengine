      There is no certain view on the pancreatic resection method to reduce pancreatic fistula in
      distal pancreatectomy.This study will be conducted to scientifically investigate the impact
      of Endo GIA Reinforced Reload with Tri-Staple Technology in distal pancreatectomy. The aim of
      this study is to evaluate if the Endo GIA Reinforced Reload with Tri-Staple Technology reduce
      incidence of pancreatic fistula (ISGPF grade B and C) after distal pancreatectomy by a
      prospective, multi-center trial.
