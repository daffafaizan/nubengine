    
      JOINTSTEM is injectables for an OA treatment that uses autologous adipose-derived mesenchymal
      stem cells. As it does not use allogenic tissues and is cultured without additional genetic
      modification, it is classified as 'autologous cell therapy' and is completely free of
      immunologic rejection.

      This clinical trial is planned to follow-up the long-term safety of "jointstem" in patients
      with degenerative knee arthritis who participated in the previous BS-JS-IIT1 investigator
      initiated trial.

      Subjects who participate in the BS-JS-IIT1 study and agree to this extension test in writing
      will be assessed for safety by conducting laboratory tests, vital signs, physical
      examinations and adverse events every 12 months after Visit 1.

      However, after unblinding of the BS-JS-IIT1 investigator initiated trial, subjects in the
      control group (placebo administration) will terminate the follow-up of this extended clinical
      trial and conduct routine treatment for degenerative knee arthritis at the discretion of the
      researcher. Appropriate measures and follow-up observations shall be implemented for abnormal
      reactions occurred during this extended test period until they are terminated (such as the
      loss of the relevant adverse event or inability to conduct follow-up investigations).
