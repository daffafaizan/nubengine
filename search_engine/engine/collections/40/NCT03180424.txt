      and fragile elder of the community.

      Circulating L-carnitine levels increase after administration of the supplement. The impact on
      the function of L-carnitine in combination with physical exercise will be studied in a
      population of older adults in Montevideo.

      The sample will be divided into 3 groups, according to the intervention:

      Group 1: Patients who will receive L-Carnitine in addition to a manual to perform physical
      exercise at home.

      Group 2: Patients receiving L-Carnitine plus supervised exercise plan. Group 3: Patients
      receiving placebo and supervised exercise plan. All three groups will be evaluated for
      functional and anthropometric parameters: prior, during and after intervention. In addition,
      the dosage of L-carnitine and acetylcarnitine will be evaluated before and after the
      intervention.
