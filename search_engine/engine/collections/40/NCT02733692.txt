      aged 13 to 29 years old compared to White women, which negatively impacts other sexual and
      reproductive health outcomes. Given that young women have a substantial need for SRH services
      and a high smartphone ownership, unique opportunities to utilize mobile apps(applications) to
      decrease HIV risk behaviors may exist.

      A tailored, culturally congruent, smartphone app co-developed with and for young Black and
      Latino women (18 to 25 years old) not yet publicly available offers a unique opportunity to
      conduct a feasibility, acceptability, and pilot RCT. Using this app, this pilot that will: a)
      assess feasibility of the sampling, consent, recruitment and retention techniques; b) collect
      acceptability and usability data and cultural congruence on the app; a and c) collect pilot
      data to test differences between intervention and control groups on the preliminary estimates
      of app effectiveness to inform a potential larger-scale study. The investigators propose YBLW
      between 18 and 25 years old in NYC will use a mobile-based health education app to access SRH
      education information. Additionally, those who use the tailored SRH app will have more
      self-reported connection to SRH services, better knowledge of SRH education domains, and how
      to link to clinical services (e.g., PREP, PEP, EC, birth control, HIV, STD, and pregnancy
      testing), compared to the control group. Analysis for the first aim will employ process
      measures and the second and third aims are mixed-methods aims.

      Analysis will compare differences between the 2-arms and indiscernible differences and
      culturally tailored usability will be explored via focus groups and web analytics.
