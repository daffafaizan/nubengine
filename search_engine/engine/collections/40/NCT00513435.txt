      I. To determine the median progression-free survival for patients with advanced or recurrent
      squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (HNSCC) treated with AZD0530 (saracatinib).

      SECONDARY OBJEC TIVES:

      I. To determine overall survival for patients with advanced or recurrent HNSCC treated with
      AZD0530.

      II. To determine objective response rate for patients with advanced or recurrent HNSCC
      treated with AZD0530.

      III. For patients with accessible tumors, to perform pre and post-treatment biopsies to
      assess the pharmacodynamic effects of AZD0530 on c-Src and downstream signaling molecules
      STAT3 and STAT5.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive saracatinib orally (PO) or by percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube
      once daily (QD) on days 1-56. Courses repeat every 8 weeks in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 12 weeks and then
      periodically thereafter.
