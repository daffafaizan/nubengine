      professional requirements. Considering the benefits of physical activity, it is recommended
      that the risks of desk workers, especially those in the risk group who produce work by
      consuming less energy, should be reduced and encouraged to participate in physical activity
      at a level and manner suitable for a healthier life. For this reason, it is important to
      determine the level of physical activity according to different variables in individuals
      working at desk jobs.The aim of our study is to evaluate the validity and reliability of the
      "Occupational Sitting And Physical Activity Questionnaire (OSPAQ)" scale in Turkish, which
      was developed to evaluate the situation of sitting, standing, walking and doing heavy work.
      All forms will be sent through the media. 100 office workers will be included in the study.
      Physical activity level of office workers will be evaluated by Turkish OSPAQ and
      International Physical Activity Questionnaire. For the reliability study, after 7 days, the
      physical activity of office workers will be re-evaluated with Turkish OSPAQ. Factor analysis
      methods will be used to examine the factor structure of the scale, correlation analysis
      (Pearson and Spearman coefficients) in validity analysis and test-retest reliability.
      Cronbach alpha analysis will be used in the reliability analysis.
