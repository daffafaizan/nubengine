      I. Classify patients with solid tumors or lymphoma according to UGT1A1 promoter (TATA box)
      and coding region (Gly71Arg) mutation, and CYP3A4 promoter (G to A) polymorphisms.

      II. Identify UGT1A1 enzyme glucuronidator and irinotecan oxidizer phenotypes in these
      patients and determine the correlation between the two metabolic reactions in vivo.

      III. Determine the relationship between UGT1A1 genotype (promoter and/or coding region
      mutation) and CYP3A4 promoter genotype vs gastrointestinal or bone marrow toxicity, and
      pharmacokinetics of irinotecan in these patients.

      IV. Determine the pharmacokinetics of irinotecan in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients are genotyped for UGT1A1 enzyme and classified as "Gilbert's" (7/7),
      "heterozygotes" (6/7), and "homozygotes for allele 6" (6/6). The DNA is analyzed for the
      UGT1A1 coding region mutation (Gly71Arg) and CYP3A4 promoter polymorphism. Patients are also
      examined for glucuronidator ratio of SN-38, the active metabolite of irinotecan, and
      classified as "low/slow" (very low or zero SN-38G/SN-38 ratio), "intermediate" (less than 50%
      normal ratio), or "normal".

      Patients receive irinotecan IV over 90 minutes once every 3 weeks. Treatment continues for at
      least 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
