    
      2 X 30 patients which are planned for FESS surgery are randomized in a sevoflurane group or
      propofol group.

      All patients will be induced with propofol (target-controlled infusion (TCI) 4 Âµg/mL) and
      remifentanil (TCI 4 ng/mL) and receive a multimodal intravenous analgesia.

      Patients in the propofol group will receive further intravenous propofol until a bispectral
      index (BIS) value of 50 is reached.

      The intravenous drip of propofol will be stopped after induction in the sevoflurane group and
      patients will receive sevoflurane as inhalation anaesthetic (1 MAC) until a BIS-value of 50.
      The surgeon will be blinded for patient allocation.

      The surgical conditions will be graded postoperatively by the surgeon who performed the
      operation using the validated Boezaart grading scale. The endoscopic images will be evaluated
      in addition by 3 blinded surgeons using this same scale.

      Besides the surgical conditions, haemodynamic parameters, nausea and vomiting scores (PONV),
      Visual Analogue Score (VAS), surgery duration, length of stay at the post-anesthesia care
      unit and postoperative analgesia and anti-emetics are registered.
