      of benefit, to both reduce inflammation and as a potential therapy to improve outcome. To
      date, there is no specific therapy for NEC that has been found to improve outcome, but
      corticosteroids have yet to be investigated in that capacity. Therefore, we propose to
      examine the effect of hydrocortisone for treatment of NEC in a randomized, blinded,
      placebo-controlled pilot study, focusing on a primary outcome of C-reactive protein levels at
      3 and 7 days of therapy as a measure of inflammation. In addition, we will follow several
      secondary outcome measures to determine the possibility of improved outcome in those infants
      assigned to hydrocortisone.

      The investigators hypothesize that infants diagnosed with NEC who receive hydrocortisone will
      have significantly lower C-reactive protein levels at 3 and 7 days of treatment versus
      infants who receive placebo.
