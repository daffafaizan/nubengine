    
      Tivozanib is a novel and potent pan-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor
      (VEGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor with potent activity against all 3 VEGFRs (VEGFR-1, -2, and
      -3). In nonclinical models and studies performed in humans, tivozanib has shown strong
      antiangiogenesis and antitumor activity.

      This study is an open-label, non-randomized, exploratory single-arm trial evaluating the ECG
      and pharmacokinetic (PK)-ECG relationship, if any, of tivozanib in subjects with advanced
      solid tumors.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the ECG intervals and morphology following treatment
      with tivozanib in subjects with advanced solid tumors and to determine the relationship, if
      any, of the change in QTc duration with serum concentration of tivozanib over time in
      subjects with advanced solid tumors.
