      microbiologic testing and extra specimens will be evaluated via nuclear acid assay developed
      in our laboratory. The assay will be directed at variety of both pathogens, including
      Streptococcus pneumoniae, Hemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus
      aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter, Mycoplasma pneumonia, Chlamydia pneumoniae and
      Legionella pneumophila, and common antibiotic-resistant genes, such as ESBLs genes, MecA,
      OprD. The ultimate goal is to have an available panel of highly accurate and rapid (same day)
      assay, which will be carried out in several hours for identification.

      The extracted pathogen nucleic acid in sputum specimen will be identified by Nuclear acid
      detection assay with Microfluidic Pumping Chip and LAMP methods. The species of bacteria and
      their antibiotic-resistant gene to be detected are as listed above. As nucleic acid extracts
      will be archived, other pathogens can be investigated in the future if the correlated assay
      is developed. All results obtained by nuclear acid detection will be compared to results for
      conventional testing as listed above. Sensitivity, specificity and predictive values will be
      calculated. In cases where discordant results occur, additional testing and or medical
      history review will be properly conducted.
