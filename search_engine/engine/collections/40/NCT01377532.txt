      cases per million annually. These tumors develop in both children and adults. About 15-20%
      metastasize. Chemotherapy for this tumor usually consists of a combination of
      cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and dacarbazine delivered over two days and repeated every 3
      weeks. Such combined chemotherapy is ineffective for the majority of patients with metastatic
      PHEO/PGL. A few patients with malignant PHEO have experienced remissions with sunitinib, but
      the drug may produce severe toxicity and the experience with that drug is limited. Those
      patients who do experience a remission with chemotherapy must continue it indefinitely to
      stay in remission. However, most such patients experience such severe side effects from the
      chemotherapy (marrow suppression, neuropathy, etc) that their chemotherapy must be
      discontinued. Thus, chemotherapy is either ineffective or intolerable for the vast majority
      of patients with metastatic PHEO/PGL.
