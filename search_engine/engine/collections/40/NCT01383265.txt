    
      Background: Warm water infusion in lieu of air insufflation (water method) improves overall
      success of screening colonoscopy and our retrospective data indicate a higher adenoma
      detection rate. Dye spray methods to improve neoplastic polyp detection such as targeted
      staining or pancolonic chromoendoscopy have been described.

      Aim: In a RCT in screening colonoscopy subjects, we will determine if chromoendoscopy using a
      dilute solution of Indigocarmine (IC) delivered by the water method (study method) will
      improve adenoma detection rate compared with the water method with plain water alone (control
      method).

      Methods: After informed consent patients undergoing screening colonoscopy will be randomized
      to be examined by the study or control method. Study method will employ a 0.008% IC solution.
      Control method will employ plain water. The water method in both study and control groups
      will be applied as previously described. The colonoscopy will be performed under sedation.
      Primary outcome measure: adenoma detection rate; secondary outcome: relevant
      procedure-related variables.
