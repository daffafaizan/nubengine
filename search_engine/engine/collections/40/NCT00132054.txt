      Primary

        -  Determine the dose-limiting toxicity and maximum tolerated dose of amrubicin when
           combined with irinotecan in patients with recurrent or relapsed extensive stage small
           cell lung cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the response rate in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the frequency and severity of adverse events in patients treated with this
           regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of amrubicin.

      Patients receive amrubicin on day 1 and irinotecan IV on days 1 and 8. Courses repeat every
      21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of up to 6 patients receive escalating doses of amrubicin until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 1/3
      (or 33%) of patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. An additional 6 patients are treated
      at the MTD.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 6-30 patients will be accrued for this study.
