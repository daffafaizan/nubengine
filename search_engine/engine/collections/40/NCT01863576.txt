      inflammatory processes, dyslipidemia, and cardiovascular diseases, there are no reports about
      food intake and PUFA supplementation in chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy patients. Thus, the
      objective of this study is to assess the effects of omega-3 PUFA supplementation on the lipid
      profile and the pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokine profiles in chronic Chagas
      cardiomyopathy patients.

      After patients are selected by cardiologists, they will be seen by study nutritionists, who
      will explain the study procedures to the patients and administer the free and informed
      consent form. The patients who agree to participate in the study will sign the consent form
      and undergo the initial assessment.

      The following data will be collected and evaluated in the study: sociodemographic data (age,
      sex, ethnicity/race, education, and domicile), clinical data (functional class and vital
      signs), alcoholism, smoking, prescription drugs, 3-day food record, 24-hour recall,
      anthropometric assessment (height, weight, BMI, waist circumference, tricipital skinfold
      thickness, and arm circumference), lipid profile (total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL-c,
      LDL-c, and VLDL-c), and cytokines (IL-1, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-alpha, IFN-γ, and
      TGF-β). Clinical, nutritional, and anthropometric assessments will take place immediately
      before starting the intervention and after 4 and 8 weeks during the study; lipid profile and
      cytokines will be evaluated before the intervention and at the end of 8 weeks. Each patient
      will be followed for 8 weeks.
