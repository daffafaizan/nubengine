        -  Determine the efficacy of arsenic trioxide in patients with unresectable metastatic
           hepatocellular carcinoma.

        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive a loading dose of arsenic trioxide IV over 1-2 hours once daily on
      days 1-5* in week 1 and then twice weekly in weeks 2-8. Courses repeat every 8 weeks in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      NOTE: *The 5-day loading dose is only administered during course 1.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 30 days and then periodically
      for up to 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-25 patients will be accrued for this study.
