    
      The UK SMA Patient Registry (https://www.treat-nmd.org.uk/registry/) is a joint venture
      between the John Walton Muscular Dystrophy Research Centre at Newcastle University and the
      patient group SMA UK (formerly known as the Jennifer Trust, then SMA Support UK). SMA UK is a
      UK national charity dedicated to supporting people affected by SMA and investing in essential
      research into causes, treatments and eventually a cure for the condition. The UK SMA Patient
      Registry is affiliated with the TREAT-NMD Alliance which is an organisation experienced in
      the design and implementation of rare disease registries.

      The purpose of the UK SMA Patient Registry is to register SMA patients from the UK and
      Ireland so that they may be considered for relevant clinical trials, receive the most
      up-to-date information regarding standards of care for their disease and help provide the
      research community with an understanding of SMA prevalence. Anonymised data from patients who
      register in the UK SMA Patient Registry will also be shared with TREAT-NMD as part of its
      global network of national SMA registries.

      All patients with a confirmed SMA diagnosis (or pending diagnosis) are eligible for
      inclusion.
