    
      HS-10296-302 is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter, phase III study
      to assess the efficacy and safety of Almonertinib versus placebo in stage II-IIIB NSCLC with
      EGFRm+ following complete tumor resection, with or without postoperative adjuvant
      chemotherapy (2~4 cycles of platinum-based doublet). Eligible patients are randomized to
      receive either Almonertinib (110 mg orally, once daily) or placebo (110 mg orally, once
      daily) in a 1:1 ratio.
