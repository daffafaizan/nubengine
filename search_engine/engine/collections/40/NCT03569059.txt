      hemiparetic hand, using haptic robots integrated with complex gaming and virtual reality
      simulations on recovery and function of the hand, when the training is initiated within early
      period of heightened plasticity. The intervention uses two training systems. NJIT-RAVR
      consists of a data glove combined with the Haptic Master robot that provides tracking of
      movements in a 3D workspace and enables programmable haptic effects, such as variable
      anti-gravity support, springs and dampers, and various haptic objects. The NJIT-TrackGlove
      consists of a robotic hand exoskeleton to provide haptic effects or assistance and an
      instrumented glove for finger angle tracking, and an arm tracking system to track hand and
      arm position and orientation. Using programmable software and custom bracing we enable use of
      this system for patients with a broad set of impairments and functional abilities. A library
      of custom-designed impairment and task-based simulations that train arm transport and hand
      manipulation, together or separately will be used. Pilot data show that it is possible to
      integrate intensive, high-dosage, targeted hand therapy into the routine of an acute
      rehabilitation setting. The study integrates the behavioral, the kinematic/kinetic and
      neurophysiological aspects of recovery to determine: 1) whether early intensive training
      focusing on the hand will result in a more functional hemiparetic arm; (2) whether it is
      necessary to initiate intensive hand therapy during the very early inpatient rehabilitation
      phase or will comparable outcomes be achieved if the therapy is initiated right after
      discharge, in the outpatient period; and 3) whether the effect of the early intervention
      observed at 6 months post stroke can be predicted by the cortical reorganization evaluated
      immediately prior to the therapy. This study will fill critical gaps in the literature and
      make a significant advancement in the investigation of putative interventions for recovery of
      hand function in patients post-stroke.
