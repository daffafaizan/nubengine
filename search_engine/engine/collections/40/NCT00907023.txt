      participate in this protocol. Involvement in this study involves completion of questionnaires
      prior to the child being discharged from the hospital. Three weeks after discharge, there
      will also be a follow-up phone call to complete more questionnaires.

      Readiness for hospital discharge is a under-investigated topic in pediatric solid organ
      transplant patients, despite the increasing number of pediatric patients undergoing
      transplant surgery. Results from this study will be used to develop an intervention program
      to promote readiness for hospital discharge in parents of children who receive a solid organ
      transplant.
