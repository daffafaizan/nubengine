      and the woman is HIV-seronegative. The couple will be counseled about their reproductive
      options, including in vitro fertilization (IVF) donor insemination and adoption. The male
      patient will be using appropriate therapy to reduce the virus in his semen. Semen will
      undergo specialized washing to reduce viral contamination of sperm. The sperm are first
      separated from leukocytes and other seminal constituents by centrifugation over a stepwise
      gradient. Motile sperm will be separated from the resulting pellet by a swim-up step in which
      washed sperm are overlaid with fresh medium into which sperm migrate. The final sperm
      suspension will be stored while testing for HIV is performed by reverse transcription
      polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Specimens found negative for HIV will then be used for
      IUI (review: Gilling-Smith et al, 2006; Bujan et al 2007). There is presumably some risk of
      HIV transmission to the woman and resulting child with this approach; however, over 4000
      inseminations reported in Europe over the last 15 years have not resulted in infection of any
      female patient or resulting child. The woman will be followed for a year after the final IUI
      to assess seroconversion. If a child is born, he or she will be tested for HIV at 3 months of
      age.
