      studies reported that nutrition status and lifestyle factors such as dietary pattern,
      obesity, physical activity, depression, diabetes, aspirin use and vitamin supplement were
      associated cancer risk. Yet, the influence of nutrition and lifestyle factors on gastric
      cancer outcome (i.e. recurrence and survival) in gastric cancer survivors is largely unknown.
      And there is currently no large cohort studies investigated the impact of these factors on
      gastric cancer outcomes in China.

      Objectives - Our study aims to evaluate the impact of nutrition status and lifestyle factors
      such as dietary pattern, tea consumption, obesity, physical activity, depression, diabetes,
      aspirin use and vitamin supplement on gastric cancer outcome (disease-specific survival,
      disease-free survival and overall survival).

      Settings and methods - The study will recruit approximately 50,000 participants with gastric
      cancer from 12 public hospitals in China after informed consent. Appropriate questionnaires
      will be utilized to evaluate nutrition status and lifestyle factors such as dietary pattern,
      tea consumption, obesity, physical activity, depression, diabetes, aspirin use and vitamin
      supplement. The association of disease-specific survival, disease-free survival and overall
      survival with these factors will be evaluated.

      Impact - To the best of our knowledge, this is the first large cohort, systematically
      investigation of the impact of nutrition status and lifestyle factors on gastric cancer
      outcome. When complete, our investigation would supply a systematical and precise
      understanding of the impact nutrition status and lifestyle factors on cancer out come in
      China.
