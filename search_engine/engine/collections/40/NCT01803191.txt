      diagnosis of prostate cancer. This technique is usually safe and well tolerated with a low
      incidence of serious complications. However, one of these complications, the bacterial
      infection can be complicated and cause urinary sepsis. The investigators have developed
      different regimens of antibiotic prophylaxis. Most of them include administering oral
      fluoroquinolones. In this area, approximately 40% of the strains of E. coli are resistant to
      ciprofloxacin (fluoroquinolone). Therefore, research is warranted alternative prophylactic
      approaches. Fosfomycin is an antibiotic ancient underused in recent decades that in recent
      years has been proposed as an alternative treatment for infections caused by
      multidrug-resistant microorganisms.
