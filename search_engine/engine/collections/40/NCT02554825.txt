      behaviors in three Massachusetts cities. This longitudinal school-cluster randomized
      controlled trial included 15 public middle schools (n=1,344). Participants were enrolled in
      the 6th grade in the 2011-2012 school year (Cohort 1) or 2012-2013 school year (Cohort 2).
      Outcome data sources included five student surveys: baseline; 6th, 7th, 8th grade follow-ups;
      and 9th grade follow-up (Cohort 1 only).
