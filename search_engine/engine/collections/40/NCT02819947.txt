    
      Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a multisystem and heterogeneous disease characterized by an
      unpredictable course and high morbidity and mortality. The complexity of SSc requires
      interdisciplinary diagnostic and therapeutic management and result in a growing burden for
      all health-care systems. For this reasons, researchers are seeking new diagnostic and
      therapeutic strategies to improve management of these patients. In order to improve clinical
      care and to develop recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of SSc, disease
      registries are used to capture and track key patient information.

      Therefore, SSc research associations and consortiums play a pivotal role to perform ongoing
      research and data collection to understanding the disease and support research projects.
      Currently, several national SSc registries in the UK, Germany, USA, Canada, Brazil, Australia
      and international registry, EUSTAR (European League Against Rheumatism scleroderma trial and
      research), have been established. However, the natural history of Asian populations are fully
      evaluated. Therefore, investigators decided to establish SSc cohort in Korean patients.
