      newly diagnosed stage IV NSCLC. To evaluate the change in the biologic parameters measured,
      two cohorts of patients will receive altered dosing regimens of fondaparinux starting with
      the second cycle of chemotherapy. The biologic parameters measured during the first cycle of
      chemotherapy will serve as a control for each patient. Chemotherapy consists of 3-week cycles
      of carboplatin and paclitaxel. The absolute maximum length of therapy with fondaparinux will
      be 3 months, regardless of which cohort the patient is assigned.

      This study consists of 2 cohorts:

      Cohort 1:

      Patients in cohort 1 will receive standard chemotherapy alone during cycle 1. During
      subsequent cycles (2-4) patients will receive a daily prophylactic dose (day 1 through 21) of
      fondaparinux. The anticoagulation will continue 21 days after the last course of
      chemotherapy.

      Cohort 2:

      Patients in cohort 2 will receive standard chemotherapy alone during cycle 1. During
      subsequent cycles, the patient will receive a therapeutic weight based dose of fondaparinux
      for the first 2 days of each chemotherapy cycle followed by a daily prophylactic dose of
      fondaparinux (day 3 through 21) until the next course of chemotherapy.
