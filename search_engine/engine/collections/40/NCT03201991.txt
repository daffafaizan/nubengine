      asked to undergo strength testing, physical exams, lab draws, and muscle biopsies at each
      study visit. Muscle biopsies are done in the quadriceps muscle. In between study visits,
      subjects are asked to maintain a weekly exercise regimen given to them by the study physical
      therapist.
