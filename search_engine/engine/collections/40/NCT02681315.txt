      (nCPAP) in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) for preventing extubation failure. In a
      recent international survey on periextubation practices in extremely preterm infants, nCPAP
      was the most common type of respiratory support used (84%) followed by nasal intermittent
      positive pressure ventilation (55%) and HHHFNC (33%). Moreover, HHHFNC appears to have
      efficacy and safety similar to those of nCPAP when applied immediately post-extubation to
      prevent extubation failure in preterm infants. and resulted in significantly less nasal
      trauma in the first 7 days post-extubation than nCPAP. However, the best flow rates of HHHFNC
      to prevent extubation failure remains to be known.

      This RCT aims to compare the efficacy and safety of postextubation respiratory support via
      HHHFNC at two different flow rates (6 L/min. versus 3 L/min) regarding successful extubation
      after a period of endotracheal positive pressure ventilation. We hypothesized that
      postextubation respiratory support via HHHFNC at a flow rate of 6 L/min. will result in a
      greater proportion of preterm infants being successfully extubated after a period of
      endotracheal positive pressure ventilation compared with HHHFNC at a flow rate of 3 L/min.
