    
      This is a multicentre, open-label trial in which paediatric subjects (ages 4 to 12 years)
      with FFR were administered prucalopride in oral solution once daily for 8 weeks. Subjects who
      entered this extension trial had completed PRU-USA-12, a single-dose pharmacokinetic trial,
      usually within the previous week.

      Evaluations for efficacy, safety and tolerability were performed, and plasma samples for
      analysis of prucalopride levels were obtained at 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks.

      The initial dosage of prucalopride oral solution was 0.02 mg/kg/day. Dependent on the
      subject's response, the parent could adjust the dosage within a range of 0.01 mg/kg/day to
      0.03 mg/kg/day.
