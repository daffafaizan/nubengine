      urinary tract infections (UTIs). However, recent studies have shown that cranberry juice may
      affect the way the body absorbs and metabolizes antibiotics used to treat UTIs. This study
      will determine whether concurrent cranberry juice administration lowers the urinary
      concentrations of two commonly used antibiotics, amoxicillin and cefaclor.

      This study will involve children being treated for UTIs and adults without UTIs. All of the
      children will continue their prescribed amoxicillin/cefaclor treatment. After 7 to 10 days of
      antibiotic treatment, the children will be assigned to receive either cranberry juice for 2
      days or no additional treatment. Urine samples will be collected from all child participants
      before and after the administration of cranberry juice to examine the excretion of the
      antibiotics.

      Adult participants will receive two different doses of amoxicillin, with or without cranberry
      juice. Blood and urine samples will be collected to evaluate the effect of cranberry juice on
      the absorption and elimination of amoxicillin.
