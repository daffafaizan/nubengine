      proportion of women with locally advanced cervical cancer are primarily managed with
      chemotherapy and radiotherapy which has improved the 5-year survival and disease-free
      survival; however both local and distant recurrences still remain to be challenges after
      treatment.

      A prospective study has shown that metabolic response on post-therapy FDG-PET scan at 3
      months to be predictive of progression-free and overall survival in patients with locally
      advanced cervical cancer. It may also predict patterns of failures for these patients.

      HPV is recognized as a necessary cause of the vast majority of cervical cancer and HPV DNA
      has been detected in circulation from patients with cervical cancer and oropharyngeal cancer
      at diagnosis and at the time of relapse. Despite the promising potential of HPV DNA to
      monitor response and detect recurrence at an early stage, no study has evaluated serial HPV
      DNA and its association with PET response and survival.

      We have recently reported preliminary data from a feasibility study (HPVDNA01) on 20
      patients. Detectable HPV DNA at the end of cervical radiation therapy predated the clinical
      diagnosis of metastases and was associated with inferior progression-free survival. Also, 3
      month plasma HPV DNA level was more accurate than 3-month FDG PET imaging in detecting
      leftover disease. This follow-up study aims to validate the clinical utility of plasma HPV
      DNA detection.
