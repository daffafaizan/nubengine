      ventilatory and hemodynamic problems but also to painful, stressful and anxiety-provoking
      situations. Learning different complementary therapies in the pre-transplant period allows
      patients to have personal tools to improve their comfort before and after the transplant.
      These tools can be used by patients who have acute or chronic pain symptoms, to support
      painful examination or care, and for situations of stress and anxiety.

      The project aims to present different therapies complementary to patients. Before and after
      transplant, patients benefits of learning and realization sessions of these techniques. They
      appropriate the techniques and choose the ones that suit best.

      The overall benefit will be judged comparing period before transplant to period after
      transplant on different criteria.
