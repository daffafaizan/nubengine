      colonoscopes, namely the latest generation (Pentax iScan, Hi Line) versus the previous
      generation (Classic Line). On withdrawal, all polyps found will be diagnosed according to
      their pit pattern (classification scheme mit example images provided) and a differential
      diagnosis made during the live examination. Pit patterns I/II will be classified as
      hyperplastic polyps, patterns III-V as adenomas (in a subgroup IV and V will be classified as
      pre-/malignant). All polyps will be photographed from near distance to allow for later
      blinded review which will be done on patients with only one polyp (to avoid mix-up of polyps)
      by 3 examiners and 2 independent hospital experts.
