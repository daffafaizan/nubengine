      following conditions will be studied in 2 groups. In the intervention group, Endometrial
      sampling is obtained twice by Pipelle [one in the follicular phase (during 8-9 or 11- 13 day
      in the beginning of buserelin cycle) and the last in the luteal phase (during 19-21 or 20-23
      day) preceding the embryo transfer cycle preceding the embryo transfer cycle]. In the control
      group endometrial sampling will be done only in the luteal phase of the cycle preceding the
      embryo transfer cycle. Blood samples (5- 10 cc) are taken in the both groups twice (one on
