      topical anesthetic sprays are safe for application on the areas of skin where epidurals
      (lower back) and arterial lines (wrist) are placed, based on whether they introduce microbial
      growth to these areas. The investigators will compare microbial growth by swabbing both of
      these skin sites following: 1) no treatment 2) ChloraPrep treatment and 3) ChloraPrep plus
      numbing spray (Ethyl Chloride or Pain Ease) treatment. The cultures will then be incubated to
      test for anaerobic bacteria, aerobic bacteria, and mold growth. The microbial growth will be
      compared between the three treatment groups based on the number of colony forming units
      present.

      Funding for the project will be from the manufacturer of the numbing sprays, Gebauer Company.

      Based on power analysis, for each of the numbing sprays, a total of 72 subjects must be
      enrolled, with 6 swabs taken per subject (untreated, ChloraPrep, and topical anesthetic spray
      samples will be taken from both the wrist and lower back of each subject). A sample size of
      72 pairs achieves 80 % power to detect an odds ratio of 24 using a two-sided McNemar test
      with a significance level of 0.05.
