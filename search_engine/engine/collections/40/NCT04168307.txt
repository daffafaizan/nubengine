      into two different post operative rehabilitation protocols. One group will receive
      conventional physiotherapy with stretching of the ankle with a non-elastic band, while the
      other group will use a new spring-loaded ankle trainer. The rehabilitation will continue for
      3 weeks. Patients will be evaluated with the Olerud Molander ankle score and visual analog
      scale for pain at 3, 6, 12 and 52 weeks follow-up. Length of hospitalization and all adverse
      events will be registered. Ankle range of motion will be registered at 6, 12 and 52 weeks
