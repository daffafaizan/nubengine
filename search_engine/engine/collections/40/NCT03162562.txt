    
      This is a Phase Ib evaluation of the combination of an antibody immunization vaccine strategy
      using oregovomab and an investigational stage immune adjuvant (poly ICLC / Hiltonol), both of
      which have previously been used in combination with other cancer treatments and demonstrated
      to be bioactive in advanced cancer, but which have not previously been combined together. The
      doses selected for each agent have been selected previously through human clinical study for
      use in immunization protocols as a well-tolerated and bioactive immune stimulatory dose. For
      immunization purposes a maximum tolerated dose is not a relevant pharmacologic objective.
      Rather this is an exercise in efficiently assessing a preliminary immunization protocol as a
      cost effective product development strategy assessing the ability of the combination to
      safely augment the immune signals measurable with either agent alone, both of which have been
      titrated to the current dose based on the principle of bell shaped dose response in
      immunization in prior studies.

      Subjects with stable disease for whom a 12 week break from cytotoxic therapy for their
      persistent and progressive advanced ovarian cancer is appropriate, who have signed informed
      consent and for whom baseline clinical information including laboratory, radiologic and
      physical documentation of their status is completed, will receive 4 cycles of
      oregovomab/Hiltonol immunization every three weeks (weeks 0, 3, 6, and 9). Blood will be
      obtained for the measurement of CA125 specific T cell immunity at 12 weeks before initiating
      continuing salvage therapy according to the best clinical judgment of the investigator. At
      week 16 the subjects will receive a final immunization with oregovomab/Hiltonol and at week
      17 an additional blood draw for analysis of T-cell immunity.
