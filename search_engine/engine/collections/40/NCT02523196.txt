      noninvasive, cost-effective, and well tolerated by patients. This study will compare the
      HQ-SHUNT to Hepatic Venous Pressure Gradient (HVPG) testing. In this study, 100 consecutive
      patients with various etiologies of liver disease who have undergone technically successful
      HVPG testing as standard of care will also undergo HQ-SHUNT testing.
