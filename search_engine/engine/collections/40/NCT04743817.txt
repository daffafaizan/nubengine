    
      This is a single center study. 100 ears are planned (up to 100 patients). Each subject will
      have one or both ears cleaned with OtoSet. The subject's level of earwax will be evaluated
      before and after by an evaluator.

      Screening data will be reviewed to determine subject eligibility. Subjects who meet all
      inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be entered into the study.

      Total duration of subject participation will be 1 day with a follow up call within 2-4 days
      after the procedure. Total duration of the study is expected to be 3 months.
