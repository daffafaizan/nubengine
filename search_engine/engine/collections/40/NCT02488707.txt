      margins, but also preserve normal sphincter function.In 1990, the results of a 'close shave'
      at anterior resection were reported, suggesting that a resection margin of 1 cm or less
      produced an oncological outcome similar to that of a resection margin greater than 1 cm.

      Sphincter preservation presents several advantages; The lower risk of intraoperative rectal
      perforation and positive circumferential margin than APR, the lower risk of damaging the
      pelvic branches of the pelvic autonomic nerve and The preservation of the body image that may
      increase quality of life.

      Recently, the clinical outcome of intersphincteric resection (ISR) as a laparoscopic approach
      (laparoscopic ISR) has been reported, but laparoscopic ISR for patients with bulky low rectal
      cancer remains challenging particularly for T3 tumors in patients with a narrow pelvis,
      because of the difficulty in understanding the accurate anatomy of the small pelvic cavity,
      in dissecting the TME or the tumor specific mesorectal excision (TSME) plane, and in
      transecting the lower rectum safely. Moreover, numerous studies have demonstrated that
      laparoscopic techniques have many advantages in colorectal surgery compared with open
      surgery.

      Although Radical resection is the gold standard for the treatment of rectal cancer, TEM
      offers the advantage of combining a minimally invasive technique with evident benefits in
      terms of postoperative morbidity and recovery, long-term functional outcomes and subsequently
      improved quality of life. Transanal Endoscopic Microsurgery (TEM) developed at 1984 and
      eliminated most of local transanal excision limitations and triggered a significant
      improvement in the local excision procedures of rectal lesions. While TEM became the 'gold
      standard' for the treatment of large rectal adenomas and early rectal cancer, there are
      special concerns about the lack of adequate lymphadenectomy.

      Preoperative chemoradiation therapy is widely used to treat locally advanced rectal cancer to
      increase resectability, and to enhance sphincter preservation, local control and possibly,
      survival rates. Surgery is performed six to eight weeks after radiotherapy.
