    
      This is a prospective, open-label, multicentre, Bayesian adaptive randomized clinical trial
      to establish whether therapeutic-dose parenteral anticoagulation improves outcomes for
      patients hospitalized with COVID-19 (e.g., reduces intubation or mortality). Participants
      will be randomized either to the investigational arm (therapeutic anticoagulation with
      heparin for 14 days or until "recovery" [defined as hospital discharge or liberation from
      supplemental oxygen if initially required], whichever comes first), or to the control arm
      (usual care, including thromboprophylactic dose anticoagulation according to local practice).
