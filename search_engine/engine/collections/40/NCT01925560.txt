      will be accomplished through analyses of breath and fecal samples to quantify fermentation
      end-products- hydrogen, carbon dioxide, and methane will be measured in the breath, and
      short-chain fatty acids, ammonia, phenol, and indole will be measured in feces. Microbial
      populations will also be measured in fecal samples.
