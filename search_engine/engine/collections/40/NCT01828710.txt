      cycle: healthy normospermic subjects and subjects with oligoasthenoteratospermia (OAT, < 15
      mil/ml).

      Semen volume, spermatozoa number and motility were evaluated during the initial semen
      analysis and after density gradient separation method. These parameters were evaluated before
      and after the administration of 4000mg/die of myo-inositol associated to 400 µg of folic acid
      (Inofolic lolipharma Rome) for three months.
