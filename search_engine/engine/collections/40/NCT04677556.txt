      The first-line recommended ventilation support is non invasive ventilation (NIV) with
      continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), which has been proved to reduce the work of
      breathing (WOB) and improve gas exchange. Non invasive Positive Pressure Ventilation (NiPPV)
      is increasingly used in case of CPAP failure to avoid intubation. Nevertheless, no study has
      ever evaluated its effectiveness on the discharge of respiratory muscles in severe
      bronchiolitis.

      Measurement of esophageal and gastric pressures with an esogastric catheter allows an
      estimation of WOB thanks to the calculation of the esophageal pressure-time product (PTPes),
      and a calculation of the transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdi) as the difference between gastric
      and esophageal pressures. This minimally invasive technique can be used at the bedside to
      assess the efficacy of ventilation support and is now increasingly used in Intensive Care
      Units to assist ventilation-targeted strategies.

      Our hypothesis is that NiPPV could reduce WOB more effectively than CPAP alone, and might
      lead to reduce intubation in the most severe bronchiolitis.

      The main purpose of this study is to compare PTPes/min between CPAP and NiPPV in infants
      hospitalized for severe acute bronchiolitis.

      Secondary objectives are i) to compare other parameters of WOB, gas exchanges and breathing
      pattern in both ventilator supports ii) to compare the rate of patient-ventilator
      asynchronies in 2 different setting of NiPPV ("clinical" and "physiological") iii) to assess
      if NiPPV is associated with reduced intubation rate, time under sedation and ventilation, and
      length of hospitalization as compared to CPAP.
