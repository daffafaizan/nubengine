      techniques whereby tunable-dye laser neo-vessel ablation is optimally employed to ameliorate
      hypertrophic scars resulting from burn injuries in children? Hypertrophic scarring is
      considered an adverse wound healing event that results in abnormal scar formation. This
      scarring process is associated with pruritis and discomfort and can interfere with function
      and aesthetics. Topical creams, massage, stretching and pressure are used as standard
      treatments of burn scar formation. With the child serving as their own control, we want to
      objectively measure the impact of PDL on burn scars in children. Variables of timing of
      application, duration and number of sessions will all be collected.
