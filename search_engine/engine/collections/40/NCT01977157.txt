      content (BAC) with the bioimpedance devices (SFB7, ImpediMed; Nicomo).

      This technology is non-invasive an can be measured by using conductive electrodes, capacitive
      electrodes or inductive measurement systems.

      The BIS-values will be compared with an official breathanalyzer (Alcotest 7110 Evidential MK
      III, Dräger, Lübeck, Germany).

      Furthermore one blood sample will be taken and analyzed with the ADH method as the current
      gold standard at the end of the trail.
