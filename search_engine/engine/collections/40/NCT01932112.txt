      fibrillation. However, atrial fibrillation recurs in up to 50% of patients, generally because
      of recovery of pulmonary vein conduction.

      Adenosine given during the initial procedure may reveal dormant pulmonary vein conduction,
      thereby identifying the need for additional ablation, leading to improved outcomes.
