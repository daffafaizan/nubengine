      progressive nature of fibrogenic diseases. The investigators have developed an ex-vivo
      mesothelial cell culture system based on work by Aroeira and colleagues. Ex vivo cell
      cultures were treated with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-AZA for 72 hours. Overall,
      the investigators found that 11 of 14 patients' cells showed an increase in the
      E-Cad/alpha-SMA ratio with treatment to 5-AZA, indicating a return to a more epithelial-like
      phenotype and supporting an epigenetic mechanism of progressive fibrosis. The investigators
      hope to identify DNA methylation patterns associated with glucose exposure and peritoneal
      membrane solute transport in PD patients.

      The investigators will take the peritoneal effluent from an overnight dwell from patients
      within one month of initiation of dialysis. The overnight effluent is centrifuged and the
      pellet is washed and cells are grown in DMEM medium. At confluence, cells are passaged into 2
      flasks then taken for DNA and RNA. At 12 months, a second overnight peritoneal effluent
      sample will be obtained. The investigators will also gather demographic data (patient's age,
      diabetes, occurrence of peritonitis, cumulative PD prescription including total glucose
      exposure, use of icodextrin, and the results of a peritoneal equilibrium test carried out for
      clinical purposes between 3 and 12 months from the start of peritoneal dialysis). The
      investigators will use whole genome DNA methylation analysis to assess epigenetic changes in
      mesothelial cells from incident PD patients.
