    
      Tourette's Syndrome is a neurological disease characterized by verbal and motor tics.
      Although its causes are unknown, many researchers believe that changes in brain chemicals
      (called neurotransmitters) are critically involved. One of these neurotransmitters is called
      dopamine, and it exerts its actions through its receptors (called D1-type or D2-type). It has
      been suggested that the symptoms of Tourette's Syndrome are due to an overactivity at the
      D1-type receptor. Ecopipam is a selective antagonist of the D1-type receptors. The present
      clinical trial is designed to test if ecopipam is able to relieve the symptoms of the disease
      in adults patients with Tourette's Syndrome. Eligible patients will be treated for eight
      weeks.
