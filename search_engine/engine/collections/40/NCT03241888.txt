      enrolled. Age, waist circumstances, blood pressure, basic history of infertility, blood
      pressure, serum lipid level and side effects will be collected. Blood tests, including
      fasting blood glucose (FBG), postprandial blood glucose (PBG), fasting insulin (FINS), SHBG,
      sex hormone levels, blood lipids and anti-müllerian hormone(AMH) will be performed before
      treatment to evacuate their metabolic conditions.

      Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment groups. Patients will receive MA (megestrol
      acetate) 160 mg by mouth daily for at least 3 months on Arm I. Patients will receive LNG-IUS
      insertion on Arm II and MA 160 mg plus LNG-IUS insertion on Arm III. Then an hysteroscope
      will be used to evaluate the endometrial condition every 3 months, and the findings will be
      recorded. For patients with EAH, complete response (CR) is defined as the reversion of
      endometrial atypical hyperplasia to proliferative or secretory endometrium; partial response
      (PR) is defined as regression to simple or complex hyperplasia without atypia; no response
      (NR) is defined as the persistence of the disease; and progressive disease (PD) is defined as
      the appearance of endometrial cancer in patients. Continuous therapies will be needed in PR,
      NR or PD.

      After completion of study treatment, 2 months of maintenance treatment will be recommended
      for patients with CR, and participants will be followed up for 2 years.
