      year and costs for management in the Emergency Department are estimated to be about four
      billion dollars per year. Vestibular problems are a major cause of dizziness. Simple to
      perform and inexpensive bedside vestibular tests are needed. The Skull Vibration-Induced
      Nystagmus Test (SVINT) with fixation blocked has been considered a vestibular gold standard
      test with strong psychometric values. No studies on the diagnostic accuracy of the SVINT in
      room light have been performed.
