      with high response rates. The expectation is that induction therapy with CRD will result in
      responses within the myeloma lesions. Extrapolating from the published experience on standard
      bone marrow response rates with CRD regimen, it is predicted that guided biopsy of myeloma
      lesions will reveal VGPR/CR/nearCR rate up to 50%. Further, it can be hypothesized that
      myeloma lesion biopsy will increase the detection rate of residual/refractory disease by
      about 20%, as compared with standard bone marrow evaluation. Thus, it is expected that
      myeloma lesion biopsy response rate may be discordant from the standard bone marrow response
      rate. The identification of patients with large residual disease burden in the myeloma
      lesions will indicate the need for further salvage therapy. Based on this, it is expected
      that advanced imaging with guided myeloma lesion biopsy will result in significantly improved
      response assessment strategy after induction therapy, and will allow better selection of
      patients prior to autologous stem cell transplant.
