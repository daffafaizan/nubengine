      inpatient psychiatric hospitalization. This includes but is not limited to medication
      management, group therapy, and individual therapy. If a patient is randomly assigned to the
      enhanced CBT group, manualized CBT, including a sequence of sessions that builds upon prior
      sessions and planned exercises, including worksheets and journal entries.The training M.D.,
      who is a treating physician on HCC-10, will also intermittently and randomly observe the CBT
      sessions to ensure the manual properly is being followed. Although the control condition may
      contain elements of CBT as per the clinician completing the therapy, it is not manualized,
      does not include specific exercises to be completed between sessions, and is not a course
      that builds upon skills from the previous day, as in the CBT condition. Participants assigned
      to the control condition will receive the usual standard of care during an inpatient
      psychiatric hospitalization. This includes but is not limited to medication management, group
      therapy, and individual therapy.
