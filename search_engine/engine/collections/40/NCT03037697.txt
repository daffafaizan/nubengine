      strapping system on increasing axial stability that will reflect on improving balance and
      walking performance in children with dyskinetic cerebral palsy. Forty children with
      dyskinetic CP will be assigned randomly into two groups (A & B). Control group (A) will
      receive conventional rehabilitation program for postural correction 2 hours/3 sessions
      weekly/3 successive months. Study group (B) will receive conventional rehabilitation program
      as in group (A) in addition to wearing Thera Togs soft orthotic undergarment. Patients
      evaluation will be carried out before and after the intervention programs to assess gait and
      balance performance using Noraxons myo pressure plate and Biodex balance system.
