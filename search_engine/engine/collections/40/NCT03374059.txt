      long-term use of technological tools causes postural disorders and neck pain called "text
      neck". The purpose of the study was to investigate the effects of exercise and life
      modification on pain and disability in "text neck".

      Methods: Eighty-five participants with "text-neck" were randomly divided into three groups:
      Exercise (n=29), Exercise+Life modification (n=28), and Control Group (n = 28). First group
      received a home exercise program treatment for 4 weeks. Second group received life
      modification suggestions additional to home exercise treatment program. Control group did not
      receive any treatments. Pain intensity during rest, activity, and at night was evaluated with
      Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and functional assessment was done by using Neck Disability Index
      at the beginning and at the end of 4 weeks.
