    
      Male clients, aged 19 to 44 years, coming to the gym for strength training will be
      purposively selected based on the inclusion criteria and then randomly assigned into two
      groups. They will undergo a series of pre-intervention tests that would assess their strength
      using Bourbon TMS and standing long jump tests; flexibility using stand and reach test;
      balance using Y balance test; coordination using jumping sideways test and speed using 20-m
      sprint test. After initial assessment, they will be advised and demonstrated for curl-up,
      side-bridging and quadrupled exercises. The experimental group will perform these exercises
      on Thera-BandÂ© Exercise Ball while the control group will perform the same exercises on gym
      floor. The clients will have sessions on preferably the first day and 4th day of the week but
      is subject to their attendance at the gym. There will be interval assessments at 2nd and 4th
      week based on the tests mentioned above to record changes at these intervals. After 6 weeks
      of bi-weekly sessions, the clients will undergo post-intervention tests that will be the same
      as pre-intervention tests.
