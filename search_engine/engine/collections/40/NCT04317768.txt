      general health status as well as the overall quality of life. Jordanian children have very
      poor oral hygiene parameters, and this is reflected as very high caries prevalence and poor
      gingival health conditions. Orphans and children who come from broken homes are suspected to
      have poorer oral health conditions from their peers in the public due to the different
      parameters that can affect their general health in whole and oral health in particular, and
      this could affect their quality of life. These parameters can be related to socioeconomic
      status, psychological and behavioral conditions, access to care and other factors. The role
      of tooth brushing in decreasing dental caries and enhancing the gingival health is
      well-established in the literature, and oral health education programs have proven to be
      effective in improving the oral health knowledge, attitude and behavior of children. These
      programs could be regarded as an effective measure to enhance the oral health status and
      establish good routines in childhood which is vital for optimum oral health and provision of
      lifelong protection against caries.

      This study will focus on children at social homes in the community in order to establish a
      baseline reference about their oral health status, treatment needs, and barriers to dental
      care. Also, to report the efficacy of oral health education using audio-visual aids and
      frequent motivation on oral health status, treatment needs and barriers to care among
      children at social homes in Jordan.
