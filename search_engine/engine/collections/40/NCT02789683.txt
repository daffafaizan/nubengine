      1) fine emulsion beverage (small lipid droplet size), 2) coarse emulsion beverage (large
      lipid droplet size) and 3) non-emulsified oil and water. All treatments will be consumed
      together with bread. All participants will be randomly allocated to the three test meals.
      Fifteen to twenty participants aged between 21 and 50 years will be recruited from the
      general public in Singapore.

      During the testing sessions, participants' glycemic, insulinemic, lipidemic responses and
      gastric emptying to the test meals will be measured. Gastric antral distention ultrasound
      measurement is an indirect measure of gastric emptying rate. Participants' metabolic satiety
      for the test meals will also be assessed at regular intervals throughout the testing session.
      Each testing session will take approximately four hours in duration and the testing sessions
      will take place at least five days apart.
