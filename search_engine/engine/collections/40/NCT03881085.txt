      biological factors contribute to racial disparities in breast cancer outcomes.The HPA axis
      plays a central role in regulating the physiological stress response;a prolonged and elevated
      glucocorticoid (GC) response following a social stressor predicts tumor growth rates and the
      development of mammary cancer in rats that histologically and etiologically resembles human
      disease.Many African Americans experience stressful life events and circumstances, including
      economic, discriminatory, and other stressors. These psychosocial factors may contribute to
      an increased risk of advanced stage breast cancer among African American women, but not all
      African American women who are exposed to adverse psychosocial and social stressors develop
      advanced stage breast cancer and African American women who have a limited number of
      stressors also develop advanced stage breast cancer, regardless of early detection. This may
      be because stress reactivity, or one's physiological and psychological responses to a
      stressor, is highly individualized and dependent on psychological and social determinants.
      However, empirical data are not available on stress reactivity among African American breast
      cancer survivors and how these reactions vary among women based on their exposure to chronic
      stressors and psychological characteristics. Empirical data are also lacking on the
      association between stress reactivity and cancer control behaviors among African American
      breast cancer survivors even though prior studies have shown that these women are less likely
      than whites to engage in health behaviors that are important to cancer control and research
      is now being conducted to understand how stress affects these behaviors.This research is
      testing the hypothesis that stress: (1) promotes temporal discounting; (2) has an adverse
      effect on self-efficacy, and (3) reduces executive functioning (e.g., goal setting,
      planning). However, stress reactivity, and the association between these responses and cancer
      control behaviors (e.g., diet, physical activity, and treatment compliance), have not been
      examined among African American breast cancer survivors. Prior studies have shown that
      African Americans have a dysregulated stress response as a result of persistent exposure to
      chronic and acute and stressors; this may alter stress responses and lead to high levels of
      allostatic load. In order to develop effective behavioral interventions for African American
      breast cancer survivors, an important first step is to verify that the mechanisms (e.g.,
      temporal discounting, self-efficacy) involved in health behaviors for cancer control (e.g.,
      diet, physical activity, treatment compliance) are associated with stress reactivity among
      these women. Therefore this study will characterize stress reactivity among African American
      breast cancer survivors and validate the association between these responses and targeted
      mechanisms of behavior change.
