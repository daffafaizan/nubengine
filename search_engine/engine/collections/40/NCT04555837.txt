      I. To determine the recommend phase II dose of the combination of alisertib and
      pembrolizumab. (Phase I) II. To determine the overall response rate (ORR) and progression
      free survival (PFS) of patients with recurrent or metastatic Rb-deficient head and neck
      squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) treated with the combination of pembrolizumab and alisertib.
      (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety of the combination of pembrolizumab and alisertib in patients with
      solid tumors.

      II. To determine the overall survival in HNSCC patients treated with the combination of
      pembrolizumab and alisertib.

      III. To determine the relationship between pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, baseline
      immune and tumor biomarkers and clinical responses in patients treated with alisertib and
      pembrolizumab.

      IV. To determine correlations between clinical responses and the effect of the treatment on
      human papilloma virus (HPV)-reactive T cells in HPV+ cancers.

      V. To determine correlations between clinical responses and tumor infiltrating lymphocyte
      function and T cell repertoire.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of alisertib in combination with fixed dose
      pembrolizumab followed by a phase II study.

      Patients receive alisertib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-7 and pembrolizumab
      intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Cycles repeat every 21 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 2-3 months.
