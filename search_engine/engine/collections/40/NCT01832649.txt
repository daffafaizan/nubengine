      effectiveness of an 8-week exercise program added to usual treatment compared with a health
      education program in 20 cocaine dependent patients. These participants will be randomized to
      one of the following two groups: a) exercise group: supervised moderate-vigorous exercise in
      group based on strength and calisthenics exercises, b) control group: supervised health
      education in group. All participants must have DSM-IV diagnosis of cocaine dependence as the
      primary disorder and must be in treatment.
