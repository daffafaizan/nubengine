      patient-specific MySpine® pedicle screws placement guides in comparison to free-hand
      technique.

      A pre-operative CT scan of the spine is obtained to create a 3-dimensional model of the
      patient's spine for the MySpine patient group. This model is then used to preoperatively plan
      the patient's surgery implantation itself, with the same goals of both free-hand and computer
      assisted techniques. The theoretical advantage of this technique is accurate implant
      placement without the added surgical time and complexity of the procedure, with lower
      radiation exposure thanks to less steps of fluoroscopy checks.

      The hypothesis for the present study is that the MySpine® technique can place pedicle screws
      more accurately in comparison to free-hand technique.

      The accuracy of the final implant position with respect to the pre-operative planning will be
      evaluated through CT post-op analysis.
