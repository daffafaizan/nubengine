    
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) and acute kidney injury (AKI) are common postoperative complications
      in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. AKI increases
      postoperative mortality and AF prolongs the hospital stay.

      Autonomic dysfunction, baroreflex impairment and an inadequate microvascular perfusion may
      play a relevant role in triggering AF and AKI.

      The perioperative characterization of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and of the
      microcirculation might improve risk stratification and help in the prevention and early
      treatment of AF and AKI in CABG surgery.

      The study aims are: i) to collect a number of perioperative indices describing the state of
      the ANS and of the microcirculation; ii) to assess the correlation among the different
      indices and their association with AF and AKI; iii) to develop a predictive model of
      postoperative outcomes (AF and AKI) accounting for perioperative autonomic indices and
      microcirculatory variables.

      Population: 200 adults subjects scheduled for CABG surgery, with or without additional
      intervention Methods: perioperative (in the operating room) acquisition of ECG, arterial
      blood pressure, cerebral blood flow velocity as derived from transcranial doppler technique,
      microcirculation parameters as derived from sidestream dark field images Statistics: receiver
      operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis with adequate cut-off values
