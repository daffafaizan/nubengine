      to help lower the amount of pain killers and other anesthetics that are given to a patient
      during surgery. Researchers want to study how this drug works in cancer patients and review
      the patient's chart for pain levels and medication use after surgery. Part of this research
      involves studying the immune system of surgery patients.

      If you agree to take part in this study, blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn before you
      have surgery and the morning after surgery while you are still in the hospital. This blood
      will be used to learn more about how your immune system works.

      After your second blood draw, your participation in this study will be over.

      This is an investigational study.

      Up to 20 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.
