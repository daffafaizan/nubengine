    
      The study is designed as a 12 week randomized, controlled intervention study. The study
      sample will consist of 80 geriatric patients admitted to a medical ward at Herlev University
      Hospital in Copenhagen, Denmark. The patients will be equally distributed into the control
      and the intervention group. The control group will follow the usual follow-home programme.
      The intervention group will also follow this programme, but will additionally be offered 3
      home visits by a registered dietician. Interdisciplinary information exchange will take place
      through established communication channels eg. patient records, visitations.

      Before and after the intervention data on the patient eg. hand-grip strength, nutritional
      status, dietary intake, functional abilities, well-being and activities of daily living will
      be gathered.
