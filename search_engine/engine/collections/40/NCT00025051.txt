        -  Determine whether celecoxib decreases ultraviolet(UV)-induced erythema and affects
           surrogate biomarkers of potential neoplastic change in participants with Fitzpatrick
           type I-IV skin exposed to UV light.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Participants are
      randomized to one of two treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Participants receive oral celecoxib twice daily for approximately 120 days.

        -  Arm II: Participants receive oral placebo twice daily for approximately 120 days.

      Skin biopsies of UV-exposed sites are evaluated.

      Participants are followed for up to 5 weeks post-treatment.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 36 participants (18 per arm) will be accrued for this study
      within 8 months.
