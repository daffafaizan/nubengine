      oncofetal antigen 5T4. 5T4 plays an important role in the development of cancer. Currently no
      drugs are available that work via the 5T4 antigen.

      The new cancer drug SYD1875 is being developed by Byondis B.V. SYD1875 is an antibody-drug
      conjugate and consists of two parts: an antibody and a linker-drug moiety containing a toxin.
      The antibody part binds to 5T4 on the surface of the cancer cell. When SYD1875 binds to this
      cancer cell, it will be internalized by the cell. After proteolytic cleavage of the linker,
      the toxin will be split off in the cell and the cancer cell will be killed. Thus, SYD1875 can
      be considered as a form of targeted chemotherapy.

      This is the first study in which SYD1875 is administered to humans. The study consists of two
      parts:

      Part 1 is the dose-escalation part in which a low dose of SYD1875 is given to cancer
      patients. If it is well tolerated, a higher dose of SYD1875 will be given to other cancer
      patients until the maximum tolerated dose is reached.

      In Part 2 of the study, groups of patients with a specific type of cancer will receive the
      SYD1875 dose which has been selected for further evaluation.

      All patients from both parts of the study will receive SYD1875 infusions every three weeks
      until progression of the cancer or unacceptable toxicity develops.
