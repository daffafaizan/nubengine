    
      Intermittent hepatic inflow occlusion (IHIO) by clamping of the portal triad, also called
      Pringle maneuver, is a safe and effective procedure in major hepatectomy in patients with
      liver disease. IHIO minimizes blood loss and operation time during liver resection. In
      addition, ischemic preconditioning with IHIO has been reported to have protective effects in
      patients undergoing liver resection. In the setting of living donor liver transplantation
      (LDLT), one of the most important concerns is liver donor safety. Several studies have shown
      the safety of IHIO in donors for liver transplantation (LT). However, the effect of
      preconditioning with IHIO during donor hepatectomy on LDLT recipients remains unclear.
      Several small series have assessed the effects on recipients of ischemic preconditioning
      during whole liver transplantation from deceased donors. The role of IHIO, however, has not
      been fully elucidated in liver donors and recipients during LDLT. In this randomized,
      prospective study, we'll evaluate the efficacy of IHIO in the recipients and donors.
