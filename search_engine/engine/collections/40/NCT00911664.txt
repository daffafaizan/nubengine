      in HIV-infected children as measured by CD4 count (CD4 percent). We will determine if vitamin
      D supplementation leads to a measurable change in CD4 count (CD4 percent) in HIV-infected
      children in the context of routine clinical care.

      Specific study questions are:

        1. Does vitamin D supplementation lead to a change in CD4 percent (CD4 count) in
           HIV-infected children?

        2. Do the serum levels of the active form of vitamin D [1, 25(OH)2D and 25(OH)D] correlate
           with CD4 percent (CD4 count) in HIV-infected children?
