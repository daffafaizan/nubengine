           This study aims to assess the efficacy and toxicities of sequential VAD and VTD
           induction followed by high dose therapy with autologous stem cell transplantation and
           maintenance treatment with velcade as a first line treatment for the patients with
           multiple myeloma. This study will be conducted as an open, multi-center, single arm,
           prospective phase 2 study.

        2. Sample size determination

           The expected response rate of sequential VAD and VTD induction chemotherapy as a first
           line treatment for the patients with multiple myeloma is 80%. By using Flemming's single
           stage design ( error: 0.05,  error : 0.2), 55 evaluable patients are needed to prove
           this hypothesis. If withdrawal rate is 10%, enrollment of total 62 patients will be
           needed.

        3. Duration of the Study

      One year of enrollment will be needed (2006.03.1-2007.02.28). At least 24 months of follow-up
      for the patients who are to be enrolled last time is needed.
