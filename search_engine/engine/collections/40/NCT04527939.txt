      agreement with each other for lesion size and distance from the anal verge and good agreement
      for the rectal wall percentage of involvement. Circumferential or almost circumferential
      lesions have a greater chance of postoperative stenosis. Patients with more advanced lesions
      on AP who underwent radical resections had lower overall survival.
