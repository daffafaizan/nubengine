      amygdala-dependent neurophysiology and HPA-axis sensitivity in a human clinical population.
      Investigators have discovered that cortisol suppression reduces fear responses in PTSD
      coupled with the development of new fear conditioning paradigms, providing a unique
      opportunity to interrogate amygdala-HPA interactions to determine aspects of the
      neurobiological underpinnings of PTSD-related pathology.

      Aim 1a will examine baseline and fear-potentiated startle (FPS) response, as well as
      cognitive awareness in PTSD patients and traumatized Non-PTSD controls during a fear
      conditioning experiment 10 hours after dexamethasone administration in a double-blind,
      placebo controlled crossover design.

      Aim 1b will examine the above outcome measures in PTSD patients and controls during a fear
      conditioning experiment 1 hour after dexamethasone administration in order to control for
      direct effects of dexamethasone.

      Aim 2a will examine fear-potentiated startle (FPS) response in PTSD patients and traumatized
      Non-PTSD controls during fear extinction, when the fear is acquired 10 hours after
      dexamethasone administration in a double-blind, placebo controlled crossover design.

      Aim 2b will examine the same outcome measures in PTSD patients and controls, when the fear is
      acquired 1 hour after dexamethasone administration in order to control for direct effects of
      dexamethasone.
