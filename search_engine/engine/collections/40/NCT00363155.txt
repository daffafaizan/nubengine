      KRN7000 can be expected in HBV, as the compound is able to induce not only IFN-alpha/beta but
      also IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha. In two clinical trials, KRN7000 was safe in both healthy
      volunteers and solid cancer patients; particularly, the compound has not been reported to
      show drug-related serious adverse events. A phase I/II trial is of significance in assessing
      the safety and efficacy of KRN7000 treatment for CHB patients.

      The 300 microgram/m2 dose level, comparable to 10 microgram/kg, can be considered as the
      highest safe dose level for the phase I/II trial for CHB patients with 3 dose levels. Dose
      incrementation will be performed in a logarithmic manner: 0.1, 1 and 10 microgram/kg.

      In the phase I trial for solid tumor patients, weekly administration of KRN7000 did not allow
      sufficient time for NKT cell recovery. As KRN7000 is reported to be an activating ligand for
      NKT cells, it is logical to assume that a dosing interval that provides time for recovery of
      NKT cells is optimal. In fact, cytokine production after repeating dosing, when NKT cells
      were hardly detected in the peripheral blood, was not observed. As it took approximately 4
      weeks for NKT cells to recover to pre-dose levels after a single administration, monthly
      administration is now proposed for this trial.
