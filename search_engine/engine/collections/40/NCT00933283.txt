      single-sequence study to evaluate the potential interaction of steady-state telaprevir on the
      steady-state pharmacokinetics of methadone. The study consists of 3 phases: the screening
      phase (within 21 days prior to the start of supervised methadone intake on Day -14),
      treatment phase, and follow-up phase. Participants on stable methadone maintenance therapy
      will be enrolled in this study and their methadone doses will not be changed starting at Day
      -14. During the treatment phase, telaprevir will be added for 7 days (from Day 1 to Day 7) to
      participants' current methadone therapy. The methadone dosage will not to be changed from Day
      -14 until Day 7. All the intakes of methadone and telaprevir will be supervised and
      pharmacokinetic parameters will be measured during the study. Safety evaluations for adverse
      events, clinical laboratory tests, alcohol breath test, cardiovascular safety, and other
      evaluations (physical examination, and pharmacodynamic assessments) will be performed
      throughout the study. The total duration of the study for each participant is approximately
      60 days.
