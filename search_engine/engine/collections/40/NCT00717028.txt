      Functional endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FESS) involves anatomic and functional
      observation of the larynx and pharynx, evaluation of swallowing and maneuvers to improve it,
      also testing the laryngeal sensitivity. We evaluated nine patients with CP of both sexes,
      which age varied from 1 to 10 years old, attended at dysphagia multidisciplinary clinic, at
      NAMI (Integrated Medical Assistance Nucleons).
