      incorporates visual cues can make a positive change in the participant's ability to make
      decisions and move as measured by several cognitive, balance and functional tests. It has
      been shown that yoga can improve balance and movement in those diagnosed with Parkinson's
      disease. Subjects will be randomly assigned to either the high-speed yoga group or an
      inactive control group. All subjects will be tested before and after the 16 week training
      period using tests of balance, cognition and functional movement. The high-speed yoga group
      will receive yoga sequences lead by a certified yoga instructor during each of the 32 visits
      to the yoga studio. Each session will last one hour and be conducted two times per week. The
      program will consist of several different balance poses and movements where participants are
      encouraged to move quickly. Participants will also be asked to move in different directions
      based on colored lines placed on the yoga mat. To ensure a safe environment, several
      assistants will be present to help participants move into each pose. In addition, several
      assistive devices such as chairs and yoga blocks will be available if participants chose to
      use them.
