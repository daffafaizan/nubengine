    
      16 patients with new nontraumatic transfemoral or transtibial amputation will be enrolled in
      the study

      Having met inclusion criteria, the patients will be randomized to experimental or control
      groups

      Patients in the experimental group undergo placement of PNS leads within 7 days of amputation
      surgery

      Patients in both groups will be treated with standard pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic pain
      therapies and evaluated weekly for 8 weeks, then at 3, 6, and 12 months postamputation
