      treatment, and at least 2 visits after completion of treatment. Duration of study
      participation is 18-30 months, depending on length of treatment.

      Review and Documentation of Cancer Therapy will be abstracted from the clinical oncology
      chart by the oncology offices caring for the patient. Treatment will be summarized in terms
      of chemotherapeutic type, duration and cumulative dose; total radiation dose and location;
      history and type of bone marrow transplantation; and any surgery. Any attempts at fertility
      preservation or use of gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist treatment during cancer therapy
      will be captured as well.
