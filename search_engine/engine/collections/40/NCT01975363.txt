    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      i.) To determine whether nanoemulsion curcumnin modulates pro-inflammatory biomarkers in
      plasma and breast adipose tissue.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES include:

      ii.) To determine the adherence, tolerability and safety of two doses of nanoemulsion
      curcumin (NEC) in women at high risk for developing breast cancer;

      iii.) Evaluate possible correlations between physical factors such as body mass index (BMI),
      dietary intake and pro-inflammatory effects in plasma and breast adipose tissue.

      iv.) Explore additional biomarkers as surrogate endpoints to measure effects of NEC.

      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Participants receive lower dose of nanoemulsion curcumin orally (PO) twice daily (BID)
      for 3 months.

      ARM II: Participants receive 100 mg of nanoemulsion curcumin PO BID for 3 months.
