      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of cidofovir when given as a radiosensitizer in
           patients with stage IB-IVA cervical cancer undergoing concurrent chemoradiotherapy.

      Secondary

        -  Evaluate the influence of treatment on the expression of mRNA codons in HPV oncoproteins
           E6 and E7.

        -  Determine the rate of local control.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of cidofovir.

      Patients receive cidofovir IV weekly for 2 weeks prior to beginning radiotherapy and then
      once biweekly during radiotherapy. Patients undergo external pelvic radiotherapy for 5 weeks.
      Beginning ≤ 2 weeks later, patients undergo utero-vaginal brachytherapy. Some patients may
      also undergo a second course of external radiotherapy to the parametrium and/or lymph nodes ≤
      3 days after brachytherapy. Patients also receive concurrent carboplatin IV once weekly
      during external radiotherapy and brachytherapy.

      Biological expression of HPV oncoproteins E6 and E7 is analyzed during treatment.
