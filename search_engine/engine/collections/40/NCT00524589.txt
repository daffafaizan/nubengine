        -  To investigate the response rate in patients with androgen-independent prostate cancer
           treated with calcitriol and dexamethasone.

        -  To evaluate the toxicity of high-dose calcitriol and dexamethasone in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral dexamethasone once on days 1 and 2 and calcitriol IV over 1
      hour on day 2. Treatment repeats weekly in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Blood samples are collected at baseline and on days 2 and 3 to assess VDR and CYP24
      expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells.
