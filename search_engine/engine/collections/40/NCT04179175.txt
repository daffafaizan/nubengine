    
      This is a multicenter extension study to both core Phase III studies CAIN457M2301 and
      CAIN457M2302 (Core studies). This study contains a randomized withdrawal design, double
      blinded and placebo controlled up to Week 104 or loss of response. The subjects with HiSCR
      response after 52 weeks of treatment in the "Core studies" will be randomized at 2:1 ratio to
      either continue on one of the two secukinumab dosing regimens assigned in "Core studies" for
      another 52 weeks or will be placed on placebo. The primary endpoint is loss of response (LOR)
      assessed during the 52-week treatment duration (up to Week 104). Subjects who attained LOR
      will be transferred to open-label treatment to continue until the end of the study. Subjects
      on placebo who did not reach LOR up to Week 104 will be offered to continue in the open-label
      treatment or discontinue the study. Thus for subjects who were HiSCR responders at Week 52 of
      "Core studies", the open label treatment duration will vary and start either from the time of
      LOR or from Week 104 dose and last until Week 260 followed by 8 weeks of a post treatment
      follow-up period to week 268.

      Subjects who were HiSCR non-responders at the end of "Core studies" will be offered to
      continue in open-label treatment until Week 260.

      Subjects who prematurely discontinue the study, or who complete the study will enter a
      post-treatment follow up period (8 weeks) The primary objective is to evaluate maintenance of
      HiSCR reponse at Week 104 in either continuous or interrupted therapy compared to placebo.
      Secondary objectives are to assess the long-term safety and tolerability evaluated by adverse
      events, abnormal laboratory values and vital signs.
