      biology and therapeutic potential of sodium-free chloride supplementation. While sodium
      homeostasis has been the focus of substantial investigation, very little research has been
      devoted to understanding chloride homeostasis. Thus, this proposal is designed to obtain the
      full spectrum of information pertaining to chloride, such as novel areas with great interest
      by the scientific community (i.e. modulation of the WNK-kinase system and the use of
      exosomes), to more practical/basic questions (i.e. what happens to sodium chloride balance
      when a patient is challenged with chloride). The proposed outpatient study has been designed
      to serve as a real world efficacy study. With extensive biobanking and analysis of samples in
      the proposed setting, there is the potential to be able to deliver a great wealth of
      information on the biology and therapeutic potential of manipulating chloride homeostasis in
      heart failure.

      Research confirms that many heart failure therapies demonstrate measurable benefit in highly
      controlled environments, but lack effectiveness when studied in decompensated patients
      receiving standard decongestive therapies. As such, this study seeks to understand the
      effects of chloride supplementation on volume-overloaded patients concomitantly treated with
      IV diuretics.
