      OUTLINE:

      Patients attend focus groups to help develop patient portal and navigation program. Patients
      use in-person navigation program. In phase II, patients use an online portal to access
      navigation program and may choose to have online/virtual navigation support or in-person
      navigation support. Patients also complete data collection and surveys over 15 minutes via
      web portal at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months and user experience survey at end of program
      participation.
