      been shown to be reversible. Many studies have shown a positive effect of polyphenols
      (natural product in apples and grapes) on the liver fat burden. Three visits will be
      planified.

      Visit 1: Demographic data and liver and vascular imaging. Blood and stool tests.

      Randomization to polyphenol versus placebo. Visit 2 at 60 days. Demographic data and liver
      and vascular imaging. Blood tests. Stop the intervention.

      Visit 3 at 120 days. Demographic data and liver and vascular imaging. Blood and stool tests.

      This study will determine the feasibility of a randomized controlled trial evaluating the
      effect of polyphenols on hepatic steatosis and the vascular subclinical radiologic changes
      related to obesity.
