      effect of ACD, ACDF, ACDA for single-level cervical degenerative disc. Patients with arm pain
      not responding to conservative treatment take part in this trial. They will be randomised
      assigned into 3 parallel arms. The participants in the each arm will undertake ACD ACDF or
      ACDA. The baseline is the day of surgery. The Harrison posterior tangent method was used as
      an estimate for measuring cervical alignment. The primary outcome will be the cervical
      sagittal alignment estimated by Harrison posterior tangent method.
