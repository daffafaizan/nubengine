      recurrent stroke and bleeding. Minimally invasive approaches for surgical treatment have been
      advocated as a treatment option for stand-alone AF. This study will investigate the clinical
      outcomes after minimally invasive surgical ablation of both paroxysmal and
      persistent/longstanding persistent AF. Neurological safety will be assessed by cerebral
      magnetic resonance, neuropsychological examination and periprocedural transcranial Doppler
      measurement.
