      balance and reduce fall efficacy, the participants in the study group will be trained by six
      weeks three progressive steps of sensorimotor integration exercises. Each exercise step will
      take 30 minutes of a practice session, three sessions per week. Conventional physiotherapy
      (passive and active exercises and lower extremities strengthening exercises) will be given to
      the control group. The changes in balance performance and fall efficacy will be measured and
      compared within and between groups.
