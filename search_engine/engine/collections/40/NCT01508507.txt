    
      The overall goal of this study is to evaluate the protective effectiveness of one or two
      doses of modified, bivalent, killed whole cell based OCV, given at least 14 days apart, when
      delivered through community - based mass vaccination campaign using existing public health
      infrastructure in a high - risk population in Satyabadi block of Puri district, Orissa,
      India.

      This study has following objectives

      Primary objectives:

      * To evaluate the individual level protective effectiveness of one or two doses of OCV
      against culture confirmed cholera episodes, severe enough to seek a formal health care.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To evaluate population - level effectiveness (herd effects)of OCV delivered through a
           community based mass vaccination when the vaccine is delivered to more than half of
           population at risk.

        -  To determine inverse correlation between vaccine coverage and cholera incidence among
           diverse geographical clusters.
