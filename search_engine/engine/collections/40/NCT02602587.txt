      40-50% in younger adults and 10-15% in elderly. Dendrogenin A is a natural novel anticancer
      agent showing potent antileukemic activity which is under-represented in tumors. Dendrogenin
      A inhibits Cholesterol epoxide hydrolase and so modulates levels of substrates and products
      of this enzymatic complex.

      Purpose : This is a biomedical study of interventional type which includes 30 patients and 30
      blood samples as well as 5 marrow samples from healthy donors. It will last 24 month, 8
      months recruiting and 16 months follow-up. Patients with acute myeloid leukemia for which an
      indication of chemotherapy treatment is retained will be enrolled in this study. This study
      will compare oxysterols (Dendrogenin A, 6-oxo-cholestane-3beta,5alpha-diol - OCDO) and
      related proteins as biomarkers of the disease between the two populations.

      Interventions : The patients included in this study will be processed according to the
      standard treatment in force for their disease. This study does not in any way interfere with
      this treatment regimen, and is only based on additional samples of blood and bone marrow in
      acts planned in the prognostic or follow-up protocols. Treatment shall start within the 15
      days following inclusion and first sampling.
