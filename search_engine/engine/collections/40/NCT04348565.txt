      adults with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) in a few clinics of a general practitioner with
      solo-practice (GP-SP) in community, and evaluate its effectiveness by comparing the outcomes
      between study group (DCP with the usual medical care) and control group (Usual medical care
      only). It is believed that a structured DCP can promote greater clinical outcomes improvement
      and behavioral changes in the study group as evidence showed in literature. The primary
      outcomes are glycemic control (HbA1c level) and Self-Efficacy in diabetes management; whereas
      Diabetes Empowerment level, Diabetes Knowledge and Quality of Life are the secondary
      outcomes.

      The DCP consists of two parts, conduct 3 interactive group education with an innovative
      educational tool "Diabetes Conversation Mapâ„¢" sessions by dietitian and diabetes
      educator/nurse. Then it followed by another 8 weeks for delivering two 15-30 minutes
      teleconsultations for patient empowerment and follow-up of "Action Plan" by a diabetes
      educator/nurse. Evaluation of outcomes will be done before the DCP (baseline), at week-8
      (right after the group sessions), and at week-20 (4 weeks after the last teleconsultation).

      In addition, a focus group interview will be carried out after the completion of the whole
      intervention. It purposes to explore and get valuable descriptive information and feelings
      from participants about the intervention and diabetes self-management.
