      detected in individuals with SLE but there is no prospective data on the risk of thrombosis
      in women who present with recurrent miscarriages in association with APA. This study should
      significantly advance medical knowledge of the natural history of primary antiphospholipid
      syndrome (PAPS) which is essential to enable optimal management of relatively young women who
      may be at risk of complications, some of which are potentially life threatening.
