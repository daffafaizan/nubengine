      improvement program has been implemented. This program consisted of training of ICU nurses
      and intensivists using a hospital based standardized pain protocol, and systematic pain
      measurements in rest, rated by the patient himself whenever possible or otherwise by the
      attending nurse. This program has resulted in a reduction of severe pain levels (NRSâ‰¥4) in
      ICU patients in rest from 41% to 22%. In order to further reduce this percentage, a pain
      titration protocol is introduced in 2007. As no attention has yet been paid to
      intervention-related pain levels in these patients, in this prospective study pain control
      will be studied using different analgesic dosages of morphine iv (2,5 mg vs 7,5 mg) around
      unavoidable painful interventions within a pain titration protocol for pain control in rest.
