    
      Pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) is a complex and morbid operation that is associated with many
      potential complications. Many people undergoing PD are malnourished due to their underlying
      medical condition or difficulties eating in the face of abdominal pain or obstruction from
      pancreatic disease. This study aims to assess the effect of high-protein dietary
      supplementation in improving perioperative nutrition and decreasing complications. We will
      randomize PD patients to an experimental arm in which they take a nutritional, high-protein
      supplement for 2 weeks before and after surgery, or to a control arm, where they will take a
      standard postoperative diet without supplementation. Outcomes and nutritional parameters will
      be examined after they complete the supplements.
