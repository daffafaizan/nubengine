      interval exercise preconditioning protocol to ameliorate anthracycline-mediated cardiac and
      skeletal muscle toxicity in women with breast cancer undergoing de novo chemotherapy.

      Research Design:

      Women with breast cancer scheduled to undergo de novo chemotherapy with anthracyclines will
      be enrolled. Qualified patients will be randomized to either 1) a high-intensity interval
      exercise group, or 2) an attention-control group.

      Supervised exercise training will be carried out at the Mayo Clinic Cardiac rehabilitation
      center in Arizona on cycle ergometers using Electrocardiogram (EKG) telemetry. Patients in
      the high-intensity interval exercise group will perform four, 4-min intervals at 85-90% peak
      heart rate (PHR), separated by 3 min at 50% PHR. Each training session will begin with a
      10-minute warm-up at 50% of PHR and end with a 5-min cool down at 50% PHR.

      The attention-controls will receive counseling consistent with standard of care regarding
      physical activity during chemotherapy. Attention-control group will receive a weekly phone
      call to maintain physical activity during chemotherapy and compliance will be verified using
      physical activity diaries and pedometers.

      Treatment for each group will commence 1-week prior to chemotherapy induction. The first dose
      of chemotherapy will be given within 16-18 hours of the last bout of exercise. High-intensity
      intermittent exercise (HIIE) training will be continued throughout four, 2-week cycles of
      chemotherapy (total training time = 9 weeks, 3 days/week).
