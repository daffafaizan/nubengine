      especially the gastrointestinal tract. Esophageal involvement occurs in up to 90% of SSc
      patients. Symptoms of esophageal disease are due to gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)
      and esophageal motor dysfunction. Thus, heartburn, regurgitation and dysphagia have been
      reported by 80% of SSc patients.

      The gold standard method for the assessment and detection of esophageal dysmotility in SSc
      patients is manometry. High-resolution manometry (HRM) is the most accurate tool to assess
      esophageal motility using multiple closely spaced (<2cm) pressure sensors, assessment of
      esophageal motility is more sensitive ,and allows a better assessment of LES and of the whole
      esophagus.

      Buspirone, an orally available 5-HT1A receptor agonist, exerts a beneficial acute effect on
      esophageal motor dysfunction and LES pressure and may enhances an important role in
      improvement of esophageal symptoms in SSc patients. Thus, the investigators will conduct a
      study to evaluate the putative beneficial long-term effect of buspirone i) on esophageal
      motor dysfunction and ii) on esophageal symptoms in symptomatic SSc patients.
