      nose and upper airways until reaching the alveoli. This mechanism is bypassed by endotracheal
      intubation. Ventilation with dry and cold compressed gases leads to loss of water and heat
      from the respiratory tract. Drying of the respiratory tract can lead to destruction of the
      cilia and mucous membranes, resulting in decreased mucociliary transport and increased
      concentration of secretions.There is no definitive literature on fresh gas mix (oxygen + air)
      flow rates in patients under general anesthesia. This study aimed to investigate whether two
      fresh gas flow rates routinely employed in the authors' practice affected airway temperature
      and humidity.
