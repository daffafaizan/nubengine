      status I to II ) undergoing elective hand, wrist and forearm surgery were prospectively
      enrolled. Patients were randomly assigned to Group C (conventional technique) or group J
      (Jedi technique). In both groups, axillary plexus blockage was provided by applying 5cc of a
      mixture of 10 cc 0.5% bupivacaine and 10 cc 2% prilocaine to the ulnar, radial, median and
      musculocutaneous nerves. Parameters such as performance time and the number of needle passes
      were recorded during procedure. Subsequently, a blinded observer evaluated and recorded
      parameters related to the success of blockage. The main outcome variable was performance time
      and success rate (surgical anesthesia).
