    
      This is an open-label study to evaluate efficiency of administration of Autologous
      Adipose-Derived Adult Stromal Vascular Fraction (SVF) in the testis in patients with
      oligospermia and azoospermia.

      Forty men with several form oligozoospermia and azoospermia will be recruited for the study.
      20 patients with same diagnosis served as a control with standard medications.Other patients
      -10 with oligospermia and 10 with azoospermia will receive standard medication and SVF
      injections.

      The diagnosis of Azoospermia (Oligospermia) will be established on the basis of two and more
      semen analysis evaluations done at separate occasions and detailed history taking, physical
      examination and investigations (blood tests include hormon levels as testosteron. follicle
      stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH). karyotyping and testosterone levels, and
      may include testicular biopsy or transrectal ultrasound if indicated.

      This study affect only Pretesticular and Testicular forms, without chromosomal aberration.
      SVF can produce a lot of cytokines ( as EGF, FGF, NGF, PDGF, VEGF, IGF, GMCSF, GCSF, TGF,
      Erythropoetin, TPO, BMP, HGF, GDF, Neurotrophins, MSF, SGF, GDF and growth factors) moreover
      the microvesicles and exosomes released by this cells can prevent cells from apoptosis and
      stimulate regenerative process of surrounding tissues and cells.

      SVF will be transplanted by an andrological surgeon through a standard surgical approach.
      Subjects will be monitored frequently for a total of one year after cell injection.
