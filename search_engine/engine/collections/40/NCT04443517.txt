      episodes appear to be predictive of further episodes of inpatient delirium and associated
      adverse outcomes. Intraoperative monitoring of frontal electroencephalogram (EEG) has been
      associated with postoperative delirium and poor outcomes. However, the efficacy of titrating
      anesthesia medication to proprietary index targets for preventing delirium remains
      contentious. The investigators aim to assess the efficacy of two pharmacologic strategies
      which could prevent post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) delirium (1) maximization of
      intraoperative alpha power during maintenance and (2) switching anesthesia regimes during the
      emergence phases of anesthesia.
