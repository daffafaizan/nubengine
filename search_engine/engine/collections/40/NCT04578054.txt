    
      This is an observational study using a REDCapÂ® questionnaire via an internet link, which will
      be distributed by any means (institution mailing lists via a referent, flash codes
      distributed to physicians, etc.).

      The questionnaire will assess the type of medicalisation, the type of activity, the different
      hours of intervention, the age, the type and the severity of the patient's disease, the type
      of care practiced and the stress of the physician.
