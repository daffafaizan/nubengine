      limb (UL), which can lead to long term problems to use the UL in daily life, such as personal
      care, household- and leisure activities. Few studies have evaluated if sensory re-learning in
      combination with task-specific training can improve the ability to perform daily hand
      activities and perceived participation. Therefore, there is a need for more studies. This is
      a single-blinded pilot randomized controlled trial with two treatment arms. Thirty persons
      with sensory impairments of the UL after stroke will be recruited and randomized to either
      sensory re-learning in combination with task-specific training or to task-specific training
      only. The training will consist of 2.5 hours of group training per session, 2 times per week
      for 5 weeks. Assessments will be conducted pre- and post-training and at 3 months' after the
      intervention.

      Descriptive statistics (mean (SD) or median (min- max) will be used to characterize the study
      groups. Non-parametric statistics will be used for ordinal data and parametric statistics for
      continues data. To analyze between group differences, the Mann-Whitney test or Independent
      sample t-test will be used and Wilcoxon signed ranks test or paired t-test to analyze within
      group differences. The level of statistical significance will be set at p < 0.05.
