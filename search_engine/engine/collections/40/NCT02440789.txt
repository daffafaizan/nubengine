      remained on ART, without study intervention. Samples were collected to define the
      pre-intervention steady-state of HIV, inflammation and immune activation parameters.

      At week 12, sirolimus therapy was initiated for the planned 20 weeks of treatment. In order
      to achieve therapeutic levels, sirolimus therapy was initiated with lead-in dose of 0.025 or
      0.05 mg/kg/day, depending on the ART regimen. Doses for each participant were then adjusted,
      based on trough blood sirolimus concentrations, to achieve target concentrations between 5
      and 10 ng/mL. There were frequent initial visits for sirolimus trough concentration
      monitoring and potential dose adjustments, at weeks 12.5, 13, 13.5, 14, 14.5, 15, 15.5 and
      16. Then visits occurred at weeks 18, 20, 24, 28 and 32. After the week 32 visit, the planned
      end of study treatment, there was an additional 12 weeks of post-sirolimus follow-up, with a
      final visit at week 44.

      Study visits included physical examinations, clinical assessments, safety monitoring, and
      blood and oral swab collection. Anal swabs were collected at week 12 and 32. Samples were
      stored for subsequent protocol testing for the study outcomes.

      In the primary analysis, the significance level was 0.05 for all analyses.
