      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of olaparib in sequential treatment with
      adavosertib (AZD1775).

      II. To establish the maximum tolerated dose/recommended phase 2 dose (MTD/RP2D) of this
      sequential schedule in patients with advanced solid tumors in a post-poly adenosine
      diphosphate (ADP) ribose polymerase inhibitor (PARPi) population.

      III. To assess the safety and toxicity profile of the sequential treatment of olaparib and
      AZD1775 in a post-PARPi population.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess putative predictive biomarkers of response and resistance to the sequential
      treatment of olaparib and AZD1775 in a post-PARPi population.

      II. To evaluate a novel experimental trial design involving sequential dosing of olaparib and
      AZD1775 in a post-PARPi population.

      III. To observe and record anti-tumor activity.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of adavosertib.

      Patients receive olaparib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-5 and 15-19 of each cycle
      and adavosertib PO once daily (QD) on days 8-12 and 22-26 of each cycle. Cycles repeat every
      28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 3-6
      months for up to 2 years.
