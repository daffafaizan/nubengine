      months and once weekly for the subsequent 3 months, in combination with mindfulness mediation
      for the duration of tDCS each treatment. Subjects who miss 4 consecutive treatment days or 20
      percent of total treatments will be exit the treatment intervention as it is our intention to
      encourage compliance with the proposed treatments to maintain optimal wellness.

      Aim 1. To investigate the efficacy of at home maintenance tDCS for patients with MDD who have
      responded to a successful acute course of rTMS.

      Hypothesis 1. Patients receiving tDCS will have a higher proportion of sustained responders
      or remitters after 6 months compared to sham tDCS.

      Exploratory Aim 2. To investigate clinical predictors of sustained response to rTMS using
      tDCS Hypothesis 2. Remitters and those not on benzodiazepines will be associated with greater
      likelihood of sustained response.
