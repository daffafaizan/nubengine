      Adolescent Medicine Trials Units (AMTUs) newly participating in ATN III and to enroll all
      participating patients followed at each site. This approach will allow for the examination of
      the broad spectrum of youth participating in the ATN, including those newly entered into
      care.

      Psychosocial and risk-taking behavioral data will be collected using Audio Computer-Assisted
      Self-Interview (ACASI) for English-speaking participants, or a paper-and-pencil
      Spanish-language survey with identical measures to the ACASI for Spanish-speaking
      participants; biomedical information will be collected through medical chart abstraction.
