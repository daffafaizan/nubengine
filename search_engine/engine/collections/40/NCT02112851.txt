      will include 33 subjects randomized to receive products A, B or C [240 mL (255 g)]. Subjects
      will be randomly assigned to one of 6 sequences of 3 interventions. After the initial
      screening visit, subjects will visit the Clinical and Translational Research Center (CTRC)
      the Tufts Translational and Clinical Science Institute (CTSI) on three separate occasions.
      Following each intervention day there will be a two week wash out period.
