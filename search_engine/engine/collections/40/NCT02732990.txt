      exercise remains unclear. Recent evidence suggests that the peripheral skeletal muscle, which
      becomes abnormal in heart failure, is the source of afferent signals which disrupt normal
      patterns of cardiorespiratory control. When CHF patients exercise, an inappropriately strong
      sympathetic response further limits exercise tolerance by evoking larger than normal
      increases in peripheral sympathetic activation at a faster rate than in healthy individuals.
      A consequence of this exacerbated sympathetic response may be the further sympathetic
      restraint of blood flow to the active skeletal muscles resulting in hypoperfusion of the
      muscle vascular bed and fatigue. Small muscle mass exercise training increases muscle
      oxidative capacity and improves aerobic work capacity in CHF patients. A range of studies is
      proposed here that will provide an integrative view of the mechanistic basis behind exercise
      intolerance in CHF and relate the intramuscular metabolic status to the autonomic control of
      hemodynamics during exercise. An understanding of the mechanistic basis of the improved
      exercise tolerance with training, independent of improved resting cardiac function, will
      yield important information regarding the integrated control of blood flow and metabolic
      demand in CHF and highlight the importance of maintaining the integrity of the peripheral
      musculature in CHF.
