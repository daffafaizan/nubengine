      endoscopic control of bleeding from peptic ulcers reduced rate of recurrent bleeding,
      decreased the need for endoscopic and surgical interventions and in general improved
      patients' outcomes. A trend towards reduced mortality associated with the use of high-dose
      intravenous PPI was also observed. Recent clinical trials from Asia have provided evidence
      that high-dose oral PPIs are associated with a reduction in rebleeding. Current meta-analysis
      suggests that both high dose (intravenous) and low dose (oral) PPIs effectively reduce
      rebleeding vs placebo. However, there has been no clinical study to compare IV infusion to
      oral PPI in this patient population.

      Endoscopic stigmata in bleeding peptic ulcers are prognostic and allow risk stratification.
      Patients with a clean ulcer base have a < 5% risk of rebleeding; this increases progressively
      with a flat spot, adherent clot, non-bleeding visible vessel and active bleeding (55%). Early
      endoscopy in patients with bleeding peptic ulcers selects the high risk ulcers for therapy
      and evaluation of adjuvant PPI use.
