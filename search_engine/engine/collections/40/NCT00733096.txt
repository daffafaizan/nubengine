      two treatments with transforaminal epidural saline. Each group will receive a 2nd procedure
      identical to the first 2 weeks after the initial procedure.

      Seventy-eight study participants will be randomized via a computerized randomization system
      using SPSS software in groups of 6 at each institution by a research nurse not involved in
      patient care. There will be 26 patients in each of the 3 groups. A physician unaware of the
      patient's treatment group will place 22-gauge needles in the relevant foramen under
      fluoroscopic guidance as determined by patient's symptoms and MRI findings. Once correct
      placement is confirmed by contrast injection, the blinded physician will leave the room and
      another physician will inject the medication. In group I, this will be 60 mg of
      depo-methylprednisolone. In group II, this will be 4 mg of etanercept reconstituted in 2 ml
      of sterile water. In group III, this will be normal saline.

      Two weeks after the initial procedure, an identical procedure to the first one will be done
      by the same physician or his designate. In addition to the study medication, each patient in
      each group will receive 0.5 ml of 0.5% bupivacaine local anesthetic for immediate pain relief
      during both injections before the study drug is delivered. The efficacy of blinding will be
      assessed by a disinterested observer unaware of the randomization results after the second
      procedure before discharge. Follow-up visits will be conducted one, three and six months
      after the second injection, for those subjects who continue to experience > 50% pain relief.
