      therapy can be increased in elderly persons suspected of having an MCI by means of parallel
      tDCS treatment.

      All test participants train over 6 sessions within 2 weeks two different working memory tasks
      with increasing difficulty. In the randomized, double-blind, prospective therapy study,
      participants are assigned to either a Verum-tDCS or a placebo-tDCS group. The Verum-tDCS
      group receives active stimulation in parallel to the exercise therapy, while the placebo
      group does not receive tDCS stimulation. To check the effects of the therapy, we measure
      performance and neuronal activation in different executive tasks using near-infrared
      spectroscopy (NIRS). Furthermore, we will check whether the training increases the volume of
      the grey matter (Draganski et al., 2004, Malchow et al., 2016) and the expression of BDNF can
      be increased (Schuch et al., 2015).
