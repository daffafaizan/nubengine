      dose of ixabepilone. Patients will be monitored for safety and toxicity. If the combination
      is found to be tolerable and feasible, accrual will continue with the full-dose regimen.
      Toxicity will be monitored in real-time by the study investigators. Should unexpected or
      increased toxicity be detected, trial accrual will be halted for full analysis.

      Bevacizumab will be administered intravenously, 10 mg/kg, every two weeks. Ixabepilone will
      be administered intravenously, 16 mg/m2, once weekly for 3 of 4 weeks on a 28-day schedule,
      to the first six patients enrolled. Ixabepilone will be administered intravenously, 20mg/m2,
      once weekly for 3 of 4 weeks on a 28-day schedule, to the remaining 40 patients enrolled.
