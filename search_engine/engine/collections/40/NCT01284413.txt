      representing the only potentially curative treatment for this disease. However, many patients
      are diagnosed too late for curative resection, and even if surgery can be performed, the
      likelihood of relapse is very high. Over the past decade, gemcitabine has been widely used to
      treat unresectable or recurrent biliary tract cancer patients. In the ABC-02 study, the first
      prospective multicenter phase III study in this field, gemcitabine/cisplatin combination
      chemotherapy was compared with gemcitabine monotherapy and found that the combination regimen
      significantly prolonged MST (from 8.1 to 11.7 months; P < 0.001). Gemcitabine/cisplatin
      combination therapy is now considered to be the standard regimen for advanced biliary tract
      cancer. S-1 is an oral fluoropyrimidine prodrug that has confirmed efficacy against various
      solid tumors, both alone and in combination with other cytotoxic drugs. S-1 monotherapy has
      yielded good results against advanced biliary tract cancer and gemcitabine/S-1 combination
      therapy has yielded promising results with acceptable toxicity levels for patients with
      advanced biliary tract cancer. In this study, we aimed to determine the safety and efficacy
      of adding S-1 to gemcitabine/cisplatin combination regimen for advanced biliary tract cancer.
