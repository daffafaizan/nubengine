    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of 5-fluoro-2'-deoxycytidine
      (5-fluoro-2-deoxycytidine) (FdCyd) administered by intravenous (IV) infusion over three hours
      with concomitant infusion of 350 mg/m2 of tetrahydrouridine (THU).

      II. To describe the toxicities of FdCyd co-infused with THU.

      III. To obtain preliminary evidence of anti-tumor activity in patients treated with this
      combination.

      IV. To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of FdCyd and THU when co-infused.

      V. To evaluate the oral bioavailability of FdCyd when co-administered with THU.

      VI. When feasible, to measure the relative levels of the messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA)'s
      for thymidylate synthase, deoxycytidine kinase, deoxycytidylate (dCMP) deaminase and other
      relevant enzymes; and the methylation status of p16 and other genes relevant to neoplasia.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of 5-fluoro-2-deoxycytidine. Patients receive
      tetrahydrouridine orally (PO) on day 1; 5-fluoro-2-deoxycytidine PO on days 1 and 8;
      tetrahydrouridine IV over 3 hours on days 2-5, 8, and 9-12; and 5-fluoro-2-deoxycytidine IV
      over 3 hours on days 2-5 and 9-12 of course 1. For all subsequent courses, patients receive
      tetrahydrouridine IV over 3 hours and 5-fluoro-2-deoxycytidine IV over 3 hours on days 1-5.
      Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.
