      low levels of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity are associated with adverse health
      consequences including increased risk for obesity, and cardiovascular and diabetes risk
      factors. Therefore, there is a need for studies that can increase physical activity levels in
      children. Mobile phones are a way to deliver behavioral interventions. Mobile phones are
      portable, allow for real-time data collection, and can potentially reach large numbers of
      people. Text messages can also be utilized to promote behavior change. Few mobile phone based
      interventions have specifically targeted child physical activity.

      The aims of this pilot study were to determine the feasibility and efficacy of a physical
      activity promotion program targeting 6-10 year old children that is delivered to parents
      through mobile phones.
