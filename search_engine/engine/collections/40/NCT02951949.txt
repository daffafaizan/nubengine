      participate in a cross-sectional study in which a list of clinical and analytical risk
      factors for cardiovascular disease were assessed. Clinical factors included weight, waist
      circumference, body mass index and blood pressure. Analytical parameters included lipidogram,
      serum glucose and insulin, thyroid hormones (TSH and total T4), vitamin D, ultra-sensitive
      C-reactive protein, estradiol, and osteoprotegerin. Imaging studies were performed to
      identify the atherosclerotic burden at the carotid artery (intima-media thickness, measured
      by a high frequency ultrasound probe), and the coronaries (both coronary artery calcium(CAC)
      score and the degree of lumen stenosis). Genetic susceptibility was measured by studying
      single nucleotide polymorphisms of the estrogen receptor. The independent effect of each
      variable was analyzed with multivariate analysis.
