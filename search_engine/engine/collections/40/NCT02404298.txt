        -  gene profile on transcriptome analysis of peripheral blood

        -  T cell repertory

        -  igG dosage

        -  immunological profile

      Before IVIG (T1 time) and and 3 weeks after IVIg treatment (T2 time). On a population of
      patients having: CIDP, autoimmune muscular disease, Clarkson syndrome, or autoimmune
      diseases.

      We also search for polymorphism of FCgammareceptor, TKPC et CASP3 genes in CIDP patients
