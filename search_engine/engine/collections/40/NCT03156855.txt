      cancer and peptic ulcer diseases. Eradication of H. pylori infection reduces the risk of
      gastric cancer and recurrence of peptic ulcer disease. However, the eradication rate of
      clarithromycin-based triple therapy has been declining in recent years, probably related to
      the increasing resistant rate to clarithromycin. Sequential therapy for 10 days has been
      shown to be more effective than triple therapy for 7 and 10 days. The investigators further
      demonstrated that sequential therapy given for 14 days was superior to triple therapy given
      for 14 days. Recently, the investigators also found that bismuth quadruple therapy given for
      10 days appeared to be more effective than triple therapy given for 14 days in the first line
      therapy. However, whether sequential therapy given for 14 days is more effective than bismuth
      quadruple therapy or triple therapy for 14 days remains unknown.
