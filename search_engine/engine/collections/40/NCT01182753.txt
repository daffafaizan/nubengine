      at Heidelberger Ionenstrahl-Therapie (HIT) centre as monocentric trial.

      Proton therapy is the gold standard in the treatment of low and intermediate grad
      chondrosarcomas of the skull base. However, high-LET beams such as carbon ions theoretically
      offer biologic advantages by enhanced biologic effectiveness in slow-growing tumors. Up until
      now it was impossible to compare two different particle therapies, i.e. proton and carbon ion
      therapy directly with each other. The aim of this study is to find out, whether the
      biological advantages of carbon ion therapy mentioned above can also be clinically confirmed.

      Patients with skull base chondrosarcomas will be randomised to either proton or carbon ion
      radiation therapy. As a standard, patients will undergo non-invasive, rigid immobilization
      and target volume definition will be carried out based on CT and MRI data. The biologically
      isoeffective target dose to the PTV in carbon ion treatment will be 60 Gy E ± 5% and 70 Gy E
      ± 5% (standard dose) in proton therapy respectively. The 5 year local-progression free
      survival (LPFS) rate will be analysed as primary end point. Overall survival, progression
      free and metastasis free survival, patterns of recurrence, local control rate and morbidity
      are the secondary end points. Plan quality is also a matter of interest.
