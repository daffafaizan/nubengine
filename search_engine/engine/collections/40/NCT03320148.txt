      primary care settings in Ontario to evaluate the individual health outcomes and health system
      impact of implementing a new physiotherapist-led primary care model for people with back
      pain. The primary purpose of this pilot study is to determine the feasibility including
      recruitment and retention of primary care teams (sites) and patient participants, carrying
      out the assessment procedures, and implementing the physiotherapist-led primary care
      intervention including training the physiotherapist to adopt this role.
