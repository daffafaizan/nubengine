      instructed to use the Eye Drop Guide first while for group II; the participants will be
      instructed to use the routine self-instillation technique first. The instruction will be
      given to all participants by the same investigator. The participants are allowed to practice
      until confidence in the techniques to which they are assigned. The participants then are
      instructed to use only that technique to instill eye drops in both eyes every day and keep
      the diary to document the date, time of practice, and number of bottles use in each eye for
      practice at home. The investigators make a telephone visit at 1 week to remind the practice
      routine and the follow up schedule. The 2 week follow up will be scheduled to evaluate the
      self-instillation performance using the techniques to which they are assigned by the VDO
      recordings under the same setting as Day 1.

      After VDO recordings the participants will be switched to receive the other technique with
      the same instruction as the other group. Allow the same period of practice in the hospital
      and at home. The investigators again will make a 1-week telephone visit and 2-week follow up
      after self-practice at home. At week 4 the VDO recordings of self-instillation performance
      will be taken again under the same setting as previous records.
