      expanding burden of poorly controlled type 2 diabetes. However, mobile health (mHealth)
      strategies are likely to significantly improve and extend Thai nurses' ability to monitor and
      manage these patients. This study aims to:

      1) investigate the feasibility and acceptability of a culturally- and clinically-adapted
      mHealth intervention with adult Thai diabetic patients and their community nurses, and 2)
      estimate the intervention's effect upon glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting blood glucose,
      self-management behaviors, and diabetes-related distress in uncontrolled type 2 diabetes.
      Thirty-six patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes (along with their regular nurses)
      will be recruited through an established community clinic network. After baseline clinical
      and behavioral assessment, patients will receive 12 weeks of automated 10-minute weekly
      Interactive Voice Response (IVR) calls to provide monitoring and self-management support
      related to glycemic symptoms, medication adherence, and several self-care behaviors.
      Patients' clinical nurse will receive weekly summaries of each IVR call by text message and
      email with guidance on Thai-appropriate best practices. Principal investigator will receive
      email whenever patients report a potentially urgent issue by IVR, i.e., symptoms of
      hypoglycemia, or inadequate supply of medication. Immediately after the 12-week intervention
      concludes, clinical and behavioral variables will be reassessed and a mixed-methods process
      evaluation will be performed.
