    
      The proposed study is a pilot study designed to determine the efficacy and safety of serial
      ketamine infusions among veterans with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) as well as
      chronic post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The investigators hypothesize that six
      infusions of ketamine will be effective in decreasing severity of depressive symptoms and
      maintaining response.

      Participants will be male/female veterans (18 to 75 years old) of any era or military
      background who suffer from TRD and chronic PTSD. Potential participants will be recruited
      from Mental Health clinics and screened for eligibility using a two stage process
      (phone/chart review, followed by interview). Participants will receive six ketamine infusions
      on a Monday-Wednesday-Friday schedule over 2 weeks. On the day of infusion, participants will
      be required to stay at the clinical site for 3 hours after the medication has been given.
      Follow-up visits will occur at different time points over the course of 2 months after the
      two week infusion period has been completed.
