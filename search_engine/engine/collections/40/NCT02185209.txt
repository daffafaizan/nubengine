      recommendations of the use of adjunctive systemic antibiotics in the treatment of
      peri-implantitis. This study will also be able to determine the ecological impact on the
      oropharyngeal and intestinal microflora between different antibiotic treatments. The lack of
      knowledge in this area has been highlighted by the Food and Drug Administration and The
      Swedish Council on Health Technology Assessment (SBU)
