      Primary

        -  Compare the overall and progression-free survival of older patients with previously
           untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia treated with fludarabine vs chlorambucil.

        -  Compare the duration of remission in patients treated with these regimens.

      Secondary

        -  Compare the incidence of toxicity, especially infections, in patients treated with these
           regimens.

        -  Compare the quality of life in patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment
      arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive fludarabine IV on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 28 days for
           up to 6 courses.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral chlorambucil on day 1. Treatment repeats every 15 days for
           up to 12 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 205 patients will be accrued for this study.
