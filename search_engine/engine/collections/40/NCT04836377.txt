    
      Subjects participating in the GuardOne study will be offered participation in the
      AVRO-RD-02-LTF01 study. For individual participating subjects, the Baseline visit for the
      AVRO-RD-02-LTF01 study will coincide with the final visit in the GuardOne study. Written
      informed consent will be obtained and inclusion/exclusion criteria will be reviewed to
      confirm study eligibility. Subjects will be asked to return for study visits at approximately
      6 month intervals for the first 4 years of the study and then annually thereafter for 10
      years (for a total follow-up of 14 years in this study), during which time periodic safety
      and efficacy assessments will be performed to assess measures of safety, engraftment, and
      clinical response after AVR-RD-02 treatment in the GuardOne study.
