      CHUGA surgeons during a cystostomy is easier to perform while having the necessary same
      results as the other methods.

      To do this, we must validate the quality of this method and therefore we will evaluate the
      results expected from a continuous cystostomy via a questionnaire. After a first telephone
      contact by Dr BOILLOT for a presentation of the study, patient will therefore be contacted by
      telephone by the Clinical Research Associate of the service.

      During this interview patient will be asked to answer a questionnaire consisting of five
      questions.
