      Medicine in Ume√• were invited to participate in this study. Only persons older than 18 years
      was included in the study. The persons included received one bottle of study medicine, a home
      protocol (WURSS 21) and a viral sampling kit. Whenever the included persons were sure that
      they had received an episode of common cold they were told to perform a viral sampling from
      the nose, fill in the protocol and start to use the nasal spray several times daily for one
      week. The treatment was either a) a saline solution with 5% glucose or b) a saline solution
      with 200U/ml of glucose oxidase and 5%glucose (active treatment group). The combination of
      glucose oxidase and glucose produces an acid environment, imitating the effect of the normal
      nasal flora and Human Rhinoviruses are sensitive to an acid environment. After one week of
      treatment and daily records of the WURSS 21 protocol the persons returned the spray bottles
      (Bag-on-Valve), the virus vials and the protocols.

      A total of 146 persons were included in the study and 98 persons returned protocols.
