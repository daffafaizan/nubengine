      corrective components. Corrective straps are attached to the artificial hinge to exert
      corrective forces onto the scoliotic spine. Semi-rigid silicon pads with high conformability
      to the body are used to enhance the corrective forces.

      This study is a multi-disciplinary collaborative project with experts in computer science,
      orthopaedics, materials science, garment technology, engineering and biomechanics. A
      biomechanical computational model will be developed to recommend modifications to the
      flexible brace design. The effectiveness of the flexible braces will be evaluated through
      low-dose X-ray radiography at pre-, post-expert and post-ML designed treatment. A polynomial
      scoring system will be created to assess the therapeutic similarity of the ML-designed
      flexible brace to the expert-designed flexible brace based on an estimate of the corrective
      forces applied through the braces. Reinforcement learning with scores based on estimated
      pressure force will guide AI training towards superior therapeutic designs.
