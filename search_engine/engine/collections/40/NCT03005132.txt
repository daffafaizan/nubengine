      transcriptomes, perform whole exome sequencing, and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
      array profiling for triplets, each comprising normal brain tissue, primary GBM carcinoma, and
      its synchronous matched metastasis, as well as analyzed genomics of GBM characterized
      previously by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to conduct integrated proteogenomic analyses.
