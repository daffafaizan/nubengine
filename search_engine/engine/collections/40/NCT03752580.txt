      mask on participants. The clinical investigation will be conducted in New Zealand and
      participants will interact with the user instructions in a one hour daytime visit. This
      investigation is designed to evaluate the interpretation by participants of the user
      instructions. A total number of 20 participants, diagnosed with OSA will be recruited for the
      trial. The participants will be recruited from the Fisher and Paykel Healthcare Database of
      subjects (Ethics reference 18/NTA/62).

      Fisher and Paykel Healthcare will act as the investigator and sponsor for this investigation.
      This study will be conducted in accordance with ICH/GCP Guidelines. No deviation from
      protocol will be implemented without prior review and approval of the sponsor except where it
      may be necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to a research participant. In such case,
      the deviation will be reported to the sponsor (Bhavi Ogra) as soon as possible.
