    
      Volunteers (aim is 36 completers) will participate in a double-blind study conducted over a
      period of about 14-17 weeks including sessions for screening, food and beverage diary review
      (Phase 1), drug exposure and choice sessions (Phase 2), and no-choice exposure sessions
      (Phase 3). During Phases 2 and 3, participants will orally ingest capsules containing varying
      doses of commonly prescribed over-the-counter medications and/or placebo. During screening,
      participants will be asked questions about participants' general characteristics including
      demographic information, mood, and personality. Participants will also be examined to
      determine medical eligibility. Eligible participants will proceed to Phase 1 in which
      participants will be asked to eliminate certain foods and beverages from participants diet,
      record participants daily food and beverage consumption and attend the laboratory
      approximately three times per week to discuss participants' food diaries. During Phases 2 and
      3 food and beverage restrictions will remain in place and participants will report to the
      laboratory 2-5 times weekly in order to ingest study capsules and fill out questionnaires
      (e.g., about participants' current mood). After leaving the laboratory, participants will be
      asked to fill out surveys remotely in order to describe the effects of that session's
      capsules on mood and preference.
