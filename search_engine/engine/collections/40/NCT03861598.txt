      standard chemotherapy treatment in the second line setting in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM).
      The change in direction with the combination of carvedilol with standard of chemotherapy
      based upon brain MRI results will be assessed and associating that with also the change in
      the quantity of tumor cells with a new invented assay device. Six subjects will be enrolled
      in the study who have recurrent GBM and will be receiving second line treatment.

      The subjects will receive standard therapy per the discretion of the treating oncologist.
      Carvedilol will start at 6.25 mg orally twice daily for 1-2 weeks to confirm tolerance. The
      subjects will then receive carvedilol at 12.5 mg orally twice daily as the maximum dose and
      take it continuously for 4 cycles of therapy. At the completion of 4 cycles, patients will
      stop taking carvedilol. If the patients were on previous anti-hypertensive medications, they
      will be instructed to restart those medications if stopped on this trial for carvedilol.

      Peripheral blood samples will be collected at baseline before initiation of treatment, on
      first day of every cycle for four cycles and after the last cycle is completed to obtain
      peripheral glioma circulating tumor levels. Subjects will be re-evaluated for response every
      2 cycles of therapy with brain MRI with and without contrast.
