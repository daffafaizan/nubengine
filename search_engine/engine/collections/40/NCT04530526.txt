      lasting greater than three months. Chronic post-mastectomy pain due to nerve injury leads to
      long-term opioid use and diminished quality-of-life. A novel surgical approach to neuroma
      treatment, the regenerative peripheral nerve interface (RPNI) developed to treat painful
      neuromas associated with limb amputation has shown significant reductions in patient-reported
      pain. RPNI surgery is now available through Michigan Medicine's Multi-Disciplinary Peripheral
      Nerve (MDPN) Clinic to improve post-mastectomy pain and definitively treat intercostal
      neuromas following mastectomy. Using patient-reported outcomes and clinical data the
      investigators will evaluate the use of RPNI surgery to reduce persistent post- mastectomy
      pain in women seeking surgical consultation through the Plastic Surgery or MDPN clinics.
