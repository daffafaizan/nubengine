        -  To assess the effect of low-fat food on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of pexidartinib
           following a single oral dose of 400 mg administered in healthy subjects

        -  To assess the PK of pexidartinib following a single oral dose of 200 mg administered
           with low-fat food in healthy subjects

      The secondary objective of this study is:

        -  To characterize the safety and tolerability of pexidartinib in healthy subjects
           following administration of a single oral dose of pexidartinib with low fat food and
           without food
