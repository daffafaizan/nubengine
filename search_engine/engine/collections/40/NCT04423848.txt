    
      This research study is a single arm pilot Feasibility Study, which is the first-time
      investigators are examining this hospital at home intervention for patients with lymphoma.

      The research study procedures include screening for eligibility, questionnaires, remote
      patient monitoring (e.g. patient-reported symptoms and home monitored vital signs) and
      home-based supportive care (e.g. visits to patients' homes to address and manage any
      concerning issues identified), and interviews of participants, caregivers, and clinicians
      asking their perceptions of the Home Hospital for Lymphoma program.

      Participants will include 3 groups:

      Enrolled participants receiving the hospital at home intervention, caregivers of
      participants, and clinicians.

      Participants will be in the research study for about six months after consent. It is expected
      that up to 38 participants will take part in this research study.
