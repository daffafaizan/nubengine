        -  Determine the activity of cisplatin and etoposide in terms of response of patients with
           metastatic Ewing's sarcoma or primitive neuroectodermal tumor.

        -  Assess the bone marrow and kidney toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive cisplatin IV over 3 hours on days 1, 8, 15, 29, 36, and 43 and oral
      etoposide daily on days 1-15 and 29-43 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 21-45 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
