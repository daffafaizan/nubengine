      patients was the use of glucocorticoids, which are accompanied by significant side effects
      including obesity, cushingoid features, osteoporosis, and behavioral disturbances.
      Spironolactone is an aldosterone antagonist primarily used as a potassium sparing diuretic
      that is widely used in the pediatric population, with limited side-effects including
      gynecomastia and hyperkalemia. Recent studies by Dr. Rafael-Fortney have evaluated the effect
      of spironolactone treatment in several different mouse models of DMD. Her results show that
      treatment of these mice demonstrates increased muscle membrane stabilization while reducing
      the negative side-effects typically associated with standard of care glucocorticoids. This
      pilot study is designed to determine whether this commonly used medication, spironolactone,
      may have similar beneficial effects with a lower side effect profile and be applicable to a
      wider population of DMD patients.

      The hypothesis for this controlled pilot trial is that spironolactone and prednisolone are of
      equal efficacy in improving skeletal muscle function over a 6-month period, and that
      spironolactone will be well tolerated in this patient population.

      One outcome is that both drugs demonstrate equal efficacy in motor function. This would then
      serve as pilot data for a longer term study.
