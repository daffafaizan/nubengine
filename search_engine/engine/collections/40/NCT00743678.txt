      EGFR status. The results of this study will show the resection rate with neoadjuvant
      treatment in patients with colorectal cancer with liver-only metastasis.

      Restaging including CT after #3, #6, #9, and #12 cycles of FOLFOX + Cetuximab

      If any time, patients have PD, Off-study SD, Continue study treatment until resectable, up to
      #12 cycles, PD, or toxicities PR or more, If resectable, go to surgery : resection of liver
      metastasis and primary tumor, if present If unresectable, continue until resectable, up to
      #12 cycles, PD, or toxicities

      Overall, a total of 12 cycles of treatment including neoadjuvant therapy will be given either
      before, after or without surgery.

      CT scans will be performed every 3 cycles during the first 12 cycles (6 months). After that,
      CT scans will be performed every 2 months for another 6 months, then every 3 months for 6
      months, then once a year or earlier if a PD is probable.

      AEs will be evaluated once every cycle and during the CT evaluation visit.. Patients that can
      only undergo R1 resection or are unable to get surgery at all, will be evaluated regularly
      until PD.

      Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) may be allowed as a palliative local therapy in patients that
      are suitable for it. RFA is not considered equal to a resection.
