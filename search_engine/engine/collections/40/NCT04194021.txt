      Chain Management (PFSCM), the Collaborative Initiative for Pediatric HIV Education and
      Research (CIPHER) of the International AIDS Society (IAS), and Right to Care have partnered
      to implement the New Horizons Collaborative to improve and scale-up pediatric HIV/AIDS care
      and treatment through increased awareness, research, health systems strengthening, and
      improved access to HIV/AIDS medicines. A primary source of darunavir (DRV) and etravirine
      (ETR) for pediatric populations in sub-Saharan Africa is through the New Horizons DRV/ETR
      Donation Program, which was launched in 2014. Under this program, Janssen provides DRV and/or
      ETR free of charge to eligible national HIV/AIDS programs in sub-Saharan Africa, for use in
      children and adolescents up to 25 years of age.

      Countries currently participating in the New Horizons Collaborative include: Cameroon,
      Eswatini, Ethiopia, Kenya, Lesotho, Nigeria, Rwanda, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. Any
      country that applies and is approved for receipt of donated product will become eligible for
      this study when they begin offering donated product to patients.

      Prior to the inception of the New Horizons Collaborative, no multi-country data were
      collected regarding the demographic or clinical characteristics of the target patient
      population (i.e., children, adolescents, and young people < 25 years in need of second- or
      third-line HIV/AIDS treatment). Therefore, the current activity proposes to collect
      cross-sectional demographic and clinical data at baseline and every six months for patients
      receiving DRV and/or ETR across participating New Horizons countries. This activity will
      comprise data abstraction of key demographic, clinical, laboratory and case history
      indicators and outcomes on each patient who ever received DRV and/or ETR.
