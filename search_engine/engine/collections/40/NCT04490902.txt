      opacification which could only be treated by central penetrating keratoplasty and limbal
      transplantation, but the rejection rate is very high. In clinical, we found that limbal
      transplantation combined with central penetrating keratoplasty from different donors can keep
      the graft transparent for a long time, this result also be found in organ transplantation,
      multiple donor organ transplantation could reduce rejection risk in liver and kidney
      transplantation. Therefore, it is speculated that there are different MHC antigens from
      different donors, which cause different reactions after transplantation. Because there are a
      large number of Langerhans cellsï¼Œ abundant blood vessels and lymphatic in the limbal, so the
      rejection occurs early and severely. Continuous and intense limbal rejection leads to the
      depletion of recipient T cells, lead to the immune tolerance of another donor's central
      corneal tissue. In this project, central penetrating keratoplasty and limbal transplantation
      from different donors will be carried out and the graft survival of high-risk corneal
      transplantation will be observed in clinical, to find a new method for high-risk corneal
      transplant patients.
