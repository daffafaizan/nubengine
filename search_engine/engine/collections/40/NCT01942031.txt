      intervention (receiving structured feed back on detection rate of stroke/transient ischemic
      attacks in comparison to hospital discharge registry data. The randomisation is done group
      wise based on training areas. A data set is presented by different means; 1) in written
      reports, directly to the head of each primary care center in the intervention group 2)in oral
      presentation on training sessions for the physicians in each training ares. Measures of
      detection rates of diagnosis and dispensed prescriptions of secondary preventive drugs are
      made before start of the project and after one year. The control group, ie the primary care
      centers not receiving feed back, are measured in the same way and thus provide a control
      group. The hypothesis being that with visibility of the problem, it is easier to improve care
      wich is what all health providers aim to do.

      Outcome measures is percentage of patients with stroke (ICD code I60, I 61, I63, I64) and
      transitory ischemic attacks(G45) who are dispensed prescribed secondary preventive medication
      and death.
