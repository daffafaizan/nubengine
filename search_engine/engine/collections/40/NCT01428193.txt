      pulses when compared to age matched controls. An ongoing study by our group is investigating
      whether the progesterone insensitivity of the GnRH pulse generator in adult women with PCOS
      is also seen in adolescent girls with hyperandrogenemia. Analysis of the data to date
      suggests that the hyperandrogenic adolescent girls have decreased hypothalamic progesterone
      sensitivity when compared to adolescent controls, with a subgroup (consisting of
      approximately half of the hyperandrogenic girls) having marked progesterone insensitivity
      similar to that seen in adult women with PCOS. These data have recently been published.

      Given that androgens mediate hypothalamic progesterone insensitivity in adult women with
      PCOS, we hypothesize that androgens play a similar role in adolescent girls with
      hyperandrogenemia and that progesterone sensitivity can be restored with the use of the
      androgen receptor blocker flutamide.

      Better understanding the effects of hyperandrogenemia in adolescence and its role in the
      development of PCOS will hopefully lead to improved prevention and treatment strategies for
      PCOS. This may prove increasingly important if the current epidemic in childhood obesity
      results in a growing number of girls with elevated androgen levels.
