      aneurysms is the use of either coils or self-expandable stents. The flow diverter stent
      concept is based upon the hemodynamic exclusion of the aneurysm sac, without coils being
      eventually placed within the sac. The primary objective of this post-market clinical
      investigation is to demonstrate that when using the CE-marked, commercially available SILK
      Artery Reconstruction Device in the indication for which it is approved, notably for the
      treatment (occlusion) of intracranial aneurysms, the anatomical results are superior compared
      to standard treatment with commercially available intracranial coils (used with eventual
      balloon remodeling and/or stents when necessary). It is a prospective, randomized, unblinded,
      multi-center post-market clinical investigation. The patient population comprises a maximum
      of 160 subjects with at least one documented untreated, unruptured intracranial aneurysm
      suitable for occlusion with an intracranial device. Subject enrollment will require a maximum
      of 18 months. Enrolled subjects will be followed for 12 months after treatment.
