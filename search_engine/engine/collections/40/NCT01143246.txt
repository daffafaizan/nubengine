      cirrhosis, decompensated liver disease, and portal hypertension. Hepatorenal syndrome type 1
      is characterized by a rapid progressive renal impairment and has a very poor prognosis with >
      80% mortality within 3 months. At present, there are no approved drug therapies for HRS type
      1 in the US, Australia, or Canada. The only curative treatment for HRS type 1 and the
      underlying end-stage cirrhosis is liver transplantation. However, many patients will not
      survive long enough to receive a liver transplant and therapy, which may provide a bridge to
      transplantation, is badly needed. Increased understanding of the pathophysiology of HRS type
      1 has demonstrated that vasoconstrictive drug therapy may reverse HRS type 1. Substantial
      data available from many published clinical investigations in the literature provide
      compelling evidence suggesting that administration of terlipressin improves renal function in
      patients with HRS.
