      control patients. The Pentax-AWS_ system (AWS; Pentax Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) is a new
      rigid indirect laryngoscope which has an integrated tube passage function. Several studies
      reported that Pentax-AWS improved the laryngeal view and guide also facilitated rapid, easy
      and reliable tracheal intubation in patients undergoing elective surgery. The purpose of this
      clinical trial was to evaluate the relative efficacy of the AWS laryngoscopes when used by
      experienced anesthetists in OSAS patients and to compare its performance with the Macintosh
      laryngoscope. The investigators hypothesized that, in comparison with the Macintosh, AWS
      would reduce intubation difficulty, as measured by the intubation difficulty scale (IDS)
      score.
