    
      This study addresses the following questions of clinical and policy relevance: 1) Is the
      pre-surgery HRQL of these patients compromised and, if so, in which areas? 2) Do patients'
      HRQL improve after surgery and, if so, when and in which areas and by how much? 3) Is there a
      relationship between BMI and pre-/post-surgery changes in HRQL (i.e., is the pre/post effect
      similar for both obese and non-obese patients)? and 4) Is there a relationship between tissue
      re-section weight and pre-/post-surgery changes in HRQL (i.e., is the pre/post HRQL effect
      similar for patients having small and large amounts of tissue resected)?
