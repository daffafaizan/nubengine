      platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and platelet-poor plasma (PPP) treatment or no treatment. We
      hypothesize that the antimicrobial properties of PRP and barrier properties of PPP (acting
      like a tissue sealant) will serve to inhibit deep incisional surgical site infection and help
      prevent delayed wound healing within 60 days of surgery. Thus, the incidence of infection and
      delayed wound healing will be lower in patients receiving PRP and PPP compared to patients
      who do not receive PRP and PPP. However, due to clinical equipoise, we do not know for
      certain that PRP and PPP is truly effective. The cost of preparing PRP and PPP is
      substantial, and involves a blood draw that would not otherwise be done. Thus, it is
      important to know if this treatment is effective or not.
