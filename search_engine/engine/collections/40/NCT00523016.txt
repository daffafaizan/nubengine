    
      40 individuals with SCI below-level neuropathic pain who are at least 6 weeks post-injury
      will be recruited at the three study sites. Subjects will be randomized into either the
      experimental or control group using a random number table as they enter the study to
      determine whether they will undergo the real acupuncture treatment or sham treatment.

      A total of 13 treatments will be administered over a maximum of 4 consecutive weeks with an
      ideal treatment frequency as follows: 5 times per week during weeks one and two; and 3 times
      per week during week three.

      Following all sessions, whether LCCNPAP group or sham, any adverse events such as nausea,
      fainting, bleeding etc., will be recorded on an adverse effects sheet for each subject.
      Baseline arterial blood pressure and heart rate will be monitored at four points during each
      treatment session for both groups.
