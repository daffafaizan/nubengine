      with advance care planning because it is a process which has multiple steps and people
      involved. This study will help health care teams in primary care learn to use the tools with
      frail or older seriously ill patients and will evaluate the perceptions of patients, family
      members and health care providers, as well as the impact of having the discussions on
      subsequent health care interactions the patient has.

      Patients complete tools about their values and wishes, and a health care provider uses a
      structured discussion tool to talk about the patient's health condition and future wishes.
      The patient's family member/substitute decision-maker is encouraged to attend and be part of
      the discussions.
