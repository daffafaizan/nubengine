    
      This is a Parallel Assignment design study. The PFDI-20 symptom questionnaire was completed
      upon enrollment. After the patient was prepped and draped, the operating room nurse opened a
      sealed opaque envelope marked with the study subject number containing a card marked with the
      assignment to bladder flap or no bladder flap, which was shown to the surgeons prior to the
      skin incision. The patient did not see the allocation nor was it verbalized in the operating
      room. The PFDI-20 was repeated 6-8 weeks after delivery at the patient's postpartum exam
      clinic visit. Equal number of bladder flap and no bladder flap assignment cards were randomly
      shuffled and placed in envelopes marked with the study subject ID number prior to the start
      of the study.

      The study hypothesis was that the omission of the bladder flap at the time of primary
      cesarean delivery would be associated with lower urinary symptoms scores in the postpartum as
      measured by the UDI-6 component of the PFDI-20.
