      neoplasm and has a poor prognosis. Surgical based treatment has been the treatment of choice
      for localized esophageal adenocarcinoma.

      Signet-ring cell carcinoma is a unique histologic subtype of adenocarcinoma characterized by
      abundant intracellular mucin accumulation and a compressed nucleus displaced toward one
      extremity of the cell (the so-called signet-ring cell (SRC)). According to the World Health
      Organisation (WHO), a true signet-ring cell carcinoma (SRCca) is defined as an adenocarcinoma
      in which the predominant component (more than 50% of the tumor) consists of isolated or small
      groups of SRC in the stroma. If the tumor contains less than 50% of those cells, it is
      generally considered as an adenocarcinoma (ADC).
