      HR+HER2- breast cancer patients after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (including anthracyclines and
      taxane, at least 6 cycles) assessed non-pCR are recruited, receiving multiple gene test
      before neoadjuvant treatment and after surgery. After enrollment, the patients were
      stratified according to multiple gene test based recurrence risk level (High risk or Low
      risk) and then randomized into two groups respectively in each cluster: receiving additional
      chemotherapy (Capecitabine) group or negative control group. The primary endpoint is 2-year
      disease free survival. The second endpoint is 5-year disease free survival (DFS), 2-year
      overall survival (OS), 5-year OS, safety of additional chemotherapy. The exploratory endpoint
      is the variety of multiple gene test based recurrence risk after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in
      non-pCR patients.
