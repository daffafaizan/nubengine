    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the safety and tolerability of folate receptor alpha dendritic cell (FRalphaDC)
      vaccination (folate receptor alpha-peptide loaded dendritic cell vaccine).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Measure time to disease recurrence of patients treated with FRalphaDCs. II. Measure
      overall survival of patients treated with FRalphaDCs.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine whether FRalphaDC vaccination induces an increase in the number of
      FRalpha-specific interleukin (IL)-17-secreting T helper (Th) cells, as determined by
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISpot).

      II. Determine whether FRalphaDC vaccination induces an increase in the number of
      FRalpha-specific T cells that secrete interferon (IFN)gamma, tumor necrosis factor
      (TNF)alpha, IL-10, and granzyme B, as determined by ELISpot.

      III. Determine whether FRalphaDC vaccination induces antibodies specific for FRalpha.

      IV. Determine whether FRalphaDC vaccination induces a delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH)
      skin reaction specific for FRalpha.

      V. Measure FRalpha expression in patients' primary tumors and in tumors that recur after
      FRalphaDC vaccine treatment (when available).

      VI. Determine whether FRalphaDC vaccination is associated with changes in peripheral blood
      immune cell subsets.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      INDUCTION PHASE: Patients receive folate receptor alpha peptide-loaded dendritic cell vaccine
      intradermally (ID) on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 5 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      MAINTENANCE PHASE: Patients receive folate receptor alpha peptide-loaded dendritic cell
      vaccine ID on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 months for 7 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3-6 months for up to 5
      years.
