      advanced soft tissue sarcomas. This study will assess the safety and efficacy of combining
      APX005M, a novel immunomodulatory drug, together with standard of care doxorubicin, for the
      treatment of patients with advanced soft tissue sarcoma. APX005M is an agonistic monoclonal
      antibody targeting the CD40 receptor and may have favorable effects on certain types of
      immune cells in sarcoma tumors, particularly macrophages.

      The primary objective is to determine the objective response rate. Secondary objectives
      include further evaluation of safety and efficacy. A subset of patients will undergo tumor
      biopsies at baseline and while on study treatment to help understand how the drug combination
      works and to evaluate how the composition of immune cells in the tumor changes after the
      treatment.
