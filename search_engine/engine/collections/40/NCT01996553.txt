    
      The purpose of this study is to establish the rate of radial artery occlusion post
      diagnostic/interventional cardiac catheterization through different modalities, and to
      compare current assessment methods (such as Allen's test, Modified Barbeau test and duplex
      ultrasonography) to specialized imaging techniques for sensitivity and specificity of radial
      artery occlusion detection post transradial catheterization.

      The study hypothesis is that specialized imaging can provide a specific focused analysis of
      hand characteristics to identify physiologic abnormalities as a result of radial artery
      occlusion post transradial catheterization.
