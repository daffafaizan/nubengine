      (Maxamine) vs no further therapy in prolonging the leukemia free survival in patients with
      acute myeloid leukemia in first or subsequent complete remission (CR) following consolidation
      therapy. II. Compare the relapse rate, overall survival, and quality of life in this patient
      population treated with interleukin-2 plus Maxamine vs no further therapy. III. Compare the
      remission inversion rate in patients in subsequent CR with this treatment regimen vs no
      further therapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open label, parallel, multicenter study. Patients are
      stratified according to complete remission (first vs subsequent). Patients are randomized to
      one of two treatment arms. Arm I: Following consolidation chemotherapy or autologous stem
      cell transplantation, patients receive interleukin-2 subcutaneously followed by histamine
      dihydrochloride subcutaneously over 5-7 minutes twice daily on days 1-21. Treatment repeats
      every 6 weeks for 3 courses and then every 9 weeks for 7 courses in the absence of disease
      relapse or unacceptable toxicity. Arm II: Patients receive no further therapy following
      consolidation chemotherapy or autologous stem cell transplantation. Quality of life is
      assessed prior to study, and at visits 6, 7, 10, 11, 16, 17, and 22. Patients are followed
      for relapse and survival every 3 months for 2.5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 360 patients will be accrued for this study.
