    
      This research study is designed to evaluate the effects of fentanyl when administered as an
      adjuvant to standard anesthetic and analgesic drugs on coughing (during insertion of an LMA
      device, during maintenance and emergence from general anesthesia) and on the postoperative
      adverse outcomes (i.e., side effects).

      All patients will receive local anesthetics and commonly used non-opioid pain relieving
      medications during surgery.
