      the incidence of preeclampsia. More recent data have shown that, when administered before 16
      weeks of pregnancy, aspirin can prevent over 50% of preeclampsia, severe preeclampsia, and
      IUGR but also a significant proportion of the rate of preterm births. Current data also
      demonstrate a beneficial effect of prophylactic use of aspirin when started early in
      pregnancy in populations composed of high-risk patients with a history of preeclampsia and /
      or other pregnancy complications related to poor placental function.

      Beside, many clinicians are already using aspirin in the context of a proven benefit.
      However, the usual dose prescribed in Canada today is 80 mg while the most favorable studies
      have used a slightly higher dose of aspirin (100 mg).

      Moreover, it has been demonstrated that the time of day during which aspirin was administered
      was also a very important factor regarding the effect on blood pressure and adverse outcomes
      of the majority of pregnancy. Yet the majority of studies in this context have not specified
      the time of day at which aspirin was or had been taken, possibly underestimating the effect
      thereof.
