    
      This is a prospective study of scleroderma- spectrum patients focused on soft tissue
      calcinosis in order 1) to better understand the risk factors (including clinical/laboratory
      characteristics, and serology) of calcinosis in the scleroderma-spectrum disorders (limited
      or diffuse systemic sclerosis with or without overlap of inflammatory arthritis and/or
      myositis).

      2) view common complications associated with calcinosis.

      Better understanding of scleroderma calcinosis would lead to other studies that eventually
      will define better treatment options for this incurable and often disabling complication.
