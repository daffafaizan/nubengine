      (i.e., plasma:platelets:RBCs) that approach the 1:1:1 ratio, found in fresh whole blood, are
      associated with significant decreases in truncal hemorrhagic death and in overall 24-hour and
      30-day mortality among injured patients. The rationale for the 1:1:1 ratio is that the closer
      a transfusion regimen approximates whole blood, the faster hemostasis will be achieved with
      minimum risk of coagulopathy. The current DoD guideline specifies the use of 1:1:1, and this
      practice is followed on almost all combat casualties. In other observational studies, leading
      centers have reported good outcomes across a range of different blood product ratios. For
      example, a 1:2 plasma:RBC ratio is used with little guidance regarding platelets. The
      proposed randomized trial is intended to resolve debate and uncertainty regarding optimum
      blood product ratios.

      Study Design: Randomized, two-group, controlled Phase III trial with a Vanguard stage. Equal
      random allocation to treatment using stratified, permuted blocks with randomly chosen block
      sizes and stratification by site.

      Objective: To conduct a Phase III multi-site, randomized trial in subjects predicted to have
      a massive transfusion, comparing the efficacy and safety of 1:1:1 transfusion ratios of
      plasma and platelets to red blood cells (the closest approximation to reconstituted whole
      blood) with the 1:1:2 ratio. The co-primary outcomes will be 24-hour and 30-day mortality.
      The PROPPR Trial will be conducted with exception from informed consent (EFIC). Additionally,
      laboratory data from the trial will add to the understanding of trauma induced coagulopathy
      (TIC) and inflammation.
