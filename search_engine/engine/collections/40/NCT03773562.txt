      days per month at baseline. Following a 4-week headache diary run-in phase, participants will
      receive two treatments with once monthly subcutaneous injections of erenumab 140 mg.
      Questionnaires, structured interviews, cognitive tests, quantitative sensory testing and
      brain imaging will be performed prior to and following erenumab treatment. These data will be
      collected at early time points after the first treatment as well as at eight weeks following
      the first treatment to allow for identification of early and late effects of erenumab on
      clinical, physiologic, and imaging outcomes and to determine if early physiologic and imaging
      outcomes predict clinical outcomes at eight weeks. Physiologic and imaging data will be
      compared to already collected data from healthy controls so as to interpret changes that are
      seen following treatment with erenumab.
