    
      The purpose of this study is to collect safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) data
      on a single dose of MinocinÂ® (minocycline) for Injection in subjects with renal insufficiency
      and in subjects receiving hemodialysis therapy. The safety, tolerability, and PK data will
      support the compound as a potential clinical candidate in Europe and will inform the
      development of future Phase 2/3 studies.
