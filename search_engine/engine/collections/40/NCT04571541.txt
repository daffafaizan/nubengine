      pathology which usually require timely intervention in order to reduce the known associated
      high morbidity and mortality. These defects can be due to surgical and endoscopic procedures,
      such as post-operative leaks and fistulas and perforations complicating endoscopic dilation.
      In addition, defects can occur spontaneously due to Boerhaave's syndrome or following
      chemoradiation treatments of esophageal or other chest malignancies. Surgical management was
      historically the mainstay of therapy for these defects with conservative management remaining
      an alternative in poor surgical candidates. Over the last several years however,
      interventional endoscopy has played an increasing role in treatment of esophageal wall
      defects, with endoscopic stenting quickly becoming a viable alternative. Temporary stents
      including the fully covered self-expandable metal stents (FC-SEMS), partially covered
      self-expandable metal stents (P-SEMS) and self-expandable plastic stents (SEPS) have all been
      successfully used and have become increasingly regarded as the new standard of care.

      Indiana University is a tertiary referral center is a destination for complex thoracic
      surgery, oncology and esophageal disease referrals. The innovative luminal endoscopy team
      started employing a several modalities including flexible endoscopic suturing and stenting to
      close esophageal defects. To our knowledge, there is a dearth of data on outcomes associated
      with multi-modality esophageal defect closure techniques and little to no data comparing this
      approach to the current standard of care of stenting alone or surgery.
