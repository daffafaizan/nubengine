      screening women from the The Hamilton Clinic for OST regularly for pregnancy to determine if
      this results in earlier prenatal care and improved pregnancy disposition. All eligible women
      at the Hamilton clinic will be approached for recruitment. The study phase last for 18
      months.

      The investigators will assess for any significant difference in the rates of early pregnancy
      diagnosis, pregnancy disposition, and associated outcome measurements. Study results could
      inform best practices in the care of child-bearing women on OST and will provide baseline
      information and feasibility data to inform design of a larger RCT to assess the effect on
      pregnancy and birth outcomes.

      This pilot study will serve to demonstrate whether routine pregnancy screening is effective
      for earlier pregnancy diagnosis and whether it has any impact on pregnancy disposition and
      entry into pregnancy-related care for women on OST. In addition, the investigators will also
      be seeking to address whether routine pregnancy testing is logistically and financially
      feasible for patients receiving OST at a primary care-run addiction setting. If this
      intervention is found to be both effective and feasible, it would be possible to apply this
      study methodology to larger-scale RCTs across multiple clinical sites with the power to
      assess maternal and fetal outcomes.
