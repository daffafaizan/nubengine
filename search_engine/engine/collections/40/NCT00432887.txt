      with postprandial glucose metabolism by increasing insulin resistance and/or by stimulating
      hepatic glucose production. This effect could have serious clinical implications for coffee
      drinkers who have type 2 diabetes. Early results suggest caffeine exaggerates the
      postprandial hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia present in these patients.

      The experimental (non-treatment) studies in this project include double-blind
      placebo-controlled cross-over laboratory tests of glucose tolerance in groups of type 2
      diabetic patients and prediabetic volunteers who are coffee drinkers.

      The lab studies test the hypothesis that caffeine (vs. placebo) increases postprandial
      insulin responses and results in a potentiation of glucose responses in the type 2 group.

      An ambulatory study examines the effects of caffeine administration on glucose levels during
      everyday activities in the natural environment. This study uses a double-blind
      placebo-controlled cross-over design. Ambulatory glucose data are collected with a MiniMed
      CGMS sensor and recorder worn for 72 hours. Caffeine and placebo are administered on separate
      days. Average glucose levels and glucose responses to meals are compared across treatment
      days within subjects.
