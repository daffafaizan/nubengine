      studies of ADA in rheumatoid and psoriatic arthritis have allowed patients on stable doses of
      MTX to continue on MTX while being treated with ADA. There has been no prospective trial of
      MTX and ADA concomitantly in psoriasis. Safety of ADA monotherapy vs. combination ADA/MTX
      will be compared.

      Compare anti-ADA antibody formation and serum ADA levels in patients on ADA compared with
      those on combination ADA and MTX. ADA is a fully human monoclonal antibody to TNF-a. More
      recent advances in detection of ADA antibodies have shown that many patients develop
      antibodies to ADA while on treatment and some of these antibodies are neutralizing. The
      presence of anti-ADA antibodies has been correlated with loss of therapeutic response in many
      disease states.
