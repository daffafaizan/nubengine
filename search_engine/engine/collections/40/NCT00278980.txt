      and sciatic endoneural Na/K-ATPase of the rat and stimulation of endothelial nitric oxide
      synthase. The hypothesis is that C-peptide administration may improve peripheral nerve
      dysfunction in diabetic neuropathy by increasing nerve blood flow and Na/K-ATPase activity.
      The purpose of the trial is to investigate the effect of C-peptide administration on diabetic
      peripheral sensory neuropathy in patients with type 1 diabetes and diabetic neuropathy in the
      lower extremities.
