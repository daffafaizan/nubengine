      Nutrigenomics, Department of Molecular Biology in Medicine, Health Sciences Center, at the
      University of Guadalajara, Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico, from February of 2018 to February of
      2019. All participants were recruited through flyers and social media invitations. Sample
      size was determined according to the mean difference formula for clinical trials. To achieve
      a statistical power of 80% and an alpha of 5%, a sample size of 13 participants in each study
      group was required. However, 37 obese individuals who met the selection criteria were
      randomized in exercise-diet group or diet-group. Blood sample, height and weight were
      measured after 8-12 hour fast and wearing light clothes. The participants in the
      exercise-diet group were cited in the Respiratory Unit of the University of Guadalajara with
      the indication of not consuming caffeine, tobacco or energy drinks 24 hours before the test,
      and not having eaten food at least two hours before the Astrand-rhyming Test. This study was
      approved by the Ethics and Biosafety Committee of the Health Sciences Center, University of
      Guadalajara (registry number CUCS/CINV/0476/18). The procedures were in accordance with this
      institution's guidelines and all the participants signed a written consent-informed.
