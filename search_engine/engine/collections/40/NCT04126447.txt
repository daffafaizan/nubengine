      architecture with the development of structurally anomalous nodules . Ascites is a condition
      in which pathological collection of fluid occurs within the peritoneal cavity mainly because
      of portal hypertension. It is a major complication of liver cirrhosis, The appearance of
      ascites in cirrhotic patients indicates a poor prognosis , Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis
      is a severe infection, commonly occurring in cirrhotic ascitic patients.

      Platelets are attributed to preserve hemostasis. Yet, recently, there has been growing
      recognition that they also play an essential role in inflammatory and immune response.
      Platelets release prothrombotic and proinflammatory agents and participate in the induction
      and advancement of vascular and inflammatory disorders . Larger-sized platelets contain many
      granules, and are therefore more efficient in their hemostatic and proinflammatory actions .
      This is why the mean platelet volume (MPV) and platelet distribution width (PDW) are worth
      considering as potential tests for platelet function and activation .

      The MPV and PWD can be calculated using almost all automated hematology analyzers. The MPV
      indicates the average platelet size in femtoliters. The PDW, reflecting homogeneity of
      platelet size, is calculated from the MPV by the equation (SD of platelet volume divided by
      MPVÃ—100) or the distribution width at 20% frequency .
