      of patients with heart failure have advanced heart failure. Heart transplantation is an
      effective life-saving treatment for patients with advanced heart failure. The cardiovascular
      rehabilitation programs are integral to heart failure management.

      This study is being done to evaluate, in adults with advanced heart failure awaiting heart
      transplantation, the effects of cardiovascular rehabilitation (including high-intensity
      interval training, stress management and nutrition workshops) on functional capacity, aerobic
      power, frailty, quality of life, and mental health.

      This study compares pre-transplant cardiovascular rehabilitation with usual pre-transplant
      care in patients with advanced heart failure awaiting heart transplant.

      All participants will be randomized into 2 study groups: Group 1 (rehab), and Group 2 (no
      rehab). Those randomized to Group 1 will receive usual care, 12 weeks of rehab (exercise
      training, and attend stress and nutrition course through the Heart Failure Clinic and the
      Division of Prevention and Rehabilitation at the University of Ottawa Heart Institute). Those
      randomized to Group 2 will receive regular visits through the Heart Failure Clinic; patients
      are encouraged to remain physically active, although they do not participate in a regular
      structured exercise training program.
