      dual-task balance performance than traditional single-task motor training, poor evidence of
      training-related transfer to a novel dual task has been shown. Additionally, another
      important impediment to the development of intervention to improve dual-task balance
      performance is that the previous studies have largely focused on training in a laboratory, or
      clinical setting, often with one-on-one supervision by a therapist or research assistant.
      Even though the home-based approach is more pragmatic, desirable, and encourages
      accessibility, no study has been done to examine the efficacy of home-based dual-task
      training.

      Therefore, this study aims to address these gaps in the literature by conducting a home-based
      program designed to improve dual-task performance with a broader transfer-of-training effects
      in older adults. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of four groups (i.e.
      single-task motor training, single-task cognitive training, dual-task motor-cognitive
      training, and dual-task cognitive-cognitive trainings).
