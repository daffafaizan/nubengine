      American Indian and Alaska Native adults with T2D. The first phase of this study (COMIRB
      Protocol 18-006) included a qualitative needs assessment to inform the development of this
      program. The second phase involves pilot testing the study at 6 collaborating AI/AN sites
      across the US. The Study Aims include: piloting the newly adapted program at 6 AI/AN
      collaborating sites to gain feedback on satisfaction, likability, usability and clinical
      outcomes such as HgA1C (measure of blood sugar control), blood pressure, and body mass index
      (BMI).
