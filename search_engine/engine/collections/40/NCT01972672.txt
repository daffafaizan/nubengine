      modulators ,the preclinical PK&PD and toxicity studies showed it can inhibit the growth of
      HCC cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo, combining clinical data perhaps it will be a very
      promising new drug to treat hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by targeting this nongenomic
      pathway. Shenogen decided to further investigate the efficacy and safety of Icaritin and to
      explore potential gene targets for treating HCC.

      The results of phase I study showed Icaritin has good safety and tolerance. The biological
      availability of Icaritin after meal is high and the half-life is relatively short.

      The phase Ib study enrolled 28 subjects. Among the 18 HCC subjects, 12 subjects received
      treatment in the oral administration group with 600 mg once, twice per day, after meal 30
      minutes, 6 subjects received treatment in the oral administration group with 800 mg once,
      twice per day, after meal 30 minutes. The results showed that in the 600mg group there are 12
      HCC patients whose therapeutic efficacy is evaluable now, one case of PR (10%), 5 cases of SD
      (50%) and 4 cases of PD (40%) were observed.Safety data showed that totally 24 AEs are
      probably related to investigational drug. Among them, 19 AEs are grade I, 5 AEs are grade II,
      no grade III or above AE.
