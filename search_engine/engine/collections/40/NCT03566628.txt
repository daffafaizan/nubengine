      amongst patients undergoing cerebral angiographies. The use of pre-warmed solutions during
      the procedure may reduce the incidence of shivering amongst these patients. In this
      triple-blind randomised trial, a consecutive sample of participants receiving total
      intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) and undergoing cerebral angiography will be allocated to
      receive a warmed (39ÂºC) solution of up to 500cc of isotonic saline or the same solution, but
      at room temperature. Patients requiring sedation, those expected to require mechanical
      ventilation after the procedure, those with diminished consciousness (Glasgow Coma Scale <15
      pts) and patients not wishing to participate will be excluded from the study. The primary
      endpoint for this study is the incidence of shivering up to 60 minutes after the procedure is
      completed. Shivering will be assessed using a validated scale by operators unaware of
      treament allocation. All analyses will be undertaken by a statistician that will not
      participate of the clinical assessment of included patients.
