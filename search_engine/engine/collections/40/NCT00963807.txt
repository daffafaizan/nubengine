    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if the absolute decrease measured in primary tumor 18
      F-F-3'-fluoro-3'-deoxy-L-thymidine (FLT) uptake (standard uptake value [SUV] and influx
      constant [Ki]) between pre-treatment imaging and imaging after the first cycle of therapy
      differs in patients categorized as responders or non-responders based on Response Evaluation
      Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) measured with computed tomography (CT) after the second
      cycle of therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if the absolute decrease measured in primary tumor FDG uptake (SUV) between
      pre-treatment imaging and imaging after the first cycle of therapy differs in patients
      categorized as responders or non-responders based on RECIST measured with CT after the second
      cycle of therapy.

      II. To assess the effects of the combination of docetaxel and cisplatin on fractional tumor
      viability and proliferative fraction pre and post treatment and to correlate these with the
      PET SUV data for both tracers.

      III. To assess the methylation status of the checkpoint with forkhead and ring finger domains
      gene (CHFR) gene from pre-treatment tumor biopsies and correlate methylation status post
      treatment with clinical and pathologic response.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive docetaxel intravenously (IV) and cisplatin IV on day 1 and dexamethasone
      orally (PO) twice daily (BID). Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 2 courses in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo FDG PET/CT, FLT PET/CT, and
      thoracic CT at baseline and the end of courses 1 and 2 and then undergo surgery.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4-6 weeks.
