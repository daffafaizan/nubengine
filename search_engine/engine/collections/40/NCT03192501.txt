      gene mutations. Studies of high-throughput sequencing for patients who suffered from cancer
      has found that different mutations play a different role in the occurrence and development of
      different cancers. Several gene panels already exist to help identify mutations in a few
      genes that may have corresponding FDA-approved drugs or drugs under clinical trials. However,
      given whole-genome/exome sequencing data, the suitable clinical analysis tool to analyze
      individualized cancer-related gene mutations, and recommend the most appropriate targeted
      treatment options among hundreds of possible drugs therapy is absent currently.

      The recently proposed iCAGES is a precise biomedical informatics analysis tool, which could
      help increase the accuracy of cancer driver gene detection and prioritization, bridge the gap
      between personal cancer genomic data and prior cancer research knowledge,and facilitate
      cancer molecular diagnosis as well as personalized precision therapy.
