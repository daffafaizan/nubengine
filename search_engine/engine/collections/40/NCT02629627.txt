      Metformin on visceral fat area in patients with METS. We will conduct a double-blind trial,
      randomized, on 4 groups, each group with 26 male and female patients of 35-65 years of age
      with METS diagnosed by IDF criteria. Randomization will determine who will receive the
      intervention during 8 week trial, each group will be like:

      Group (A) intervention with ACL/Leucine plus Metformin: 26 individuals will receive
      ACL/Leucine in a dosis of 2,475mg per 24 hrs (1,650mg or 2 capsules with the first meal and
      825 mg or 1 capsule with the second meal) plus Metformin in a dose of 500 mg per day (with
      the first bite of the second meal) during 8 weeks.

      Group (B) Metformin plus Placebo of ACL/Leucine: 26 individuals will receive Metformin in a
      dose of 500 mg per day (with the first bite of the second meal) plus homologue placebo of
      ACL/Leucine (linseed oil capsules) in a dosis of 3600 mg each 24 hrs (2 capsules of 2400 mg
      with the first meal and 1200 mg or 1 capsule with the second meal) during 8 weeks.

      Group (C) ACL/Leucine plus Metformin's Placebo: 26 individuals will receive ACL/Leucine in a
      dose of 2,475mg per 24 hrs (1,650mg or 2 capsules with the first meal and 825 mg or 1 capsule
      with the second meal) plus homologate placebo of metformin (calcined magnesia) in a dose of
      500 mg per day (with the first bite of the second meal) during 8 weeks.

      Group (D) Placebo of ACL/Leucine plus Placebo of Metformin: homologate placebo of ACL/Leucine
      (linseed oil capsules) in a dose of 3600 mg each 24 hrs (2 capsules of 2400 mg with the first
      meal and 1200 mg or 1 capsule with the second meal) plus homologated placebo of metformin
      (calcined magnesia capsules) in a dosis of 500 mg per day (with the first bite of the second
      meal) during 8 weeks.

      The clinical findings and laboratory test include a metabolic profile and biosafety, which
      will be baseline and at 8 weeks.

      Visceral fat area, epicardial fat, body weight, body fat, body mass index (BMI) and blood
      pressure will be determined during the inicial and final visit, likewise, hemodynamics
      parameters of arterial stiffness like aortic pulse wave velocity (PWVao), central pulse
      pressure (PPao), aortic augmentation index (IAxao) and central systolic blood pressure (cSBP)
      by an oscillometric monitoring system via BPLab Â®. Adverse events and adherence to treatment
      will be documented. Statistical analysis: Mann-Whitney U Test and Wilcoxon exact test. It is
      considered with significance at p<0.05.
