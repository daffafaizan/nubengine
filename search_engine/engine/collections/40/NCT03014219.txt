      written, informed consent will be obtained. Patients will undergo general exam with vital
      signs. Patients will be scheduled for a fat biopsy to collect the tissue needed to grow MSC.
      In the event there is no cell growth from the tissue obtained from the first biopsy, one
      further attempt will made from a second tissue sample from this patient. However, if the
      second attempt fails to grow cells, no further attempts will be made, and the subject will
      not continue in the study.

      The subjects will be subsequently followed for fistula response and closure for 24 months.
      Study visits are Day 1, Week 2, Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, Week 24, Week 52, and Week 104. This
      is an autologous product derived from the patient and used only for the same patient.
