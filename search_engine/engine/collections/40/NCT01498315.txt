      One of the major complications of pelvic surgery is symptomatic pelvic hematoma, which can
      present with pain, fever, and foul smelling discharge. The incidence of pelvic hematoma is
      40%, and varies according to the type of hysterectomy and the diagnostic procedure. Those
      hematoma increase the risk for infection. Diagnosis usually is not a clinical one unless
      symptoms occur, and then the diagnosis is made by CT or ultrasound. Number of interventions
      are mentioned in the literature to try and decrease post operative complications and
      infections, none have suggested effective enough. This is a prospective study which objective
      is to characterize the incidence of pelvic hematoma following hysterectomy using ultrasound.
      The investigators will also try to identify preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative
      risk factors for infection of this hematomas. This identification might decrease the
      incidence of postoperative hematoma and infection.
