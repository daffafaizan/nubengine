      motion within a casing to harvest solid biopsies from tissue through the biopsy channel of a
      conventional flexible endoscope. It was originally designed for sampling of tissue from
      submucosal lesions. The investigators´ first study of the instrument is now finished.
      Endodrill is safe to use and generates more submucosal tissue compared to biopsies with a
      conventional biopsy forceps.

      In this study, the investigators want to compare the Endodrill instrument´s ability to obtain
      representative tissue samples from a group of patients diagnosed with or suspected diffuse
      gastric cancer. 20 patients will be enrolled for this study. For each patient the
      investigators will collect 8 biopsies, 4 biopsies each with conventional biopsy and the
      Endodrill instrument respectively. The order will be randomized for each patient. For each
      specific biopsy the investigator will choose a particular site on the suspected tumor tissue
      without knowing which instrument that will be used for the biopsy. This procedure will be
      repeated for all 8 biopsies.
