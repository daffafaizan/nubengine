      The development of a Scale To assess Ataxia and Neurologic Dysfunction (STAND) would examine
      and measure as many facets of ataxia as possible. Scale items to be measured include
      parkinsonism, timed gait analysis, dystonia, neuropathy and peripheral nerve weakness, as
      well as other areas of clinical manifestation for ataxia. This brief but thorough scale
      should yield a thorough measurement of ataxia.
