      Primary

        -  Determine the dose-limiting toxicity and maximum tolerated dose of paclitaxel
           albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation (Abraxane) in combination with gemcitabine
           hydrochloride in patients with advanced metastatic solid tumors.

      Secondary

        -  Evaluate the efficacy of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle
      formulation (Abraxane).

      Patients receive paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation (Abraxane) IV over 30
      minutes on day 1 followed by gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8.
      Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of paclitaxel albumin-stabilized
      nanoparticle formulation (Abraxane) until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The
      MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience
      dose-limiting toxicity. Up to 10 additional patients may be treated at the MTD.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 30 days.
