    
      This is a phase 1/1b open-label, multicenter, dose-selection study of ciforadenant, an oral
      small molecule targeting the adenosine-A2A receptor on T-lymphocytes and other cells of the
      immune system. This trial will study the safety, tolerability, and anti-tumor activity of
      ciforadenant as a single agent and in combination with atezolizumab, an intravenous PD-L1
      inhibitor. Ciforadenant blocks adenosine from binding to the A2A receptor. Adenosine
      suppresses the anti-tumor activity of T cells and other immune cells.
