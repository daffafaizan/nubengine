      I. To describe the recovery of salivary gland function after administration of a 5-day course
      of everolimus, administered two weeks after completion of radiation or chemoradiation
      therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the decrease of saliva flow rates during radiation or chemoradiation therapy.

      II. To describe the changes in saliva protein composition during radiation or chemoradiation
      therapy and following administration of a 5-day course of everolimus.

      OUTLINE: This is an early phase 1 proof of principal study.

      Participants receive everolimus orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 5 days beginning 2 weeks
      after completion of radiation or chemoradiation treatment. Participants also undergo saliva
      output testing at baseline prior to radiation or chemoradiation treatment, after 3 weeks of
      RT/chemoRT, after 6 weeks of RT/chemoRT, prior to everolimus administration, at completion of
      the 5 day everolimus course, and at 1, 3, and 6 months after the completion of radiation or
      chemoradiation therapy.
