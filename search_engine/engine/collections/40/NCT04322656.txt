      setting to yield optimal postoperative refractive outcome. 31 Patients suffering from DED
      caused by MGD will be selected and allocated randomly to therapy. Patients with pre-existing
      DED therapy other than lubricants will be excluded. After completing prestudy-screening and
      baseline visit, LipiflowÂ® therapy is applied to the study eye. Follow-up visits will be
      scheduled two weeks and three months after baseline visit. Each visit includes dry eye
      investigations and IOL calculation by IOLmaster 700 and CSO MS-39. After each study visit an
      IOL will be theoretically selected.
