      cytokine and neuroendocrinal changes like increased levels of catecholamine and steroid
      hormones and other metabolic consequences .This stress response is considered a defense
      mechanism important for developing resistance to noxious insults.

      The cytokine cascade caused by surgical stimulation is complex with various effects on the
      injured host. Increased production of proinflammatory cytokines from the site of injury
      causes many systemic changes such as metabolic derangements and hemodynamic instability. Some
      released cytokines like tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-Î±) and Interleukin 6(IL-6) can cause
      long lasting hyperalgesia. These proinflammatory cytokines change pain signal transmission
      through cytokine induced release of some neuroactive substances like nitric oxide, oxygen
      free radicals and excitatory amino acids. On the other hand anti-inflammatory cytokines are
      also released during inflammation to counteract these effects and keep balance.

      Dexmedetomidine is a highly selective alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist that has sedative,
      analgesic, anesthetic-sparing properties with no respiratory depression. Its
      anti-inflammatory effects are being studied.

      Intravenous lidocaine can be used in management of chronic pain. Lidocaine has
      anti-inflammatory properties and is capable of reducing postoperative analgesic requirements
      and the length of hospitalization.

      The effect of both drugs on proinflammatory cytokines and stress response will be assessed
