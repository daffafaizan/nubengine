    
      The purpose of this study is to provide continued treatment with macitentan to subjects with
      PAH or CTEPH who participated in "parent studies" and to continue to accrue long-term safety
      data. The design of this study is widely used in clinical programs to give participants in a
      clinical study access to an effective study treatment beyond completion of the parent study.
      This is considered the best option to collect long-term safety and tolerability information
      of macitentan 10 mg and survival status of participants with PAH and CTEPH. "Parent
      study/studies" refer to a number of clinical studies with macitentan that are conducted in
      different clinical classification of PAH and CTEPH (NCT00667823, NCT02112487, NCT02310672,
      NCT02968901, NCT02558231, NCT02382016, NCT02060721) and may be completed before the
      participants have access to commercial macitentan in their country of residence. The "parent
      studies" are fully or partially running in countries where no access to commercial macitentan
      is expected in the near future.
