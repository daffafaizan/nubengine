        -  Determine the activity of irinotecan and cytarabine in patients with refractory or
           recurrent acute myeloid leukemia or chronic myelogenous leukemia in myeloid blast
           transformation.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of irinotecan in this regimen in these patients.

        -  Correlate the clinical activity of this drug with cellular endpoints associated with DNA
           synthesis inhibition, DNA repair, induction of apoptosis, and drug resistance in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of irinotecan.

      Patients receive irinotecan IV over 90 minutes and cytarabine IV over 60 minutes on days 1-6.
      Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of irinotecan until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. An additional 9 patients with
      refractory/relapsed acute myeloid leukemia and 9 patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia
      in myeloid blast transformation are treated at the MTD.

      Patients are followed for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-36 patients will be accrued for this study within 2.5 years.
