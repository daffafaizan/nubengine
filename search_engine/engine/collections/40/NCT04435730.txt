      about 2% of the population . Also psoriasis is a strong risk factor for the development of
      several comorbidities of which the most common is psoriatic arthritis (PsA).

      The presence of cutaneous psoriasis indicates a high risk for developing PsA. Studies
      conducted in dermatology clinics have shown a high prevalence of undiagnosed PsA in psoriasis
      patients , therefore identifying soluble biomarkers for PsA in psoriasis patients may help in
      early diagnosis, and thereby prevent disability and improve quality of life .

      Mac 2 binding protein [M2BP] is thought to be a marker of synovial cell activation and joint
      destruction .M2BP may be involved in the pathogenesis of PsA .

      Recently, with the introduction of new medications and wider use of musculoskeletal
      ultrasound (US) imaging in clinical practice, the possibility of earlier US diagnosis in
      patients with psoriasis in the pre-clinical phase of PsA has been examined.
