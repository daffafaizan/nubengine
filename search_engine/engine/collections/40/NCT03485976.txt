    
      Pityriasis rubra pilaris (PRP) is a rare and poorly understood severe inflammatory skin
      disease characterized by widespread (often full-body) redness and flaking of the skin,
      painful thickening and cracking of the palms and soles, hair loss, crumbling nails, and
      severe skin itching and burning.

      There is no FDA-approved therapy for this rare disease and the commonly used medications do
      not work for many patients. There is some evidence that IL-17 may be too high in the skin of
      PRP patients. Ixekizumab is an injectable medication that blocks IL-17 and is FDA-approved
      for psoriasis.
