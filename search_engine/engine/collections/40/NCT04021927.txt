      neonates while severe neonatal jaundice affects at least 481,000 neonates annually. Jaundice
      and jaundice related complications like Kernicterus Spectrum Disorder (KDS) are gaining
      recognition among the world's health policy leaders as an important area for further research
      and development. The long-term sequelae of KSD include choreoathetoid cerebral palsy,
      sensorineural hearing loss, and upward gaze palsy. KSD is irreversible resulting in a
      lifetime of physical, emotional, social and economic challenges. Access to cost-effective
      methods of improving pediatric jaundice care along with improved circumferential (full body)
      illumination technologies is an affirmed objective of the AAP (American Academy of
      Pediatrics). The investigators hypothesize that unused therapy light (irradiance) surrounding
      the neonate using an existing single-lamp bank phototherapy (PT) device is sufficient in
      quantity and if redirected onto the patients untreated or poorly illuminated skin surfaces,
      it will accelerate metabolism and excretion of bilirubin. This PT ring device redirects
      unused phototherapy light sideways onto the neonate body using an open-faced ring approach.
      The technology will illuminate previously unexposed and poorly exposed skin regions where
      treatable bilirubin exists. The device is superior to current PT devices in that it converts
      existing waste light into treatment efficacy while integrating into existing overhead lamp
      systems offsetting the purchase of secondary devices that are often unaffordable and create
      hospital complexity, cost and inefficiency issues. A further benefit of the device will be
      reduced ambient blue-light spillover in patient care areas, an ongoing concern for medical
      staff.
