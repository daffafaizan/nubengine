      12-week trial. The group A undergoes the IVGB training in the initial 6 weeks (intervention
      phase), follows by suspended from exercise in the subsequent 6 weeks (control phase). The
      group B does not received treatment in the first 6 weeks (control phase), and then performs
      IVGB training in the following 6 weeks (intervention phase). For all participants, The
      36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36), Modified Falls Efficacy Scale (MFES), Berg Balance
      Scale (BBS), Multidirectional reach test (MDRT) and Maximum step length (MSL) test were
      assessed at weeks 0, 6, and 12 of the experiment.
