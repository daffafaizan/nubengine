      population. It will define the achievable dose, image quality and safety of this protocol and
      provide an evidence base upon which modern CTPA protocols can be appropriately compared to
      scintigraphy for this population.

      Pregnant women undergoing the specified low-dose CTPA protocol for suspected pulmonary
      embolism (PE), agreed across study sites with equivalent computed-tomography (CT)
      capabilities, will be included. Independent review of CTPAs by two radiology consultants,
      image data analysis and 3-month patient follow up will be performed.

      The diagnostic algorithm employs chest-x-ray and lower limb Doppler if lower limb symptoms
      are present, followed by CTPA in cases where advanced imaging is required. D-dimer is
      permitted within the diagnostic algorithm for patients recruited after implementation of the
      updated 2019 "European Society of Cardiology guidelines for diagnosis and management of acute
      pulmonary embolism".
