      widely implanted following cataract extraction, phacoemulsification is adopted. To assess the
      binocular vision, the investigational lens will be bilaterally implanted. Considering the
      safety of the study subjects, the time of implant to the remaining eye (2nd eye) will be
      decided based on the results of the 1st implant.
