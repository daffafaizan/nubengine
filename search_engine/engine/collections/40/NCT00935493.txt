    
      Primary:

        -  To determine whether low does of the Î±2A-adrenoceptor agonist guanfacine can improve
           deficits in prefrontally-mediated working memory and executive control functions, in
           healthy elderly subjects. Subjects will be randomly assigned to receive placebo or
           guanfacine at one of two dose levels: 0.1 mg, or 0.5 mg daily at bedtime in double-blind
           fashion for twelve weeks.

      Secondary:

        -  To determine whether guanfacine can favorably influence global status and quality of
           life (QOL) in healthy elderly subjects.

        -  To determine whether low-dose guanfacine is safe and well-tolerated in healthy elderly
           subjects.
