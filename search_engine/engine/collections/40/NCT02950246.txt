      catheters More recently, it is the antiseptic solution that has been the subject of several
      studies, including the latest on laying intravascular central catheters, highlights the
      superiority of alcoholic chlorhexidine 2% compared to povidone iodine alcohol [ 5]. Indeed,
      it was observed a reduction in the risk of bacterial infection 6 (RR 0 • 15, 95% CI 0 • 05-0
      • 41) and of colonization by 5 (RR: 0.18 (95% Cl 0.13-0.24) through the use of alcoholic
      chlorhexidine with 2% applicator.

      Such a study comparing the efficacy of the antiseptic (chlorhexidine vs Povidone-iodine) on
      the establishment of perineural catheters does not exist what motivated the establishment of
      our study.
