      included 80 adults who met all the eligibility criteria and who were undergoing PDL therapy
      for the treatment of vascular lesions on the face.

      During the screening visit, the study, including potential risks and benefits, was clearly
      explained to each patient, and written informed consent was obtained from each patient. The
      screening visit also included: evaluating eligibility criteria, obtaining a medical history
      (including skin type, demographic data, and concomitant medications), a brief physical
      examination, and a urine pregnancy test (for women of childbearing potential). The screening
      visit could be completed on the same day as the procedure visit.

      At the procedure visit, eligible patients were assigned the next available sequential patient
      number. By having a patient number assigned to them, patients were randomized to receive
      S-Caine Peel or placebo on the facial treatment area.

      The surface area of the intended treatment area was determined (up to 200 cm2). A thin layer
      (approximately 1 mm or the thickness of a dime) of the study drug was applied evenly across
      the area to be treated. The study drug was applied for 20 minutes (Â±2 minutes).

      Immediately following removal of the study drug, the investigator performed an evaluation of
      skin reactions, assessing the treatment area for erythema, edema and blanching or any other
      adverse skin reaction.
