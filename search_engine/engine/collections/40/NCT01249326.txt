      requirements and protein metabolism, and protein supplementation interest, appropriate to the
      digestive tract changes, for the mass and muscle function. Three groups of patients will be
      studied: One group undergoing sleeve gastrectomy in Clermont-Ferrand (group 1: n = 20) will
      be followed by current recommendations. A second group undergoing sleeve gastrectomy in
      Clermont-Ferrand (group 2: n = 20) will receive during three months, protein supplement
      (powder whey protein ("fast")) at dose of 40g / day. 10 patients in group 1 and 10 patients
      in group 2 will participate in protein metabolism study. The third group undergoing gastric
      bypass in Lyon (group 3: n = 20) will be followed by the current recommendations and will
      participate in study of endotoxemia.
