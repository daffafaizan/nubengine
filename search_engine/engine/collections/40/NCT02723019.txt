      unmet behavioral health needs in the US Hispanic population. Differences in the quantity and
      quality of health care targeted to and received by members of the Hispanic population
      contribute to these disparities. Inequities in health care access and use are likely the
      result of an interaction of several multi-level factors, such as those related to low SES
      (e.g., lack of transportation or health coverage, time constraints, unsafe environments,
      knowledge barriers), cultural factors, language or communication-style differences, and
      others. Mi Puente (or "My Bridge") is a culturally-tailored, interdisciplinary approach
      designed to support at-risk Hispanic patients and their caregivers pre- and post-hospital
      discharge as they navigate the multi-level barriers that contribute to inequities in health
      care access and use, and in turn, perpetuate disparities in cardiometabolic and behavioral
      health. Mi Puente builds upon a sustainable nurse + volunteer peer team-based model and a
      strong collaborative, bridging partnership between inpatient and outpatient care settings to
      meet the integrated (i.e., physical and behavioral) health needs of Hispanics who are
      hospitalized with multiple chronic cardiometabolic conditions and one or more behavioral
      health concern(s). The program is guided by the Social Ecological Model,34 Resources and
      Support for Self-Management Model,35,36 and Transtheoretical Model of behavior change,37,38
      and will be tested at Scripps Mercy Hospital - a large, non-profit, safety net hospital
      located in the US/Mexico border region of South San Diego County, CA. The proposed randomized
      controlled trial will test Mi Puente versus Usual Care (evidence-based, best practice
      discharge procedures) in improving hospital utilization, patient-reported, and cost
      effectiveness outcomes. Electronic medical records (EMR) will be used to identify eligible
      patients and examine primary outcomes. Ultimately the investigators seek to evaluate an
      effective, culturally appropriate, sustainable, and scalable program that addresses
      integrated health needs and reduces health disparities in Hispanics and other at-risk
      populations.
