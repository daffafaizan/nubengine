    
      Primary Objectives:

        -  To demonstrate that the investigators can recruit DMT treated RRMS patients who have
           breakthrough enhancing lesions identified on clinically indicated monitoring brain MRI
           scans and measure lesion repair over 32 weeks.

        -  To obtain estimates of the magnitude and variability of lesion repair in DMT treated
           RRMS patients who are taking add-on domperidone, or no add-on treatment. The
           investigators will evaluate three MRI measures [texture analysis, diffusion tensor
           imaging (DTI), and magnetization transfer imaging (MTI)] for their ability to measure
           repair within acute enhancing lesions in RRMS. They will also evaluate repair at 16 and
           32 weeks. These outcomes will aid in the development of future trials.

      No therapies have yet been shown to improve lesion repair, and there is no accepted trial
      model to evaluate lesion repair in humans. Therefore, the investigators anticipate that the
      data from this trial will inform the design of future phase 2 trials of therapies to promote
      lesion repair in MS.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To determine the safety and tolerability of domperidone in RRMS

        -  To determine serum prolactin levels during dosing with domperidone 10mg tid in this
           population

        -  To explore metabolomic profiling during lesion repair.

        -  To explore the impact of the following variables on lesion repair: prolactin level at 6
           weeks, concurrent use of each type of DMT, Vitamin D and B12 levels at baseline, patient
           clinical characteristics (MS duration, EDSS), imaging characteristics (T2 lesion volume,
           enhancing lesion volume), patient demographics and behaviours (age, sex, smoking
           status).
