    
      Fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (FCR) is the gold treatment for fit and young
      (age â‰¤65 years) patients with CLL. However, IGVH unmutated patients and patients with
      disrupted TP53 show an inferior outcome after FCR in terms of PFS and OS. Venetoclax as a
      single agent or combined with rituximab is an effective treatment for relapsed/refractory
      patients with IGVH unmutated CLL and/or del(17p) and is associated with a high rate of
      clinical responses and MRD-negative responses. The achievement of a MRD negative response in
      CLL is the best treatment endpoint since it is associated with an improved PFS.

      In treatment-naive patients with unmutated IGVH and/or disrupted TP53 the venetoclax and
      rituximab combination could be a more effective regimen than FCR with a 15% increase in the
      CR rate.
