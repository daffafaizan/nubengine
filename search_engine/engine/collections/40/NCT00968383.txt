      of contemporary treatment of acute myocardial infarction (MI) prevents myocardial necrosis
      and its consequences. However, due to late presentation or failed fibrinolytic therapy up to
      one third of patients have persistently occluded IRA after MI.

      Recently, the Occluded Artery Trial (OAT) has demonstrated that percutaneous coronary
      intervention (PCI) with optimal medical therapy does not reduce the frequency of major
      adverse events compared to optimal medical therapy alone when performed on days 3-28 post MI
      in stable patients. Assessment of infarct zone viability was not used as an
      inclusion/exclusion criterion in the main OAT trial.

      Several studies confirm that patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction and
      preserved myocardial viability (necrosis transmurality<50% in most segments of the infarct
      zone) assessed with magnetic resonance imaging benefit from revascularization.

      Late opening of the occluded infarct-related artery only in patients with preserved
      myocardial tissue viability may lead to improvement of left ventricular volumes and function.
