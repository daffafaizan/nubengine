    
      Up to 60 myeloma bone marrow samples from Myeloma patients and 10 bone marrow samples from
      other haematological malignancy samples (Acute leukaemia's) at Diagnosis and Relapse will be
      tested.

      Patients attending haematology clinics at New Cross Hospital will be reviewed for eligibility
      of the study by the clinician and if they meet the recruitment criteria, they will be
      approached to participate at clinic.

      After informed consent, participants will be asked to donate an additional 2-3ml sample of
      bone marrow in a single aliquot for the purpose of this study whilst undergoing a bone marrow
      aspirate as part of their routine clinical care at diagnosis and relapse.The single aliquot
      will be sent to the University of Wolverhampton for analysis.

      Specific clincial data will be collected at the time of diagnosis and relapse:

        -  Diagnosis

        -  Date diagnosed

        -  Disease stage

        -  Relapse status

        -  Age

        -  Sex

        -  Previous treatments

        -  Date of marrow sample

        -  Marrow trephine

        -  Marrow liquid The clinical data set will remain at The Royal Wolverhampton NHS Trust
           whilst analysis of the samples takes place. Once the samples have been analysed, the
           clinical data will then be released to determine relapsed or refractory disease and
           correlation with the in vitro data.
