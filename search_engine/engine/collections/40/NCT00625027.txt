      non-urgent emergency department use. However, to my knowledge, no study has investigated the
      efficacy of Telehealth Ontario in particular. There are important differences between
      Telehealth Ontario and other phone lines that have been evaluated, in terms of the method in
      which calls are handled, the diversity of the population served, and the place of the
      phone-in line within the health care system. These studies, the results of which cannot be
      extrapolated directly to Telehealth Ontario, should not replace the direct study of the
      impact and utility of Telehealth Ontario.

      Currently Telehealth Ontario receives over 3000 calls daily from residents of Ontario who are
      concerned about their health. These callers rely on the advise of Telehealth nurses to direct
      the care they seek out for themselves and for their families. The provincial government also
      relies on Telehealth Ontario - to provide a useful service within the health care system,
      relieving the pressure on over-crowded emergency departments by directing patients with
      non-urgent medical complaints to more appropriate avenues of treatment. This will be the
      first study to examine the impact of Telehealth Ontario. Although only a small aspect of
      Telehealth's impact will be examined - the impact on non-urgent emergency department use at
      Sick Kids - it is an important first step. The results of this study may serve to guide
      modifications to Telehealth that will make it more accessible to specific groups within the
      community, more reliable in the advice it provides, and more effective in delivering its
      message to callers.
