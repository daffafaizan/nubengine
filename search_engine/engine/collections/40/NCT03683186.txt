    
      Study ROR-PH-303 is a multicenter, open-label extension (OLE) study for subjects with WHO
      Group 1 PAH who have participated in another Phase 2 or Phase 3 study of ralinepag and who
      qualify for entry based upon participation in the prior study. Subjects who discontinue
      participation in a prior study due to safety issues related to study medication or who fail
      to complete study procedures will not be eligible to enter Study ROR-PH-303. Subjects who
      meet all OLE entry criteria will be enrolled and will receive ralinepag in addition to their
      pre-existing PAH disease-specific background therapy.

      For subjects who are enrolled from an ongoing double-blind Phase 2 or Phase 3 ralinepag
      study, a 16-week blinded Dose Titration Period will be completed following enrollment into
      the OLE. Subjects previously on ralinepag will continue on the same dose during the Dose
      Titration Period as received in the original study and will also initiate placebo treatment
      in the OLE.

      Subjects who are enrolled from a non-blinded study or another OLE will not participate in the
      blinded Dose Titration Period in Study ROR-PH-303 but will be enrolled directly into the
      Treatment Period and continue on the dose of ralinepag received in the original study.

      All subjects will receive ralinepag in the OLE study until premature discontinuation of
      ralinepag due to an AE/serious adverse event (SAE) or other reason, marketing approval of
      ralinepag is granted in the region in which the study is conducted, or the study is
      discontinued by the Sponsor.
