      paralysis. This reduction induced vital capacity alteration and peek flow reduction.Several
      studies analysed dysfunction recovery duration after single injection using short
      (lidocaine)or intermediate (ropivacaine, bupivacaine)local anesthetic drug. Because
      continuous infusion prolonged block duration, phenic nerve may be also prolonged. However no
      study with continuous interscalene infusion have been performed for this dysfunction.
