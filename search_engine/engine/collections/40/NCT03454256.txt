    
      In this randomized controlled trial (RCT), the randomization of the sample will be performed
      by a local software and in a single blind design. Forty patients will be enrolled and after
      giving the informed consent, assigned to two groups :

        -  the experimental group (VRG), which will be undergone to treatment with virtual reality
           for the recovery of load distribution and proper gait pattern;

        -  the control group (CG), which will be undergone to a traditional rehabilitation
           addressed to recovery of correct gait pattern for the same time period as VRG.

      Both treatments consist in 15 sessions, at least 5 per week , each lasting 45 minutes. Both
      VRG or CG will last for 21 days from the start of treatment.

      All patients, in adjunction to Virtual Reality Rehabilitation (EG) or Traditional
      Rehabilitation (CG), will execute a global rehabilitation project, consisting in
      Physiotherapy, Physical Therapies for pain and inflammation control, and Occupational
      Therapy, personalized by a multidisciplinary rehabilitation team for a minimum of 150-180
      minutes per day, and according to their clinical conditions for them.

      The purposes of this study in detail are:

        1. Observing differences in the distribution of the bi-podalic load in the group that
           performs a re-education with virtual reality compared to those who perform the
           traditional treatment.

        2. Observing differences in the recovery time of a correct pattern of gait in the group
           that performs a re-education with virtual reality compared to those who perform a
           traditional treatment.

        3. Observing changes in neurophysiological patterns in the two groups.
