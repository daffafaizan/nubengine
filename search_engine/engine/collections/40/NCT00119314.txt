      Primary

        -  Determine the feasibility of positron emission tomography (PET) and pathology assessment
           in identifying the primary tumor site in patients with carcinoma of unknown primary.

        -  Determine the efficacy and safety of gemcitabine, docetaxel, and capecitabine in
           patients with carcinoma of unknown primary.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the frequency with which PET scan and pathology assessment can define the
           organ of origin in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a 2-part, multicenter study.

        -  Part 1: Patients undergo a comprehensive standard evaluation, including pathologic
           assessment and positron emission tomography scan, to attempt to identify the primary
           tumor site. If the primary tumor site is identified, the patient proceeds to appropriate
           treatment for that tumor off study. If the primary tumor site remains unknown, the
           patient proceeds to chemotherapy in part 2 of the study.

        -  Part 2: Patients receive gemcitabine IV and docetaxel IV over 30 minutes on days 4 and
           11. Patients also receive oral capecitabine twice daily on days 1-14. Courses repeat
           every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 4 weeks and then every 6
      months for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 44 patients (10-29 for part 2) will be accrued for this
      study.
