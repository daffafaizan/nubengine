    
      At the end of the study, patients with no clinically significant toxicities, no
      contraindications to continue treatment with talazoparib, and no disease progression
      (underlying cancer progression) may be eligible to continue talazoparib treatment in a
      separate open-label extension study. The decision to allow the patient to continue dosing
      with talazoparib in an open-label extension (OLE) study will be based on potential overall
      benefit-risk and patient meeting eligibility criteria for OLE.
