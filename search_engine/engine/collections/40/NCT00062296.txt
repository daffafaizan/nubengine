        -  Determine the response rate, time to progression, and overall survival of patients with
           refractory or relapsed B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia
           treated with epirubicin and rituximab.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a non-randomized, open-label, multicenter study.

      Patients receive epirubicin IV over 3-5 minutes once weekly for 6 weeks. Patients also
      receive rituximab IV on weeks 2 and 5 during course 1 and then on weeks 1 and 4 for all
      remaining courses. Treatment repeats every 8 weeks for a maximum of 3 courses in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months until disease progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-38 patients will be accrued for this study within 2.5-3
      years.
