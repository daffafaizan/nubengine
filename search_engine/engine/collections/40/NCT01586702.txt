      adherence to recommended evidence-based treatments is often poor. Programs for supported
      secondary prevention after cerebrovascular events with improved health education are
      promising but have not been evaluated regarding recurrent event reduction so far.

      A prospective randomized trial has been started to assess the effectiveness of a patient
      centered structured support program intending a reduction of recurrent vascular events. Usual
      care consists of structured information given at discharge as well as regular outpatient care
      by general practitioners. The support program additionally employs a stepwise intensified
      support program with up to eight appointments over two years in outpatient clinics. Results
      of risk factor measurements and assessed adherence to medical recommendations are shared with
      the patients. They are also offered assistance in finding appropriate physical activities or
      smoking cessation programs.

      Patients are randomized to regular care or regular care plus support program and will be
      followed-up until the total number of 317 primary endpoints has been reached. The composite
      primary endpoint consists of stroke, major coronary event and vascular death.
