    
      This study is a longitudinal, randomized control trial evaluating the use of two commercially
      available dynamic arm support devices (Armon Ayura-Kinova and JAECO WREX) to promote
      participation in activities of daily living in non-ambulatory individuals with Duchenne
      muscular dystrophy (DMD) with upper extremity weakness. Up to 30 individuals will be enrolled
      to participate in this research study, which includes a two-week baseline data collection
      period, a four-week device trial and a two-week post device data collection period.
      Participants will be randomly assigned to trial one of the dynamic arm support devices during
      the four week in-home trial. The ActiGraph, a wrist worn activity monitoring device, will be
      worn during the baseline period, the device trial and the post device data collection period
      to capture UE movement patterns. UE performance will be further quantified with use of a
      physical motor assessment, the Performance of Upper Limb (PUL) assessment and patient
      reported outcomes. Data gleaned will provide important knowledge and objective results
      regarding the potential benefit of dynamic arm supports in individuals with DMD with limited
      functional use of their upper extremities.
