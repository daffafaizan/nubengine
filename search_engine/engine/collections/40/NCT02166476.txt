      antimicrobial agents are frequently the antibiotics of "last defense" for the most resistant
      pathogens in serious infections, including those found in cUTIs. The recent dissemination of
      serine carbapenemases in Enterobacteriaceae in many hospitals worldwide now poses a
      considerable threat to the carbapenems and other members of the beta-lactam class of
      antimicrobial agents.

      Rempex is developing meropenem-vaborbactam administered as a fixed combination by intravenous
      infusion to treat serious Gram-negative infections such as cUTIs, including those infections
      caused by bacteria resistant to currently available carbapenems.
