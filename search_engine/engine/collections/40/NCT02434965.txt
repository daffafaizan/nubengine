    
      The primary aim of this study is to determine the safety, tolerability and feasibility of
      intravenous administration of autologous cord blood (CB) and autologous human placental
      derived stem cells (HPDSC) in neonates with severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). It
      is hypothesized that the administration of autologous CB and autologous HPDSC will be safe
      and well tolerated in neonates with severe HIE.

      Additionally, postnatal neuro-developmental outcomes in neonates with HIE after autologous CB
      and HPDSC therapy will be measured; HIE injury to the neonate/infant brain post autologous CB
      and HPDSC therapy by imaging will be characterized; the pluripotent stem cell properties of
      CB and HPDSC will be characterized; serum levels of selected circulating cytokine and
      neurotrophic factors in neonates with HIE before and after autologous CB and HPDSC therapy
      will be compared and immune cell phenotype and function in neonates with HIE before and after
      autologous CB and HPDSC therapy will be compared.
