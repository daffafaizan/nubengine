      screening scale was completed by the subjects' parents in preoperative interview. All
      children were induced by sevoflurane inhalation. After eyelash reflex disappeared and
      pharyngeal airway insertion, giving 1 mcg/kg fentanyl when the End-tidal concentrations of
      sevoflurane were maintained at 3.0 and the spontaneous respiratory frequency was stable,
      observing the changes of respiratory rate. Severe OSAS was diagnosed as respiratory rate
      decreased by more than 50%. Anesthesia was maintained with desflurane and 60% nitrous oxide
      in oxygen. The children were transferred to the PACU after extubation. The postoperative pain
