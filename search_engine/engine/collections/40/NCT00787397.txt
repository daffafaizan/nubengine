      behavioral and social predictors of improvement as a critical next step in advancing the
      understanding of processes involved in the treatment response of anxiety disorders in youth.
      This protocol will offer a six to eight session sleep intervention (Sleeping Tigers)children
      ages 9-13 who currently have a DSM-IV anxiety disorder and who endorse some level of
      impairment in their ability to sleep. Participants will have completed a 16 session
      intervention for anxiety (IRB submission, Child Anxiety Treatment Study CATS). We hope to
      assess whether improving sleep will further enhance affective, clinical, and social
      functioning.
