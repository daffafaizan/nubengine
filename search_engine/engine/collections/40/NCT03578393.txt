      an important health problem as long with pain. In the surgical fields there are two
      especially stressful moments for the child, the first one is the parentÂ´s separation, and the
      second is the anaesthetic induction, which in up to 42% of cases can be traumatic.

      Methods to treat paediatric anxiety have evolved in the last decades. Pharmacological therapy
      is one of the most used methods to treat anxiety in the immediate preoperative period, but
      complications and unwanted side effects are described. Due to this side effects, this study
      will evaluate the the effectiveness of the Virtual Reality Educational Program (RVEP) to
      reduce the perioperative anxiety in children.
