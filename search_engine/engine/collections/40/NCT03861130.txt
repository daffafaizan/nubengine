      Kawasaki disease is now the most common cause of acquired heart disease in children in Japan
      and North America. Kawasaki disease arises when genetically predisposed children encounter an
      as yet unidentified infectious agent which may cause only mild illness or no illness at all
      in children without the genetic predisposition. Other children may suffer permanent damage to
      the coronary arteries. Identification of the genes involved will help to improve
      understanding of the disease, and the development of better treatments.

      Objective

      The investigators aim to identify the genes underlying both susceptibility to Kawasaki
      disease, and the development of coronary artery aneurysms.

      Design

      The study will recruit nuclear families (affected child and their biological parents) through
      participating NHS hospitals or through the records of the UK Kawasaki Support Group.

      Study size

      400 affected children and both biological parents (i.e. 1200 participants)

      Procedures

      Informed consent using age appropriate patient/parent/guardian information sheets will be
      taken from parents (or from children aged 16 and over), assent will be taken from the child
      under the age of 16 (if appropriate). Children recruited during the acute illness; routine
      clinical and laboratory data and research samples (blood, urine, throat swab). Children
      recruited retrospectively; study questionnaire (completed by parents), saliva samples.Saliva
