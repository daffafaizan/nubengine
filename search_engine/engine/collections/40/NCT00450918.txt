      cough and infections in the airways, sinuses, and middle ears. Long lasting airway infection
      ultimately leads to structural damage to the airways, known as bronchiectasis, and, in turn,
      loss of lung function. While PCD shares some similarities with the disease cystic fibrosis,
      it is important to distinguish PCD from cystic fibrosis. In particular, the age of onset and
      progression of PCD's clinical lung disease, including timing of specific microbial pathogen
      infections and bronchiectasis, remain poorly defined. The purpose of this study is to
      determine how lung disease progresses over time in children and adolescents with PCD.
      Specific attention will be directed toward determining whether certain factors play a role in
      lung disease progression. The study will also evaluate diagnostic tools and quality of life
      among individuals with PCD. Filling these gaps of knowledge may help to improve the clinical
      management of PCD in the future.

      This longitudinal study will last 5 years. There will be a total of 5 study visits, and these
      visits will occur yearly. Each study visit will last 3 to 4 hours. All study visits will
      include a medical history review; physical exam; height, weight, and vital sign measurements;
      sampling of respiratory fluids and mucus; lung function tests; and questionnaires. The
      initial visit may also include using a probe to measure nasal nitric oxide levels and blood
      collection for genetic testing. Study visits 1, 3, and 5 will also include blood collection
      for pregnancy testing and a high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan of the chest to
      image the lungs. At the end of each month, participants will report any use of oral, inhaled,
      or intravenous antibiotics.
