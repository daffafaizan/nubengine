    
      CorMatrix Cardiovascular, Inc. has developed a device for heart valve replacement, the
      CorMatrix® Cor ECM® Tricuspid Valve, which can be implanted to replace dysfunctional
      tricuspid heart valves. This Early Feasibility Study is proposed to obtain initial insights
      into the ability to successfully implant the Tricuspid Valve, the clinical safety of the
      device, and whether the device performs its intended use. The study is a multi-center,
      prospective, single-arm, Early Feasibility Study (EFS) of subjects receiving the Cor
      TRICUSPID ECM Valve or Cor PEDIATRIC Tricuspid ECM Valve. The study will be conducted at up
      to 8 sites.

      Up to 15 subjects will undergo tricuspid valve replacement (TVR) with the CorMatrix ECM Valve
      for the surgical management of tricuspid valve disease. The cohort will include up to 10
      adult patients and up to 5 pediatric patients.
