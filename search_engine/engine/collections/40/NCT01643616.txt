      stimulation technique)assumed that the target is a close approximation to the nerve, without
      epineural perforation. Intraneural injections were considered as evitable, with high risk for
      nerve damages.

      Ultrasound guidance provided for the first time a real-time visualization of the spread of
      local anesthetic. Some recent studies proved, that an intraneural injection using nerve
      stimulator technique is common and not necessarily accompanied with nerve damages.

      In the ultrasound group (group US) the investigators tested the hypothesis, that an
      intraneural injection of local anesthetic generate a high success rate and a short onset time
      without clinical apparent nerve damages.

      In the nerve-stimulation group (group NS) the investigators tested the hypothesis, that an
      intraneural injection of local anesthetic is common, and in case of intraneural injection
      accompanied likewise with high success rate and shorter onset time.

      For the sciatic division the investigators tested the hypothesis, that classical methods of
      nerve localization (nerve-stimulation technique, cause of paresthesias) are not able to avoid
      epineural perforation.
