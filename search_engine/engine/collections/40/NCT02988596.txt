      who suffer a concussion during the course of study will be directed through the post-injury
      protocol. Following injury, participants will complete post-injury assessments and follow the
      specific intervention of their randomized group. Post-injury assessments will focus on the
      following: postural stability, neuro-cognitive function, symptom presence and severity,
      fatigue, vision, dual-task ability, and mental status. Participants will complete outcome
      assessments at the following time points: time of injury, 24-48 hours post-injury,
      asymptomatic, and one month post return to play. Symptoms and physical and cognitive activity
      will be assessed daily from the first assessment point to 7 days post return to play. Session
      logs will be kept by the supervising clinician at each study site regardless of study arm.
      Baseline and outcome assessments will be entered into a secure online platform, each study
      site will have the option for paper records of outcomes and session logs to be double entered
      into the electronic system at a later date.
