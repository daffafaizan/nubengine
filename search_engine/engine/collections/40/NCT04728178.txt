      total of ASA I-III, 60 patients over the age of 18 who will undergo head and neck
      surgery.After randomization, patients underwent arterial cannulation. The arterial cannulas
      of the study group patients were integrated into the hemodynamic monitoring system with a
      special transducer, and their fluid management was planned to achieve a target value of 13%
      or less through SVV monitoring. In the control group, fluid management was set as MAP (Mean
      arterial pressure) 65 mmHg and above and diuresis 0.5ml/kg/hour and above. Crystalloid
      infusion at 7ml/kg/hour was started in both groups. When SVV value increased to 13% and over
      in the study group, 250 ml of crystalloid was given in the first stage, and if it continued
      to be 13% and over, 250 ml of colloid bolus was given. Vasoconstrictor agent was used when
      SVV was below 13% and MAP was below 65 mmHg. The patients in the control group were given 250
      ml of crystalloid in the first stage if the MAP was below 65 mmHg, and 250 ml of colloid
      bolus if the hypotensive episode continued. If hypotension persisted despite these fluid
      boluses, a vasoconstrictor agent was used. In addition, when the diuresis of the patients was
      detected at 0.5mg/kg/hr or less, 250 ml of colloid bolus was administered.
