      other conscious sedation procedures. Alf and Pro have the characteristic of rapid anesthetic
      onset and quick recovery, synergic sedative effect and unwanted side effects too. However,
      the amount of Alf needed in combination with Pro for induction and the timing of
      administration was no standardized. The investigators designed this study to evaluate the
      optimal regimen, dose and timing of Alf in Target-Controlled infusion (TCI) of Pro for
      flexible bronchoscopy sedation.

      Method: patients will be enrolled and assigned randomly into five groups. In group 1, normal
      saline two minutes before and Alf 2.5μg/kg before Pro were given; In group 2, normal saline
      two minutes before and Alf 5μg/kg before Pro were given; In group 3, Alf 2.5μg/kg two minutes
      before and normal saline before Pro were given; In group 4: Alf 5μg/kg two minutes before and
      normal saline before Pro were given; in group 5, normal saline two minutes and before Pro
      were given.

      Concentration of effect site to loss of consciousness (LOC), dose of Pro to LOC, and
      induction time of variable regimen, as well as hypoxemia, hypotension, cough severity, and
      Pro injection related pain will be recorded and analyzed.
