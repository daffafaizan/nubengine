      to investigate safety and tolerability of single and repeat intravenously infused doses. The
      study will enrol healthy male subjects and healthy female subjects of non-child bearing
      potential and will also investigate immunogenicity, GSK1995057 distribution
      (pharmacokinetics), and potential impact on indicators of host immunity and normal
      immunological function. Safety, tolerability, immunogenicity, pharmacokinetic and
      pharmacodynamic data from this trial may facilitate further clinical investigations in
      healthy subjects dosed with GSK1995057 via the inhaled route, and ultimately clinical trials
      in patients with acute lung injury.
