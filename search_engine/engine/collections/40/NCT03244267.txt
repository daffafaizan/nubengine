    
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of using a smartphone application (app)
      reminder on medication adherence twice daily in 200 adults prescribed 81 milligrams of
      aspirin (ASA) for 35 days as anti-thrombotic therapy after knee or hip arthroplasty. The aim
      is to determine if an app downloaded on a smartphone that reminds patients twice a day to
      take their ASA as prescribed will improve ASA adherence and clinical outcomes for patients
      after total knee and total hip joint arthroplasty compared to those in the usual care.

      This is a two group, randomized control study with random assignment into the control group
      for usual care or the intervention group to receive a medication reminder app for their smart
      phone (daily for 35 days) plus usual care. Participants will receive a baseline interview for
      demographic and other data and 36 day follow-up assessment, both conducted in person.
