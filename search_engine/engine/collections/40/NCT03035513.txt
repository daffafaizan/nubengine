      encephalopathy. Even if the correlation between the severity of the epilepsy and the
      cognitive consequences is well established, the mechanisms involved in epileptic cognitive
      degradation are complex and poorly understood. In CSWS, there are many arguments for the
      implication of cortical and subcortical cerebral structures. Among them the thalamus seems to
      play a crucial role. In fact it is strongly implicated in the sleep and this function is
      determining for learning. Moreover, it is part of the propagation pathway of generalized
      forms of epilepsy like absences in animal studies. Unfortunately there is no animal model for
      CSWS to confirm this theory. In human studies, few cases are caused by thalamic injuries but
      most of the time conventional MRI is normal. Despite few literature on CSWS, some studies
      reported abnormal functional connectivity especially in the thalamus.

      The investigators hypothesize that the first utilisation of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)
      and tractography will be useful in CSWS to confirm the implication of a
      cortico-thalamo-cortical network showing an abnormal structural connectivity. The
      investigators will try to determinate if a particular thalamic nucleus is concerned and
      demonstrate a link between the disease severity (duration and cognitive consequences) and the
      importance of structural abnormalities.

      Using resting state functional MRI (fMRI), the investigators will also try to investigate the
      default mode network. Its implication was also suggested in the literature.
