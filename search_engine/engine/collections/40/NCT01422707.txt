      androgen (male hormone) overproduction in overweight girls with androgen excess. The
      investigators hypothesize that one month of oral hydrocortisone administration will improve
      androgen levels in girls with adrenal androgen overproduction. Specifically, this
      intervention will improve androgen levels after adrenal stimulation testing with
      adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH).
