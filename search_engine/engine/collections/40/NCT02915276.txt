      developmental stages in order to prepare for implantation inside the womb. During the fifth
      and sixth day post fertilisation, the embryo becomes a blastocyst. It consists of 100-150
      cells and has two cell types. The inner cell mass (ICM) will give rise to the baby and the
      trophectoderm cells will become the placenta. The trophectoderm (TE) cells surround the ICM.
      Following the formation of the two cell types, the TE cells start producing fluid. The
      progressive accumulation of fluid leads to the formation of a cavity that expands to form the
      blastocele cavity. This cavity contains fluid is known as blastocoelic fluid (BF). The fluid
      can contain proteins, cells and genetic material. Traditionally to make a genetic diagnosis
      or when to screen embryos for abnormal chromosome number, cells are removed (biopsy) from the
      trophectoderm. In experienced hands, this is a very safe procedure and causes minimal damage
      to the embryo. However, recent studies have shown that blastocoele fluid may contain genetic
      material which can be aspirated (drawn out) from the blastocole cavity (blastocentesis) and
      used for genetic analysis of an embryo. This is potentially less invasive and harmful to the
      embryo. The aim of this study is to compare genetic analysis obtained following
      blastocentesis versus trophectoderm cell biopsy.
