      the pain score in intramuscular ketamine group will be similar to similar to those in
      previously published data; forty children would be required per group to detect a difference
      of 30% in CHEOPS pain scores with a power of 90% (α =0.05, β =0.1)

      - Statistical analysis: Data will be analyzed through SPSS (Statistical Package for Social
      Sciences), program version 22. Distribution of data will be first tested by the Shapiro test.
      Data will be presented as the mean and standard deviation (SD), median and range or numbers
      and percentages. For normally distributed data, the unpaired t-test will be used to compare
      the mean values of both groups. For pain and emergence behaviour scores, Mann Whitney U test
      will be used. Fisher's exact test will be used for comparison of categorical data. The P
      value ≤ 0.05 will be considered as the level of statistical significance.
