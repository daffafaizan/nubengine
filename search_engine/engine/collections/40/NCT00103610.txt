      destroyed by chemotherapy. Currently filgrastim (G-CSF), a colony stimulating factor, is used
      to cause the growth and mobilization of stem cells from bone marrow to peripheral blood,
      which can then be collected from the peripheral blood by a process called apheresis.
      Plerixafor aids in the release of the stem cells from the bone marrow into the peripheral
      blood, possibly allowing for a more rapid collection of a larger number of stem cells from
      the peripheral blood. Larger stem cell doses for transplantation correlate to faster recovery
      times after high dose chemotherapy followed with stem cell transplantation. This study is
      intended to determine whether the combination of plerixafor with filgrastim is better than
      filgrastim alone in helping non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patients collect at least 5 million stem
      cells in four or less apheresis sessions.
