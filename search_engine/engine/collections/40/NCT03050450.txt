      of cancer death in children. For children with relapsed, refractory, or recurrent brain
      tumors, new agents in new combinations are needed. This study is a phase I study designed to
      provide an objective observation of toxicity and establish a maximum tolerated dose of this
      combination. In addition, this study will observe the response of children with relapsed or
      refractory central nervous system tumors. Lenalidomide will be dosed orally once daily days
      1-21 consecutive days of a 28 day cycle. Vorinostat will be dosed orally once daily days 1-7
      and 15-21 of a 28-day cycle.Doses will be escalated according to standard phase 1 dose
      escalation criteria. In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse event(s), treatment
      may continue for 24 cycles.
