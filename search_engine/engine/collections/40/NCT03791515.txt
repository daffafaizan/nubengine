      incorporating a plethora of scientific approaches. First, clinical biomarkers will be
      assessed by deep phenotyping of clinical characteristics and associated comorbidities using a
      semi-structured interview and multiple validated questionnaires. Second, biochemical
      biomarkers will be determined by plasma levels measurements of blood markers for headache
      hypersensitivity and neuronal/axonal damage. Third, imaging biomarkers will be established by
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to assess structural and functional changes in the brain.
      Lastly, molecular biomarkers will be identified by examining whether intravenous infusion of
      calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) provokes headache attacks mimicking the usual headache
      phenotype in subjects with PTH. This would determine whether PTH patients exhibit
      hypersensitivity to CGRP (molecular biomarker) and advance our understanding of the complex
      pathophysiological events that constitute the headache phenotypes in PTH sufferers.
