      cancer in surgical high-risk patients and as part of multimodal treatment in patients with
      large lesions or metastatic malignant disease in the lungs. Endobronchial ablative strategies
      allow deliver y of these therapies through a natural orifice and minimally invasive approach,
      potentially improving safety and reducing related morbidity. Application and deployment of
      this system allows the operator to have constant control of the airway, preventing
      life-threatening hemoptysis and other complications. We hypothesize that this novel
      detachable OTS system can be successfully deployed in the peripheral parenchymal target with
      potential clinical applications in the near future.
