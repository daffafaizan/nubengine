      omega-3 fatty acids in fish oil supplements can significantly reduce depression with a low
      risk of side effects. Therefore, fish oil supplements may be a safe adjunctive therapy to
      improve the therapeutic benefits of antidepressants. This study will determine the
      effectiveness of fish oil supplements in reducing depression in MS patients who are taking
      antidepressant medication.

      This study will last 3 months. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either fish
      oil supplements or placebo daily for 3 months. At the end of 3 months, participants who show
      an improvement in their depressive symptoms will have the option to continue their treatment
      for an additional 3 months. Participants will do no respond to treatment will be excused from
      the study. All participants will remain on their antidepressants and MS medication throughout
      the study. Participants will have weekly study visits. At each visit, participants will be
      asked about their general health, and self-report scales will be used to assess depressive
      symptoms. Medication adherence will be monitored by pill counts and through red blood cell
      fatty acid analysis. Blood collection will occur at study start and at study completion.
