    
      Patients will be randomized 1:1, and will be stratified according to histology (squamous cell
      carcinoma vs adenocarcinoma).

      86 patients with platin refractory Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) will be treated either
      with metronomic low-dose treosulfan, pioglitazone and clarithromycin (experimental arm) or
      with nivolumab (squamous cell lung cancer and nonsquamous cell lung cancer).

      Patients will undergo tumor assessments at baseline and every 6 weeks (approximately every
      two cycles) thereafter, until progression. Patients without progression after 36 weeks will
      undergo tumor assessments every 12 weeks.
