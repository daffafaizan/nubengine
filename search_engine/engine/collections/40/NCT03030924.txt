      Emergency Department with acute suicidality or are admitted to an inpatient psychiatric
      adolescent unit. The plan is to monitor basic physiologic parameters to assess for trends
      associated with suicidality noninvasively in an objective manner beyond subjective
      questionnaires currently available. Upon discharge they will be sent home with a noninvasive
      monitor to track physiologic parameters.
