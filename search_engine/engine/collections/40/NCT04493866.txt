      legible completion of consent forms as a key part of the process of gaining informed consent.
      In addition to this, consent forms serve as an important medico-legal document to protect
      clinicians and patients should problems arise. It is therefore in all parties' interests that
      they are correctly completed.

      It was noted that consent forms within the Royal London Hospital Plastic Surgery department
      were often not correctly completed. A Quality Improvement Project was undertaken to improve
      the completion of consent forms within the department.

      Materials and Methods Common problem areas on consent forms were identified and QI
      methodology was used to design the study including selection of appropriate outcome, process
      and balancing measures. Baseline information on completion of: 1) patient details, 2)
      consultant details, 3) legibility, 4) use of abbreviations in description of
      operation/complications, and 5) patient signatures was collected. Four weekly interventions
      were made which were accompanied by four further data collection cycles. A further re-audit
      took place 4 months following the completion of the project to establish whether improvements
      had been sustained.
