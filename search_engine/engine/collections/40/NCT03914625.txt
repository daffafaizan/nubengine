    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine in a randomized manner if the addition of 2 cycles of blinatumomab to
      standard therapy improves disease-free survival (DFS) in patients with standard risk (SR)
      B-ALL and higher risk features (SR-High), and patients with standard-risk average (SR-Avg)
      B-ALL who are negative for minimal residual disease (MRD) by flow cytometry but have
      detectable or indeterminate MRD as measured by high-throughput sequencing (HTS) at end of
      induction (EOI).

      II. To confirm that boys in the standard-risk favorable (SR-Fav) subset of B-ALL, with or
      without Down syndrome (DS), will maintain a 5-year DFS of greater than 93% when treated with
      a standard chemotherapy regimen with a treatment duration of 2 years from the start of
      interim maintenance I (IM1).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the DFS for patients with SR-Avg B-ALL who are negative for MRD measured by
      flow cytometry and HTS at EOI when treated with standard chemotherapy with a treatment
      duration of 2 years from the start of IM1, regardless of sex.

      II. To describe the DFS for patients with standard-risk favorable (SR-Fav) B-ALL when treated
      with a standard chemotherapy regimen.

      III. To determine if patients with DS-High achieve a reduction of treatment-related mortality
      (TRM) after replacement of intensive elements of standard chemotherapy (omission of
      anthracyclines in induction, omission of the second month of delayed intensification [DI])
      with 3 cycles of blinatumomab.

      IV. To describe the DFS characterized by the replacement of intensive elements of standard
      chemotherapy with 3 cycles of blinatumomab in patients with DS-High B ALL.

      V. To describe the DFS for patients with localized (Murphy stage I and II) B lymphoblastic
      lymphoma (B-LLy) receiving standard risk B-ALL therapy.

      VI. To compare the change in neurocognitive functioning, as measured by the CogState
      Cognitive Composite, from baseline to end-of-therapy among patients with ALL ages 4- < 10
      years at the time of diagnosis between children from poor families (defined as presence of
      household material hardship [HMH], including either food, housing or energy insecurity) and
      non-poor families (absence of HMH).

      VII. To describe the impact of blinatumomab on caregiver burden and patient/proxy-reported
      symptoms among a subset of children enrolled in the HMH and neurocognitive outcome study.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore adaptive and innate immune functions and host genetic factors associated with
      severe infectious complications in children with DS B-ALL.

      II. To explore the impact of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and its therapy on
      neurocognitive, functional, and quality of life outcomes in patients with DS and ALL, as
      measured by caregiver (parent/legal guardian) questionnaires.

      III. To define the prevalence of minimal marrow disease (MMD) in B-LLy and to correlate MMD
      at diagnosis with outcome in patients with B-LLy.

      OUTLINE: All patients are assigned to, and complete an INDUCTION treatment regimen. Patients
      are then assigned to a CONSOLIDATION treatment regimen. Finally, following CONSOLIDATION,
