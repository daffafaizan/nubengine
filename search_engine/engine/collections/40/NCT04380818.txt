        1. Exploratory phase. It will include 10 patients, to assess the feasibility and efficacy
           of low-dose lung irradiation. If a minimum efficiency of 30% is not achieved, the study
           will not be continued.

        2. Comparative phase in two groups, a control group, which will only receive
           pharmacological treatment, and an experimental one. It will include 96 patients, the
           allocation will be 1: 2, that is, 32 in the control arm and 64 in the experimental arm,
           which will receive low-dose lung irradiation.
