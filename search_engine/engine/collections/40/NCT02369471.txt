    
      This is a double blind, randomized, placebo controlled, two-part study. Part A only will be
      described in this record.

      Subjects who satisfy all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria will begin a 14-day
      baseline observation period followed by a 14-day treatment period. Subjects will be required
      to attend six study visits. A follow-up phone call will take place four weeks after last
      dose.

      Part A will enroll three groups of 10 subjects:

        -  Group 1 - subjects on inducer AEDs (and not on inhibitor AEDs)

        -  Group 2 - subjects on inhibitor AEDs (and not on inducer AEDs)

        -  Group 3 - subjects on AEDs that are neither inducers nor inhibitors.

      In each of the three groups subjects will be randomized to receive, in a 4:1 ratio, GWP42006
      400 mg twice daily or matching placebo. Pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles for GWP42006 and
      metabolites will be collected on the first and last day of treatment. Samples will also be
      collected 24h and 72h after the last day of treatment.

      Subjects will be required to record a daily diary with information about their seizures,
      investigational medicinal product (IMP) and concomitant AED administration.
