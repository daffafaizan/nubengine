      cause disruptive fear, worry, or uneasiness that impairs their normal functioning. These
      anxiety disorders can include generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), phobias, panic disorder,
      and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and they often co-occur with a second anxiety
      disorder or another mental or behavioral disorder, like depression. Research on interventions
      such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) indicates that these interventions are helpful to
      children who suffer from anxiety disorders, but are not always used. This study will examine
      the feasibility of implementing CBT for children between the ages of 8 and 13 in two
      different forms: through in-person contact at the pediatric primary care setting and through
      telephone-based contact.

      Participants in this study will be randomly assigned to receive either cognitive behavioral
      therapy in primary care (CBT-PC) or therapist-assisted bibliotherapy in primary care
      (TAB-PC). In CBT-PC, participants will have therapy administered by a child anxiety
      specialist, and the parents of participants will learn how to support the new skills their
      children learn in therapy. In TAB-PC, parents will receive educational workbooks and ongoing
      support over the phone from a child anxiety specialist to learn how to use CBT skills to
      manage their children's fears and worries. Participation in this study will last 3 to 4
      months, with therapy visits occuring once a week at the beginning and tapering to once every
      other week at the end of treatment. At pre-treatment, mid-treatment, post-treatment, and a
      3-month follow-up, participants will undergo structured clinical interviews to assess their
      anxiety levels and the severity of their conditions.
