      low-grade glioma following neoadjuvant chemotherapy with PCV
      (procarbazine/lomustine/vincristine). II. Describe the toxicity of PCV. III. Determine the
      incidence of disease progression in these patients during PCV treatment.

      OUTLINE: The following acronyms are used: CCNU Lomustine, NSC-79037 PCB Procarbazine,
      NSC-77213 PCV PCB/CCNU/VCR VCR Vincristine, NSC-67574 3-Drug Combination Chemotherapy
      Followed by Radiotherapy. PCV; followed by external-beam cranial irradiation using at least 6
      MV photons.
