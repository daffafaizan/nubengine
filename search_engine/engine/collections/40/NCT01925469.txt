      is inserted through the cervical canal in order to define the size and shape of the uterine
      cavity and patency of the fallopian tubes. The utility of HSG is an integral part of the
      evaluation of infertile women for intrauterine pathology. In some cases, HSG can be a painful
      procedure. Poor pain control can limit the quality of the study due to inability to complete
      the procedure in cases of extreme discomfort. There is little consensus regarding pain
      control during HSG, although a number of approaches have been studied. Patients undergoing
      HSG are typically advised to premedicate with ibuprofen, which is consistent with the current
      standard of care. This study will assess pain control using a benzocaine spray (in addition
      to ibuprofen) in patients undergoing routine HSG at the Hospital of the University of
      Pennsylvania. All patients who present to the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania for
      HSG will be eligible for the study. Benzocaine spray versus a placebo spray will be applied
      to a tenaculum (a surgical hooklike instrument used to grasp and hold the cervix). The
      tenaculum will then be applied to the cervix prior to HSG and pain relief will be assessed at
      3 time intervals: 0, 5, and 30 minutes. The primary outcome is the mean difference in
      patients pain score and will be measured using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) which has been
      shown to be a valid and reliable scale. The secondary outcome will assess patient
      satisfaction in each group using a validated patient satisfaction survey. The study design
      will be prospective, randomized, placebo controlled, and double blinded.
