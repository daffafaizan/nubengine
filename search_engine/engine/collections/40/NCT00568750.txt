      Primary

        -  To determine the efficacy of dasatinib as assessed by fusion PET/CT scan in patients
           with gastrointestinal stromal tumors.

      Secondary

        -  To determine the efficacy and safety of dasatinib in these patients.

        -  To correlate the efficacy of dasatinib with KIT and PDGFR mutational status.

        -  To correlate the efficacy and safety of dasatinib with dasatinib drug exposure.

        -  To determine the efficacy of second-line treatment with another TK-inhibitor.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral dasatinib twice daily on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for
      26 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then
      every 6 months for 4 years.
