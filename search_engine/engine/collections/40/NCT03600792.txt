      neurodevelopmental outcome of patients with ACC is extremely variable, ranging from normal
      intelligence to severe intellectual disability (ID). When ACC is discovered during the
      prenatal period, prenatal counseling is challenging because of this uncertain
      neurodevelopmental outcome. Currently, only chromosomal analyses are performed in cases of
      prenatal diagnoses, which are expected to bring the diagnosis in only few cases. No molecular
      studies of genes implied in ACC with or without ID are performed. Then, the couples are in
      the difficult situation of continuing or interrupting the pregnancy without complete
      information about the aetiology of ACC.

      All patients will have a consultation with an obstetrician and consultations with a
      paediatric neurologist and a geneticist. The geneticist will explain WES and its issues. Both
      parents will have to provide informed consent for the study.
