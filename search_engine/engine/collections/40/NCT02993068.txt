      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To test the effects of online genetic education versus telephone genetic counseling on
      testing completion rates.

      II. To evaluate the role of psychological and social variables in women's reactions to
      genetic testing for ovarian cancer risk with variable education strategies.

      III. To consider the effects of variations of genetic education/counseling on genetic
      knowledge, satisfaction with the decision to undergo testing, and family communication.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized into 1 of 4 arms.

      ARM A: Patients watch genetic testing online educational video and receive genetic testing
      online test results report.

      ARM B: Patients watch genetic testing online educational video, receive genetic testing
      online test results report, and post-telephone genetic counseling.

      ARM C: Patients watch genetic testing online educational video, receive pre-telephone genetic
      counseling, genetic testing online test results report, and post-telephone genetic
      counseling.

      ARM D: Patients watch genetic testing online educational video, receive pre-telephone genetic
