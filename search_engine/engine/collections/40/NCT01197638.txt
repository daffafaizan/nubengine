      curative treatment possible of numerous tachycardiac arrhythmics. By this crucial improvement
      of the supply of patients and its quality of life a genuine healing of a multiplicity of
      heartbeat disturbances became possible. Especially within the range of the ablation treatment
      there are relatively few con-trolled studies, which would give a broad collection of the
      results of the catheter ablation in the different indication areas.
