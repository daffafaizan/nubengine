      feedback on performance and goal setting for changing practices in the real world, and
      addressing vegetable (V) feeding problems commonly reported by parents, may elicit desirable
      cognitive, affective, and behavioral outcomes.

      The rationale for training parents of preschool children in effective V parenting practices
      is that: 1) parents have an important influence on young children's dietary intake; 2) child
      dietary intake tracks into the adult years; and 3) high V consumption protects against
      several chronic diseases later in life. Since parents of young children commonly complain
      about not getting their child to eat V, there should be broad interest in playing Mommio.

      A pre-post randomized clinical trial with 110 parents of 3-5 year olds who report having
      difficulty getting their child to eat vegetables will be employed. The primary outcome will
      be parent report of children's dietary intake; the secondary outcome will be use of V
      parenting practices.

      We had to discontinue the study since changes in commercial availability of game development
      software required reprogramming and available funding did not allow for completion of game
      programming. Thus, no game evaluation was possible.
