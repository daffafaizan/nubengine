      admission. Ward et al have outlined the demands that emergency department coverage places on
      practicing orthopedic surgeons. Assuming no statistically significant differences in
      outcomes, there are potential advantages of having PEMs provide restorative fracture care at
      the initial visit. This practice would permit judicious orthopedic consultation at a time
      when several emergency department's are facing an "on call" specialist coverage crisis and
      there exists a nationwide shortage of fellowship trained pediatric orthopedic specialists, in
      addition to ACGME mandated duty hour restrictions for orthopedic residents.

      Pershad et al conducted a retrospective study with historical controls, of 60 patients with
      distal radius fracture that were reduced by an orthopedic resident or PEM physician. In this
      review, there were no differences in rates of re-intervention to restore fracture alignment
      or ED length-of-stay between the two groups.Mean facility charges were lower in the group
      treated by PEMs.

      It is our hypothesis that with goal directed training, PEM physicians can perform closed
      reduction of uncomplicated distal forearm fractures with outcomes that are similar to when
      fracture reduction is performed by senior orthopedic resident physicians.
