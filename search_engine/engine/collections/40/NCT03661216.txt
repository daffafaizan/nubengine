      volunteers on a controlled diet as compared to placebo. Subjects are on a normal diet with
      controlled oxalate (750mg/day) and calcium (550mg/day) levels for 8 consecutive days. The
      study is a cross-over design with two four-day treatment periods. The study intends to
      determine level of reduction in urinary oxalate output as a measure of the effect of Nephure
      on dietary oxalate when ingested with a meal.
