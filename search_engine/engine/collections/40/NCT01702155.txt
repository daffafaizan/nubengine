      The Phase I dose-escalation portion of the study will determine the highest tolerable dose
      and regimen (7 or 14 day continuous infusion) based on safety data in patients with
      refractory or relapsed AML or ALL. The phase II portion will investigate the safety and
      efficacy of DFP-10917, at the dose and regimen to be determined in the Phase I portion, in
