      repair of unilateral inguinal hernia, which is becoming the new standard of care in open
      surgical repair of inguinal hernia.

      The study design is interventional, enrolling 300 patients above 18 years of age, admitted
      for elective repair in the surgical department of Rambam Medical Health Care Campus, an
      academic medical center.
