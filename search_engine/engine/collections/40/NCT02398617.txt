    
      This study will be a prospective pilot enrolling 10 patients with advanced disease admitted
      to the heart failure service at St. Luke's Mid America Heart Institute and who are not
      candidates for advanced therapies such as heart transplant or mechanical circulatory support
      (left ventricular assist device). Potential enrollees will be identified using a validated
      risk model that predicts death or poor quality of life in the six months after discharge from
      the hospital for heart failure exacerbation. Enrolled patients will complete validated
      questionnaires while still hospitalized, regarding health-related quality of life, illness
      acceptance, prioritization of different life goals, and confidence in decision-making
      regarding their terminal heart failure. Patients will then be given a paper exercise
      regarding delineation of an end-of-life plan and appointment of a surrogate medical
      decision-maker, to be completed after discharge. At their regularly scheduled admission
      follow-up visit with seven days of discharge, participants will be asked to bring their
      medical decision maker and participate in a semi-structured supplemental palliative
      care/education session facilitated by a heart failure nurse practitioner trained in
      palliative care discussions. Domains included in the intervention will include disease
      literacy and understanding, goals of care, legal issues for patients with terminal illness,
      symptom management, health-related quality of life, caregiver burden, patient autonomy,
      healthcare utilization, and establishment of end-of-life plans.

      Outcomes to be measured after the intervention include repeated validated questionnaires and
      unstructured patient interviews at 1 month and, at 6 months, creation of a formalized
      end-of-life plan, change in code status, obtainment of an advanced directive, designation of
      a durable power of attorney, frequency of re-hospitalizations, emergency room visits and
      unscheduled clinic visits with providers, and death. These will be obtained at the time of
      regularly scheduled heart failure clinic follow-up visits or over the phone.
