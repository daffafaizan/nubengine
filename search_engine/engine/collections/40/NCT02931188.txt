    
      REVEAL-Vasc is an investigator led sub-study of HPS3/TIMI 55: REVEAL. Participants who
      previously enrolled on HPS3/TIMI 55: REVEAL and received treatment will be invited to
      participate in this sub-study. Participants will attend a screening and an assessment visit
      during which Pulse Wave Velocity/ Pulse Wave Analysis and Flow Mediated Dilation will be
      carried out to assess blood vessel function and stiffness. A blood sample will also be taken
      from participant to assess CRP and lipid profile. Since participants will have received
      treatment on the main trial HPS3/TIMI 55: REVEAL, no treatment will be received on this
      sub-study.
