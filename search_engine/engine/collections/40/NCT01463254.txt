      primary method of contraception in Pakistan. It will be conducted in close collaboration with
      the Pakistan MoH and Marie Stopes Society, Pakistan in several MoH-affiliated and Marie
      Stopes Society clinics that have experience with implants and sufficient expected flow of
      implant users per month. We will enroll a total of 600 women divided into two cohorts in this
      one-year prospective study:

        -  a prospective cohort consisting of 300 women who will be followed-up 3 and 12 months
           after enrolment; and

        -  a surveillance cohort of 300 women who will report back to the clinic during 12 months
           after enrolment only if they have complications, medical problems, pregnancy, or want to
           remove the implant

      The main study outcomes are pregnancy, immediate and delayed complications associated with
      insertion or removal, adverse events, early discontinuation and reasons for discontinuation,
      and level of women's satisfaction with Femplant services.
