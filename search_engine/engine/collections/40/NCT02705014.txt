      in male pituitary stalk interruption syndrome patients by pulsatile GnRH therapy. The
      hormonal response of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonad axis was assessed after pulsatile GnRH
      replacement by measurement of serum T, LH and FSH. A standard seminal fluid analysis was
      performed in men who could produce an ejaculate.
