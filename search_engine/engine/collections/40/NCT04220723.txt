      liver diseases. In a study, 6 Minute Walk Test was associated with mortality in patients with
      cirrhosis and survival was lower in patients walking less than 250 meters. Malnutrition is a
      common complication of end-stage liver disease. It is a complex condition that causes loss of
      muscle and fat mass, loss of body weight, increased pro-inflammatory cytokines, anorexia and
      fatigue, resulting in sarcopenia. Sarcopenia is generally defined as a loss of muscle mass
      and muscle strength and is directly related to adverse outcomes in these patients. In the
      evaluation of malnutrition in end-stage liver disease, evaluation of skeletal muscle (mass,
      strength, functionality) provides an objective way to determine malnutrition, since most
      intrinsic markers originate from existing liver disease (eg albumin, prealbumin, lymphopenia
      levels).
