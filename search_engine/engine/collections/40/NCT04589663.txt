    
      This is an open-label, two-period, single-sequence, crossover study to assess the
      pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of single inhaled doses of mometasone furoate (MF)
      when administered alone via MF Twisthaler® (TH) or as an indacaterol acetate/MF fixed dose
      combination (QMF149) via the Concept 1 (C1) device in ≥ 6 to <12 year old asthma patients.
      The study includes two open-label single-dose treatment visits. On the first treatment visit
      (Day 1) patients receive a single inhaled dose of 100 μg MF administered via the Twisthaler®
      device. On the second treatment visit (Day 6) patients receive a single inhaled dose of 75/40
      μg indacaterol acetate/MF fixed dose combination (QMF149) via C1 device. Both treatments are
      in addition to their rescue medication and potentially standard of care asthma therapy
      (excluding MF and indacaterol acetate).

      The primary objective is to compare the systemic exposure to MF resulting from single doses
      of MF when administered as MF TH 100 μg versus QMF149 75/40 μg C1.
