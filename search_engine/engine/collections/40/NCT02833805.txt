      not have a fully human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matched donor. The trial uses a conditioning
      regimen which has been successful in the refractory and relapsed setting to maximize
      engraftment and post transplant therapy to minimize graft versus host disease (GVHD). This
      would be used here in patients who have not yet undergone immunosuppressive therapy for their
      SAA or are thought to be unlikely to respond to immunosuppressive therapy for SAA.
