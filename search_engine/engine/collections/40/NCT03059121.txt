      (ART) are unknown, and as such, investigators will use this prospective observational cohort
      to study relationships between lifestyle factors, including diet, physical activity and
      illicit drug use, with changes in body composition after ART. In addition, the effect of the
      body fat changes will be correlated to changes in cardiometabolic indices such as endothelial
      function and coronary calcium scoring.
