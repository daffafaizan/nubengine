      interest. Analyses show an increase of respiratory difficulty, but also cardiac deaths in the
      daytime when the atmospheric pollution was increased. It was demonstrated that health effects
      of ambient air pollution in subjects presenting cardiac or lung difficulty were important.
      Mechanisms show a possible relation to autonomic nervous system (ANS) deactivation and
      mortality. Particularly, the ageing and ANS reach would be more predictive of cardiovascular
      events. Thus, we suggest estimating in 60 healthy volunteers from 60 to 80 years old, the
      impact of the air pollution on the autonomic nervous system activity and sleep apnea
      consequences.
