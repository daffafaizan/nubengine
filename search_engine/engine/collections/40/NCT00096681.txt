    
      TB is the most common opportunistic infection among HIV infected people, and is the most
      common cause of death in HIV infected people in Africa. The Masiphumelele township of Cape
      Town, South Africa, with its high rates of TB and HIV, is representative of many poor
      communities of Africa. Via random sampling, this study will assess the prevalence of HIV and
      TB infections in the Masiphumelele township. Knowledge gained from this study will be used to
      predict if introducing antiretroviral therapy will reduce the prevalence of TB in this
      community.

      Selection and enrollment of participants will last about 4 months. Potential participants
      will be visited in their homes by fieldworkers, who will explain the study. Participants will
      be invited to either go to the clinic on the day of the fieldworker's visit or to go on a
      different day. Participants who go to the clinic on the day of the visit will have two sputum
      samples collected with a nebulizer. Participants who do not go to the clinic on the visit day
      will be given a sputum sample bottle and will be asked to collect a sputum sample in the
      early morning the day before their clinic appointment. At the clinic appointment, another
      sputum sample will be collected from these participants. Direct smear acid-fast bacilli and
      Mycobacterium tuberculosis cultures will be done on both sputum samples. Participants who
      test positive for TB will be referred for TB treatment at the clinic. Participants will also
      be asked to complete a study questionnaire and will undergo an anonymous oral HIV test at the
      clinic visit.
