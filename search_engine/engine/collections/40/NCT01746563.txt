    
      Comparative efficacy of combined treatment including intravitreal injection of 0.5 mg of
      Lucentis (ranibizumab) and laser photocoagulation for patients with Proliferative Diabetic
      Retinopathy (PDR).

      Objectives:

      Primary objective:

      The primary objective will be to evaluate the efficacy of combined treatment with ranibizumab
      and laser photocoagulation versus laser photocoagulation alone in patients with severe PDR by
      the mean change in BCVA at V7/M6 compared to baseline. The Best Visual Acuity (BCVA) measured
      by the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (EDTRS).

      Secondary objectives:

      To evaluate differences in Optic Coherence Tomography (OCT) retinal thickness and total
      macular volume of combined treatment regiment including intravitreal injection of 0,5 mg of
      Lucentis (ranibizumab) and laser photocoagulation for patients with PDR at visit 7 compared
      to the baseline assessments.

      To evaluate the percentage of patients that present with vitreous hemorrhage after the
      beginning of the laser treatment at visit 7 compared to the baseline assessments.

      Strategic goal:

      The main goal of this study is to evaluate if the use of intravitreal ranibizumab in eyes
      submitted to Pan-Retinal Photocoagulation (PRP) due to PDR induces less macular edema and
      less vitreous hemorrhage and therefore leads to a better visual outcome
