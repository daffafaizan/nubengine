    
      This study is designed as a nonrandomized, single-blind, sham-controlled trail in which
      willing participants will receive a 5 day course of twice daily caloric vestibular
      stimulation (CVS) or sham treatment. CVS involves twice daily sessions of CVS each lasting 15
      minutes. The week before the intervention baseline characterization of mood and substance
      craving will be conducted using standard mood and substance use questionnaires. Prior to
      treatment beginning participants will undergo structural and functional MR imaging.
      Participants will also undergo a standard battery of questionnaires, including cognitive
      testing, mood and affect surveys, and surveys specific to SUD. During each of the 5 treatment
      days the participants will be asked to fill out questionnaires related to mood and craving
      symptoms. Participants will be blinded to sham stimulation or the standard CVS protocol. At
      the end of the 5 day course participants will be scanned again in MRI and asked to fill out
      the same battery of questions. Consistent with the existing standard of care participants
      will also receive two urine drug screens (UDS)
