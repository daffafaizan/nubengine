      Organization (WHO) reports that 20% of college students likely meet criteria for a mental
      health condition, yet only approximately 16% of those with conditions received treatment.
      Data from the 2015 National College Health Assessment (N=67,308 from 108
      colleges/universities) showed that 25% of the sample had a diagnostic history of a
      psychiatric condition. Further, this study found high rates of the presence of mental health
      symptoms in the past 12 months among students, with 35% reporting depression that interfered
      with functioning, 39% reporting overwhelming anger, 50% reporting hopelessness, 58% reporting
      overwhelming anxiety, 61% reporting loneliness, 66% reporting feeling very sad, 83% reporting
      exhaustion, and 87% reporting feeling overwhelmed. Self-harm was reported by 7% and 10%
      reported that they "seriously considered suicide."

      Many previous studies have shown that sleep is strongly related to mental health, especially
      among your adults. In particular, our preliminary data from the 2011-2014 National College
      Health Assessment data show that each night of reported insufficient sleep was associated
      with an increased likelihood of also reporting hopelessness (28% increase per night of
      insufficient sleep), feeling overwhelmed (24%), exhaustion (31%), loneliness (21%), sadness
      (21%), functional problems (30%), anxiety (28%), anger (27%), desire to hurt self (21%),
      suicide ideation (30%), and suicide attempts (12%). In looking at UA students, we previously
      found that among student athletes, sleep is related to mental health. Sleep duration, sleep
      quality, insomnia, fatigue, and symptoms of sleep disordered breathing were all independently
      associated with depression, anxiety, and mental well-being.

      In our previous work, we developed an intervention called "REST" (Recovery Enhancement and
      Seep Training) that was deployed among student athletes. This intervention included
      education, sleep tracking, a financial incentive (lottery system), and support. It was
      effective at increasing sleep duration (by M=77 mins) and improving sleep quality (increased
      sleep efficiency, reduced insomnia severity, and reduced fatigue). The present study aims to
      examine relationships between sleep and mental health and well-being among a more
      heterogeneous sample of students and apply the REST intervention to this group to determine
      whether we can improve sleep in this group and whether changes in sleep are associated with
      improvements in mental health.
