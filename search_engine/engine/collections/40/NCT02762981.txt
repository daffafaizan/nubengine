      (Part 1) and a dose expansion which will occur once the development regimen for Segment I and
      Segment II has been determined (Part 2). Segment I will evaluate a continuous-dosing regimen
      and Segment II will evaluate an intermittent-dosing regimen. Enrollment in Segment I and
      Segment II will be mutually exclusive, and the two segments will enroll patients
      concurrently.

      Segment I, Part 1: dose-escalation cohorts will be enrolled with approximately 62 patients to
      determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the development regimen for the
      continuous-dosing regimen. Treatment will be administered in 28-day cycles.

      A continuous dosing cohort will be explored in patients with pancreatic cancer. Segment I,
      Part 2: Enrollment in Part 2 of the study (dose expansion) will occur once the development
      regimen for Segment I has been determined.

      Segment II, Part 1: dose-escalation cohorts will be enrolled with approximately 24 patients
      to determine the MTD and the development regimen for the intermittent-dosing regimen.
      Treatment on Segment II Part I will be administered in 28-day cycles.

      Segment II, Part 2: Enrollment in Part 2 of the study (dose expansion) will occur once the
      development regimen for Segment II has been determined.
