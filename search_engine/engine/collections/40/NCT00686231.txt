      assigned to one of two Dose-Test arms to receive either 15mg or 30mg of nitroglycerin on one
      wrist and placebo on the other. Radial artery diameter will be measured with ultrasound at
      regular intervals up to two hours. On the second study visit, the same participants will be
      randomly assigned to one of two Combination-Test arms to receive bilateral topical
      application of either 20mg or 40mg of lidocaine; the lidocaine will be applied in combination
      with 30mg of nitroglycerin on one wrist and in combination with placebo on the other wrist.
      Measurements of radial artery diameter will be performed as in the first visit.
