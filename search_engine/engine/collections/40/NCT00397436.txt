      forearms of healthy young male volunteers. Knowledge of specific molecular markers may
      provide knowledge of basic biological systems and possibly targeted therapy of inflammation.

      By using combined proteomic methodologies we will be able to quantify protein changes at
      cytoplasmic and membrane protein levels of epidermal cells in normal vs. irradiated skins.

      This study may allow us to obtain fairly comprehensive profile of membrane integrated and
      cytoplasmic proteins of epidermal cell populations which will facilitate our understand of
      biological responses to UV irradiation.
