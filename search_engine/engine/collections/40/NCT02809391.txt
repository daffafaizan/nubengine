      increased plantar sensory information and orthotics in a Parkinsonian gait. Observing gait
      parameters and muscle activation changes, in orthotics with and without a textured top cover,
      provides an increased understanding of conservative treatment options available to the
      Parkinson's population. It is hypothesized that balance and functional mobility in
      Parkinson's Disease (PD) patients will increase, while decreasing fall risks, when wearing
      both types of orthotics. Larger improvements are expected with the orthotics with a textured
      top cover, thus increasing plantar sensory feedback. Male and female participants, aged
      55-75, with a diagnosis of idiopathic Parkinson's disease can participate in the study. Two
      types of orthotic design will be examined: 1) Customizable over-the-counter orthotics and 2)
      Customizable over-the-counter orthotics with a textured top cover. Five different assessments
      will be performed during three different testing sessions: 1) baseline testing; 2) 6-weeks
      post-baseline; and 3) 12-weeks post-baseline. The administered assessments include: 1) Static
      balance, double limb stance; 2) The Berg Balance Scale (BBS); 3) Timed Up and Go (TUG), 4)
      Functional Gait Assessment (FGA); and 5) Walking task.
