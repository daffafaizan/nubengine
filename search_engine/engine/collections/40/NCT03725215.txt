      imposed by a split-belt treadmill, improves walking ability and reduces FOG. The
      investigators will test the hypothesis that motor adaptation deficits underlie FOG and that
      these problems are modifiable with training. To address these suppositions, the investigators
      propose a multi-centric study conducted in two research labs with expertise in split-belt
      gait analysis and FOG: University of Leuven (KUL) and Christian-Albrechts-University Kiel
      (CAUK). As freezers have been shown to have more difficulty with consolidation of motor
      learning, the investigators aim in study I (pilot phase) to first understand which split-belt
      parameters are optimal for training gait flexibility and lead to consolidated gains in daily
      walking. For this study, the investigators will recruit 60 freezers and 60 healthy controls,
      pooled across centers, and manipulate different split-belt conditions in one learning and
      retention session.
