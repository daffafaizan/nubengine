    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess objective response rate (ORR) of ATR kinase inhibitor AZD6738 (AZD6738)
      monotherapy and AZD6738 + olaparib by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)
      1.1 criteria.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the median duration of response (DOR) in each study arm. II. To determine the
      median progression-free survival and progression-free survival rate at 6 and 12 months in
      each study arm.

      III. To further characterize the safety and tolerability profile of AZD6738 alone and in
      combination with olaparib.
