    
      This study requests using your additional bone tissue (the extra tissue not needed after your
      back surgery is complete).

      This tissue will be measured for total volume (amount), labeled with your age, gender, date
      and time the tissue was removed (date and time of surgery), and taken to a lab for analysis.
      You will not be billed for the collection of your additional tissue or the lab analysis. All
      routine procedures (surgery and all follow-up care relating to your back surgery) will still
      be paid for by you or your insurance.

      Once your extra tissue sample has been collected, measured, labeled, and sent to the lab for
      testing, no further participation is required from you in this research study. The
      investigators will use your sample in our research to enhance bone healing.
