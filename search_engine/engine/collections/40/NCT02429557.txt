      blood pressure on standing) due to severe impairment of the autonomic nervous system.
      Compression garments such as waist-high stockings and abdominal binders have been shown to
      improve orthostatic hypotension in these patients. The purpose of this study is to determine
      the hemodynamic mechanisms by which abdominal compression (up to 40 mm Hg) improve the
      standing blood pressure and orthostatic tolerance in these patients, and to compare them with
      those of the standard of care midodrine. The investigators will test the hypothesis that
      abdominal compression will blunt the exaggerated fall in stroke volume and the increase in
      abdominal vascular volume during head up tilt. This study will help us better understand the
      contribution of the abdominal veins to orthostatic hypotension and the mechanisms underlying
      this non-pharmacological therapeutic approach.

      Participants will be studied in a tilt table in two separate days in a randomized, crossover
      fashion with sham abdominal compression (~5 mmHg) and active compression (~40 mmHg).
