      children acting as their own controls. The study is scheduled at three-week intervals. All
      children undergo conventional occupational therapy (OT) and modified constraint-induced
      movement therapy plus self-regulation (mCIMT + SR) program in a random order.

      Both programs last for three weeks. Each program is followed by a three-week no-treatment
      period to measure the carry-over effect. The OT program consists of training on unimanual and
      bimanual tasks for 1 to 2 hours a week with daily home exercise. The mCIMT + SR program
      involves restraint of the unaffected upper limb of children using a cotton sling for 6 hours
      per day for 15 days. A one-hour structured task practice with the use of SR is provided
      during each 6-hour restraint.

      The Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency, the Jebsen-Taylor Test of Hand Function,
      the Caregiver Functional Use Survey, a hand dynamometer, pinch gauge, and modified Ashworth
      scale are used for evaluation. All children are assessed for five times at 3-week interval:
      once before and twice after the conventional OT; and twice after the mCIMT + SR at 1 week and
      at 3 weeks.

      Before and after the three-week intervention, the children participate in event-related
      potentials (ERP) sessions with a choice reaction task. Event-related potentials (ERP)
      technique is used to capture the changes in neural mechanism after intervention.
