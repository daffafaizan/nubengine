      along with pneumoperitoneum. These both can cause a significant rise in intraocular pressure.
      Significant rise of pressure for prolonged period can cause post operative visual
      disturbances, which can be of medicolegal importance. Thus studying the quantitative rise and
      thus trend of intraocular pressure is first step in managing ophthalmic changes during
      robotic surgeries.
