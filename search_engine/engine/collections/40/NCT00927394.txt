      into the study. These patients were included in the trial prior to making changes to the
      eligibility criteria. Thus, the study contains 2 distinct cohorts. Cohort 1 contains those
      patients who had already been randomized, and had been deemed eligible based on the original
      inclusion/exclusion criteria, prior to Amendment 2. No new patients were randomized to Cohort
      1. Cohort 2 contains patients who were randomized, having been found eligible based on the
      revised inclusion/exclusion criteria, after Amendment 2. Differences in the inclusion and
      exclusion criteria are indicated below.
