      ability to shift perspective from the here and now to a simulated time, place, or person.
      Based on prior review and meta-analysis of the distancing literature, a new model has been
      developed of the neurocognitive processes that support distancing. The proposed experiment
      will test the model causally through a neural intervention that should impair or enhance the
      ability of healthy adults to successfully apply distancing to down-regulate negative affect.
      In the model, it is hypothesized that the temporoparietal junction (TPJ) was a key region
      mediating the self-projection aspect of distancing. Leveraging recent functional magnetic
      resonance imaging (fMRI) work, the experiment will functionally modulate this region through
      inhibitory transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to test its causal role in distancing.
      Importantly, the proposed work shifts emphasis from traditional models of emotion regulation,
      which implicate frontal executive control mechanisms, to new cognitive processes and brain
      targets that can ultimately lead to novel approaches to treat affective disorders.
