      whom PDXs are successfully generated within 7-10 days. This will give the investigators an
      indication of the success rate for providing patients with actionable information if this PDX
      technology were to be implemented in the clinic. Since the PDXs will also receive the same
      drug as the patient, there is an opportunity to assess the agreement between the clinical
      response and the PDX response.

      As a secondary goal, the response of PDXs will be compared to the patient's response to
      systemic therapy, as measured using the objective response rate at 12 weeks +/- 4 weeks (ORR,
      measured using RECIST 1.1 criteria).
