    
      Insulin sensitivity is measured using the hyperinsulinemic euglycemic glucose clamp method.
      The hypothesis of the investigators is that a continuous (pyr1)-apelin-13 infusion improves
      insulin sensitivity of type 2 diabetic patients compared to placebo infusion.

      This study could bring new elements for understanding the pathophysiology of insulin
      resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus in humans and could lead to the development of
      innovative therapies in type 2 diabetes mellitus.
