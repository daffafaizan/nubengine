      depressive symptoms using the Cornell Depression Scale and the MDS 3.0 section D. We are
      selecting patients who are not currently on treatment with Advair and starting them on Advair
      Diskus50/250 1 inhalation bid for a period of 16 weeks and reassessing the Cornell Depression
      SCale and MDS3.0 section D looking for any changes. We are also going to measure FEV1 and FVC
      using spirometry before treatment and at the end of 16 weeks. This is a pilot study. The
      numbers are not necessarily adequate to achieve statistical difference-we are looking for
      trends.
