      >=12 years of age with a forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) >=40 percent (%)
      predicted. This study was conducted in 2 parts.

        -  Part A of this study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group
           evaluation of participants with CF who were aged 12 years or older and were homozygous
           for the F508del-CFTR mutation.

        -  Part B of this study was an open-label extension of Part A, enrolling participants who
           completed Part A and met pre-specified endpoint criteria, and explored the safety and
           efficacy of ivacaftor over long-term treatment in participants with CF aged 12 years or
           older who were homozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation.
