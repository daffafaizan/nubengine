      Manifestations of SS include salivary and lacrimal gland dysfunction. There is no generally
      accepted treatment for the underlying autoimmune reactivity or the exocrine gland dysfunction
      in SS. We propose to test the effects of etanercept therapy. In a randomized, double-masked,
      outpatient protocol, patients will receive etanercept for 2 times/week for 3 months. Therapy
      will be given by subcutaneous injection. Efficacy of treatment will be assessed by monitoring
      salivary and lacrimal function, serological markers of autoimmune activity, and subjective
      reports of local and systemic symptoms. The present trial will serve as a screening protocol
      to identify if etanercept should be further analyzed in a larger clinical trial for efficacy.
