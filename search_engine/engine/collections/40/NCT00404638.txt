      that all sphincters in the human body work simultaneosly, mutually affecting one another
      possibly mediated by "oscillation" of the spinal cord. According to this theory, exercising
      the ring muscles in a certain area of the body will result in strengthening the circular
      muscles in other areas. This method was found to to be efficacious for treatment of urinary
      stress incontinence in women.
