      read, see familiar faces, and walk independently. Almost 2 million persons (about 5 percent
      of the U.S. population over age 65) are now affected, and this number will triple by the year
      2020. This study will target patients with neovascular AMD (NV-AMD), a form of AMD which can
      lead to sudden vision loss, substantial disability, and depression. Because depression is
      itself disabling and not likely to be recognized nor treated by ophthalmologists, preventing
      depression in people with NV-AMD is important.

      Patients are randomly assigned to either PST or a usual care control condition. The primary
      outcome measure is a DSM-IV diagnosis of depression. Patients are evaluated at baseline,
      Month 2 (immediately post-intervention), Month 6 (for the primary efficacy analysis), and
      Month 12 (to evaluate sustained effects). The study will also assess the impact of PST on
      levels of disability and vision-related quality of life.
