      disease. Technical improvements in surgical approaches have been reported, providing less
      invasive surgery with lower morbidity. However, there are cases of unresectable tumors where
      the needs of novel strategies is higher.

      New therapeutic strategies are needed to obtain more efficient treatment with less morbidity.
      Some studies explored the role and feasibility of induction chemotherapy (CT) and the
      prognostic value of response to CT. Histology and molecular pattern can guide the type of
      administered CT. The first drives the choice of drug to be associated with Cisplatin, while
      mutational status of p53 (wild type, WT vs mutated, MUT) is a predictive value for response
      to CT with Cisplatin plus 5-Fluorouracil and Leucovorin in ITAC.

      Moreover, proton/carbon ion beam therapy, compared to conventional photon therapy, provides a
      more accurate and intense dose to tumor area, with potentially higher control of disease.

      Treatment outcomes for unresectable paranasal sinus carcinoma are poor, and combined-modality
      treatment is needed to find out novel therapeutic strategies.
