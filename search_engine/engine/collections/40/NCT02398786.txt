    
      The Myotonic Dystrophy Family Registry (MDFR) is an online, patient-entered database that
      collects information on myotonic dystrophy (DM) such as disease symptoms and demographic
      information to aid researchers in developing new, effective treatments and help identify
      participants for research studies and clinical trials.

      The Registry supports trials and studies, making it easier for researchers to explore data
      and identify possible trial and study participants. It is the first DM registry that gives
      community members the opportunity to explore anonymous Registry data, to see what the DM
      community looks like and what others with DM experience. It also provides information on the
      community of people living with DM, giving researchers and other medical professionals the
      opportunity to improve how they treat those affected with DM and learn more about how and why
      certain treatments work and don't work.
