      leukapheresis procedure approximately 3 to 4 weeks prior to the first BATs infusion. The
      white blood cells, specifically T cells, are then mixed with two proteins in order to
      activate the cells to multiply.

      After approximately 14 days in culture, the activated T cells are coated with OKT3 and
      trastuzumab/Herceptin (HER2Bi), and washed to remove excess Herceptin in order to produce
      bispecific antibody armed T cells (BATs). Cells are then frozen and stored until scheduled to
      be infused.

      Up to 2 weeks following leukapheresis, participants will undergo surgery to place the
      catheter/reservoir into the lateral ventricle of the brain to allow intraventricular
      administration of HER2 BATs and a chemotherapy agent methotrexate. A few weeks later,
      participants will receive the intraventricular methotrexate in order to control disease while
      the BATs product is being manufactured. About 4-5 weeks following the leukapheresis and at
      least 7 days after receiving methotrexate, study treatment will begin with a test dose of
      HER2 BATs. If this dose is well tolerated by the participant, she will then receive 8 weekly
      doses of HER2 BATs at the assigned dose level.
