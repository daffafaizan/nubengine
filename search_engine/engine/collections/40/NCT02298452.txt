      Phonak Headquarters in Staefa. The focus is to compare a new hearing aid product generation
      with the one on the market as well as with competitor devices regarding the audiological
      performance, usability as well as features and functions with the aid of 382 mild to profound
      hearing impaired subjects (18-90 yrs). The subjects, all of them native (Swiss) German
      speakers, individually conduct a number of laboratory standard tests and home trials
      (questionnaires) during nine weeks including weekly appointments of 2 hours.
