      PDT. Ranibizumab was first administered to patients followed after seven days by RF-PDT.
      Subsequently intravitreal ranibizumab (IVR) was injected as needed (pro re nata). All
      patients were evaluated every 4 weeks for 48 weeks.

      Main Outcome Measures: Mean change in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) from baseline at 48
      weeks, reduced mean central foveal thickness (CFT) analyzed by optical coherence tomography
      (OCT) and improved macular sensitivity registered at microperimetry (MP) evaluation.
