      function. To our knowledge, no research has investigated the functional and behavioural
      effects of tDCS on anosognosia in schizophrenia. As such, we aim to improve impaired illness
      awareness in schizophrenia with tDCS by inhibiting left hemisphere regions (i.e.
      temporoparietooccipital cortex) shown by our group to be activated during illness denial.

      Positive results will demonstrate that impaired illness awareness in schizophrenia involves a
      similar brain network to impaired illness awareness in patients with brain lesions and can be
      similarly modulated with non-invasive techniques, such as tDCS. If proven effective, this
      easy to administer, safe, non-invasive intervention would have the potential to alter
      individuals' attitude towards their illness and medication, leading ultimately to an
      improvement in individuals' capacity for illness recognition and treatment engagement, which
      would undoubtedly have a significant impact on the management of this devastating mental
      disorder.
