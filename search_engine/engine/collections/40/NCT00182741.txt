      Primary

        -  Determine the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response rate, defined as the fraction of
           patients with 50% reduction in PSA level over 3 weeks' time, in patients with
           androgen-independent metastatic prostate cancer treated with high-dose pulse calcitriol,
           mitoxantrone, and prednisone.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral high dose pulse calcitriol on day 1, mitoxantrone IV on day 2, and oral
      prednisone on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 12 courses in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 48 patients will be accrued for this study.
