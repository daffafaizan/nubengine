      phase- II study of EPAG or placebo in combination with standard-dose DAC treatment as
      concomitant medication in subjects at least 65 years of age with AML not eligible for
      intensive chemotherapy and planned therapy with Decitabine (DAC). Patients will be randomized
      1:1 into the experimental study arm and the control study arm. EPAG 200 mg (100 mg for East
      Asian patients) once daily has been selected as the starting dose for this study because this
      regimen has been investigated to be safe and potentially effective in increasing platelet
      counts in patients with AML. Concomitant medication with DAC will be according to the
      european label and the summary of product characteristics. There will be a dose adjustment of
      EPAG depending on the platelet counts obtained on day 1 of a planned DAC cycle.

      Concomitant medication will be Decitabine (DAC) 20 mg/m2 i.v. over 30 minutes on days 1-5 of
      each cycle. One cycle lasts 28 days. Patients will receive medication as long as they benefit
      from treatment and in the absence of relevant adverse events indicating a treatment
      discontinuation; but for a maximum of 12 cycles. During Follow Up (up to 4 years) patient
      survival and first treatment change will be observed.
