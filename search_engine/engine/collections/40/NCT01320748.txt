      subjective stress are highly predictive of relapse and significantly influence behavioral
      motivation. From a neurobiological perspective, stress associated with withdrawal and
      substance abuse experiences stimulates chemical and hormonal changes in the brain creating a
      protracted hyperaroused state. Further, cognitive control resources (i.e., cognitive coping
      skills/relapse prevention training) have been shown to exert minimal impact on behavioral
      decision-making in the presence of intense affective material. Thus, implicit cognitive
      processes play a significant role in drug use behavior, decreasing self regulation capacities
      and increasing risk of. Specifically, high levels of stress can compromise prefrontal cortex
      functioning, with the nucleus accumbens, orbitofrontal cortex and amygdala functional changes
      related to increased cue reactivity.

      Taken together, the current literature strongly suggests that verbally-based therapies may
      have limited utility as a singular form of treatment in early substance abuse recovery, as
      the brain may not be functionally ready for executive level processing. Instead, the
      multidisciplinary substance abuse literature suggests that psychosocial treatment methods
      need to include a range of learning approaches that allow for visual-sensory processing, in
      addition to traditional verbal-based processing. Integrated multi-modal interventions are
      needed to offer opportunities for activation of these different brain regions to facilitate
      cognitive-affective balance in behavioral decision-making.
