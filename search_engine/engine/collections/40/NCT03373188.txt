    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      To evaluate the effect of the anti-SEMA4D monoclonal antibody VX15/2503 (VX15/2503) alone and
      VX15/2503 in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors, ipilimumab or nivolumab, on the
      immune profile in the tumor microenvironment and in peripheral blood.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      To extend the previously reported safety profile of single agent VX15/2503 to the combination
      of VX15/2503 and immune checkpoint inhibitors, ipilimumab or nivolumab, in patients with
      pancreatic and colorectal cancer.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients are randomized to 1 of 4 arms.

      ARM I: Patients undergo surgery.

      ARM II: Patients receive anti-SEMA4D monoclonal antibody VX15/2503 intravenously (IV) over 60
      minutes on day 1. Patients then proceed to surgery 22-36 days after drug administration.

      ARM III: Patients receive anti-SEMA4D monoclonal antibody VX15/2503 IV over 60 minutes and
      ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes on day 1. Patients then proceed to surgery 22-36 days after
      drug administration.

      ARM IV: Patients receive anti-SEMA4D monoclonal antibody VX15/2503 IV over 60 minutes and
      nivolumab IV over 60 minutes on day 1. Patients then proceed to surgery 22-36 days after drug
      administration.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 90 days and then every 12
      weeks thereafter.
