      I. Describe the patterns and levels of 18F-EF5 in Stage 1 - 4 de novo HNSCC of the oral
      cavity, oropharynx and larynx.

      II. Determine whether the 18F-EF5 PET images are predictive of patient outcome (event-free
      survival; EFS and overall survival; OS).

      III. Determine whether any statistically significant prognostic relationships found in the
      corresponding grant are independent of nodal status.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Explore the relationship between 18F-EF5 signal and other measures of hypoxia (serum OPN;
      HIF1alpha protein expression), proliferation (Ki67+ cells/high power field (HPF)), apoptosis
      and radiation resistance (pAkt expression).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo fluorine F 18-EF5 positron emission tomography imaging. Scans are performed
      180 minutes following injection.

      After completion of study, patients are followed at 2-4 weeks and 4-6 weeks.
