      initiated breast cancer screening (mammography), The Annenberg School of Communication at the
      University of Pennsylvania has created a personal breast cancer screening decision aid tool.
      This tool incorporates questions about a women's personal history of breast cancer and
      compares her to the average women her age in terms of breast cancer risk. The tool helps the
      women to understand the benefits and risks of breast cancer screening. This tool will be
      pilot tested using SSI to help develop the final version of the decision aid tool. The
      decision aid tool will then be implemented and tested in nine general internal medicine,
      family medicine, and OB/GYN practices within the University of Pennsylvania Health System.
