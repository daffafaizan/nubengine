      inclusion/exclusion criteria will be allocated to appropriate cohorts: 1) gastric cancer, 2)
      esophageal cancer and 3) hepatocellular carcinoma. Each cancer cohort group will be treated
      with two cycles of neoadjuvant immune checkpoint inhibitor of IMC-001 (1 cycle = 2 weeks)
      followed by curative resection and be followed up consecutively.

      The sample size of the study is determined based on a major pathologic response rate (primary
      endpoint) and by using Simon's single stage design from the subjects who receive preoperative
      neoadjuvant therapy of IMC-001.

      In each cancer cohort group, the null and alternative response rates are assumed as 5% and
      20%, respectively. This provides a power of 80% when calculating the difference between major
      pathologic response rates of 5% and 20% in two-tailed significance level of 0.153 (Type I
      error[two-tailed] of 15.3%). In order to reject the null hypothesis, at least two major
      pathological respondents are needed among 14 assessable subjects for each cancer cohort.
      After choosing the margin of safety as 10%, each cancer cohort will require 16 subjects and
      therefore a total of 48 subjects will be enrolled into the study.
