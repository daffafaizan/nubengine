      I. To improve the treatment of patients with prostate cancer utilizing diagnostic
      multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and MRI-guided prostate biopsy combined
      with molecular and clinical data to help determine the extent of prostate cancer and risk of
      disease progression.

      II. To determine the relative accuracy of transrectal MRI-guided versus ultrasound-guided
      biopsy for the diagnosis of prostate cancer in patients with an appropriate dominant target
      lesion at multiparametric MRI, using pooled cancer diagnoses by either MRI-guided or
      ultrasound-guided biopsy as the reference standard.

      III. To determine the proportion of positive transrectal MRI-guided biopsies that demonstrate
      a higher Gleason score than contemporaneous transrectal ultrasound guided biopsy.

      IV. To determine the management impact of transrectal MRI-targeted biopsy results as compared
      to transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided systematic biopsy results.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive gadodiamide intravenously (IV) and undergo a diagnostic multiparametric
      endorectal MRI. Patients with lesions visible on the diagnostic multiparametric endorectal
      MRI undergo transrectal MRI-guided biopsy within 2 weeks of diagnostic multiparametric
      endorectal MRI. Patients then undergo TRUS-guided biopsy per standard clinical care
      approximately 2 weeks after transrectal MRI-guided biopsy.
