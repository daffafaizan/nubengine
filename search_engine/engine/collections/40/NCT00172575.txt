      nodules larger than 1cm indicative of malignancy or with indeterminate finding according to
      morphology criteria have to be defined by invasive methods such as biopsy or surgical
      excision, and benign pathology makes up 20-50% of those resected pulmonary lesions. The
      lesions not receiving surgical intervention often need imaging follow-up on a regular basis
      for a long period of time to monitor the stability of the finding.

      There are many reports regarding the MRI perfusion analysis of neoplasms from many organs,
      including bone marrow, liver, breast, cervix, and they stressed not only on comparison
      between benignity and malignancy, but also on monitoring the treatment outcomes after
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy, radiation therapy or anti-angiogenic agent therapy [7-15]. Dynamic
      contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE MRI) is not a standard examination for SPN, but there have been
      some data regarding the differentiation between malignant and benign SPN using DCE MRI, with
      MRI offering higher specificity compared to dynamic CT scan [6, 7, 16]. It was also reported
      that DCE MRI could delineate kinetic and morphologic differences in tumor angiogenesis and
      perfusion characteristics between malignant and benign pulmonary lesions with relatively high
      accuracy [7, 16]. The purpose of our study is to determine whether DCE MRI analysis of tumor
      angiogenesis and perfusion can be used as a reliable modality to differentiate benign from
      malignant SPN before surgical intervention, using kinetic model derived from DCE MRI, and
      further correlate if there is any positive correlation between angiogenesis factor (vascular
      endothelial growth factor VEGF, microvessel density MVD); and if the perfusion parameters
      from DCE MRI can predict patients' outcomes and survival.
