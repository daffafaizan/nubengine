      salivary gland US, and QoL surveys of participants without head and neck cancer (HNC) to
      determine standard values. The investigators will then compare this to the salivary
      composition and viscoelasticity of participants with treated HNC.

      Additionally, the investigators will examine the paracrine factors of marrow MSCs in order to
      prove a hypothesis that paracine factors constitutively expressed by marrow MSCs [Wnts,
      fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), GDNF and others] will directly influence the biology of
      dormant salivary gland stem cells following intraglandular transplantation and allow for
      functional recovery following RT.

      Primary Objective

        -  To determine the feasibility of in vitro expansion of marrow-derived MSCs from HNC
           patients to >50 million cells.

      Secondary Objectives

        -  To assess the stability of salivary function in HNC patients using quality-of-life (QoL)
           questionnaires and salivary composition analysis.

        -  To assess the stability of salivary gland size as measured by ultrasound.

      Correlative Objectives

        -  To compare assess the secretome profile of MSCs from HNC patients treated with radiation
           or, chemoradiation, or previously untreated.

        -  To compare the salivary composition, viscoelasticity, salivary gland ultrasound, and QoL
           of HNC patients to non-HNC patients
