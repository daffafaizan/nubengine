      with multiple femoral venous access sites. All femoral venous access sites will be closed
      using the Cardiva Mid-Bore VVCS. Subjects will be prospectively evaluated for eligibility in
      the three study groups in order to answer specific research questions related to safety and
      effectiveness of the device as it relates to the use of peri-procedural urinary catheters,
      protamine for reversal of heparin, and same calendar day discharge in a select group of
      procedure types.
