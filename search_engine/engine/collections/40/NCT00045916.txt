      whether patients treated with ECT should receive concurrent treatment with antidepressant
      medications, and the relative efficacy and side effects of high dosage right unilateral (RUL)
      ECT compared to low dosage bilateral (BL) ECT.

      This study has 2 phases. In Phase I, patients are randomized to receive nortriptyline,
      venlafaxine (Effexor), or placebo while they simultaneously receive either high dosage RUL
      ECT or low dosage BL ECT. Patients have an electrocardiogram (EKG), a chest x-ray, medical
      and neurological examinations, and blood tests. Memory function is assessed before and after
      ECT. Whenever feasible, patients are withdrawn from all prior psychotropic medication before
      the start of ECT. ECT is administered 3 times per week to inpatients and twice a week to
      outpatients. Patients continue ECT until they are asymptomatic or until there is a plateau in
      improvement over 2 treatments.

      Patients who respond to ECT enter Phase II and add lithium to either nortriptyline or
      venlafaxine within 1-3 days of the last ECT. Clinical and side effect evaluations and blood
      level determinations are conducted weekly for the first month, every 2 weeks until Week 12,
      and every 4 weeks for the remaining 12 weeks. Following any indication of relapse, patients
      are monitored more intensively and are re-evaluated within 1 week. The neurocognitive battery
      is readministered to all patients at 2 and 6 months after the acute ECT course, regardless of
      ECT clinical outcome.
