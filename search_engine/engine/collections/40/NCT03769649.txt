        -  The CelluTite - based on a minimally invasive, temperature-controlled
           Radiofrequency-assisted lipolysis (RFAL) technology. RF energy is applied using a
           handpiece with 2 electrodes: internal active electrode with spatula-shaped tip and
           external electrode.

        -  The Morpheus8 - designed to deliver RF energy to the skin surface in a fractional manner
           via an array of 24-electrode pins.
