      attributable to laryngopharyngeal reflux (i.e. the reflux of stomach acid to the level of the
      larynx). It is unclear what role laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR) has in producing throat
      symptoms and its relationship to laryngeal pathology. LPR may be more carefully diagnosed if
      knowledge could be obtained regarding the presence of esophageal manifestations of reflux of
      stomach acid. Although LPR may occur in the absence of esophageal manifestations, the
      presence may make this diagnosis more probable. If so, therapy can be more carefully
      directed.

      Using a flexible endoscope, otolaryngologists perform transnasal flexible laryngoscopy. This
      requires only topical anesthesia and occurs in the clinic setting. The small caliber
      transnasal esophagoscope was developed in recent years and is performed in a similar manner.
      It can provide key information regarding esophageal pathology. This obviates the need for
      administration of anesthesia (i.e. other than the topical, non-sedating agent). Transnasal
      flexible laryngoscopy is considered to be the standard of care for evaluation of the larynx.
      Transnasal esophagoscopy is an extension of this standard of care.

      There are a number of studies demonstrating the safety and utility of transnasal
      esophagoscopy in humans. Typically these studies are composed of retrospectively on a select
      group of patients. Additionally the TNE findings are reviewed by one medical discipline. This
      study will be the first prospective analysis of TNE in which the findings will be reviewed in
      a multidisciplinary manner (i.e. otolaryngologists and gastroenterologist). Also, the
      population involved will be more general than previous studies, representing a myriad of
      throat symptoms.
