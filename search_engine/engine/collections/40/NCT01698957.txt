      blood flow through the uterus and placenta. Historically, women with growth restricted
      fetuses or oligohydramnios have been placed on bed rest. Unfortunately, this treatment
      modality has met with only limited success. Cardiologists have long recognized the simple act
      of making a fist or otherwise occluding blood flow through a limb dramatically increases a
      person's peripheral vascular resistance. If maternal peripheral resistance can be increased,
      perhaps the increased differential between the maternal peripheral vascular resistance and
      that of the uteroplacental unit will increase flow through the uterus and placenta.
