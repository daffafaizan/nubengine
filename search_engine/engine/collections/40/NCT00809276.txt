      transplantation (BMT). BMT has developed over several decades of research on both animal and
      human subjects as an effective treatment of various malignant and nonmalignant hematologic
      diseases. Many hematologic malignancies can be successfully treated with a combination of
      high-dose chemotherapy or chemo-radiotherapy and transplantation of allogeneic bone marrow or
      peripheral blood stem cells (alloBMT)

      However, a possible side effect of BMT is graft versus host disease (GVHD). GVHD occurs when
      cells of the donor's immune system, which are present in the bone marrow, attack the BMT
      recipient's normal tissue. Prevention of GVHD is important for the success of the bone marrow
      transplant. This research is being done to find the most effective and least toxic way to
      prevent GVHD after BMT
