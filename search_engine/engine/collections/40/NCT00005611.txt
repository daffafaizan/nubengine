      limiting toxicities, and safety of BMS-188787 in patients with nonhematologic malignancies.
      II. Determine the plasma pharmacokinetics of BMS-188797 in these patients. III. Describe any
      antitumor activity of this treatment in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive BMS-188797 IV over 1 hour.
      Treatment continues every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of BMS-188797 until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2
      of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicities. Patients are followed every 4 weeks until
      toxicities resolve, and then at the investigator's discretion.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study over 12-18
      months.
