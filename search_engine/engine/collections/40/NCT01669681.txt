    
      The following direct medical costs will be collected according to the point of view of the
      Social Security on a duration of 2 years:

        -  Hospitalizations (valuation from the GHS + medicines except GHS)Â· Consultations
           (valuation AM)

        -  Complementary(additional) examinations except hospitalization (valuation AM)

        -  Pharmacy (valuation AM)

        -  Transport (valuation AM)The estimate of average costs will be made with a reliable
           interval for 95 %.

      The average cost by patient of the care will be calculated for every year of the follow-up.
      Relationship individual cost-efficiency: by analogy with the studies cost-efficiency
      comparative clauses, the investigators shall calculate a relationship cost-efficiency at the
      individual level as follows: (cost-year2 - cost-year1) / (efficiency-year2 - efficiency-year
      1). Differences in these relationships will be looked for between various groups by tests of
      comparisons of averages.The construction of patients' clusters will be made according to the
      algorithm of the study SARP but also by using techniques statistics of classification non
      supervising to define our own algorithm. Variables used on our algorithm will include the
      relationship cost efficiency individual in addition to the clinical variables. The temporal
      stability of the relationship cost efficiency will be analyzed. The risk factors of a
      modification of this relationship will be looked for.
