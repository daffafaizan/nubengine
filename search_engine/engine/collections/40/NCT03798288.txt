      with an individually tailored weekly plan of suggested activities to use in their
      self-management of low back pain.

      The selfBACK system constitutes a data-driven decision support system that uses case-based
      reasoning to capture and reuse participant cases to suggest the most suitable self-management
      plan for participants. The system is an intelligent system delivering self-management plans
      tailored to individual participant characteristics. Information about participant
      characteristics is collected via a (baseline) questionnaire, weekly self-reports via the app
      on symptom progression etc., and a wristband that detect daily number of steps. The weekly
      plans are presented in an app to participants.

      The weekly plan includes three categories of content;

        1. information/education

        2. recommended daily number of steps

        3. recommended strength and flexibility exercises

      Outcomes are collected as baseline, 6 weeks, 3, 6, 9 months.
