      surgical opening established by bringing the end or a loop of the ileum to discharge directly
      outside the body. This is typically done when part or the entire colon is removed because of
      IBD, cancer, or familial adenomatous polyposis. Reversal of this procedure, an ileostomy
      closure, may be done if possible to reconnect the ileum to the remaining colon and allow
      normal bowel movements again. This study looked at the outcomes for these surgeries in
      patients who were seen and operated on by the investigators. Patients were identified from
      the files and schedules of the investigators, and Epic was used to collect the information
      needed to determine perioperative clinical characteristics and post-operative outcomes. This
      data was kept in a secure electronic database, with identifiers removed as soon as all of the
      data was collected for a patient.
