      before and after a 4 hour insulin clamp ( protocol A) and before and after a mixed meal
      (protocol B). Then subjects will be randomized into 2 groups: Group 1 will undergo a 12 week
      intervention of Empagliflozin, and Group 2 will do 12 weeks of Placebo. The intervention will
      be single blinded. At the end of the 12 week intervention subjects will repeat protocol A and
      B.

      The study's primary objective is to assess whether, compared to placebo, 12 weeks of
      Empagliflozin improves post-absorptive or postprandial insulin action to enhance myocardial
      perfusion (MP) and whether changes of MP correlate with improved glucose variability or
      postprandial hyperglycemia
