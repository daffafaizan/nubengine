      two stool samples one for the stool DNA test and the other for the commercially available FIT
      assay, and a single blood sample for the blood mRNA test. Subjects will undergo colonoscopy
      within 6 months of enrollment. Representative histopathology slides from tissue biopsied or
      excised during colonoscopy and those from subsequent definitive surgery may be retrieved in
      order to be evaluated by pathologists to confirm the diagnosis and staging.
