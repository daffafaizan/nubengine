        -  Determine the efficacy of gemcitabine, dexamethasone, and cisplatin in patients with
           relapsed or refractory Hodgkin's disease or aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

        -  Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxicity of this regimen in these two patient
           populations.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to disease (Hodgkin's
      disease vs non-Hodgkin's lymphoma).

      Patients receive oral dexamethasone on days 1-4, cisplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1, and
      gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to 6
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 4 weeks, 3 months, and then every 3 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 44-88 patients (22-44 per stratum) will be accrued for this
      study within 4-10 months.
