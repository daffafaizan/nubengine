    
      The study is a randomized, single-blind, multi-center, placebo-controlled trial to
      preliminarily evaluate the efficacy and safety of PC-SOD, and to provide a basis for dose
      selection in the next stage of study.

      For each participant, the trial will be divided into the screening/treatment (screening and
      treatment conducted during the first visit, 0 d) and safety follow-up (1 - 30 d) stages.

      The study will screen 120 eligible subjects. After successful screening, the subjects will be
      randomly assigned into four groups of equal size, including the 40 mg PC-SOD, 80 mg PC-SOD,
      160 mg PC-SOD and placebo control groups. Subjects in each group will be administered the
      corresponding intervention, followed by PCI treatment. During the safety follow-up stage, the
      subjects will receive basic treatment based on Guidelines for Management of Patients with
      ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. Treatments will include dual anti-platelet
      therapy, beta-blockers, ACEI/ARB (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/ angiotensin
      receptor blocker), statins, anticoagulants, and so on.

      By comparing the efficacy and safety endpoints of patients in the experimental and placebo
      control groups, the study aims to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy and safety of different
      doses of PC-SOD in reducing myocardial reperfusion injury.
