      diagnosed by hand and other sidedness, including footedness, eyedness and earedness. study is
      aimed to investigate if chewing side preference (CSP) can be used as another indicator of
      hemispheric laterality in healthy adults. Healthy volunteers with no oral/dental problems
      with Angle I occlusion relationship and without any missing teeth will be included in the
      study. The CSP will be determined with the visual analog scale (VAS), which is the highly
      reliable method. Laterality test will be used to determine the preferred side for hands,
      feet, ears and eyes.
