      on inhibitory learning is effective in reducing panic symptoms. The secondary objective is to
      study if the protocol is feasible and acceptable. Secondary objective is measured is examined
      on 1) number of participants completing the study protocol, 2) participants' satisfaction
      with the treatment, 3) therapists' ratings of acceptability. The aim of this study is to
      assess the feasibility, and pilot the design and delivery of a RCT that will subsequently
      form the framework for a larger RCT to evaluate the effectiveness of an exposure protocol
      based on inhibitory learning.

      Trial Design: Randomized controlled pilot study with two groups randomly assigned to either
      Internet-based exposure therapy based on the principles of inhibitory learning or
      Internet-based exposure therapy based on the principles of habituation Duration: Eight weeks
      Primary Endpoint: Change in panic symptoms from baseline to Week 8. Efficacy Parameters:
      Panic Disorder Severity Scale - Self rated (PDSS-SR) Safety Parameters: Adverse Events is
      assessed weekly via the internet. Description of Trial Subjects: Patients > 18 years old with
      a PDSS-SR score more than 6 points Number of Subjects: 80
