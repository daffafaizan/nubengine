      moderate ARDS. This study will be multicentric between the University Hospital of Amiens and
      intensive care of Lens, intensive care of Bethune and intensive care of Arras. All patients
      in intensive care and severe, moderate ARDS will be included in this study. All patients will
      benefit from Lung ultrasound (LUS) with a mapping of each lung looking for normal or
      pathological lung profiles, as well as a measurement of esophageal pressure (Peso) at rest. A
      "PEP titration pulmonary opening" (PEP-OP) test using a recruitment maneuver was then
      performed in all patients followed by a new LUS and Peso measurement.
