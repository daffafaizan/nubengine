    
      This is a Phase 2b, two-arm, open-label, multicenter study of Sd (selinexor 100, 80 or 60 mg)
      in combination with carfilzomib, or pomalidomide in patients with MM previously treated with
      carfilzomib or pomalidomide respectively, and refractory to prior treatment. An additional
      exploratory arm will focus on patients treated with SD in combination with daratumumab.

      This study will enroll approximately 96 patients overall (43 in each of the arms and 10
      additional patients in the exploratory arm. Patients will be assigned to the respective arms
      based on their previous treatment.

      Patients who are relapsed or refractory to their current carfilzomib-based regimen will be
      enrolled on Arm 1 and will receive the following treatment regimen on a 28-day cycle:

      Carfilzomib 56 mg/m2 on days 1, 8 and 15. They will also receive dexamethasone 40 mg (or 20
      mg if patient is ≥ 75 years old) once weekly and Selinexor 80 mg on days 1, 8 and 15.

      Patients who are relapsed or refractory to their current pomalidomide-based regimen will be
      enrolled on Arm 2 and will receive the following treatment regimen on a 28-day cycle:

      Pomalidomide 4 mg po daily for 21 days combined with Dexamethasone 40 mg (or 20 mg if patient
      is ≥ 75 years old) once weekly and Selinexor 60 mg days 1, 8 and 15.

      For arms 1 and 2, 13 patients will be accrued in each arm in the first stage. If there are 3
      or fewer responses in these 13 patients, the study will be stopped. Otherwise, 30 additional
      patients will be accrued for a total of 43 (in each arm).

      Finally, in the exploratory arm, we will enroll up to 10 patients who are relapsed or
      refractory to their current daratumumab-based regimen. Patients enrolled on the exploratory
      arm will receive the following treatment regimen on a 28-day cycle:

      Daratumumab on current schedule (16 mg/kg IV days 1,8,15,22 for cycles 1-2; days 1 and 15 for
      cycles 3-6; day 1 for cycle 7 and on) combined with Dexamethasone 40 mg once weekly (or 20 mg
      if patient is ≥ 75 years old) and Selinexor 100 mg once weekly.

      The Investigator may remove a patient from study treatment using criteria described in
      Section 10.2. Patients may decide to discontinue study treatment for any reason. Patients who
      elect to discontinue study treatment should be encouraged to continue in the study so that
      follow-up information on disease progression, other antineoplastic therapy, symptoms and
      survival status may be obtained. However, patients may elect to withdraw consent and decline
      further participation in the trial at any time.

      The Investigator must determine the primary reason for a patient's discontinuation of study
      treatment and record this information on the electronic case report form (eCRF). Patients who
      are prematurely withdrawn from study treatment are not eligible to re-initiate study
      treatment on this protocol at a later date.
