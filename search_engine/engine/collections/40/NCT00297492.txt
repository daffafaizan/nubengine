      cessation. There is evidence from some small studies that gradually reducing the number of
      cigarettes per day smoked may increase success in quitting. In this study, we will randomize
      smokers who want to quit smoking in the next 30 days to one of three groups: gradual
      reduction, abrupt cessation, and minimal intervention.
