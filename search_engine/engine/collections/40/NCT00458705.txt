        -  Determine the efficacy and safety of bortezomib, pegylated doxorubicin hydrochloride
           liposome, and dexamethasone followed by thalidomide and dexamethasone with or without
           bortezomib in patients with symptomatic high-risk or primary resistant multiple myeloma.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive BDD comprising bortezomib IV on days 1, 4, 8, and 11; pegylated
      doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome IV over 60-90 minutes on day 4; and oral dexamethasone on
      day 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, and 12. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 3 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients achieving response to BDD receive oral thalidomide on days 1-28 and oral
      dexamethasone on days 1-4, 9-12, and 17-20. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 2 courses in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients experiencing stable or progressive disease on BDD receive oral thalidomide on days
      1-28; oral dexamethasone on days 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, 12, and 17-21; and bortezomib IV on
      days 1, 4, 8, and 11. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 2 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.
