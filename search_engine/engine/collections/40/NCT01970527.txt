      I. To determine feasibility and immune-related clinical responses associated with SBRT when
      given in conjunction with ipilimumab.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine late toxicity and immune pharmacodynamic changes after SBRT followed by
      ipilimumab.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo a total of 3 fractions of stereotactic body radiotherapy between days 1-13.
      Patients then receive ipilimumab intravenously (IV) every 3 weeks. Treatment repeats every 3
      weeks for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up within 60 days, and then every
      effort will be made to obtain records of patients during this follow up, and permission will
      be sought for the investigators and/or study team to re-contact the patient directly with
      regard to health status and toxicity.
