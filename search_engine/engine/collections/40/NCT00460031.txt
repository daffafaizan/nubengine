      Primary

        -  Determine the objective response frequency in patients with hormone-refractory
           progressive prostate cancer treated with ketoconazole, hydrocortisone, and lenalidomide.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the effect of this regimen on time to clinical progression in these patients.

        -  Determine the safety of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the effects of this regimen on serum cytokines, including tumor necrosis
           factor-alpha, basic fibroblast growth factor, plasma soluble interleukin (IL)-2
           receptor, IL-8, and IL-12, as well as serum vascular endothelial growth factor levels in
           these patients.

        -  Determine the co-stimulatory effects of this regimen on dendritic cells and
           CD4-positive, CD25-positive, T-regulatory cells in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a nonrandomized, open-label study.

      Patients receive oral ketoconazole 3 times daily and oral hydrocortisone twice daily on days
      1-28 and oral lenalidomide once daily on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients undergo blood collection periodically during study for evaluation of prostate
      cancer-specific immune response. Blood samples are assessed by serum analysis, flow
      cytometry, real-time PCR, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay techniques to detect and
      quantify different cytokines, antiangiogenic markers, dendritic cells, and specific
      T-regulatory cells.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed at 30 days.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 34 patients will be accrued for this study.
