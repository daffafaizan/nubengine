    
      prospective, randomized, open, multicentre study was performed between 1997 and 1999 in 16
      French intensive care units. Patients were enrolled within 24 hours of development of the
      first organ failure related to a new septic insult. They were randomized to group 1 (HF), who
      received haemofiltration for a 96 hr period, or group 2 (C) who were managed conventionally.
      The primary end-point was the number, severity and duration of organ failures at 14 days, as
      evaluated by the SOFA score, on an intention-to-treat analysis. Strict guidelines were
      provided to perform continuous haemofiltration under the same conditions and objectives in
      all centres.
