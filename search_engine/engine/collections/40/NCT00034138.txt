      patients with Stage III/IV epithelial ovarian cancer. The study will compare the
      pharmacokinetic profile of OvaRex MAb-B43.13 ascites fluid product and OvaRex MAb-B43.13 cell
      culture product. The study will also evaluate the safety of the cell culture product and the
      immune responses in patients following treatment. The study is being conducted in three
      phases:

        1. The pharmacokinetic assessment phase will include at least 24 patients, who will be
           randomized into two treatment groups to receive a single 2 mg dose of either ascites
           fluid product or cell culture product.

        2. The treatment phase will continue administration of two more monthly doses (weeks 4 and
           8) and all patients will receive cell culture product. Study patients will be followed
           for safety and immune response through week 20.

        3. The continuation phase will continue administration of cell culture product at the
           discretion of the investigator on a quarterly schedule for up to 104 weeks in eligible
           patients who tolerate therapy. Patients who continue treatment will be followed for
           serious adverse events and all patients will be followed for survival for up to 2 years
           after first treatment.
