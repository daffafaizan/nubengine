      disease, in the United States and abroad. Patients who suffer from co-morbid depression and
      alcohol abuse/dependence have illnesses that are more severe, persistent and costly than
      people with either depression or an alcohol use disorder alone. The treatment of these
      patients remains controversial. Several studies have demonstrated that antidepressants can be
      safe and efficacious in the treatment of depression in people who continue to drink, and it
      is now considered the standard of care to provide such treatment. Other studies have shown
      that pharmacotherapy with naltrexone or acamprosate can help reduce drinking in alcoholics
      without co-morbid depression. A logical extension of these findings would be to study the
      treatment of depressed alcoholics with dual pharmacotherapy, combining an anti-depressant
      with a medication aimed at treating the alcohol use disorder. We will conduct a randomized,
      double-blind, placebo controlled trial of escitalopram plus acamprosate and behavioral
      treatment vs. escitalopram plus placebo and behavioral treatment in 20 depressed alcoholics.
      Outcome measures will include depression, alcohol use and global functioning.
