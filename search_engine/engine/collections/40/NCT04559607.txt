    
      This is a multicentric open-labal trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of transarterial
      chemoembolization (TACE) in combination with Camrelizumab and Apatinib versus TACE in
      patients with intermediate- and advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The primary
      hypotheses are that TACE in combination with Camrelizumab and Apatinib is superior to TACE
      alone with respect to progression-free survival (PFS).
