      of 36 months with a median overall survival of more than 6 years. The main toxicity of this
      therapy is related to carmustine-induced pneumonitis or interstitial pneumonitis (IP). This
      complication is related to the dose of carmustine. Institutional experience in myeloma
      patients using this dose of carmustine indicates an incidence of IP of34%.

      There have been recent studies evaluating the role of tandem autologous transplants for
      patients with multiple myeloma. These trials were based upon the hypothesis that performing
      tandem high-dose therapy regimens would lead to increased tumor cell kill, decreased tumor
      burden and an improvement in overall survival. Our results with high-dose sequential therapy
      including the dose-intense carmustine/melphalan transplant demonstrates similar median EFS
      and overall survival (OS) when compared with the results of tandem transplant approaches.The
      proposed trial will continue to use a high-dose sequential transplant approach, however, we
      will use a reduced dose of carmustine which we expect to be associated with a lower incidence
      of IP.
