    
      Subjects 11-25 years of age will be randomized to receive either the meningococcal vaccine
      GSK134612 or Menactra®. An additional non-randomized group of subjects aged 10 years (< 11
      years of age) will be enrolled to receive meningococcal vaccine GSK134612 only (At the time
      the study begun, Menactra® was only licensed in the United States for individuals above 11
      years of age and therefore could not be used as a control vaccine in subjects less than 11
      years old).

      This study will be single-blind for the subjects 11 to 25 years of age and open for the
      subjects 10 to < 11 years of age.
