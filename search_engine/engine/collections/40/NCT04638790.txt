      The study aims to assess the efficacy and safety of three different approaches to first line
      chemotherapy for classical Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL):

        1. Early favourable (stages I-IIA without unfavorable risk factors). Patients will receive
           two courses of standard ABVD (Adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine).
           Those with a PET-2 (positron emission tomography) negative scan (Deauville Score 1-3)
           will proceed with radiotherapy on initially involved site (20 Gy). Those with a PET-2
           Deauville score 4 will proceed with additional 2 ABVD courses. After that, those with a
           PET-4 negative scan (Deauville Score 1-3) will proceed with radiotherapy on initially
           involved site (30 Gy). In case of PET-4 positive scan after 4 ABVD cycles (Deauville
           score 4-5) patients will be planned to perform the biopsy and in case of positive
           results, proceed to high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplantation
           (HDT with ASCT). In case of negative results of the biopsy, they will proceed with
           additional 2 ABVD courses and restage again. Those with a PET-6 negative scan (Deauville
           Score 1-3) will proceed with radiotherapy on initially involved site (30 Gy). In case of
           PET-6 positive scan (Deauville score 4-5) patients will be proceeded to HDT with ASCT.

           Those with a PET-2 Deauville score 5 after 2 ABVD courses will be planned to perform the
           biopsy and in case of positive results, proceed to HDT with ASCT. In case of negative
           results of the biopsy they will proceed with additional 2 ABVD courses and restage
           again. Those with a PET-4 negative scan (Deauville Score 1-3) will proceed with
           radiotherapy on initially involved site (30 Gy). In case of PET-4 positive scan
           (Deauville score 4-5) patients will be proceeded to HDT with ASCT.

        2. Early unfavorable (stages IA-B, IIA bulky and/or extranodal lesions, patients younger 50
           years). Patients will receive two courses of EACODD-14 (etoposide 100 mg/m2 days 1-3,
           doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 day 1, cyclophosphamide 650 mg/m2 day 1, vincristine 1,4 mg/m2 day
           8, dacarbazine 375 mg/m2 day 1, dexamethasone 20 mg days 1-3; cycle is repeated every 14
           days). Those with a PET-2 negative scan (Deauville Score 1-3) will be deescalated to 2
           courses of AVD (Adriamycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine) and consolidative radiotherapy
           on initially involved site (30 Gy). Those with a PET-2-positive scan (Deauville score
           4-5) will proceed with additional 2 EACODD-14 courses. After that, those with a PET-4
           negative scan (Deauville Score 1-3) will proceed with radiotherapy on initially involved
           site (30 Gy). In case of PET-4 positive scan after 4 EACODD-14 cycles (Deauville score
           4-5) patients will proceed with additional 2 EACODD-14 courses. After that, those with a
           PET-6 negative scan (Deauville Score 1-3) will proceed with radiotherapy on initially
           involved site (30 Gy). In case of PET-6 positive scan (Deauville score 4-5) patients
           will be proceeded to HDT with ASCT.

        3. Advanced stages (younger 50 years). Patients will receive two courses of EACODD-14.
           Those with a PET-2 negative scan (Deauville Score 1-3) will proceed with 4 additional
           courses of EACODD-14. After that, patients with residual tumor ˂ 4 cm, will stop the
           therapy and start the follow-up phase. Patients with residual tumor ≥ 4 cm, will undergo
           consolidative radiotherapy on residual tumor (30 Gy). Those with a PET-2-positive scan
           (Deauville score 4-5) will proceed with additional 4 additional courses of EACODD-14.
           After that, those with a PET-6 negative scan (Deauville Score 1-3) will proceed with
           radiotherapy on residual tumor ≥ 2,5 cm (30 Gy). In case of PET-6 positive scan
           (Deauville score 4-5) patients will be proceeded to HDT with ASCT.
