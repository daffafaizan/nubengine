      study. The first biopsy will be done prior to receiving the participants' assigned treatments
      as a part of their cancer care and the second biopsy will be done about 3-7 days after
      starting treatment. Participants who will undergo neoadjuvant treatment and then surgery,
      will also have their tumor tissue collected during surgery. Participants whose disease
      worsens while on treatment will also be asked to have an additional, optional tumor biopsy.

      The tumor tissue samples will be studied to look at certain proteins and enzymes, including
      enzymes called kinomes, that may be important in determining response and resistance to the
      treatment that participants will receive as a part of their cancer care.
