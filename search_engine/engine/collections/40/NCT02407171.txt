      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of SBRT when given to patients previously and subsequently
      exposed to MK-3475. Because the class of PD-1 inhibitory antibodies conveys a risk of
      pneumonitis, there will be two parallel dose escalation arms- Arm A will include SBRT targets
      in the lung parenchyma, and Arm B will be limited to targets outside the lung parenchyma.
      Each arm will be separately escalated, and two MTDs will be determined. The starting dose
      will be 3000 cGy in 5 fractions; there will be one dose escalation cohort (3000 cGy in 3
      fractions), and if necessary one dose de-escalation cohort (1000 cGy in a single fraction).
      If there is dose-limiting toxicity at the lowest cohort, that arm will be closed and SBRT to
      that site will be discontinued.

      The phase 2a portion of the study includes 2 expansion cohorts, for melanoma and NSCLC, with
      SBRT delivered at the MTD. The primary endpoint of this phase of the study is the overall
      response rate to post-SBRT MK-3475. Secondary endpoints include determining the time to
      progression, overall survival, and exploratory biomarkers.
