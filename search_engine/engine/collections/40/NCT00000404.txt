      set forth guidelines for managing osteoarthritis (OA). These guidelines emphasize a
      comprehensive approach toward nondrug treatment (e.g., patient education, exercise, social
      support) and a conservative approach to drug management to minimize the side effects of
      nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Unfortunately, few primary care physicians
      provide conservative, comprehensive care for OA as promoted in the recent rheumatology
      literature. Also, although researchers have studied individual elements of a comprehensive
      approach to OA care and largely validated them in isolation, no research support exists to
      suggest that uniformly adopting OA care guidelines will result in better patient outcomes
      and/or reduced costs of care.

      In this project, we will implement, in a controlled fashion, and evaluate a comprehensive
      plan for treating patients with knee OA by primary care physicians in a managed care
      environment. Comprehensive care for knee OA will be guided by a procedure designed to
      introduce and reinforce (a) an array of nondrug, self-care procedures intended to combat
      joint pain and preserve function and (b) a stepped protocol for drug management of knee pain
      that minimizes the risk of adverse side effects of NSAIDs.

      Participants will be 300 patients with a confirmed clinical diagnosis of knee OA who receive
      their medical care in a large health maintenance organization (HMO) in Indianapolis, Indiana.
      We will randomly allocate geographically discrete offices of the HMOs to experimental (OA
      care by algorithm) or control (routine OA care) conditions (150 subjects/group). Patients who
      enroll in the study at each location will receive care for knee OA for 1 year under the
      guidelines specified by random assignment.

      We will measure outcomes at baseline and 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months after enrollment,
      and outcomes will include joint pain, physical function, drug side effects, quality of life
      (i.e., general health status), satisfaction with OA care, and direct costs of medical care.
      We think that comprehensive care, as guided by our algorithms, will result in significant
      improvement in knee pain, physical function, and patient satisfaction, and lower direct costs
      compared to care delivered under routine circumstances.
