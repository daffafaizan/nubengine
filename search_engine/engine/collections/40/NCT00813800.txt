    
      Varenicline, a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor partial agonist, has been shown in two
      placebo-controlled trials to be efficacious for smoking cessation. Given the high prevalence
      of nicotine dependence in bipolar disorder and the high prevalence of sub-syndromal and
      syndromal depressive symptoms in bipolar disorder, this 12-week adjunctive varenicline open
      label trial will be conducted to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and safety of
      varenicline in bipolar depressed smokers. All subjects will receive individual behavioral
      counseling.

      Primary hypothesis: the abstinence rate for bipolar depressed patients will be 50%. Secondary
      hypothesis: At final visit, bipolar depressed patients who have achieved remission, defined
      as a Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) <8, will have a higher rate of tobacco
      abstinence than depressed patients who did not achieve remission (MADRS >/= 8).
