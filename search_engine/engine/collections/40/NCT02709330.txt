      Lunasin regimen) can decrease the rate of ALSFRS-S progression by 50% relative to matched
      historic controls.

      ALS is a devastating motor neuron disease that causes rapidly progressive muscle weakness,
      disability and premature death. In spite of a large number of attempted ALS trials, there are
      no significant disease-modifying therapies for this condition.

      It was recently reported that a patient with a validated diagnosis of ALS, had experienced
      dramatic objective improvement in speech, swallowing and limb strength while taking a
      supplement regimen containing Lunasin. Several other patients with ALS have also reported
      improvement on this Lunasin regiment, though records were not obtainable to validate these.

      The Lunasin regimen will consist of:

        -  LunaRich X Capsules

        -  Reliv NOW - a mixture of 'vitamins, minerals and super-powered antioxidants'

        -  Pro-Vantage - a mixture of 'soy protein, medium chain triglycerides, creatine, CoQ10 and
           supercharged amino acids'

      Dosages will be titrated up to target over the first 6 days. The subject will take the
      highest tolerated dosing for the remainder of the 12-month study.

      There are 3 in-clinic visits which occur at screening/baseline, Month 1 and Month 12. For
      Months 2-11, participants will make "virtual visits" by measuring their own ALSFRS-R score
      and weight and will record it in the PatientsLikeMe website. They will also self-report any
      perceived efficacy, compliance, adverse events and changes in concomitant medications.
