      and family histories and to collect blood specimen to obtain DNA. The Blood specimen and DNA
      will be processed by the Rutgers University Cell and DNA Repository (RUCDR) to rule out
      Familial Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia (MEN 1), and succinate dehydrogenase complex, subunit D
      (SDHD), gene inactivation thought to be associated with different types of carcinoid cancer.
