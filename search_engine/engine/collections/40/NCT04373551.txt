    
      The investigators propose: (1) to explore the HIV risk perceptions of AA women with recent
      PrEP use, AA women who are candidates for PrEP, and providers and identify preferences around
      patient-provider communication about HIV risk and PrEP services that address the needs of AA
      women.

      (2A) To systematically adapt a patient-provider communication tool to increase PrEP uptake at
      two FQHCs in rural Alabama, using an iterative implementation process; and (2B). To assess
      the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary impact of the patient-provider communication
      intervention on PrEP uptake among AA women and their providers in a pilot
      pre-/post-intervention design.

      As part of aim 2B), the investigators will also systematically document and evaluate reasons
      for declining a PrEP referral, reasons for incomplete referrals, reasons for failing to
      initiate PrEP after a successful referral, and ongoing PrEP use at 3/6 months post PrEP
      initiation among our sample.
