      physical and mental disabilities. A control group was added to compare the effect of the
      training with no training. Before the training period the participants were tested in
      relation to their physical status: weight, height, fat%, blood pressure, Aastrand test, chair
      stand test and waist circumference. In addition to this, the participants were instructed to
      wear an accelerometer to measure step and active minutes for 2-3 days a work.

      The staff at the day center, where the participants works in daytime, were responsible for
      the physical training 2 times/week for 8 weeks. The training was an hour of combined aerobic,
      strength, balance and flexibility training.

      The participants were tested after the training period using the same test-protocol as
      before.
