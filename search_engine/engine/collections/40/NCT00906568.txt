      the diagnosis is difficult to make. The disease presents with wheezing, pulmonary
      infiltrates, and bronchiectasis. The most important diagnostic parameters are asthmatic
      symptoms with obstruction, positive prick test, elevated total IgE, specific IgE and IgG to
      Aspergillus fumigatus, eosinophilia and radiological findings. Aspergillus fumigatus acts as
      an allergen Ig-E mediated allergy. Pathophysiological it is assumed that there are two
      different mechanisms of allergic inflammation. First, there is a direct effect of Aspergillus
      fumigatus proteases in the alveolar and bronchial epithelium with release of proinflammatory
      cytokines (IL-8, IL6, MCP-1) and consecutive chemotaxis of inflammatory cells. Second a CD4+
      Th2 response with release of IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13. Recently published studies suggest that
      Aspergillus spores cause the TH2-dependent inflammation directly. So-called Chitinases (part
      of innate immunity) induce massive IL-13 stimulation. Induction of chitinase activity (CHIT1)
      leads to an increased remodeling of the lung. It is currently unclear, to which extent
      Aspergillus-triggered bronchial inflammation in patients with CF is relevant.
