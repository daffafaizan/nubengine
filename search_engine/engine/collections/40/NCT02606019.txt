      A pilot study was conducted to evaluate the five of the biomarkers: neopterin, vascular
      endothelial growth factor (VEGF), thrombomodulin, Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule 1 (VCAM-1)
      and pentraxin 3 (PTX-3). VEGF and PTX-3 was the only two potential biomarkers in
      differentiating severe dengue from non-severe dengue cases. The analysis between severe
      dengue and non-severe dengue cases indicated that only VEGF was able to discriminate the two
      categories. Though VCAM-1 and PTX-3 were not statistically significant, the p-values were at
      the margin of the pre-determined p-value of less than 0.05.

      Hence, this study aims to evaluate VEGF and PTX-3 levels in differentiating severe dengue
      from non-severe dengue cases. The secondary objective is to evaluate the correlation of VEGF
      and PTX-3 levels with full blood count (platelet, white blood cell count and haematocrit) and
      liver function test (alanine aminotransferase and aspartate).

      This is a prospective cohort study in which the patient will be followed up from the day of
      presentation to the attending practitioner until the patient is discharged. The blood samples
      will be obtained daily during the follow-up. The demography and clinical final diagnosis will
      be obtained from the medical record of the patient.

      This study will aid triaging of dengue cases thereby reducing the need of unnecessary
      admission and better focused management to those might develop complication of dengue
      infection. This in turn reduces the workload and cost of the treating the dengue infection.
