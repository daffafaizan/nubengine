      group) and control (clinicians' order weaning group). Setting: Respiratory Intensive Care
      Unit (RICU). Subjects: Patients >18 yr, noninvasive mechanical ventilation >24 hours.
      Interventions and measurements: Study group (weaning as the protocol) and control group
      (weaning as the clinicians' order); recording of clinical variables at admission and during
      RICU stay, and end-point variables (noninvasive mechanical ventilation day, RICU and hospital
      stay, RICU mortality. Expected results: the protocol group's noninvasive mechanical
      ventilation days is less than clinicians' order group.
