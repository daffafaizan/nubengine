      repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) as a treatment for executive function
      deficits in individuals with autism spectrum disorder between 16 and 25 years of age. The
      study duration is approximately 3 months, with the rTMS sessions lasting for 4 weeks, 5 times
      a week, for about 1 hour each. Several scales will be used to assess for symptom severity and
      adaptive functioning. Cognition will be assessed using a validated battery.

      This study also involves a type of brain imaging known as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at
      the beginning and at the end of the 4 weeks of daily rTMS to better understand the effects of
      rTMS on brain structure and function. Investigators will measure the size and connections of
      different parts of the brain to assess brain structure and blood flow while participants are
      completing some basic tasks to asses brain function.
