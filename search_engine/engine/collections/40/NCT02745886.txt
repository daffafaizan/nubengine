    
      Blood samples will be obtained from all individuals. blood lipids, inflammation markers,
      insulin, glucose, leptin,adiponectin, ala aminotransferase, asp aminotransferase, creatine
      phosphokinase,lactate dehydrogenase, alkaline phosphatase,bilirubin, cyclo-oxygenase, citrate
      synthase, renal function, leukocyte telomere length ratio, and telomerase activity will be
      measured before and after the treatments.Also, hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp will be
      performed before and after the treatments. Muscle samples will be obtained by biopsy for 9
      individuals (3 cases from each group) at the end of the study. Microarray analysis will be
      performed for the gene expression profile from the muscle samples. Other protein expressions
      such asadenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), peroxisome
      proliferator-activated receptor coactivator 1a (PGC-1a) activity,will be checked by Western
      blot.
