      Primary

        -  To evaluate the efficacy of the CerviPrep™ device in delivering topical gemcitabine
           hydrochloride to the cervix

      Secondary

        -  To document any side effects directly attributed to local administration of gemcitabine
           hydrochloride.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo application of topical gemcitabine hydrochloride directly to the
      cervix using the CerviPrep™ drug delivery device during routine hysterectomy.

      Uterine vein and peripheral blood samples are obtained periodically to measure local and
      peripheral gemcitabine hydrochloride concentration levels in the blood. Local gemcitabine
      hydrochloride concentration levels are also measured in uterine tissue samples obtained from
      the surgical specimen after hysterectomy.

      Patients complete a self-reported symptom diary for the first 7 days after surgery for
      assessment of local and systemic side effects associated with topical administration of
      gemcitabine hydrochloride.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed at 2-4 weeks.
