      (ECG Interpretation and arrhythmia detection) to the VistaCenter platform, aiming to replace
      current telemetry monitoring equipment. The new technology, through the previous Mercy pilot
      study, has demonstrated greater accuracy in the detection of ventricular tachycardia patterns
      and other dysrhythmias/arrhythmias, as well as, reducing the volume of false alarms resulting
      in the mitigation of alarm fatigue experienced by bedside staff and monitor technicians.
