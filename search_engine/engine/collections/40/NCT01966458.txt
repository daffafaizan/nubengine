      subjects receiving improved blood pressure management to a control group (i.e., any
      FDA-approved LVAD for destination therapy). Secondary endpoints include: a comparison of
      stroke/TIA incidence to a reference observed in the original IDE clinical trial (HW004) that
      did not specify improved blood pressure management; and non-inferiority of stroke-free
      success on the originally implanted device to the control group. Subjects will be randomized
      to HeartWare® HVAD or control LVAD in a 2:1 ratio. Each subject receiving the HeartWare® HVAD
      or control LVAD is followed to the primary and secondary endpoints at 12 months, with a
      subsequent follow-up period extending to 60 months post-implant.
