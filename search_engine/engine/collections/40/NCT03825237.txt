      observed during sleep and wakefulness, respectively, the single definition for bruxism is
      recommended be "retired" in favour of 2 separate definitions. In this sense, the sleep
      bruxism is a masticatory muscle activity during sleep that is characterised as rhythmic
      (phasic) or non-rhythmic (tonic) and is not a movement disorder or a sleep disorder in
      otherwise healthy individuals .The diagnosis of sleep bruxism often is challenging and
      despite the use of questionnaires, clinical exams and portable devices, based on current
      knowledge, the polysomnography with audio-video recordings emerges as the gold-standard
      criteria for a definite sleep bruxism diagnosis.

      Included on the questionnaire there is a registration form, which contains: Sociodemographic:
      self-reported ethnicity, marital status, education level; Occupational: individuals were
      asked about work outside home, working hours; Clinical condition: body mass index, smoking;
      alcohol consumption; use of sleeping pills.

      Sleep Quality, was evaluated with the following questions: Sleep behavioral, how long does it
      take to sleep; restless sleep; nightmares; heartburn, obstructive sleep apnea by
      polysomnography. Bedtime, sleep time. Waking during the night, insomnia. Morning wake up,
      headache on waking; Lastly, Sleep structure data: sleep onset latency, rapid eye movement,
      sleep latency, wake time after sleep onset, total sleep time, sleep efficiency, non-rapid eye
      movement, sleep time in stages N1, N2, and N3, REM sleep time, arousal, arousal per hour,
      respiratory disturbance index, apnea-hypopnea index; and Epworth Sleepiness Scale.
