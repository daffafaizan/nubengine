      reinforcement procedure. In order to encourage engagement in study procedures and reduce
      dropout in the randomized sample, all participants will undergo a 4-week pre-randomization
      induction period. During the induction period, participants will be reinforced for providing
      urine-tests three times a week. Those who demonstrate study participation and need for
      treatment during the induction period will be randomized to receive treatment as usual and
      either 1) 12 weeks of CM for alcohol abstinence (assessed by Ethyl glucuronide immunoassay
      urine-test) AND weekly reinforcement for intensive outpatient addiction treatment attendance;
      or 2) 12 weeks of reinforcement for providing urine-samples and continued study involvement.
      Randomization will be used to assign participants to treatment conditions.

      The primary outcome will be changes in alcohol use assessed by Ehyl glucuronide immunoassay
      urine-tests, breath-tests, as well as self- and clinician-reported alcohol use. The secondary
      outcome will be changes in intensive outpatient group attendance assessed by intensive
      outpatient clinician-report, as well as administrative data sources, and self-report. Other
      outcomes will include: urine-tests and self-reported illicit drug use, psychiatric symptoms,
      other outpatient treatment utilization, HIV-risk, and nicotine use. All outcomes will be
      assessed [for 4-weeks prior to study enrollment (self-report, clinician ratings etc)] and
      throughout the 4-week induction, 12-week intervention, and 3-month follow-up periods.
