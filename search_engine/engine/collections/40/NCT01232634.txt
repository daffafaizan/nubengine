      more readily available in centres around the world. Given these characteristics of ultrasound
      it is an ideal imaging tool for early assessment of hemophilic joints in countries whose
      access to MRI is limited. Early evaluation of soft tissue changes in young hemophilic
      patients may lead to earlier interventions and better mid-term and long-term clinical
      outcomes. By this way the joint function of hemophilic patients can be preserved, saving
      their joints from severe arthropathy and offering them the possibility of a normal
      professional life in the society.
