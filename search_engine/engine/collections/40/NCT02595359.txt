      visual outcome, surgical complications do occur. The most feared complication is
      postoperative endophthalmitis which is an infectious condition caused by micro-organisms
      introduced to the interior of the eye during or after the surgical procedure.

      As endophthalmitis is an infection, it should be preventable by antibiotic treatment.

      Prophylactic antibiotic treatment can be given as topical treatment preoperatively, or during
      surgery directly into the anterior chamber, or as a subconjunctival, or it can be given as
      topical treatment postoperatively.

      The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the prophylactic effect of
      intracameral moxifloxacin for prevention of postcataract endophthalmitis.
