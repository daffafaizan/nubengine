      receptor antagonism on the severity of parkinsonian signs and dopaminomimetic drug-associated
      motor response complications in patients with mild to moderately advanced Parkinson's
      disease. In a controlled proof-of-principle clinical study, the acute efficacy of JP-1730
      will be assessed through the use of validated motor function scales. Safety will be monitored
      by means of frequent clinical evaluations and laboratory tests.
