    
      Profound Medical Inc. has developed a novel technology called the MRI-guided transurethral
      ultrasound therapy system. The technology is developed for patients with organ confined
      prostate cancer. The therapeutic endpoint of this technology is thermal coagulation of
      prostate tissue.

      The treatment is conducted completely within an MRI suite, which enables real-time
      temperature images of the heated region to be acquired as the ultrasonic treatment is
      delivered. Using MRI thermometry during treatment, dynamic temperature feedback control over
      the intensity of the ultrasound beams and rotation of the Ultrasound Applicator can shape the
      pattern of thermal coagulation accurately and precisely in the prostate gland, thereby
      reducing the risk of possible damage to important surrounding anatomy such as the rectum,
      urinary sphincters, neurovascular bundles and pelvic bone. This coagulation method,
      therefore, has the potential to have lower complication rates than conventional therapies.
