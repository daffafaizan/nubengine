      components and evaluate acute safety. Upon meeting the defined criteria, the Workflow Phase
      will be closed and further enrollment will be toward the Main Study Phase which includes the
      roll-in (the first 3 subjects enrolled at each site following the closure of the Workflow
      Phase) and Subpopulation Neurological Assessments (SNA) substudy subjects. SNA assessment is
      a prospective, non-randomized, controlled, acute assessment of two ablation devices to
      determine if intracerebral microemboli are generated during or immediately after
      radiofrequency ablation therapy for PAF. SNA subjects will remain and complete the Main Study
      Phase. However, SNA-control subjects will not be considered part of the Main Study Phase. All
      subjects, including the subjects enrolled under the Workflow Phase will be included in the
      Safety Cohort (evaluated for Primary Safety endpoint and all Secondary Safety endpoints).
