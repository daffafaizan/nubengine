    
      Protocol Synopsis: There is a link between early RSV infection and chronic respiratory
      morbidity.

      Hypothesis: Palivizumab administration may result in decreased AHR and lower respiratory
      morbidity.

      Primary objective: to evaluate prospectively the effect of palivizumab on airway reactivity
      (AHR) in children born at 29-32 weeks.

      Secondary objective: to assess prospectively the effect of palivizumab on respiratory
      morbidity airway inflammation and allergy in children born at 29-32 weeks.

      Inclusion criteria: premature babies 29-32 weeks of gestation born during 2007 and 2010.

      Exclusion criteria: Any mechanical ventilation or chronic diseases, e.g., bronchopulmonary
      dysplasia (BPD), cystic fibrosis (CF), congenital heart disease, congenital anomalies, known
      immunodeficiency, or receipt of other RSV investigative vaccines or therapies.

      Primary end points: Airway reactivity as assessed by methacholine challenge test with
      determination of PC20.

      Secondary end points: Respiratory morbidity as assessed by questionnaire and telephone
      interviews. Additionally, IGE, eosinophil count, and exhaled NO will be evaluated.

      Sample size: 74 participants; Group I - 37 premature babies at 29-32 weeks of gestation born
      during 2007-2008 (before approval of Synagis for this group in Israel). Group II - 37
      premature babies 29-32 weeks of gestation born during 2009-2010 (after approval of Synagis
      for this group in Israel).

      Statistics: A sample size of 37 patients was calculated as necessary to detect a difference
      of 0.5 SD in AHR for a 2-sided tail, with a power of 80%. Demographics and baseline
      characteristics will be compared using 1-way analysis of variance for quantitative variables
      and Fisher's exact test for categorical variables..
