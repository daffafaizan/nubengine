      promote platelet aggregation and stabilize the formation of fibrin thrombosis by maintaining
      the high pH environment in the stomach and inactivating pepsin. The effect of PPIs on
      ulcerative upper gastrointestinal bleeding was confirmed but it is not clear whether PPIs is
      applicable in esophagogastric variceal bleeding whose etiology and bleeding position are
      different from ulcerative upper gastrointestinal bleeding. There is lack of consensus and
      sufficient evidences to support to use PPIs in esophagogastric variceal bleeding in cirrhotic
      patients universally. Nevertheless, the use of PPIs in liver cirrhotic patients with
      gastroesophageal varices is common.
