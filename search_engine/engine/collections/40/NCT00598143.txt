    
      This study consists of two arms; both of which are observational studies of molecular
      assessments of risk for tobacco related cancer. Arm A of the protocol is a pilot
      crosssectional study that evaluates the feasibility of obtaining and testing a genetic marker
      of cancer susceptibility (UGT1A7 polymorphisms) in smokers. It also explores smokers'
      interest in and comprehension of genetic risk assessments as possible tools for increasing
      motivation for smoking cessation. The second arm of this protocol, Arm B, is an observational
      prospective evaluation of a putative noninvasive biomarker of tobacco smoke exposure -
      urinary prostaglandin E-metabolite (PGE-M) - in smokers motivated to reduce and/or cease
      smoking.
