    
      This is a randomized, multicenter, clinical trial in which 598 patients with advanced gastric
      cancer at high risk of peritoneal metastases are randomly allocated to receive either
      preoperative hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) plus gastrectomy (experimental
      group) or gastrectomy alone (control group). All patients, regardless of allocation, will
      additionally receive 4 cycles of FLOT4 chemotherapy (docetaxel 60 mg/m2, oxaliplatin 85
      mg/m2, leucovorin 200 mg/m2 and 5-fluorouracil 2600 mg/m2) before surgery Â± HIPEC and 4
      cycles of FLOT4 chemotherapy after gastrectomy. The main outcome is frequency of peritoneal
      recurrence by 6-months post-operative. Patients will be followed for 5 years and undergo
      additional evaluations at 6 months, 1 year, 3 and 5 years.

      The study will take place at 7 hospitals across Poland. All participating centers have the
      equipment and skills to perform all necessary procedures in this study. The below centers
      specialize in the treatment of stomach cancer with many documented years of experience. They
      are trained in the maintenance of a register, possess the skills to conduct appropriate
      research analyses and are equipped with a system for assessing the quality of both surgical
      and oncological treatment.
