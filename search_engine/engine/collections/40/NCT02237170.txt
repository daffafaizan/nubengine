        1. Establish the phenotype and frequency of circulating immune cell compartments in
           patients undergoing treatment with Sipuleucel-T.

        2. Determine the induction and the quality of prostate antigen-specific T cell immunity in
           patients undergoing treatment with Sipuleucel-T.

        3. Correlate whole-blood RNA transcript-based signatures with clinical outcomes in patients
           treated with Sipuleucel-T.

        4. Evaluate the cytokine and chemokine milieu in the peripheral blood pre- and
           post-treatment with Sipuleucel-T.
