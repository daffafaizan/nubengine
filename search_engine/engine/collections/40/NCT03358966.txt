      advances in treatment of CKD little is known about metabolic rate in renal disease. Increased
      knowledge about metabolic rate would have numerous potential benefits.

      Little is known of the effects of metabolic rate on kidney disease. This study was designed
      to define the relationship of metabolic rate with degree of kidney function.

      Study design and methods In an observational cohort study, the investigators studied Total
      Energy Expenditure in 80 patients with CKD stage 1-5 using the doubly-labelled water
      technique over a 14 day period. The group was divided such that half had stage 1-3 CKD and
      half stage 4-5. All subjects performed a comprehensive metabolic analysis including
      measurement of Resting Energy Expenditure using indirect calorimetry, bioimpedance, and body
      size measures. Physical activity was assessed using a Stanford 7 day recall questionnaire.

      Data Analysis The data analysed will include determining the relationship between level of
      kidney disease as measured by eGFR and energy expenditure measured as Resting Energy
      Expenditure and doubly-labelled water Total Energy Expenditure. This will be determined by
      regression analysis. Additionally, comparison will be made between subjects with
      early-moderate (CKD stage 1-3) and advanced (CKD stage 4-5) CKD.
