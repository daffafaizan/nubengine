      analysis of bone itself. skeletal dynamics and structure such as dual energy X-ray
      absorptiometry, quantitative central and peripheral computed tomography, geometry and size
      quantification, histomorphometry by standard and microCT methods, finite element analysis,
      biochemical bone markers, quantitative back scattered electron imaging, and Fourier Transform
      Infrared Spectroscopy.
