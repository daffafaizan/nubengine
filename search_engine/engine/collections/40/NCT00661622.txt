      hepatic artery every 4 weeks. GM-CSF (granulocyte-macrophage colony simulating factor) or
      normal saline will be injected into one of the liver arteries with an oily contrast dye,
      Ethiodol. This is followed by blockage of the artery with small pieces of gelatin sponge
      (embolization).
