      I. To determine whether intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) diffusion weighted imaging (DWI)
      can detect a difference between the changes in the diffusion related parameters in patients
      before and after chemotherapy between responders and nonresponders.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Use respiratory-triggered DWI and quantitative T2 maps for the evaluation of colorectal
      liver metastases (CLM) after treatment.

      II. Assess whether changes in these parameters correlate to pathologic treatment response
      (percent necrosis) determined on pathology.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo IVIM DWI over 10 minutes during standard of care MRI within 30 days of
      starting chemotherapy and after 4-6 cycles of preoperative chemotherapy.
