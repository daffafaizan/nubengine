      SurgiQuest AirSeal Insufflation System (AIS) used at low vs. higher pressures for maintaining
      pneumoperitoneum during laparoscopic/robotic surgical procedures.

      The study is designed and powered to demonstrate superiority of the AIS used at low
      insufflation pressure (9±mmHg ±1mmHg) vs higher pressure (15mmHg ±1mmHg) in relation to a
      single key effectiveness measure: Incidence of shoulder pain. Patients will be randomized 1:1
      to either AIS with an insufflation pressure target of 9±1mmHg) or to AIS with an insufflation
      target pressure of 15±1mmHg.

      Secondary outcome measures include severity of shoulder pain measured using a VAS scale and
      medication use, procedure time, the number of procedure interruptions, length of hospital
      stay, aspects of anesthesia management including end tidal CO2 and the frequency of adverse
      events. These outcomes will be evaluated in a controlled population undergoing
      laparoscopic/robotic surgery.
