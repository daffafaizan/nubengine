      bronchoscopy will be invited to participate in the study. All patients must be over 18 years
      old and must sign informed consent. The endoscopic examination of the bronchial tree will be
      performed using a commercially available flexible fluorescence bronchoscope (11004BI; Karl
      Storz; Culver City, CA) and the flexible white light video-bronchoscope (BF-T180; Olympus;
      Center Valley, PA).

      Images obtained will be photographed using both video recordings and parallel images of white
      light and imaged bronchoscopy. These digital images will be electronically stored and
      evaluated at a later time. Biopsies will be obtained of all suspected abnormalities. These
      will be correlated with the images.

      Images will be identified as normal, suspect or abnormal based upon each modality
      independently, paired with the spectral image and all three combined. The control will be an
      area considered normal by all modes of bronchoscopy. Images will be graded at the time of
      bronchoscopy. Later, all images will be graded in a blind fashion by two independent
      bronchoscopists. Standard statistical analysis using paired Student's t test will be applied.
      We anticipate that the combination of one or more imaged bronchoscopy techniques will
      increase accuracy by 25%. Power calculation to detect such a difference will require 140
      abnormal specimens. If 50% of patients examined have an abnormality, the study population
      will need to be around 300 patients.

      Histopathology reports will be obtained on all specimens. Abnormal results will be discussed
      with the individual patient and appropriate procedures will be performed based upon best
      medical practices. These procedures and patient follow-up are beyond the scope of the study.
