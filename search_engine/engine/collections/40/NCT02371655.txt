      setting. For this reason, limited bowel preparations have been extensively investigated.
      Usually, they combine the use of low-fibre diet and faecal/fluid tagging. The ingestion of a
      positive contrast agent (either barium, iodine or a combination of the two),needed to
      differentiate stool or fluid residues from true colonic lesions, is now considered mandatory.
      A low-fibre diet has the aim of improving residue homogeneity and facilitates tagging;
      however, there aren't significative evidences at support. The aim of this study is to compare
      a new regimen of reduced bowel preparation that does not include low fiber diet with another
      reduced bowel preparation including low-fiber diet. Primary outcome is the overall quality of
      bowel preparation.
