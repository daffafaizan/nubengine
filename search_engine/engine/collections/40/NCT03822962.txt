      with prescriptions for this medications more than quadrupaling in the last 17 years.

      Little is known as to the appropriate use of opioid analgesics in the post-operative recovery
      of patients undergoing sinus surgery. Furthermore, most pain protocols include only Tylenol
      based opioid analgesics. No study has prospectively evaluated the volume of use of Tylenol
      based opioid analgesics and whether the addition of NSAIDS decreased the need for opioid
      analgesics.

      This study will compare opioid use with and without the addition of NSAIDS following sinus
      surgery.

      Post-operative opioid use is a great public health concern, relatively unstudied, and an area
      with an opportunity for potential intervention to significantly reduce risks, morbidity, and
      mortality to our postoperative patients by better formulating a postoperative pain management
      plan using evidence-based practices. Appropriate opioid prescribing practices can reduce the
      risk of addiction, drug overdose, death, and undertreated pain. By optimizing post-operative
      pain management protocols, the need for opioids following sinus surgery should be minimized.
