      who recurred after at least one prior chemotherapy regimen. The primary endpoint is response
      rate; secondary endpoints are Progression-Free Survival, Overall Survival and treatment
      tolerability. Responses will be assessed according to RECIST 1.1; progression-free survival
      is defined as time between start of treatment and tumor progression or death; survival is the
      time between start of treatment and death. Furthermore exploratory studies will be performed
      on archival tumor material (PDL-1 expression, next-generation sequencing), and fresh biopsies
      (culturing; next-generation sequencing).
