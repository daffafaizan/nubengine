    
      This is a cross-sectional descriptive study with a research/action design to be carried out
      at the Consorci Corporació Sanitària Parc Taulí (CCSPT). The aim of this study is to identify
      the knowledge that CCSPT nurses have in relation to care aimed at coping with anxiety, fear
      or loneliness and the use that they have made of it in the recent crisis. By its design, the
      research/action will allow the training of these nurses to improve nursing care of these
      aspects in the future. This is a population-based study, in which all CCSPT nurses who have
      carried out care work during the COVID-19 crisis period will be invited to participate. The
      variables collected will be age, sex, academic level, usual work shift, care given to reduce
      anxiety, fear, loneliness, coping style and self-pity. Quantitative variables will be
      described by their mean and standard deviation, while qualitative variables will be described
      in absolute and relative frequencies. A linear or non-parametric correlation will be made
      between the score on the self-pity and coping scales and the number of actions identified
      and/or performed referred to by the nurses and the calculation of the Pearson or Spearman
      correlation coefficient, as appropriate. Comparison of the number of actions between high
      activity and low activity (70% cut) coping nurses using the Mann-Whitney U test
