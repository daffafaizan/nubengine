      the mesorectum is a standard treatment of locally advanced rectal cancer.Capecitabine has the
      potential to replace 5-FU as standard agent. Cetuximab is a monoclonal antibody directed
      against EGFR. Both agents are active in treatment of colorectal cancer and have demonstrated
      radiosensitising properties.The trial aims to assess the efficacy, safety and toxicity of the
      combination of cetuximab, capecitabine and radiation in patients with stage II and III rectal
      cancer.
