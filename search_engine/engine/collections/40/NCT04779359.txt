      diagnosis of COVID-19. Electronic medical records were reviewed. Data including age, sex,
      symptom from onset to hospital admission and laboratory findings at admission of hospitalized
      patients with confirmed COVID-19 were extracted and analyzed retrospectively. Identifying the
      possible immune factors and laboratory parameters is requisite for the early identification
      of patients with severe COVID-19 and timely intervention for control of the disease. There is
      an unmet need to establish robust clinical cutoffs of lymphocyte subsets for predicting risk
      associated with ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, and mortality in COVID-19 patients.
      This retrospective study was thus carried out to improve knowledge and clinical utility of
      lymphocyte subset measurements, together with other laboratory measurements and clinical
      information, for understanding prognosis in COVID-19 patients. These findings suggest that
      alterations in lymphocyte subsets and laboratory measurements play a significant role in the
      progression of COVID-19.
