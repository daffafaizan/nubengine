    
      In this longitudinal cohort study, 3036, nursing home (NH) residents (1656) and staff (1380),
      spread over 69 nursing homes throughout Belgium will be repeatedly sampled at a 2-month
      interval. Seroprevalence and -incidence will be assessed by means of a point-of-care rapid
      antibody test with additional collection of a Dry Blood Spot sample for quantitative
      detection of immune markers*. Sample collection (capillary blood samples) at baseline (day 0,
      week 0) will start in a staggered way, so all baseline samples among the different nursing
      homes are collected within the first 21 days after collection of the first sample. Follow-up
      sample collection will occur with a 2-month interval in week 8, week 16, week 24, week 32 and
      week 40 after the baseline collection of that specific nursing home. At each timepoint,
      questionnaires will be taken concerning medical history, clinical outcomes and potential
      COVID-19 riskfactors. The recruited NHs will be equally spread across the Belgian territory
      according to geographic and demographic characteristics to guarantee general
      representativity. Forty-four participants (20 staff, 24 residents) will be randomly included
      per nursing home. (* collection of the Dry Blood Spot is part of a sub-study by Ghent
      University)
