      hepatocellular carcinoma. Additionally, previous studies showed that stereotactic body
      radiotherapy (SBRT) was effective for hepatocellular carcinoma with portal vein tumor
      thrombus (PVTT). No study has evaluated the efficacy and safety of toripalimab plus SBRT for
      hepatocellular carcinoma with PVTT. Thus, the investigators carried out this prospective
      study to find out it.
