      diagnose genetic disorders in the fetus by looking at fetal DNA (genetic material) found in
      the mother's bloodstream during pregnancy.

      Women carrying a fetus diagnosed with microdeletions/microduplications (small missing or
      extra pieces of DNA that can cause problems), aneuploidy (trisomy 21, 18, or 13) or other
      genetic disorders will be asked to participate.

      If this study is successful, it will reduce the need for invasive procedures during pregnancy
      such as amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling (CVS) but still enable women to find out
      accurate information regarding their baby's health early in the pregnancy.
