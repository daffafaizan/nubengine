      is a need for parenteral hydration. Subcutaneous infused fluid or hypodermoclysis is a method
      for parenteral hydration. This method is used to treat older adults with mild to moderate
      dehydration or at risk of dehydration. Despite that, this method is used in older adults who
      are acutely ill we have a very limited understanding of the absorption time and thereby when
      the infused fluid is available in the circulatory system. This study aims to compare the
      absorption time in older adults who are acutely ill with when they are not acutely ill.
      Furthermore, this study aims to describe how fast the subcutaneous infused fluid is absorbed
      from the subcutaneous space and subsequently when it is available in the circulatory system
      where it has its effect.
