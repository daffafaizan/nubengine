      (336 days; 12 cycles of 28 days each). Participants who completed the Double-Blind Treatment
      Phase were unblinded and, if receiving pomalidomide and determined to have a complete
      remission (CR), partial remission (PR) or clinical improvement (CI) using the International
      Working Group (IWG) Response Criteria in the study protocol, could have continued on their
      current dose of pomalidomide until disease progression. Participants receiving placebo were
      discontinued from the study.
