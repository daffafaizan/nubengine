      as a 120 hour weekly infusion is an effective treatment for advanced non-small cell lung
      cancer. II. Observe any toxicities associated with this treatment in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive a 120 hour continuous infusion of aminocamptothecin colloidal
      dispersion (AC/CD) once a week for 2 weeks, followed by 1 week of rest. Patients are assessed
      after every 2 courses of therapy. Treatment with aminocamptothecin continues indefinitely if
      there is tumor shrinkage or stable disease and no significant toxicity is experienced.
      Patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 19-36 patients will be accrued for this study.
