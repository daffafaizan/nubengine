      surgery practice. Unfortunately, 40% of the patients experience moderate-to-severe acute pain
      in the early period. Erector spinae plane (ESP) block is a relatively new interfascial plane
      block which was described in 2016. In this prospective, controlled trial, the primary
      hypothesis is that ultrasound-guided unilateral ESP block will provide an increase in the
      quality of recovery-15 scores which will be assessed at the postoperative 24th hour following
      open IHR surgery. The secondary hypothesis is that ESP block will reduce postoperative pain
      scores, need for rescue analgesia and time to first mobilization.The study will be conducted
      as a single-center, prospective, randomized, controlled, double-blinded trial in a university
      hospital. Patients scheduled for an elective unilateral open IHR under spinal anesthesia,
      will be screened for enrollment to the study. At the end of the operation, patients will be
      randomized to receive a unilateral ESP block with 30 ml of 0.25% bupivacaine or 30 ml of
      normal saline at the level of T12 vertebrae. A blinded anesthesiologist will collect outcome
      measures in the postoperative period.
