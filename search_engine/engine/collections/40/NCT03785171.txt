    
      Imaging protocols:

      3D TOF 3SLAB; SWAN; 3D ASL 2.0s; T1; T2; T2 Flair; DWI; tASL 2.0s; DCE; APT-CEST

      Imaging evaluation:

        1. Transfer contrast volume value measured by DCE;

        2. ASL shows CBF in associated regions;

        3. Stoke area measured by DWI and Flair;

        4. PH values reflected by APT-CEST.

      Treatment:

      Surgery-indirect revascularization

      Follow-up:

      Baseline (MRI+DSA); 3-months follow-up (MRI); 6-months follow-up (MRI+DSA)
