    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine the clinical response to bortezomib and vorinostat in patients with
           high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes or acute myeloid leukemia, as defined by the
           International Working Group response criteria.

      Secondary

        -  To characterize the quantitative and qualitative toxicities of this regimen in these
           patients.

        -  To assess the effect of this regimen on natural killer (NK) cell function, in terms of
           activating and inhibitory receptor alterations, target cell ligand and HLA class I
           modulation, and NK-mediated cell killing.

        -  To correlate the above changes with clinical response.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive bortezomib subcutaneously (SQ) on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 and oral
      vorinostat once daily on days 1-14. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 3 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve a complete
      response, partial response, or hematologic improvement may receive 3 additional courses of
      therapy (for a maximum of 6 courses).

      Bone marrow and peripheral blood samples are collected at baseline and at the completion of 3
      courses of therapy for analysis of target cells (myeloid blasts) (i.e., HLA class I receptor
      analysis and natural killer [NK] cell receptor ligand analysis) and analysis of activating NK
      cell receptor alterations and NK-mediated cell killing.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 1 year.
