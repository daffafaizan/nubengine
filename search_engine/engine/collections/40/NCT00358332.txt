      malaria vaccine, using rabies vaccine as a control. This study is linked to DMID protocol
      07-0003. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and reactogenicity of
      FMP2.1/AS02A in children naturally exposed to P. falciparum malaria infection. The secondary
      objective is to measure the magnitude and duration of antibody response to FMP2.1 by
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). One hundred healthy children aged 1-6 years in
      Bandiagara, Mali, will be randomized to 1 of 3 possible groups. Twenty subjects will be
      enrolled in cohort 1 and 40 subjects each in cohorts 2 and 3. Children within each cohort
      will be randomized in a 3:1 ratio to receive 10, 25 or 50 micrograms of FMP2.1 (in cohorts 1,
      2 and 3, respectively) adjuvanted with a proportionate volume of the AS02A, or rabies
      vaccine. Thus a total of 75 children will receive the malaria vaccine and 25 the rabies
      vaccine. Immunizations will be given on days 0, 30 and 60 in a staggered fashion, with the
      first administrations of the 25 and 50 microgram dose levels of FMP2.1 following the first
      administration of the 10 and 25 microgram dose levels, respectively, by 2-3 weeks. Solicited
      adverse events will be recorded on the days of immunization and days 1, 2, 3 and 7 after each
      immunization, and unsolicited adverse events will be recorded for 30 days after each
      immunization. Children will be followed for 1 year after the last immunization. Sera will be
      collected for anti-FMP2.1 antibody titers on the days of immunization and 14 days after each
      immunization as well as 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after the first immunization. Each child will
      participate in the study for up to 414 days, which includes the screening period. The primary
      outcome measures include: occurrence of solicited symptoms after each vaccination during a
      7-day surveillance period (day of vaccination and days 1, 2, 3 and 7 after vaccination),
      occurrence of unsolicited symptoms after each vaccination during a 30-day surveillance period
      (day of vaccination and 30 subsequent days); and occurrence of serious adverse events
      throughout the study period. The secondary outcome measure is titers and activity of
      anti-FMP2.1 antibody at each time point where serology samples are analyzed, measured by
      ELISA.
