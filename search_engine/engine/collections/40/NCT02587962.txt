      sequential group dose-escalation design to determine the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and
      recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of birinapant administered in combination with 200 mg
      pembrolizumab, both administered as a 30-minute intravenous (IV) infusion. The following
      proposed doses of birinapant are to be evaluated: 5.6, 11, 17, and 22 mg/m2.

      The Phase 2 portion, the dose expansion phase, will compromise 4 cohorts of 26-30 patients.

      The 4 cohorts will include the following:

        -  Colorectal cancer

        -  Ovarian Cancer

        -  Cervical cancer

        -  Various solid tumors (30 patients, including 5 patients with each of the following 6
           tumor types: Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC)-checkpoint-inhibitor na√Øve;
           and HNSCC checkpoint-inhibitor experienced; Gastroesophageal carcinoma; Mesothelioma;
           Small cell lung cancer (SCLC); Cholangiocarcinoma

      A Simon's 2-stage design will be used for each of the cohorts in colorectal cancer, ovarian
      cancer and cervical cancer. A predefined interim analysis allowing stopping each of these
      cohorts for futility and safety will be conducted in the first stage to limit undue exposure
      before further inclusion into a given cohort. The design of the various solid tumors cohort
      will limit undue exposure in any of the selected tumor types by limiting the number of
      enrolled patient to five in each tumor type.
