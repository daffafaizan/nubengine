      hybrid closed-loop phase.

      Subjects will undergo a 14-day outpatient, standard therapy phase during which sensor and
      insulin data will be collected. Subjects, or their caregivers, will manage their diabetes at
      home per their usual routine using the study continuous glucose monitoring system (CGM) and
      remain on current multiple daily injections (MDI) or pump therapy. This will be followed by a
      94-day (13-week) hybrid closed-loop phase, conducted in an outpatient setting where subjects,
      or their caregivers, will manage their diabetes at home using the Omnipod Horizonâ„¢ Automated
      Glucose Control System. After completing the 94-day hybrid closed-loop phase, subjects will
      have the option to continue using the system for an additional 12 months.

      During the hybrid closed-loop phase, there will be supervised exercise challenges. A subset
      of subjects will participate in 5-days of supervised Meal and Exercise challenges. A subset
      of subjects will participate in 3-days of supervised HypoProtect Exercise challenges.

      The hybrid closed-loop phase will begin on Study Day 1.
