        -  to determine a threshold value of diaphragmatic excursion (ultrasound measures:
           expiration versus inspiration)that best predicts a 40% collapsibility of the inferior
           vena cava (IVC).

        -  to determine a threshold value of diaphragmatic excursion (ultrasound measures:
           expiration versus inspiration)that best predicts a 100% collapsibility of the IVC.

        -  to determine the location of the cutting plane for the TM analysis of collapsibility of
           the IVC.

        -  to evaluate the hemodynamic conditions of normal healthy volunteers.

        -  to detect any abnormality of cardiac function.
