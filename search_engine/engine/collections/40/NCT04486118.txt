      efficacy of a CA-ACEi, lisinopril, compared to a nonCA-ACEi, benazepril, for CI in SLE as
      measured by improvement in regional resting brain hypermetabolism and cognitive testing. The
      study will also investigate the impact of CA-ACEi compared to nonCA-ACEi on microglia cell
      activation as measured by PBR28 binding, behavioral function, circulating inflammatory
      cytokines and whole blood gene expression. The target population is SLE subjects between the
      ages of 18 and 55 that have stable disease activity and have no history of active or prior
      CNS disease of any kind. If applicable, subjects must be on stable doses of corticosteroids
      (less than or equal to 10 mg daily of prednisone) and non-increasing doses of other
      immunosuppressive medications for at least 4 weeks prior to screening.
