      blood loss, less hemoglobin drop post-operatively, decreased post-operative pain and fewer
      overall complications, it is a difficult procedure, which often requires greater operative
      time to perform. In the current climate of attempting to reduce health care expenditures,
      even though the minimally invasive approach offers the advantage of reduced hospital stay, a
      deterrent for hospital administration and surgeons may be the increased operative time it may
      require. Barbed suture is a relatively new material available in gynecologic surgery. Barbs
      are cut into the suture with the barbs facing in a direction opposite that of the needle. The
      barbs allow for anchoring of the suture in tissues, which prevents migration and allows
      suturing without knot tying. This study will be a single-centre non-blinded randomized
      controlled trial comparing laparoscopic myomectomy with barbed suture versus traditional
      suture material.
