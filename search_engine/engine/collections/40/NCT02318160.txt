      subjects with matching age and sex were included as a control group. Thorough history,
      examination, thyroid ultrasound, measurement of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and free
      thyroxine (FT4), as well as anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAb) and anti-thyroglobulin
      antibody (TgAb) were done in addition to assessment of malondialdehyde (MDA) and total
      antioxidant capacity (TAC) levels as an oxidative stress markers. Results: Overt
      hypothyroidism was detected in 23/32 while subclinical hypothyroidism was detected in 9/32 of
      the studied patients. Malondialdehyde levels were significantly elevated while total
      antioxidant capacity levels were significantly decreased in autoimmune thyroiditis patients
      compared with healthy controls. The difference was more evident in patients with overt
      hypothyroidism than those with subclinical hypothyroidism. We also observed a significant
      positive correlation between anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies levels and age, TSH,
      malondialdehyde, thyroid volume and a negative correlation with total antioxidant capacity
      and thyroxine .

      Conclusions: The high serum malondialdehyde and lower total antioxidant capacity levels in
      patients with autoimmune thyroiditis and the correlation of thyroid antibodies with
      biomarkers of oxidative stress may reflect the role of autoimmunity in the development of
      oxidative stress. Future studies are needed for evaluation of the antioxidant therapy for
      autoimmune thyroiditis patients.
