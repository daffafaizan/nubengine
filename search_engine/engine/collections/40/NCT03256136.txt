      and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works
      in treating a specific disease.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has approved Nivolumab as a treatment for
      other types of cancers including lung cancer. However, the combination of Nivolumab with
      other drugs (such as those being tested in this study) has not been approved by the FDA as a
      treatment for this type of lung cancer.

      The purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness (how well the drug works), safety, and
      tolerability of the drug Nivolumab in combination with standard of care chemotherapies, or in
      combination with Ipilimumab. Nivolumab and Ipilimumab are antibodies (a type of human
      protein) that are being tested to see if they will allow the body's immune system to work
      against tumor cells. This study is being done to see if Nivolumab and Ipilimumab, or
      Nivolumab and chemotherapy drugs (Carboplatin and Pemetrexed), are more effective against
      cancer when administered together.

      These drugs are given as infusions. They are designed to "boost" the immune system's ability
      to suppress or kill cancer cells that are foreign to the human body.
