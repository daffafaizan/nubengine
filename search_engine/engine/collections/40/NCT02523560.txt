      developing civilization and generating worrying economic and social effects. Early
      comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation (CCR) is an accepted method of preventing and treating
      adverse cardiac events, which allows for care cost reduction. In Poland, CCR availability is
      highly unsatisfactory (around 8%) and unacceptably varied (0.5-70%). With the existing
      organization and technical background, improving this situation seems impossible. Project
      objective: To apply telemedicine technologies to implement a novel model of home-based CCR in
      HF patients.

      The program, performed in six centers, will comprise 850 HF patients (randomization 1:1), in
      NYHA class I-III, EFâ‰¤40%, clinically stable, after a hospitalization incident. The study
      group patients will undergo a 9-week rehabilitation program consisting of two stages: Stage I
      - preliminary (one week at stationary ward), Stage II - main (8 weeks of home-based
      telerehabilitation). The primary end-point (days alive and out of hospital) will be assessed
      during a 24-month follow-up in both groups. The project will enable early secondary
      prevention in the population of people with HF to be implemented. It will be achieved via:

        -  Novel concept - "From Hospital To Home"

        -  Novel technology - telemedicine

        -  Novel method of CCR implementation
