      frequency of COPD exacerbation.

      In addition, the result of the pilot study (NCT02545855) of the stable COPD patient in Japan
      is indicated that HOT with HFNC improved their QOL and PaCO2 by comparing to HOT only.

      Therefore, this study is planned to indicate the efficacy of HFNC which can increase the
      ventilation efficiency and have the function of heated humidification, by comparing HOT with
      HFNC to HOT only.
