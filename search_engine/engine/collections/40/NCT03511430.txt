      or admitted to clinical decision unit at Renown Regional Medical Center with a primary
      complaint of chest pain in a period of 12 months.

      All patient >24 years will be recruited. Exclusion criteria include patients with clear-cut
      acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, traumatic non-cardiac chest pain,
      life-expectancy less than 90 days, hemodynamic instability or inability to provide informed
      consent. Data and scores based on commonly known TIMI* risk score, HEART score and a newly
      developed SVEAT index ( Symptoms, Vascular disease, EKG, Age, Troponin) will be obtained by
      primary investigator trained physicians or advanced nurse practitioners as earliest as
      possible after their initial presentation. The care of the patients will be left to the
      discretion of the treating physician.

      The outcome of each patient will be determined by either chart review, telephone contact or
      office visit as appropriate in 30 days post presentation. The sensitivity, specificity,
      positive and negative predictive value of SVEAT index will be calculated using standard
      statistical analysis. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves of SVEAT index, TIMI
      risk score and HEART score will be generated and compared using commercially available
      software. P value of 0.05 or less will be considered statistically significant difference.

      The primary hypothesis of the study is that scoring systems that better incorporate useful
      clinical information such as the SVEAT score may improve our ability to accurately identify
      low-risk acute chest pain patients presenting to the ED.
