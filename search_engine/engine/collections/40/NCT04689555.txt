      interventional therapy. Closure of the arteriotomy site is usually achieved by manual
      compression after femoral arterial puncture. There are many disadvantages of this standard
      method for hemostasis which is still related to high rate of access-site complications such
      as pseudoaneurysm, major bleeding, ipsilateral groin hematomas and so on. Several vascular
      closure devices are emerging as novel means for improving patient comfort and accelerating
      ambulation after invasive cardiovascular procedures performed via femoral arterial access,
      however, the cost performance and other aspects limit its wide application especially in
      developing countries.

      Actually the investigators found a novel method for femoral artery hemostasis without manual
      compression. After sheath removal, four or five sterile gauzes were overlaid layer by layer
      and then bandaged without the procedure of manual compression.

      FAST trial is aimed to investigate if the safety and efficacy of this novel method without
      manual compression is noninferior to the standard manual compression.
