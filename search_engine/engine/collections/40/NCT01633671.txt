      NT-proBNP, Troponin-I and D-dimers were measured according to the standard hospital protocol.
      Blood samples were obtained within one hour after the onset of clinical symptoms.

      Definitive confirmation or exclusion of APE was performed with an angiographic CT-scan of the
      thorax.
