    
      Kyprolis® (K; carfilzomib) was approved in India on 17 January 2017 as a prescription
      medication in combination with dexamethasone (Kd) or with lenalidomide (Revlimid®) plus
      dexamethasone (KRd) for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory multiple
      myeloma (RRMM) following 1 to 3 prior lines of therapy.

      This non-comparative, interventional phase 4 study is designed to fulfil the post-marketing
      requirement to assess safety, tolerability, and efficacy of Kyprolis on Indian subjects with
      RRMM as per the locally approved label.
