      on pre-established ERAS protocol consisting of 13 pre and intraoperative items. Its
      principles and criteria for discharge from the hospital were based on the ERAS Society
      Guidelines.

      Investigators analysed which of the factors: gender; age; BMI; ASA (American Society of
      Anaesthesiologists) physical status; type of surgery (colonic resection vs. rectal resection
      with total mesorectal excision, TME); stage of cancer; distance between the hospital and
      place of residence; operative time; intraoperative blood loss significantly prolong LOS
      (primary length of stay, excluding readmissions). Moreover, the compliance with ERAS protocol
      and its influence on LOS was analysed.

      For the purposes of further analyses the entire group of patients was divided into 2
      subgroups depending on the length of their hospital stay. On admission every patient received
      the information about the target length of stay of 4 days. Group 1 consisted of patients
      whose hospital stay was shorter or equal to the target LOS (â‰¤ 4 days). In group 2 were
      patients whose hospital stay was longer than 4 days.
