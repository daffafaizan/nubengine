      with blinded outcome assessment. Patients admitted to the participating hospitals will be
      managed under usual care conditions for three months (control arm). This will be followed by
      the training of the doctors and nurses in those hospitals on essential acute stroke care
      management. Patient management for the following three months after the training
      (intervention) will then be assessed to evaluate its impact on the care and clinical outcome
      of the patients.
