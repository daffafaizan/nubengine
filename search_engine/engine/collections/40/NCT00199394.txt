    
      Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive motor disease characterized by bradykinesia or
      akinesia, rigidity, and resting tremor. Levodopa is still the most widely used treatment for
      PD, but as the disease progresses the drug tends to become less helpful. This is because of
      the development of motor response complications such as end-of-dose deterioration or
      wearing-off, peak dose dyskinesias, and ON-OFF phenomenon.

      Comparison(s): The safety of 40 mg/d istradefylline and the efficacy for reducing the
      percentage of OFF time in patients with advanced PD treated with levodopa will be compared to
      placebo. The safety and efficacy of Entacapone will also be compared to placebo.
