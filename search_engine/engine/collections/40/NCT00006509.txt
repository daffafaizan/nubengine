      show decreased levels of HIV-specific immune responses. In these patients, a prime-boost
      vaccine strategy may induce both humoral and cell-mediated immunity. The hypothesis of this
      study is that the vaccine strategy selected will be both safe and immunogenic in the patient
      population being tested.

      Patients continue antiretroviral medications throughout the course of this study. All
      patients receive intramuscular injections of ALVAC-HIV (vCP 1452) and recombinant soluble
      gp160 MN/LAI-2 on Days 0, 30, 90, and 180. Patients are monitored for safety 30 minutes after
      each immunization and by telephone contact within 72 hours of each vaccination. In addition,
      each patient records adverse events in a diary. Patients have regular physical exams,
      pregnancy tests, and blood drawn for virologic and immunologic assessments. The induction of
      HIV-specific responses will be measured.
