      of those who enter treatment for MJ dependence relapse. However, the mechanism of action of
      MJ on brain neurochemistry, especially in connection with the reported withdrawal symptoms,
      is still not well understood. We hypothesized that brain gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) and
      glutamate (glu) fluctuate during the transition between active exposure, early abstinence
      (1-2 days since last use), and prolonged abstinence (7 days and more), and an imbalance of
      GABA and glu during MJ abstinence was the metabolic source of the aforementioned withdrawal
      symptoms that make MJ abstinence so difficult for many individuals. The investigator's
      specific aims were to measure MJ abstinence related changes in levels of GABA and glu and to
      correlate the changes in GABA and glu with MJ withdrawal symptoms and clinical measures at
      baseline, day 7, and day 21 into abstinence. The MR measures were conducted at 3 tesla and
      the abstinence was verified by urinary tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) levels.
