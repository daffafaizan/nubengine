    
      This pilot study is designed as a prospective, multicentre, double blind, randomised
      controlled non-inferiority trial. The total follow up time is 6 months with follow up
      assessments at 1, 3 and 6 months post intervention. It is estimated that the total duration
      of data collection will cover 1 year. Adult patients (> 18 years) with chronic, moderate to
      severe knee pain (NRS>4) due to osteoarthritis, radiological diagnosed to be graded 2-4
      according to the Kellgren-Lawrence criteria or with persistent postoperative moderate to
      severe knee pain (NRS>4) after total knee arthroplasty can be included in the study.

      Patients will be randomly selected for treatment with conventional radiofrequent treatment or
      cooled radiofrequent treatment of the SL, SM and IL genicular nerves. In total, three
      hospitals participate in this study: Ziekenhuis Oost-Limburg (Belgium), Maastricht UMC+
      (Netherlands) and Rijnstate (Netherlands).
