      were naïve to anti-VEGF therapy or have not received intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy for the
      previous 3 months. Patients were randomized in two treatment arms for 3 months:

        -  Study arm 1: Three monthly injections of 0.5mg Ranibizumab

        -  Study arm 2: Three monthly injections of 0.5mg Conbercept Blood sample (plasma/serum)
           was collected at baseline (pre-dose), 3h post-injections and days 1, 3, 7 and 28,
           following doses 1 and 3 for PK and systemic VEGF analysis. The lab staff was blinded for
           treatment allocation.

      Plasma VEGF concentration was measured by a blinded laboratory using Quantikine® ELISA kits.
      Serum ranibizumab and conbercept concentration will be determined using validated ELISA
      assay.

      The study was divided into 2 stages: the 1st initial feasibility stage with 6 patients per
      arm (12 patients in total) to verify SD for sample size justification and 2nd stage to
      confirm the findings with justified sample size.
