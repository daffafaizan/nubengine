      are currently taking antiretrovirals (ARVs). Hair collection will be evenly distributed into
      color cohorts: Black, Brown, Blonde and Grey. Participants will need to be >80% adherent to
      their medication and have had an undetectable HIV RNA VL within the previous 6 months. In the
      lab, samples will be used to develop IR-MALDESI MSI hair protocols for high sensitivity and
      accuracy to quantify ARVs in 5 therapeutic drug classes (Integrase Inhibitors, Nucleoside
      Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors, Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors, Entry
      Inhibitors, Protease Inhibitors).
