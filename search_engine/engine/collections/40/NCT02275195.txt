      function of the cells of a patients immune system and how these change and impact on the
      outcome of alcoholic hepatitis. The investigators will examine the role of different cells of
      the immune system and how they may determine the outcome of this condition. The investigators
      will also look at how established treatment strategies impact on the frequency and function
      of these cell subsets.

      Alcohol is the most common cause of liver disease in the developed world and results in the
      death of 2.5 million people annually. It is a causal factor in more than 60 major types of
      diseases and injuries and approximately 4.5% of the global burden of disease and injury is
      attributable to alcohol. Acute alcoholic hepatitis (AAH) is perhaps the most florid form of
      ALD and the leading cause of mortality in these patients is the development of sepsis which
      occurs in up to 40% of these patients and has a mortality rate of 50%.

      By gaining a better understanding of the relationship between elements of the immune system
      and the progression to severe alcoholic hepatitis, it will allow the formulation of more
      effective treatment strategies for this condition.

      Patients who agree to participate in this study will have an extra 40mls of blood drawn for
      scientific studies at the same time as routine blood samples are taken as part of their
      ongoing care.
