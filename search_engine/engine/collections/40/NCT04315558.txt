    
      Objective: To assess the efficacy of nebulized revefenacin in improving the lung mechanics of
      COPD patients with acute respiratory failure requiring invasive mechanical ventilation (MV),
      in comparison to a control group receiving the short-acting muscarinic antagonist
      ipratropium.

      Hypothesis: Revefenacin is as efficacious as ipratropium in improving the lung mechanics of
      COPD patients with acute respiratory failure.

      Study Design:

      RARICO is a pragmatic, randomized, controlled, double-blinded, multi-center trial evaluating
      the safety and feasibility of nebulized revefenacin in comparison to nebulized ipratropium in
      patients with COPD and acute respiratory failure requiring invasive mechanical ventilation.
