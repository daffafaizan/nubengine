      transduced chondrocyte cells that express growth factor to modify osteoarthritis symptom for
      long term period.

      During clinical trial Phase 1, we compare three different dose levels of TisssueGene-C in 6
      months with 12 outpatients with degenerative arthritis. The patients are randomized by three
      different dose levels of TisssueGene-C in 1:1:1 ratio, and they are monitored and recorded
      for alleviating symptoms, sports activities, function of the knee, and the presence of
      adverse events.
