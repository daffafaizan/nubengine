      likely to maintain their weight, few people continue to keep records given the vigilant
      attention needed. This study will test the efficacy of an alternative approach to record
      keeping that may be easier for people to sustain and lead to better long-term weight
      management. We propose that obese adults who attempt to keep their weight within a clearly
      defined and personalized 'range', e.g., a 5-lb range between 200-205 pounds, will be more
      likely to continue weighing themselves and remain weight stable because they have learned to
      self-regulate, i.e., accurately monitor changes in their weight, alert themselves when
      they've gained too much weight, and 'finetune' their eating and physical activity in
      response, but with the minimum effort and attention necessary. The primary aim for this
      randomized trial will examine whether participants in an 8-week 'Fine-Tuning' program are
      more likely to weigh themselves over the 6-month study than participants in an 8-week
      traditional 'Record-Keeping' program.
