      in order to improve patients' health-related quality of life, overall survival and to better
      support treatment side effects as well as the disease evolution. Unfortunately, they are not
      widely used in clinical practice.

      A direct assessment of the needs perceived unmet by patients could allow to assess the
      magnitude of expectations to better target treatments as example. A prospective assessment of
      the expectations and needs of the patients is thus essential. This would also allow help to
      highlight the convergence between supportive care proposed and used and those expected by
      patients. The first step to understanding how to optimize the use of resources and to improve
      the quality of care is to identify patient's expectations. Moreover, it is now well
      recognized that patients should play a key role in the research and that their active
      participation in research can increase the relevance of the research.

      In this context, the CyPRES project aims to:

        1. assess through national consensus the patients' expectations in terms of supportive care
           in order to help both clinicians and health care services;

        2. prioritize them and to arrange resources according to priority needs identified;

        3. identify supportive care for which no previous research (evidence-based medicine) has
           demonstrated their usefulness. A randomized clinical trial will thus be proposed;

        4. Involve patients in the written, conduct and analyses, as well as communications of the
           randomized clinical trial.
