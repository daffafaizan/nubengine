      these Canadians will aim to continue working over the next 10 years. However, the impact of
      arthritis on aging Canadians compromises their ability to continue working. By 2031, over 2
      million Canadians aged 45 to 64 years will have arthritis. The investigators aim to boost the
      ability of adults with the most common arthritis, osteoarthritis (OA), as well as adults
      without OA, to engage in the workforce for as long as they desire. Identifying strategies to
      promote productivity among workers with knee and hip OA will be of great public health
      significance in the coming decades. However, the investigators face two challenges. First,
      obesity among sedentary workers is a risk for worsening knee and hip OA. Second, large
      occupational loads on the knee and hip worsen OA. Exercise has the most promise in addressing
      these challenges because it reduces pain and sick time, and improves mental health. Thus,
      there is a call for studies examining exercise for workers with knee and hip OA.
