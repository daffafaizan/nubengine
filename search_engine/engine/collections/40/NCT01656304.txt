      I. The rate of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response with avastin (bevacizumab) therapy in
      androgen independent non-metastatic prostate cancer.

      II. Toxicities associated with avastin therapy. III. Time to PSA progression.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Overall survival of androgen independent non-metastatic prostate cancer patients treated
      with avastin.

      II. The change in PSA velocity with avastin therapy in androgen-independent non-metastatic
      prostate cancer.

      III. Time to distant metastatic disease. IV. Circulating tumor cell count. V. Changes in
      levels of N terminal collagen peptide and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase with avastin
      therapy.

      VI. Correlation of crosslinked N-telopeptide of type I collagen (NTX) and serum
      B-Cell-Specific Activator Protein (BSAP) levels with time to PSA progression.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive bevacizumab intravenously (IV) over 30-90 minutes once every 14 days.
      Courses repeat every 14 days in the absence of disease progression and unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months.
