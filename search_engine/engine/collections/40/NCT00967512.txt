      5'-CCCTG5-CTCCC10-CCCTG15-GCTCC20-3'. For AML, cenersen is specific for blocking p53
      expression in the stem cells. When AML stem cells are dividing, cenersen sensitizes them to
      even low-level DNA damage of the type caused by idarubicin, etoposide and possibly ara-C.

      Because AML stem cells are not all dividing at any given time, this protocol is designed to
      treat patients with a total of four cycles of cenersen plus chemotherapy within a two to
      three month period. For a limited period of time, proliferating non-stem cells can be
      expected to maintain or even expand the tumor while the stem cells are being depleted. If the
      proliferating non-stem cells are not resupplied by the stem cells, they will all become end
      stage blasts after a few divisions and undergo elimination.
