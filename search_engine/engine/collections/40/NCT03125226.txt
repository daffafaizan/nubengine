      I. To utilize the TraceIT hydrogel tissue marker in localizing bladder tumors during
      transurethral resection of bladder tumors (TURBT).

      II. To improve identification of gross tumor or tumor bed location in patients receiving
      chemoradiation treatment for bladder cancers.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To report adverse events surrounding the placement of the TraceIT tissue marker.

      II. To calculate the actual dose received by the bladder tumor bed, as delineated by the
      hydrogel.

      III. To compare the dosimetric impact to the tumor bed of daily patient alignment to the
      pelvic bones, versus alignment to the whole bladder, versus alignment to the hydrogel
      markers.

      IV. To calculate the amount of normal tissue radiation dose decrease achievable without
      losing tumor coverage, with better tumor targeting with hydrogel placement.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo transurethral resection of bladder tumors and receive TracelT hydrogel via
      injection. Patients undergo standard of care radiation therapy within 8 weeks of TracelT
      hydrogel placement.
