      removal of secretions from their airways. Many different techniques are available to achieve
      this and there is currently no consensus as to which form of therapy is most effective. High
      frequency chest wall oscillation (HFCWO) is used by CF patients throughout the United States
      and abroad. To perform this therapy, the patient wears a vest which fits over the entire
      torso and is connected to an air compressor. The compressor generates oscillating air pulses
      that are transmitted to the lungs, thereby mobilizing secretions. The most commonly used
      device is The Vestâ„¢ Airway Clearance System, (Hill-Rom Inc, St Paul, MN). Adjustment of the
      inflation pressure and frequency of oscillations affects the volume of displaced air and flow
      of air measured at the mouth of the patient. Previous studies indicate this form of therapy
      is as effective as more traditional and cumbersome forms of therapy. However, it is unclear
      which inflation pressures and oscillator frequencies provide optimal airway clearance. Some
      studies of sine waveform HFCWO reported the largest volume of air displacement and highest
      air flow measured at the mouth when using a combination of high inflation pressures with
      either low (7 - 10 Hz) or high frequencies (18 - 20 Hz), but most CF centers in the United
      States use HFCWO with lower pressures combined with mid-range frequencies (10 - 14 Hz).
      Furthermore, there are no previous studies assessing the affect of sine waveform HFCWO
      settings on sputum production. As a result, there is no consensus on which pressure and
      frequency settings are most efficacious for CF patients.
