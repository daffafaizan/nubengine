    
      Standard treatment for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) involves a combined therapy of
      paclitaxel and carboplatin. These drugs are administered once every 21 days. This study adds
      high dose ascorbic acid (75g per infusion) twice per week for up to 4 cycles of therapy.

      Participants will:

        -  receive high doses of intravenous (IV) ascorbate two times a week during each 3 week
           chemotherapy.

        -  have blood samples drawn to measure blood ascorbate levels once every 21 days

        -  have blood samples drawn to measure iron and ferritin levels before treatment, then on
           cycles 1 and 3.

      The active therapy portion of this study lasts for 4 months. After that is completed,
      participants will go back to standard therapy for their cancer. Participants will continue to
      have life-long follow-up for this study.
