      However, it is restrained by the reticence of patients and physicians. For type 2 diabetes,
      insulin therapy is well managed and there is ongoing progress. But there are still some
      questions about the effect of the treatment in the everyday life of patients: culture, fear,
      material resources, necessity of education.

      Ignorance and prejudices on insulin injection are still prevalent and often it delays for
      more than a year the time when patients have to switch an insulin treatment for unbalanced
      chronic disorder.

      Type 2 diabetes patients think that the treatment is heavy, can lead to serious hypoglycemia,
      is uncomfortable for family and can cause fear.

      Education of the patients can reduce ignorance and prejudices about insulin treatment.

      Nowadays studies show that diabetes patients want to be more involved in the decisions linked
      to their treatment which impact their perception of the disease and the treatment.

      Auto measurement of glycaemia can help the patient better manage his disease and make him
      understand the importance of controlling his glycaemia levels.

      This study could allow to:

        -  Offer a new care organization for a better use of resources (network, patient
           therapeutic educationâ€¦)

        -  Set up adequate training for professionals and for patients being cared for in medical
           offices.

        -  Improve the glycemic balance of patients and slower the growth of degenerative
           complications.
