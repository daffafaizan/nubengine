    
      A new PAP device has been developed by ResMed which includes an improved humidification
      system, a new user interface and optimized workflows. This study will assess the efficacy and
      usability of the new PAP device in an OSA population.

      This is a prospective, open-label, single arm study, multi-site study to assess the usability
      and efficacy of investigational device in the home environment.

      Recruitment Recruitment will be done via phone calls/ SMS messages/ emails. Participants will
      be explained the details of the study and those who wish to take part will be invited to a
      ResMed clinic or selected site for the first study visit (As detailed in section 7).

      Visit 1 Participants will provide written informed consent (as per section 6.1). If eligible,
      baseline participant demographics will be collected. Participants will be shown the
      investigation device. If the participant is happy to proceed the investigational device will
      be set-up to be exactly the same as their current CPAP device, and the participant will take
      it home to use in place of their own device.

      Visit 2 At the conclusion of the 7 nights of use, the participant will be asked to fill in a
      questionnaire documenting their experience with the investigational device. The participant
      will return all study equipment to the researcher. The questionnaires will be reviewed. This
      concludes the participation in the study.
