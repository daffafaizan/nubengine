      mesentery rather than just of the bowel alone. A more extensive central mesenterectomy (up to
      the level of the ileocolic artery), in order to remove an increased volume of affected
      mesentery to prevent postoperative CD, has been suggested to lead to beneficial results. It
      is hypothesised that patients who undergo a central mesenterectomy during an ileocolic
      resection compared to a mesenteric sparing ileocolic resection will have decreased recurrence
      rates.
