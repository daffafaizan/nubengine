      that there is a larger shift toward pathogenic bacteria. Previous studies have shown that
      probiotics, fecal transplants, antibiotic decontamination, and dietary interventions can
      shift the gastrointestinal microbiome toward a metabolically favorable microbiome profile and
      be associated with improvements in disease burden.

      This study will randomize critically-ill children who are stable enough for enteral tube
      feedings to receive either Pediasure or Nourish. Pediasure is a commercially-made formula
      that is used commonly in pediatric patients. Nourish is an organic, whole-food formula with a
      high fiber content. High-fiber diets have been correlated with metabolically favorable
      microbiome profiles. This study will look at the microbiome before and after initiation of
      enteral tube feedings to determine if either formula is associated with a shift in the
      microbiome toward a favorable profile.
