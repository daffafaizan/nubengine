      demographic characteristics, treatment performed and clinical outcomes of Brazilian
      participants with HCV chronic infection in about 12 Brazilian reference centers. It will
      expect that approximately 2000 participants will be enrolled in the study. Analysis set will
      consist of participants with HCV chronic infection who are registered at the Brazilian
      reference centers and meet all the inclusion criteria and have sufficient information to
      identify the diagnosis of chronic HCV infection with identification of genotype. The study
      related data will be collected from the medical records in the predesigned electronic Case
      Report Form (eCRF).
