      improve outcomes from clinical trials. This 'individualised medicine' approach requires the
      development of biomarkers of treatment response.

      60 adults with ADHD are recruited from the Adult ADHD Clinic at the Maudsley Hospital,
      London, United Kingdom.

      The study is developed over three sessions, two at baseline (DAY 1 and DAY 2) and one after
      two months of treatment (follow-up).

      The first two sessions are conceived as a single-blind non-randomised placebo-controlled
      cross-over experiment. The first 30 participants enrolled in the study receive a placebo
      tablet (ascorbic acid 50 mgs) on DAY 1 before the behavioural assessment and magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) scan. The behavioural assessment and the functional MRI measurements
      are repeated two days after (DAY 2), under a clinically effective dose (20 mgs) of
      short-acting methylphenidate (MPH).

      The order of the tablets is reverted for the remaining 30 participants to balance any
      potential expectation and practice effect between the two conditions. Placebo and medication
      are over-encapsulated with the same red opaque capsules by the pharmacy team. Also, the
      protocol followed during the two sessions is absolutely identical in respect of timing and
      tests administered in order to keep the participants blind to the drug condition (medication
      or placebo).

      After the scanning sessions, all the participants receive the same prescription of a
      long-acting formulation of MPH, according to the clinical guidelines adopted by the Maudsley
      Hospital. Treatment response is evaluated clinically and behaviourally after 2 months of
      treatment (follow-up). Pre-treatment brain characteristics are tested as potential predictors
      (biomarkers) of treatment response.
