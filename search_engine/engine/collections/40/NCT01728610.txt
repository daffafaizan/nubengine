      dose-responsive set up on functional intestinal symptoms among subjects diagnosed with IBS
      according to Rome III criteria. Subjective assessment of bowel symptoms, quality of life,
      anxiety and depression and adequate relief will be assessed as with questionnaires as outcome
      measures. The intestinal microbiota will be analysed from faecal samples.
