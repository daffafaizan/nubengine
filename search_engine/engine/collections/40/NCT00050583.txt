      experience significant distress and disability. This disorder is an important problem for the
      primary health care system because patients with Somatization Disorder use health care
      resources extensively but receive little benefit. To date, no medical or psychiatric
      intervention has been demonstrated in controlled trials to produce clinically significant and
      lasting symptom relief or improved functional status in Somatization Disorder patients.

      Patients in primary care settings with multiple unexplained symptoms are treated with 10
      weekly sessions of CBT or "treatment as usual." Physical symptoms, comorbid psychiatric
      symptoms, disability, and health care utilization are measured and assessed through a
      combination of structured interviews and self-reports. Assessments are performed at study
      start, mid-treatment, end of treatment, and at a 6-month follow-up.
