      bone marrow aspirate in order to obtain autologous MSCs. In a Current Good Manufacturing
      Practices (cGMP)-compliant cell manufacturing facility, the bone-marrow derived MSCs will be
      stimulated with interferon gamma and increased in number (i.e., expanded) prior to
      cryopreservation. After thawing and recovery in culture, a single dose of MSCs will be
      injected into the submandibular glands under local anesthesia. The safety and tolerability of
      MSC injection will be assessed and changes in quality of life and production of saliva will
      also be evaluated.
