      confirm antibody protection from vaccines in the Aurora Health Care multiple myeloma (MM)
      patients.

      The overall goal of this study is to obtain a normative dataset for MM patients and non-MM
      control populations as well as determining baseline IgG levels to seasonal influenza A,
      influenza B, pneumococcal polysaccharide, and tetanus toxoid and confirmation of antibody
      protection from vaccines with assays based upon WHO standards of detection.

      This is part of a series of studies designed to provide important information about the best
      way and time to vaccinate MM patients to flu, pneumonia, haemophilus influenzae B (HIB),
      and/or meningococcus and to gather additional information about MM and immune function.
