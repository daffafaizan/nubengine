        -  Compare the efficacy of escitalopram oxalate vs placebo in treating major depressive
           disorder in patients with advanced lung or gastrointestinal cancer.

        -  Compare the side effect burden of escitalopram oxalate vs placebo in these patients.

        -  Determine potential moderators of the efficacy of escitalopram oxalate in these
           patients, including medical, psychological, and social variables.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Patients are
      stratified according to stage of disease (stage IIIB with effusions vs stage IV) and current
      treatment (radiation vs chemotherapy vs novel agent). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2
      treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral placebo once daily for 4 weeks followed by oral placebo
           once daily for another 4 weeks

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo once daily for 4 weeks followed by escitalopram
           oxalate 10 mg once daily for 4 weeks.

        -  Arm III: Patients receive oral escitalopram oxalate 10 mg once daily for 4 weeks
           followed by oral placebo once daily for 4 weeks.

      After 8 weeks, all non-responders are offered open treatment with an antidepressant.

      Depression, fatigue, quality of life, anxiety, and somatization are assessed at baseline and
      then at 4 and 8 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 220 patients will be accrued for this study.
