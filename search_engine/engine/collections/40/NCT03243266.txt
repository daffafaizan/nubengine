      male and Ten female are required for each age range. The values will be assessed against
      published reference ranges to verify that the values obtained fall within the expected
      reference interval for the age ranges listed below:

        1. Neonate: 0 to 30 days

        2. Infant: > 30 days to 2 years

        3. Child: 3 years to 12 years

        4. Adolescent: 13 years to 21 years
