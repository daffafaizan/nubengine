      two-sequence, single-dose, crossover bioavailability study comparing oxcarbazepine 300 mg/5mL
      oral suspension of OHM Laboratories (a subsidiary of Ranbaxy Pharmaceuticals Inc.) with
      TrileptalÂ® 300 mg/5mL oral suspension (containing oxcarbazepine 300 mg/5mL) of Novartis
      Pharmaceutical Corporation in healthy, adult, male, human subjects under fed condition.

      Following an overnight fast of at least 10 hours, all subjects were served a high-fat high
      calorie breakfast. Thirty minutes after the start of the meal, a single oral dose of 10 mL of
      oxcarbazepine 300 mg/5 mL oral suspension was administered using a 10 mL graduated syringe,
      during each period of the study under the supervision of trained study personnel, along with
      240 mL of drinking water at ambient temperature.

      During the course of the study safety parameters assessed were vital signs, clinical
      examination, medical history and clinical laboratory safety tests (hematology, biochemical
      parameters, serology and urine analysis) at baseline. Laboratory parameters of hematology and
      biochemistry were repeated at the end of the study.

      A total of forty (40) subjects were enrolled into the study, to be administered a single oral
      dose of the test or reference formulation of 10 mL of oxcarbazepine 300 mg/5 mL oral
      suspension according to a randomization schedule. Thirty-three (33) subjects completed both
      the periods of the study.
