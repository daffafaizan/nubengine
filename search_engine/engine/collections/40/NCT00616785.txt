      Primary

        -  To evaluate the efficacy of induction chemotherapy comprising irinotecan hydrochloride
           and cisplatin in patients with locally advanced, unresectable stage III non-small cell
           lung cancer.

        -  To evaluate the feasibility of radiotherapy administered concurrently with etoposide and
           cisplatin chemotherapy after induction chemotherapy in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  To evaluate the toxicity of induction chemotherapy comprising irinotecan hydrochloride
           and cisplatin in these patients.

        -  To assess whether this induction chemotherapy regimen will improve patient survival when
           compared with outcomes from the predecessor study, SWOG-9019.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive dose-dense induction chemotherapy comprising irinotecan
      hydrochloride IV and cisplatin IV on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to
      2 courses.

      After completion of induction chemotherapy, patients undergo radiotherapy five days a week
      for approximately 7 weeks. Patients receive concurrent chemotherapy comprising cisplatin IV
      on days 1, 8, 29, and 36 and etoposide IV on days 1-5 and 29-33.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed at 6 weeks.
