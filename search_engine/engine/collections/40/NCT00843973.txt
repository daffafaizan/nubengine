      procedures, limited quantity in some individuals and donor site morbidity have lead surgeons
      to look for alternative harvest sites or sources such as allograft or osteobiologics. Of
      these alternative harvest sites is the femoral shaft. Intramedullary contents from reaming
      are composed of bone marrow, and blood and bone spicules. In this respect, the reamed
      contents are similar to the bone routinely harvested from the iliac crest. Studies have shown
      that despite the reaming process using standard reamers, cells maintain their viability and
      are able to produce new bone. However, the addition of aspiration and irrigation used in the
      RIA system could potentially compromise the harvested cell viability and limit their
      osteogenic potential. In addition, Wenisch et al. have concluded that the harvested cells
      using standard intramedullary reamers not only proceed toward osteogenic differentiation, but
      also can be directed toward neurogenic differentiation. This suggests that reaming debris is
      a viable source of stem cells as well. RIA allows for these cells to be harvested. It is our
      hypothesis that the intramedullary contents harvested using the RIA system is similar to ICBG
      in cell viability and osteogenic potential.
