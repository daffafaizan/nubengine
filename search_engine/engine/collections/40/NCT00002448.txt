      SQV SGC plus RTV plus two NRTIs of choice. Arm B receives EFV plus two NRTIs of choice. NRTIs
      approved for study use are stavudine (d4T), didanosine (ddI), zidovudine (AZT), lamivudine
      (3TC), Combivir, and zalcitabine (ddC). Abacavir is excluded. The following immunology
      variables and HIV-1 viral characteristics will be evaluated during study visits: CD4 and CD8
      cell counts; naive and memory T-cells; T-cell activation markers (HLA-DR and CD38); T-cells
      expressing T helper 1- (TH1-) and T helper 2- (TH2-) associated intracytoplasmic cytokines;
      anti-CD3 T-cell activation responses; T-cell receptor V Beta repertoire; cytotoxic
      T-lymphocyte (CTL) activity levels; lymph node histology (optional); HIV-1 qualitative
      microcultures and viral phenotyping for non-syncytium-inducing (NSI) and syncytium-inducing
      (SI) viral isolates. Laboratory determinations, adverse effects, neurological exams
      (including mental status evaluations), and lipodystrophy parameters (including fasting lipid
      profile and physical parameters) also are evaluated.
