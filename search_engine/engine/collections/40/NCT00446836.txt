      ablation, in the form of medical or surgical castration, is the cornerstone of management for
      metastatic prostate cancer; however, treatment options for a patient in whom androgen
      ablation fails are limited. Docetaxel and paclitaxel, taxanes that are cell cycle specific,
      play a major role in advanced hormone-refractory prostate cancer treatment. In preclinical
      studies, Xyotax, a conjugate of paclitaxel with enhanced permeability and retention in tumor
      tissue, has an improved therapeutic profile, with both decreased systemic drug-related
      toxicities and enhanced efficacy. Xyotax as a single agent has been studied in a broad
      variety of syngeneic and xenogeneic tumor models. Recognizing that taxanes are active in
      prostate cancer and preclinical data reports activity with Xyotax in docetaxel and paclitaxel
      resistant cell lines, there is significant rationale to develop this agent in prostate
      cancer. Thus, a phase II study is needed to evaluate the antitumor activity in two subsets of
      hormone refractory prostate cancer patients: those with no prior systemic and those with one
      prior systemic therapy.
