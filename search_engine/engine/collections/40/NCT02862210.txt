      inappropriate repetitive behaviors are common, distressing to patients and caregivers, often
      lead to institutionalization, and can be very difficult and expensive to treat. There is a
      dearth of medication for treating these symptoms in FTD. Typically, antidepressants and
      antipsychotic medications are prescribed - which low efficacy and, with the latter class,
      carry serious adverse effects such as parkinsonism and increased cardiovascular-related
      mortality. The investigators propose a study of the efficacy of lithium carbonate compared to
      placebo in the treatment of agitation, aggression, and inappropriate repetitive behaviors in
      60 patients with FTD in a randomized, double-blind, two-arm parallel 12-week trial. Lithium
      is a highly effective treatment for mania and symptoms of agitation or aggression in bipolar
      disorder. It also inhibits tau aggregation and phosphorylation, leading to considerable
      interest in its use as a disease-modifying treatment for tauopathies such as FTD and
      Alzheimer's disease. Unfortunately, earlier trials using typical doses (i.e., doses
      prescribed for treatment of bipolar disorder) showed high incidence of serious adverse
      effects (including confusion and delirium). For the study proposed study the investigators
      will: 1) use lower doses and lower target serum concentrations than have preceding trials
      (shown in preliminary data from a Columbia study and data from other labs to be
      well-tolerated) and 2) target behavioral symptoms rather than cognitive outcomes.
