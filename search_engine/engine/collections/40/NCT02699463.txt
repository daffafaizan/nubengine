    
      Patients who visit their local sleep service for OSA investigation, and are found to have
      mild OSA (AHI â‰¤ 15) from an Apnealink polygraphy (PG) home sleep test, scored as per AASM
      2007 and/or AASM 2012, will be invited to take part in the study (pre-screening).

      At the study visit, informed consent, baseline demographics, and standardised questionnaires
      will be administered. Participants will then be randomised to a CPAP treatment group or
      control group.

      After 3 months, participants will be asked to repeat the standardised questionnaires, the
      trial will then be complete and they will return to routine clinical care.
