      sensitive points; Participants in the low/non-sensitization group receive acupuncture
      treatment at the five low/non-sensitive points and all other treatment settings will be the
      same as in the high sensitization group. Patients in the waiting-list group will receive
      standard acupuncture treatment after the study is completed.
