      • To compare the effectiveness of motivational interviewing versus brief advice by conducting
      a randomized controlled trial in General Practice Setting in China.

      OUTLINE:

      This is a randomized controlled study. Patients are randomized to either the intervention arm
      or the control arm.

      • Arm I (intervention): Patients will be given a 20 minutes personal talk in the family
      physician's office during the visit. The family physicians will determine the stage of change
      in smoking cessation (precontemplative, contemplative, action, maintenance and relapse) and
      use the motivational interviewing skills during the talk. The motivational interviewing
      skills include expressing empathy, developing discrepancy, rolling with resistance,
      supporting self efficacy. Up to six phone calls will be given to the patients during the
      follow-up, using the motivational interviewing skill.

      • Arm II (control): Patients will receive brief advice for smoking cessation, lasting
      approximately 5 minutes. The risks of smoking and the advantages of quitting will be
      explained. The information provided during the talk will be standardized. No phone call will
      be given during the follow-up.
