      Smith-Magenis Syndrome (SMS), a rare (1/15,000 1/25,000) clinically recognizable yet often
      under diagnosed multiple congenital anomaly/intellectual disability (MCA/ID) syndrome (OMIM
      #182290). The syndrome is characterized by a distinct pattern of minor craniofacial and
      skeletal anomalies, expressive speech/language delays, psychomotor and growth retardation,
      and a striking neurobehavioral phenotype that includes a circadian sleep disorder. The
      majority of cases (~90%) are due to de novo interstitial deletion of chromosome 17p11.2 that
      includes the RAI1 (retinoic acid induced 1) gene; however, heterozygous RAI1 mutations
      account for about 10% of cases. While clinical variability exists, haploinsufficiency of RAI1
      (by deletion or mutation) is believed to be responsible for most of the common features that
      characterize the syndrome.

      Individuals with confirmed or clinically suspected SMS, their parents, and/or unaffected
      siblings will be enrolled in this comprehensive longitudinal natural history study. An NIH
      interdisciplinary SMS Research Team (SMS-RT) of clinical and basic science researchers, in
      collaboration with extramural investigators, will conduct comprehensive clinical and
      molecular analyses to delineate the physiological, developmental (cognitive), behavioral,
      biochemical, and cellular processes that characterize the syndrome. The protocol aims to:
      characterize the phenotypic variability, natural history and underlying pathophysiology of
      SMS; delineate the neurobehavioral phenotype with respect to sleep disturbance, cognition,
      mood and maladaptive behaviors and sensory processing dysfunction; investigate the
      physiologic and functional aspects specifically underlying delays in speech/language and
      motor development; explore genotype/phenotype correlations to identify gene(s) or modifiers
      that contribute to phenotypic variability; determine potential intervention and therapeutic
      strategies likely to improve outcome; and evaluate the psychosocial impact of SMS on the
      family system. Offsite enrollment of two pediatric comparison groups to participate in the
      Home Assessment of Sleep (HAS) are also enrolled: 1) unaffected siblings/control group; and
      2) a DD/ID-comparison group of children with developmental/intellectual disabilities
      associated with sleep disturbances.
