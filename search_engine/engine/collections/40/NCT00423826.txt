      Primary

        -  Determine the efficacy of double umbilical cord blood stem cell transplantation using a
           conditioning regimen comprising lower doses of busulfan and fludarabine phosphate and
           low-dose total body irradiation, in terms of stem cell engraftment at 60 days post
           transplantation, in patients with hematologic cancer or other diseases.

        -  Determine the merits of conducting a larger, comparative study of this regimen.

      Secondary

        -  Determine mortality within 100 days of transplantation in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot study.

        -  Reduced-intensity conditioning regimen: Patients receive busulfan IV over 3 hours on
           days -9 to -8 and fludarabine phosphate IV on days -7 to -3. Patients then undergo
           low-dose total body irradiation on day 0.

        -  Graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis: Patients receive tacrolimus IV twice daily and
           mycophenolate orally or IV three times daily beginning on day -3.

        -  CNS prophylaxis and/or treatment: Patients with a history of CNS involvement receive
           prophylactic cytarabine (Ara-C) intrathecally (IT) prior to transplant. Patients also
           undergo lumbar puncture (LP) to test for active CNS disease. Patients with cerebrospinal
           fluid positive for leukemia receive Ara-C IT every 2-3 days until a repeat LP shows no
           remaining leukemic cells. Three days after the last LP and after one final dose of
           Ara-C, patients begin the conditioning regimen.

        -  Double umbilical cord blood (UCB) donor stem cell transplantation (SCT): Patients
           undergo double UCB donor SCT on day 0.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.
