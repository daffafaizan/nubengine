      remotely. In this way, it will be ensured that individuals can apply their exercises at an
      optimum level in non-clinical settings and to prevent exercise application errors that occur
      due to the learning effect frequently observed in conventional methods. Exercise is
      considered a central element in physical therapy and rehabilitation management in patients
      with chronic neck pain. However, studies have found that improvements after physical therapy
      and rehabilitation are not preserved in the long term, and recurrence of chronic low back
      pain is common. With a more cost-effective treatment model, "telerehabilitation", it is aimed
      that patients can be followed more efficiently during their home exercise period. The aim of
      the study is to compare the video-based and telerehabilitation based home-exercise program in
      patients with chronic neck pain. It is aimed to evaluate the patients in terms of pain,
      functionality, quality of life, and exercise adherence.
