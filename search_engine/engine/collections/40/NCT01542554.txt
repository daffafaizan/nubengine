      carbohydrate. For the same amount of carbohydrate, food with lower GI value cause a lower
      post- meal rise in blood glucose concentration in both normal and diabetic patients.
      Meta-analysis of randomized controlled trial has showed that low GI diet can achieve an
      additional reduction of A1c by 0.4% when compare with usual diabetic diet. Furthermore,
      various diabetes associations have already endorsed the use of low GI diet in the management
      of diabetes.

      Hong Kong Chinese obtain most of their carbohydrate intake through consumption of rice or
      rice related foods, which are considered as having high GI value. In addition, it has been
      demonstrated that Asian have higher post-prandial rise in blood glucose than Caucasian after
      consuming the same amount of carbohydrate. When the above two factors add together, we expect
      our local type 2 diabetic patients are suffering from significant post-prandial
      hyperglycaemia, which in turn translate into elevated 24-hour hyperglycaemia and A1c.

      However, nearly all studies about glycaemic index and diabetes are conducted in Caucasian. It
      is unclear about the benefit in Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes who are currently
      having diet with high GI value.

      We therefore hypothesized that low GI diet may improve blood glucose control in Chinese type
      2 diabetic patients. To test this hypothesis, we plan to conduct this randomized controlled
      trial about low GI diet in Chinese diabetic patients.
