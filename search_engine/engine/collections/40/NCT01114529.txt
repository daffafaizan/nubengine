      adult de novo renal allograft recipients. The study consisted of a run-in period from
      transplantation to Randomization and a treatment period from Randomization until Month 24. At
      baseline visit, patients were transplanted and entered the run-in period from transplantation
      (Baseline) to Randomization (week 10-14 post-transplantation). At Week 10-14, eligible
      patients were randomized into one of the 2 treatment arms: standard CNIs and Myfortic versus
      everolimus and Myfortic and entered the treatment period of the study from Randomization to
      Month 24. Patients in both arms received steroids as per center practice and in any caseat
      least 5 mg/Day. At Randomization, patients were stratified according to their renal allograft
      function and previous cardiovascular events. The main analysis was performed at Month 12 and
      the follow-up analysis was performed at Month 24.
