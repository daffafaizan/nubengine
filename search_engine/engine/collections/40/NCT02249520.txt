      avoid administering radioisotope solely for the purposes of this calibration, we will recruit
      20 patients from the clinical population at the S. Mark Taper Foundation Imaging Center at
      CSMC who are already receiving an isotope dose for their standard-of-care examination and are
      willing to be scanned at the Research Imaging Core on the same day right after their clinical
      exam. Subjects who are having a PET-MR after receiving FDG will have the same body part
      scanned as they did for clinical testing.

      MR-only Protocol on the Biograph mMR:To set up MR-only protocols, we will enroll 20
      volunteers for MR-only on the mMR scanner. This is a standard MR scan with no isotope
      involved. Those volunteers who are participating in the MR-only scan will have major body
      parts and organs scanned as needed for calibration.

      MR imaging on the Siemens Vida 3T scanner: applications training is taking place and we will
      build clinical protocols in the future
