      occupational therapist delivered, preventative intervention to increase habit development
      (HD) of healthy dietary and physical activity behaviors, and reduce metabolic syndrome (MetS)
      among high-risk, rural breast cancer survivors (BCS). Using a pilot 1-arm pre-post design,
      investigators will implement an intervention that is personalized, low burden (the majority
      of interactions are telephone coaching sessions), and delivered during the initial
      survivorship transition. To determine the feasibility of the intervention 48
      community-dwelling rural BCS (ages 40 and older) will receive the intervention. The 12-week
      intervention consists of three home-based face-to-face consultations with the therapist, 9
      weekly habit telephone coaching sessions, and the use of implementation intentions,
      environmental modifications, and tailored text messages to support physical activity and
      dietary habit formation and address unmet needs. Feasibility metrics will be collected
      throughout the intervention. The one specific aim is:

      Aim 1. To determine the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention for rural BCS.
      Investigators will evaluate recruitment, trial engagement and retention rates, treatment
      satisfaction, and the feasibility of the data collection processes for the primary behavioral
      measures of HD.
