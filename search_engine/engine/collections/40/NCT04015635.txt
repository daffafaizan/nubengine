      hypertension. Understanding of the inflammatory and immune nature of hypertension is
      currently based on studies in rodent models of hypertension, but is supported by human
      epidemiological and genome wide association studies (GWAS) studies. It is now essential to
      identify key checkpoints and inflammatory mechanism(s) involved in human hypertension in
      comprehensive and sufficiently powered studies, which will then be able to guide subsequent
      in-depth hypothesis-driven mechanistic studies. This approach may provide the basis for
      future randomized clinical trials (RCTs).

      To define the relationships and predictive value of the immune signature of hypertension and
      clinical phenotypes of hypertension :

        -  Predictive value of immune signature for blood pressure parameters measured by
           ambulatory blood pressure measurements (ABPM)

        -  Predictive value of immune signature for endothelial function assessed by Endo-PAT2000
           and flow mediated dilatation (FMD) both complementary non-invasive techniques.

        -  Predictive value of immune signature for vascular stiffness and central pressure
           assessed by SphygmoCor

        -  Predictive value of immune signature for renal function parameters

        -  Predictive value of immune signature for cognitive function. To define genetic
           determinants of immune signature of hypertension.
