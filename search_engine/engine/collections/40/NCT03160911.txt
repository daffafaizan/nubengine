      Non-variceal bleeding accounts for more than 80-90% of the cause with gastroduodenal peptic
      ulcer being the major cause. Endoscopic haemostasis has significantly improved the outcome of
      these patients. Recurrent bleeding remains one of the most important predictors of mortality.
      Previous studies have identified ulcers that are high risk for rebleeding.

      Conventionally, endoscopic haemostasis is achieved by injection therapy, thermocoagulation or
      mechanical therapy such as haemostatic clips. However, there are limitations to
      thermo-coagulation and conventional haemostatic clips. Over the past few years, a novel
      endoscopic clipping device, the Over-The-Scope Clip (OTSC; Oversco Endoscopy AG, TÃ¼bingen,
      Germany) has become available. The device provides a robust and strong tissue apposition. The
      system was developed to close perforations and treat bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract.
      In chronic ulcers, an anchor device can be used to pull the ulcer base toward the aspiration
      cap to facilitate accurate clip application. With a larger jaw width and greater strength,
      the OTSC is expected to have superior haemostatic properties when compared to hemo-clips.
      Case series have been published on the clinical experience of OTSC on gastrointestinal
      bleeding with promising results.

      Therefore, in this randomised controlled trial, we aim to compare the efficacy of the OTSC to
      standard endoscopic therapy in primary treatment of patients with peptic ulcer bleeding that
      are of high-risk for rebleeding. The hypothesis is that the use OTSC can significantly
      decrease the rebleeding rate in this group of patients.
