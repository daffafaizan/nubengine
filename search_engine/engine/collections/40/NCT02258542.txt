      a maximum of 2200 total for the study), who complete a minimum of 16 weeks, and no more than
      40 weeks, in this study, will be given the option to transition to an open-label safety
      extension study, Study D3250C00037 (MELTEMI).

      Adolescent patients, patients from Japan and South Korea, and any patient who chooses not to
      enter Study D3250C00037 will remain in this study through IPD or EOT and FU.

      At the time of the first interim analysis in Japanese patients, the study regimen for all
      patients will become unblinded to AstraZeneca for data analysis purposes. Study conduct and
      blinding at the site and patient level will remain unchanged.
