      improve cardio-respiratory fitness (CRF) in patients with systolic heart failure.

      Participants treated with SGLT2 inhibitor Empagliflozin as standard of care will undergo
      assessments described below.

      The investigators will measure CRF with a validated cardiopulmonary exercise test at baseline
      and after 4 weeks of treatment received as standard of care, to determine whether SGLT2
      inhibition improves cardio-respiratory fitness assessed by changes in peak oxygen consumption
      (VO2)(mL/kg/min) and minute ventilation (VE)/carbon dioxide production (VCO2) slope, powerful
      independent clinical predictors of mortality in HF.
