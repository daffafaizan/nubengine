    
      This is a Phase 3 randomized, double-blind study with an 8-week, placebo-controlled period
      designed to test the effectiveness, safety, and tolerability of LV-101 in participants with
      PWS.

      Effectiveness will be measured using both caregiver-reported and clinician-reported measures
      of hyperphagia (extreme hunger), obsessive and compulsive behaviors, and anxiety. Safety and
      tolerability will be measured by adverse events, laboratory tests, and physical exams.

      After the 8-week placebo-controlled period, there will be a long-term follow-up period of 56
      weeks and an optional extension period after study week 64 during which all participants will
      receive active treatment with LV-101. At Week 8, participants who were randomized to placebo
      in the placebo-controlled period will be randomized to one of the two LV-101 doses,
      administered three times per day before meals.
