    
      Specific Aim 1: To modify the existing, efficacious Alcohol Behavioral Couple Therapy (ABCT)
      manual into a 6-session prevention protocol, called Alcohol Behavioral Couple Prevention
      (ABCP) that will be developed for delivery via in-person and telehealth platforms. The goal
      of the new ABCP is for individuals or family dyads to learn to work together to minimize
      hazardous drinking in order to effectively address other problems often present among
      returning service members.

      Specific Aim 2: To field test feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a prevention protocol
      using a successive cohort design. First, an in-person protocol will be tested with 4 National
      Guard (NG) members and then adapt and test the protocol for 4 NG members via an analog
      telehealth design. Again, the manual and accompanied materials will be revised.

      Specific Aim 3: To conduct a small Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) to compare 2 conditions
      with 22 NG Members in each: (1) In person (ABCP_P; 11 individual, 11 dyad), and (2)
      Telehealth (ABCP_T; 11 individual, 11 dyad).
