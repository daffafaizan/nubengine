      bleeding (HMB) and low Von Willebrand Factor (VWF) will be recruited.

      Data collection will occur from participant's medical records in regards to their low VWF
      activity and HMB medical history.

      Participants will be asked to complete symptom questionnaires in regards to their HMB.

      A blood sample will be collected to analyze how many participants have the disease causing
      sequence variation in the VWF gene and other genes affecting bleeding, clotting and blood
      vessel biology and correlated with their bleeding history.

      The blood sample will be deidentified and stored indefinitely for future research.
