      a result of extensive transannular patching (TAP) and considered unobjectionable. In fact,
      this is well tolerated during the first postoperative years, but today there is increasing
      evidence that the resulting chronic volume stress to the right ventricle is harmful on the
      long run, in particular if there are stenoses of the pulmonary artery in addition. Such
      stenoses, partly due to distortions after shunt surgery, together with pulmonary
      insufficiency, lead to a combined volume and pressure load of the right ventricle. The
      chronic volume stress results in a decrease in biventricular function and exercise tolerance,
      associated with increasing electrical instability with frequent, mostly ventricular,
      dysrhythmias. This constellation brings about a significantly increased risk of cardiac
      death.

      Pulmonary valve replacement can improve haemodynamics, exercise tolerance and dysrhythmia.
      However, it is still unclear, which criteria best indicate the need for re-intervention, such
      as balloon dilatations of peripheral pulmonary stenoses, and what may be the best point in
      time in infancy.

      The objective of this study is to assess the effectiveness of such interventions to the right
      ventricular function in small children. The data obtained are supposed to determine
      predictive parameters of the right ventricular recovery and to help to establish criteria for
      the necessity and time of re-intervention.
