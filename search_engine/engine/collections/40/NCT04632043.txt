      of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure associated with COVID-19 often includes mechanical
      ventilation. The optimal timing of initiation of invasive mechanical ventilation remains
      unknown.

      On the one hand, early initiation of invasive mechanical ventilation (i.e. early endotracheal
      intubation) has been advocated as a means to reduce subsequent possible aerosolization of the
      virus, as would happen by alternate means of oxygenation/ventilation allowing air leaks.
      Also, early intubation may prevent the induction of self-inflicted lung injury in patients
      who breath spontaneously and have high respiratory drive and, therefore, large transpulmonary
      pressure swings. On the other hand, delaying intubation, by trying alternate means of
      oxygenation/ventilation, may mean that some of the patients may not be intubated at all and
      therefore will be protected from the adverse events of invasive mechanical ventilation (such
      as ventilator-induced lung injury, ventilator-associated pneumonia and ventilator-induced
      diaphragmatic dysfunction). The latter strategy may also address the unavailability of enough
      ventilators to meet the increased demand of treating patients with COVID-19.

      Given that no randomized controlled trials are currently available to guide clinical practice
      regarding optimal timing of intubation, we propose a single-center randomized controlled
      feasibility trial to compare early intubation versus delayed intubation among patients with
      COVID-19 suffering from severe acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. The aim is that we gain
      experience and produce pilot data, which could inform the design of a subsequent large
      multi-center clinical trial.
