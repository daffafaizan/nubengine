      Optimal management for a first episode of this benign disease has been a matter of debate. In
      the recently published BTS guidelines [3], simple aspiration is recommended as the first-line
      treatment for all primary pneumothoraces requiring intervention because it appears to be as
      effective as chest tube drainage (CTD), as well as safe, well tolerated and feasible in an
      outpatient setting in the majority of cases [3]. When simple aspiration was unsuccessful,
      which occurred in about 15-62% of all pneumothoraces requiring intervention, chest tube
      drainage is recommended [3-12]. However, many prospective studies that have compared simple
      aspiration and tube drainage for primary spontaneous pneumothorax have shown that they are
      equally effective for treatment of primary spontaneous pneumothorax in terms of success and
      recurrence rates [4, 11, 12]. In this regard, chest tube drainage provides no benefits in
      unsuccessful aspiration of primary spontaneous pneumothorax because the rates of persistent
      air leakage and recurrence remain the same.

      Advances in video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) have made it a safe, less-invasive
      and more-effective intervention for treating recurrent pneumothorax or persistent air leakage
      after CTD [13-15]. However, the role of VATS in the management of first primary spontaneous
      pneumothorax where aspiration has failed remains unclear. Theoretically, unsuccessful
      aspiration is usually associated with large or persistent air leaks. Definitive treatment
      would include elimination of air leakage and, if possible, recurrence. Under such
      consideration, VATS with bullectomy and mechanical pleurodesis provides a good alternative in
      terms of achieving these therapeutic goals. We hypothesize that VATS is more effective than
      CTD for management of primary spontaneous pneumothorax with aspiration failure. To this end,
      we will compare two groups of patients who had experienced unsuccessful aspiration of primary
      spontaneous pneumothorax stratified by treatment.

      This study will be performed at National Taiwan University Hospital (40 patients),
      Far-Eastern Memorial Hospital (10 patients), and Min-Sheng General Hospital (10 patients). A
      total of 60 patients will be included (30 patients in each arm).
