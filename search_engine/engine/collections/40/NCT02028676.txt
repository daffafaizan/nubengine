      trial primarily evaluating two strategic approaches for management of antiretroviral therapy
      (ART) in 1200 symptomatic HIV-infected infants and children initiating ART following WHO
      guidelines in Uganda and Zimbabwe. The first strategy compares clinically driven monitoring
      (CDM) with laboratory plus clinical monitoring (LCM). In both groups, tests for toxicity
      (standard haematology and biochemistry panels) and efficacy (lymphocyte subsets including CD4
      count) will be done every 12 weeks. In LCM, all results will be returned for patient
      management. In CDM, physicians may request results from routine haematology/biochemistry
      panels if needed for clinical management, but results will not be returned routinely, and
      lymphocyte subsets will never be returned. Extra laboratory tests may be requested outside of
      the scheduled visits at any time in either group (except for lymphocyte subsets in CDM). The
      second strategy compares a continuous WHO-recommended first-line ART three-drug two-class
      regimen, comprising two Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NRTIs) plus one
      Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor (NNRTI), with induction with four drugs (two
      classes) for 36 weeks followed by maintenance with three drugs. After at least 36 and 96
      weeks on ART respectively, two further randomisations will assess simplification strategies
      which could improve long-term ART adherence (i) once versus twice daily lamivudine+abacavir
      NRTI drugs (ii) stopping versus continuing daily cotrimoxazole prophylaxis.
