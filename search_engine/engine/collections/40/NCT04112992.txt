      presenting with defects in long bones. Up to date, treatment remains challenging with little
      evidenced-based recommendations.

      For this purpose, any patient who presents at a study center with a bone defect of the
      defined expansion of any long bone is eligible for inclusion. Over a 3-year period as many
      patients as possible are included from the participating sites, at least 600 patients should
      be included in the registry. Details on any surgical intervention that is used to treat a
      bone defect will be recorded. Further patient-related and other pre-defined outcome measures
      will be collected.

      There is no formal hypothesis to this registry, hence it will help to identify prevalence and
      underlying etiologies, evaluate treatment strategies, and highlight possible challenges and
      complications - and will so help to gather clinical evidence to provide better treatment for
      patients suffering from a long bone defect.
