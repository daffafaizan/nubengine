      which one perceives these behaviors as normative. The canonical example of this phenomenon is
      taken from the U.S. literature, which has robustly shown that undergraduate students on
      college campuses tend to drink more heavily and frequently if they believe their classmates
      drink heavily and frequently, irrespective of their classmates' actual levels and frequency
      of use. However, there remains little systematic understanding about the best ways to elicit
      these perceived norms through survey-based research studies. This randomized survey
      experiment compares different ways of eliciting perceived norms.
