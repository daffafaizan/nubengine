      ischemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disease. A substantial portion of acute ischemic
      cerebrovascular disease (AICVD) patients have both cerebral and coronary atherosclerosis,
      which is an omen of poor outcomes. But there is large evidence gap in these high-risk
      patients' prognosis-related factors, limiting the improvement of care quality.

      Coexistence of Cerebral and Coronary Atherosclerosis in Acute Ischemic Cerebrovascular
      Disease Patients Registry (CoCCA) is a single-center prospective observational registry of
      patients hospitalized for AICVD with atherosclerotic changes in both cerebral and coronary
      arteries.

      This registry aims to establish quantified risk stratification and prognostic models, as well
      as suggest effective diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.

      The clinical, imaging and laboratory information will be collected at the baseline. During an
      estimated 5-year follow-up, the vessel-related diagnostic or monitoring procedures,
      treatment, functional status and new vascular events will be recorded by web-based patients'
      self-reports, investigators' regular telephone visits.
