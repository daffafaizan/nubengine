      public health problem due to the increased risk of mortality from various causes. Changes in
      respiratory system arising from obesity are well established and they include a reduction in
      compliance with an increased ventilatory work and oxygen consumption with breathing.
      Bariatric surgery is an alternative surgical treatment of obesity and patients who undergo
      this surgery are susceptible to post operative pulmonary complications as a result of obesity
      and also abdominal surgery. The inspiratory muscle training (IMT) used in pre or post
      operative period can improve muscle strength and endurance, beyond the perception of
      dyspnea.There are suggestions that the preoperative training may contribute to a best post
      operative evolution in patients, but these benefits are not clearly defined in the
      literature. The objective is to evaluate the effects of preoperative IMT in post operative
      patients undergoing gastroplasty. There will be 40 patients of bariatric surgery group in
      RibeirÃ£o Preto Medical School of both sexes, BMI>40 kg/m2 and with the appropriate inclusion
      criteria.They will be assessed by pulmonary function tests, measurement of strength and
      endurance of respiratory muscles, submaximal exercise tests, dyspnea and quality of life
      scales. All patients will receive standard treatment and will be randomly divided into two
      groups, named control group and training group, who will be trained for 4 weeks
      preoperatively. The patients will be reassessed after 4 weeks of training and on the 15th
      postoperative return day. The evolution data about pulmonary complications will be collected
      from the medical records, notes of the medical staff and physical therapy routine service.
