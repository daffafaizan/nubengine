      tissue biopsy cores using the ClariCore System for the purpose of algorithm development.

      The system algorithm will be trained to identify real-time in vivo 'Normal' versus
      'Suspicious' prostate tissue. The 'Normal' or 'Suspicious' assignment will be based on the
      optical signal principle component parameters of the measured signal when compared to a
      threshold to be derived from pathologically known values of suspicious (or possibly
      cancerous) and normal (or non-cancerous) measurements in prostate tissue.
