    
      This protocol is a six month, randomized, open label trial of risperidone versus aripiprazole
      in antipsychotic naive youth (7 - 12 years old) who have been identified by their clinical
      treatment provider as needing antipsychotic treatment of a bipolar disorder.

      This study proposes to monitor changes in metabolic parameters (body mass index percentile, %
      body fat, insulin resistance, and lipid levels) over the course of six months treatment with
      aripiprazole or risperidone in youth with a bipolar spectrum disorder. We will also assess
      possible mechanisms of second generation antipsychotic induced weight gain by monitoring
      physical activity and hunger/appetite changes over the course of treatment.
