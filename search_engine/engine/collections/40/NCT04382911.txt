      endometriosis to demonstrate FES PET-MRI's clinical utility for diagnosis of endometriosis.
      The primary objective is to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of 18F-fluoroestradiol
      (FES) PET/MRI for evaluating endometriosis. Secondary objectives include comparing PET to
      conventional MRI, using histopathology from laparotomy as the gold standard and evaluating
      association of uptake values (SUV-max) with EHP-30 and pain rating scales, controlling for
      covariates.
