    
      This study will enroll approximately 60 subjects in four cohorts of 15 subjects each. The
      cohorts may be enrolled and run in parallel or overlap; they do not have to run sequentially.
      The dosing for each cohort will be as follows:

      Cohort 1: Multiple low dose on Days 1 and 8 Cohort 2: Multiple low dose on Days 1, 3 and 5
      Cohort 3: Multiple low dose on Days 1 and 29 Cohort 4: Multiple high dose on Days 1 and 29

      All subjects receiving study drug will have safety and immunogenicity assessments completed
      through Study Day 57 following their initial vaccination. Subjects may also be evaluated for
      persistent immunogenicity at Day 180 and will be followed for safety for 12 months following
      initial vaccination (Study Day 365).
