    
      The purpose of this study is to establish a prospective observational cohort of 250
      well-characterized adults with ADPKD, and an associated biorepository of DNA, plasma, serum,
      and urine. Baseline clinical phenotyping includes measurement of renal filtration function,
      total kidney volume, clinical and family history, presence and history of renal and
      extra-renal ADPKD manifestations, cardiac function, vascular stiffness, and health-related
      quality of life.

      Prospective characterization will include the development of ADPKD complications (e.g.,
      infection, stones, cyst hemorrhage) and other acute medical events, and changes in symptoms
      and QoL.

      In addition, an electronic PKD patient registry will collect demographic and contact
      information on adults with ADPKD interested in participating in future clinical trials and/or
      observational cohort studies.

      No treatment interventions will be performed in these observational studies
