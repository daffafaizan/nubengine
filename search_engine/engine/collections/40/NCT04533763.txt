      ovarian cancer survivors cope and improve the quality of their lives following treatment. The
      programs include techniques and information to enhance both mental and physical well-being.
      The study is conducted through an internet video conferencing platform and is open to
      survivors in all parts of the US. The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of
      various factors such as emotions, stress management and coping techniques, and health
      information on quality of life, stress levels, depression, fatigue, and distress in ovarian
      cancer survivors. Participants are randomized into either a Mindful Living group (targeting
      stress management skills - e.g., relaxation, coping) or a Healthy Lifestyles group (targeting
      health promotion strategies - e.g, nutrition, sleep, exercise). Participation in this study
      includes taking part in an introductory online meeting, 10 consecutive weekly online
      sessions, and follow-up meetings at approximately 4.5 and 9 months following randomization.
      Each session will be 1.5-2 hours. Participants will complete surveys online prior to
      beginning the program, within a week after the 10-week program is completed, and at 6 months
      and 12 months later.
