      cancer. Osteoporosis can lead to bones breaking easily. Broken bones may make living
      independently challenging. Effective bone health management can reduce the risk of broken
      bones. This study will examine whether providing "osteoporosis information" to women
      diagnosed with breast cancer will promote their bone health management. With the current
      advance in technology, people are more interested in receiving information by email or
      smartphone text messaging. This study will also examine whether delivering osteoporosis
      information in different ways will change bone health management.
