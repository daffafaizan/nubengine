      abdominal surgery .Transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block is widely used in abdominal
      surgery for postoperative analgesia The transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block is
      aperipheral nerve block that involves the injection of alocal anesthetic (LA) in the plane
      between the internaloblique and transversus abdominis muscle layers, with the aim of
      anesthetizing the intercostal nerves supplyingthe abdominal wall (from T6 to L1) By blocking
      intercostal nerves T6 to L1, TAPblock efficiently blocks somatic pain after abdominalwall
      surgery

      . It providesadequate postoperative pain relief following various abdominal surgeries TAP
      block can reduce pain scores, opioid consumption, and the incidence of opioid-related
      complications after abdominal surgery.

      The duration of the TAP block is limited to theeffect of the administered LAs. Various
      adjuvantmedications have been added to the LA to prolong theduration of TAP block and magnify
      its effects .

      Perineural injection of steroids is reported to influence postoperative analgesia.

      As a synthetic glucocorticoid, triamcinolone acetonide binds to and activates the
      glucocorticoid receptor to produce anti-inflammatory responses,such as down-regulating
      pro-inflammatory cytokine expression , preventing prostaglandin and leukotriene synthesis and
      release of arachidonic acid, and activating anti-inflammatory transcription factors such as
      lipocortins
