      oxygen consumption (VO2) and carbon dioxide production (VCO2). The energy equivalent of VO2
      ranges from ~4.7-5.0 kcals/L, depending on the ratio of carbohydrate, fat, and protein
      oxidized. However, RMR can be measured based solely on VO2, because VCO2 has a relatively
      small effect on energy expenditure estimation. A device that measures RMR based on VO2 and
      eliminates the need for measuring VCO2 could provide a simple and less expensive alternative
      to metabolic carts and may have important clinical applications. The overarching goal of this
      proposal is to validate such a metabolic system by comparing its ability to accurately
      measure RMR against a metabolic cart.
