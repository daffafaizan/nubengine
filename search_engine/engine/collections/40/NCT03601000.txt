      evaluating effect of Yi-Zhi-An-Shen Granules on cognition, sleep quality, and gut microbiome
      of older adults with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). The investigators plan to
      involve 80 cases for observation in 2 years (40 cases for each group), expecting that
      cognition and sleep quality of aMCI patients can be improved by Yi-Zhi-An-Shen Granules
      versus placebo, and discussing the differences between individuals with aMCI and ones with
      normal cognition, also investigating whether this Chinese medicine compound can regulate gut
      microbiome of older individuals with aMCI.
