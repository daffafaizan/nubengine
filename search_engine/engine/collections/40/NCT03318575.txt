    
      This is a multi-center, randomized, controlled single-blind clinical trial to evaluate the
      safety and effectiveness of the autoRIC device to attenuate myocardial injury as measured by
      cardiac Troponin I (cTnI) levels in patients undergoing PCI with stent implantation.

      Eligible patients that are scheduled for an elective PCI, or unscheduled/non-emergent PCI, or
      patients scheduled for a diagnostic catheterization procedure with orders of "treat as
      indicated" will be enrolled in the study. Patients will undergo remote ischemic conditioning
      with the autoRIC device or the control procedure with the autoRIC Sham device completed â‰¤ 1
      hour prior to balloon or stent inflation. Subjects will have measurements of cTnI levels at
      baseline and 4-8 and 12-24 hours post completion of the PCI procedure. Adverse events will be
      recorded through study exit for all patients. Patients will be exited from the study after
      completion of their 30-day post-procedure telephone follow-up.
