      focusing on minimization of ischemic damage by the two-layer pancreas preservation technique,
      attenuation of posttransplant nonspecific inflammatory responses by etanercept and
      anti-thymocyte globulin, deletion/inactivation of autoreactive T cells by anti-thymocyte
      globulin and daclizumab induction immunotherapy, and potent yet non-diabetogenic maintenance
      immunosuppression with sirolimus and delayed mycophenolate mofetil instead of tacrolimus for
      the reestablishment of stable glycemic control in recipients with type 1 diabetes.
