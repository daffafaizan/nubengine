      standard first-line treatment is not clearly codified, however, many results in the
      literature show the benefit of bevacizumab (anti- angiogenic therapy) and it is often
      proposed in this indication . Tissue action, response mechanisms and therapeutic escape
      remain is poorly understood.

      The investigators hypothesize that these response mechanisms are controlled by changes in
      some parameters in the tumor tissue, such as hypoxia, neoangiogenesis, cell density and that
      multimodal imaging can help us to better understand these mechanisms.

      To identify which parameters of imaging would best measure response mechanisms, the
      investigators want to evaluate in the first study and for this particular indication , a
      property of the measure called by the Anglo -Saxon ' sensitivity to change " that is to say,
      its sensitivity or ability to measure changes. This is an additional property to the
      reproducibility of the measurement.
