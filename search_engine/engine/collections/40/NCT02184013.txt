      longstanding persistent AF is associated with success rates of 40-50% at one year.
      Experimental models have shown that AF results in progressive structural changes due to
      electrical atrial remodeling, where AF burden correlates with atrial fibrosis. The optimal
      ablation strategy for patients with PeAF is not yet known. There is limited understanding of
      the critical mechanisms responsible for maintenance of AF in these patients.

      In this study ECG body mapping (ECGI) will be used to look for distinct electrical rotors in
      the atria. Delayed gadolinium enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DE-MRI) will be used to
      assess the extent of left atrial fibrosis. In addition to PVI catheter ablation procedure, an
      ablation strategy guided by the results of the ECGI mapping and DE-MRI will be performed.A
      C-metahydroxyepherdrine (HED) PET scan will also be done pre-ablation to evaluate left atrial
      sympathetic denervation and any relationship to the initiation and/or maintenance of AF.

      Subjects will be seen at 3 and 6 months after ablation, with 12 lead ECG and 2-week loop
      monitoring done at each visit.
