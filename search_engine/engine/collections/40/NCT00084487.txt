      I. Determine the objective response rate in patients with limited or extensive stage small
      cell lung cancer that relapsed after prior first-line chemotherapy when treated with
      rebeccamycin analogue as second-line therapy.

      II. Determine the duration of remission and survival of patients treated with this drug.

      III. Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive rebeccamycin analogue IV over 1 hour on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 21
      days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed annually.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-39 patients will be accrued for this study within 15 months.
