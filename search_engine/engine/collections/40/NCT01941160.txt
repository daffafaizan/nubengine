      as a stool frequency ≥ 3 per day and/or stool consistency ≥ 5 (Bristol Stool Score) for at
      least 2 days will be lower in the group receiving Lacidofil® STRONG compared to the group
      receiving placebo and therefore mean Bristol Stool Scores will be lower in subjects receiving
      Lacidofil® STRONG compared to those receiving placebo.
