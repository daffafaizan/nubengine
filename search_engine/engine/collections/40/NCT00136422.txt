      patients with myelodysplasia and acute myelogenous leukemia. These harvested tumor cells will
      be modified by adenoviral mediated gene transfer to secrete granulocyte-macrophage colony
      stimulating factor (GM-CSF).

      Patients will be administered vaccines at one of three dose levels (as determined by total
      cell yield). Vaccinations will be given weekly for three weeks, followed by every other week
      until the vaccine supply is exhausted or when patients are removed from the study.

      The patient will receive a minimum of six vaccinations, but more will be administered if the
      vaccine is available.

      During the course of the study, patients will be tested to see how their immune system is
      reacting to the vaccinations. Testing will include bloodwork evaluating the immune cells in
      the body at monthly intervals. Skin biopsies may also be performed to see if an immune
      reaction is occuring at the injection site.

      During the first course of treatment, a bone marrow biopsy and aspirate may be performed
      monthly.

      The length of time on this study depends upon the number of vaccines available and whether or
      not unacceptable side effects occur.
