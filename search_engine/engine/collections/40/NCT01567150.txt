      the extracellular matrix through the activity of proteinases and other enzymes. Wound fluids
      can provide biochemical information about the healing status of chronic wounds and the
      effects of wound treatments. In this study the investigators will obtain samples of wound
      fluid and measure healing in wounds randomized to receive the novel dressing or a control.
      The findings will be compared between the two groups.
