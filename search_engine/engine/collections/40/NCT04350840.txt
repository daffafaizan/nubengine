      University Hospital Healthcare System Gangnam Center. This study is composed of two periods.
      First, an education program on predicting polyp histology and real-time optical diagnosis
      will be performed by 8 endoscopists From February to March 2020. In the second period from
      April 2020 till October 2020(total 6 months), real-time optical diagnosis with time drill for
      diminutive and small colorectal polyps will be activated. Endoscopists will have 3 seconds
      rule to make high confidence diagnosis and have feedbacks on their accuracy of optical
      diagnosis for polyps per 3 months. The performance will be evaluated by comparing the
      optically predicted diagnosis with the actual histologic diagnosis. Negative predictive value
      for the prediction of non-neoplastic polyp and concordance of surveillance intervals for
      diminutive polyps diagnosed optically with high confidence will be measured.
