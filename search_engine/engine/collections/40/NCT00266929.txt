        -  Patients receiving surgical management will exhibit better disease specific health and
           general health related quality of life measures compared to those managed
           conservatively.

        -  The rate of radiographic bony fusion will be greater among elderly patients receiving
           surgical fixation compared to patients receiving conservative management.

        -  The rate of non union will be greater in the conservative group compared to the surgical
           group.

        -  The complication rate will be higher in the surgical group due to the nature of the
           intervention though the rate of severe and serious complications will be low.
