      I. Overall response rate (ORR).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Progression free survival (PFS). II. Overall survival (OS). III. Disease control rate
      (DCR). IV. Duration of response. V. Safety and tolerability.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive trifluridine and tipiracil hydrochloride (TAS-102) orally (PO) twice daily
      (BID) on days 1-5 and oxaliplatin intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on day 1. Cycles repeat
      every 14 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 28 days.
