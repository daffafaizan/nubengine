      PsA diagnosis. Patients will be randomized to receive a PsA screening questionnaire
      (intervention group) or not receive a questionnaire (control group). Rates of rheumatologic
      evaluations and new PsA diagnoses will be compared between the groups, using EMRs to
      longitudinally track outcomes.

      Intervention group patients who through the completion of the PsA Screening questionnaire
      positively self-screen for an elevated PsA risk will either be randomly invited to directly
      access a rheumatology appointment or instructed to talk with their doctor about a
      rheumatology referral. We will compare rates of rheumatologic evaluations and new PsA
      diagnoses between these groups to identify the best method for accessing rheumatology
      appointments.

      To determine if PsA patients diagnosed after receiving a screening questionnaire differ from
      patients diagnosed via usual care; investigators will examine disease duration, severity, and
      comorbidities in patients receiving and not receiving the screening questionnaire.
