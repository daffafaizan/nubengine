      adults has been associated with reduced risk of upper respiratory tract infections including
      influenza A infection. The rationale for giving 25(OH)D3 rather than vitamin D3 is to rapidly
      improve the vitamin D status of the subjects who are at high risk of acquiring COVID 19 or
      who are infected by this very aggressive viral infection. It takes approximately 6-8 weeks to
      achieve a steady state blood level of 25(OH)D when ingesting a daily dose of vitamin D3
      whereas ingesting 25(OH)D3 results in a rapid rise in its blood level reaching steady state
      within 48 hours. Based on the available literature it is reasonable to consider the
      possibility that vitamin D deficiency could increase risk of acquiring COVID 19 infection and
      exacerbating its infectivity and the body's cytokine response to it. It therefore seems
      plausible that the rapid improvement in vitamin D status by providing 25(OH)D3 may contribute
      to reducing the severity of illness caused by COVID-19, particularly in settings where
      hypovitaminosis D is frequent especially in people of color. Arguably, there is little
      evidence to date that improving the vitamin D status will reduce the infectivity risk or
      mitigate the devastating health consequences of COVID-19 infection. The proposed study to
      rapidly improve vitamin D status in adults who are at high risk of acquiring COVID- 19 or who
      are at risk for its morbidity and mortality will test the veracity of this evidence based
      hypothesis. Results from this study, especially if positive, would have far reaching global
      health consequences. Vitamin D3, vitamin D2 and 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 are readily available
      worldwide and could be quickly instituted as a rapid cost-effective method to help combat
      this pandemic.
