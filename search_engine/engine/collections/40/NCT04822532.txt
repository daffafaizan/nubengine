      presence of fludarabine) to receive their first dose of busulfan according to:

        1. the most performing method based on age and weight - McCune's model (control arm)

        2. a method that also considers a pharmacogenetic factor (variants occurring in the
           promoter region of the GSTA1 gene) in association with the co-administered
           chemotherapeutic agent fludarabine in the dose personalization (experimental arm)

      This is an international study being carried out in five countries (Canada, Italy,
      Switzerland, France, and Denmark).
