      evaluate the microcirculation of the musculoskeletal system. We believe that this will be a
      valuable research tool into diseases of the microcirculation, and in the future may also
      offer a clinical benefit by quantifying and monitoring disease over time and after
      intervention. It may also allow targeting of therapies towards those patients most at risk of
      ulcers and peripheral neuropathy, and those that would get the maximum benefit from these
      therapies.
