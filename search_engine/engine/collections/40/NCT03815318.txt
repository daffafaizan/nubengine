    
      After subjects pass screening, prophylaxis with 25 - 50 IU/kg of SCT800 shall be administered
      once every other day or three times per week for 6 months. Subjects shall receive FVIII
      intravenous injection treatment at the study site or at home. During the study prophylaxis
      treatment period, subjects should return for visit every four weeks, namely for Visit (V) 2
      (4 weeks ± 4 days), Visit 3 (8 weeks ± 4 days), Visit 4 (12 weeks ± 4 days), Visit 5 (16
      weeks ± 7 days), Visit 6 (20 weeks ± 7 days), Visit 7 (24 weeks ± 7 days) and
      end-of-treatment (EOT) visit (+ 14 days). Of which, blood collection shall be carried out
      during the screening period and in V1, V2, V4, V7 and the EOT visit for FVIII inhibitor
      assay; blood collection shall be carried out before and after the completion of SCT800
      infusion in V1, V4 and V7 for incremental in-vivo recovery (IVR) assay.

      FVIII:C activity shall be monitored before injection and 15minutes(min), 30min, 1h, 3h, 6h,
      9h, 12h, 24hours(h), 28h, 32h and 48h after injection at V1 and V7. Then pharmacokinetics
      parameters (incremental in-vivo recovery, t1/2 etc.) of SCT800 shall be calculated and
      evaluated.

      5 subjects may receive elective surgical treatment within the prophylaxis treatment period
      (after the first drug administration in day 0).
