      hypertension, dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance. Weight gain is implicated in the
      increased cardiovascular risk and the long-term loss of graft function. Weight loss achieved
      by a suitable dietary intervention in these patients transplanted kidney can correct lipid
      disorders and facilitate balance blood pressure. The identification of mechanisms responsible
      for weight gain would suggest prevention strategies and allow to align the caloric energy
      needs of renal transplant patients.
