      in the U.S., is a heterogeneous clinical entity in which retinal degeneration occurs
      predominantly in the macula in the context of aging and leads to impairment primarily of
      central visual acuity. AMD occurs in two general forms, one of which involves subchoroidal
      neovascularization with subsequent formation of a disciform scar. A second form, and the
      subject of this study, is termed "dry" or atrophic macular degeneration and involves a
      constellation of clinical features that can include drusen, pigment clumping and/or retinal
      pigment epithelium (RPE) dropout, and geographic atrophy. Geographic atrophy can begin as a
      thinning of the RPE with involvement of the underlying choriocapillaris and lead subsequently
      to an atrophic change in the macula. The only therapy for persons with atrophic AMD is an
      oral supplement containing high doses of antioxidants and zinc, which was tested by the
      National Eye Institute (NEI) in a large, multicenter, double-masked, placebo-controlled
      clinical trial with average participant follow-up of about 6 years. This antioxidant therapy
      was shown to modestly retard the progression of dry AMD from an intermediate stage to the
      advanced stages and demonstrated the benefit of antioxidant therapy in this disease.

      In this study, we will evaluate Othera Pharmaceuticals' OT-551 antioxidant eye drop for
      chronic treatment of the dry form of AMD. This single-center, open-label, study of up to 10
      participants with bilateral geographic atrophy is designed to characterize the safety of 0.45
      percent concentration of OT-551 eye drops, given 3 times a day, on participants with
      geographic atrophy area for up to three years. Participants will have one eye randomized to
      receive the eye drop and the fellow eye will be observed.
