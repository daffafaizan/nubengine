      and efficacy of sorafenib in addition to TACE in patients diagnosed with unresectable HCC,
      but this will also be the first clinical trial with sorafenib to assess the effects of this
      novel therapy on HRQL. Understanding the effects of sorafenib on HRQL is critical in the
      treatment of HCC secondary to the modest benefits in survival that have been reported with
      conventional therapies. Our team has one of the largest experiences in evaluating HRQL in
      patients diagnosed with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. We have previously reported on
      alternative methods of evaluating HRQL, solutions for missing data in clinical trials as well
      as tested statistical and clinically meaningful differences, within and between treatment
      groups, in clinical trials with patients diagnosed with hepatobiliary carcinoma.
