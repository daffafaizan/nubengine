      However, there is a poor correlation between degree of thrombocytopenia and bleeding risk. A
      better marker of bleeding risk suitable for use in neonates could help physicians more
      accurately determine the risk/benefit ratio of platelet transfusions, guiding platelet
      transfusion decisions, and potentially protecting vulnerable infants from exposure to
      unnecessary transfusion-related risks. The investigators recently found that the Platelet
      Function Analyzer (PFA) Closure Time-Collagen/ADP (CT-ADP) was a better marker of bleeding
      than the platelet count in preterm neonates. However, the CT-ADP requires 0.8 mL blood
      limiting its potential widespread use. The Immature Platelet Fraction (IPF) is a new
      laboratory marker measuring the % newly released and more active platelets, measured from the
      same sample as the platelet count. This is a prospective observational study designed to
      evaluate IPF as marker of bleeding risk in thrombocytopenic neonates admitted to the Neonatal
      Intensive Care Unit, compared to platelet counts alone. And also, to validate the previously
      found association between PFA-100/200 CT-ADP and bleeding in a bigger cohort, to compare the
      IPF with the PFA-100/200 CT-ADP as bleeding predictors and to assess whether the PFA-100/200
      CT-ADP combined with the IPF is able to predict bleeding in thrombocytopenic preterm
      neonates.
