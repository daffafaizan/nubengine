      intervention. The RE-AIM Framework includes criteria to evaluate the impact and translation
      of an intervention at both individual and organizational-levels in order to promote uptake,
      transferability and ultimately enhance the public health impact of health promotion
      interventions.

      Specific study objectives are: 1) To determine the extent (proportion of sessions attended,
      frequency, intensity, time, type) to which adults with HIV participate in a CBE intervention;
      2) To assess the effect of a CBE intervention on disability and health outcomes and intrinsic
      and extrinsic factor outcomes for people living with HIV; 3) To assess engagement in CBE for
      adults with HIV over time (adherence, level of physical activity); and 4) To evaluate the
      process (strengths and challenges; feasibility; accessibility, long term sustainability) of
      implementing a CBE intervention within the community from the perspective of recreation
      providers (fitness instructors; managers) and people living with HIV.

      Investigators will conduct a prospective longitudinal study using mixed methods to evaluate a
      CBE intervention in the community with people living with HIV. They will use an interrupted
      time series (ITS) design in combination with qualitative interviews to assess outcomes at
      baseline (pre-testing phase), during (intervention phase) and after the CBE intervention
      (post-testing phase) to evaluate the short- and long-term effect of CBE.
