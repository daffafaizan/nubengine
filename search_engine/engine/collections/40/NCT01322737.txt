      The colectomy or gastrectomy specimen will be prepared on a side table for an ex vivo
      endoscopic procedure. The ends of the stomach or colon, if not already stapled closed will be
      ligated to allow for insufflation. The endoscope will be placed into the excised organ and
      the SuMO System devices will be deployed away from any areas of excised pathologic tissue, so
      as not to disrupt the pathologist's evaluation of the excised tissue. The specimen will then
      be opened and grossly examined for the actual completeness of the submucosal pocket and
      resection. Mucosal and muscular wall disruptions will be assessed. Again, no interference in
      the underlying pathology will be performed. If sufficient specimen is present, the SuMO
      procedure may be repeated on the same specimen.

      Following the performance of the EMR by the SUMO balloon system on the ex vivo colon
      specimen, both the resected piece of tissue and the site of resection will be evaluated
      pathologically by H and E staining. Specifically, the depth of resection in the ex vivo colon
      specimen will be determined. In addition, the level of dissection on the removed piece of
      mucosa will also be identified.

      During this procedure still images or a video recording maybe captured, however all images
      will be taken of the removed specimen. There will not be any patient identifiers on any of
      the images or DVD's taken during the procedure.

      No clinical follow up is required, as the treated area will have already been resected and
      there is no risk to the patient.
