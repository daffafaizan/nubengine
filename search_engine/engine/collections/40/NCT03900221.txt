    
      METHODOLOGY Prospective, observational, multicentric and national epidemiological study,
      within the scope of the OFSEP, including all groups of patients eligible to participate in
      the Observatoire Français de la Sclérose en Plaque (OFSEP) (definite MS, radiologically
      isolated syndromes, clinically isolated syndromes, neuromyelitis optica (NMO) and NMO
      spectrum disorders), with no age limit and an ongoing pregnancy. Women will be followed
      during pregnancy and in the year after and their children until 6 years of age.

      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS To be determined for each specific question. EXPECTED RESULTS
      Interactions between pregnancy and MS course have been well characterized before the
      therapeutic era. Neurologists and patients are lacking information to weigh benefits and
      risks of DMDs used immediately before or during pregnancy, including short and long-term
      risks to the mother and to the child, but also after delivery. This study should help provide
      better answers to those questions as well as to still controversial questions about
      locoregional analgesia and breastfeeding. By following these patients within the Observatoire
      Français de la Sclérose en Plaque (OFSEP) cohort, the investigator will also have access to a
      comprehensive description of MS before pregnancy but also in the long term.
