    
      Patients undergoing free flap reconstructive surgery for head and neck cancer with
      preoperative radiotherapy will be randomized to either remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC)
      group or control group. On the day of surgery, after induction of anesthesia, RIPC,
      consisting of 4 cycles of 5-min ischemia (using pneumatic cuff pressure of 200 mmHg) followed
      by 5-min reperfusion at the upper arm, or sham-RIPC (pressure < 10 mmHg) will be induced in
      the RIPC or control group, respectively. Before completion of surgery, RIPC or sham-RIPC will
      be repeated. Tissue oxygen saturation and skin temperature of the flap will be recorded until
      postoperative day 1.

      As a sub-study, blood samples will be obtained before and after RIPC/sham-RIPC. From them,
      plasma dialysate will be prepared to use for Langendorff isolated heart model. Myocardial
      infarct size of Langendorff rat heart will be compared between the groups to evaluate organ
      protective effects of RIPC during free flap reconstructive surgery.
