      subject and then platelet-rich plasma (PRP) prepared from the same blood sample by six
      different methods. The platelet count will be measured in each PRP preparation and compared
      to the CBC platelet count to determine the platelet yield for each method.

      In the second phase of the study a baseline CBC platelet count will be performed on each
      subject and then platelet-rich plasma (PRP) prepared from the same blood sample by six
      different methods. The CBC platelet count will be used to calculate the estimated platelet
      content of each sample/method based on the platelet yields determined in the first phase. The
      platelet count will be measured in each PRP preparation and compared to the estimated
      platelet content to determine the predictive accuracy for each method.
