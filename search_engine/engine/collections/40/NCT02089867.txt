      ezetimibe both reduce cholesterol absorption in the intestine by different mechanisms and
      effectively reduce LDL cholesterol (LDL-c) plasma levels. Although, the associated usage of
      ezetimibe to plants sterols in coronary patients not reaching recommended lipid levels
      despite the use of statins has not yet been demonstrated. Objectives: Evaluate if ezetimibe
      10mg associated to plant sterols spread enriched with 2g of plant sterols in coronary
      patients not reaching recommended lipid levels despite the use of statins is able to reduce
      cholesterol levels after 6 week treatment. Methods: Prospective, open-label study with both
      male and female patients with stable coronary disease and LDL > 70mg/dL. Patients will be
      randomized for the following 6 week treatment: control group (CT) no additional statin
      therapy, ezetimibe group (EZ) 10 mg/day ezetimibe, plant sterol group (PS) spread enriched
      with 2g of plant sterols or ezetimibe+plant sterols group (EZ+PS) 10mg/day EZ + 2g PS.
      Anthropometric evaluations and laboratory exams (blood glucose test, total cholesterol,
      LDL-c, HDL-c, triglycerides, and C-Reactive Protein) will be performed in all groups at
      baseline and after the sixth week intervention.
