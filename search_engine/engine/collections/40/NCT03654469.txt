    
      A prospective screening study based on questionnaires and electronic mini-spirometry (Néo-6®)
      that includes a representative sample of dairy farmers from the departments of Morbihan and
      Île-et-Vilaine in Brittany.

      The dairy farmers had an occupational medicine appointment and, if they demonstrated at least
      one marker of possible bronchial obstruction (chronic cough, chronic bronchitis, dyspnoea,
      wheezing, spirometry), they were referred to a pulmonologist.
