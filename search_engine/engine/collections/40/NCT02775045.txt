      mucosa. Although incompletely understood, the pathophysiology of Eosinophil Esophagitis is
      thought to include food allergen driven inflammation in the esophageal mucosa that triggers
      release of mediators for recruitment of eosinophils. The mediators, such as eotaxin, invoke
      eosinophil activation and trafficking into the esophageal tissue. The subsequent release of
      mediators from eosinophils and other cells, including mast cells and basophils, promotes
      inflammation and fibrosis resulting in Eosinophil Esophagitis symptoms. This protocol focuses
      on early eosinophil activation events in Eosinophil Esophagitis in the peripheral
      circulation, specifically activation of surface Î²1 integrin, as a biomarker for disease
      activity reflecting eosinophils destined for trafficking into the esophagus. Demonstrating a
      correlation between disease activity and a peripheral biomarker may ultimately facilitate a
      timelier, less invasive and less costly management strategy for Eosinophil Esophagitis.
