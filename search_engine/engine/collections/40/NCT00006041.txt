      adjuvant QS21 in patients with ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal epithelial cancer. II.
      Determine the dose of this treatment regimen for optimal antibody response in these patients.
      III. Determine the effect of immunization with this treatment regimen on the T-cell response
      in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of glycosylated MUC-1-KLH vaccine. Patients receive
      glycosylated MUC-1-KLH vaccine and QS21 subcutaneously once a week on weeks 1-3, 7, and 19.
      Cohorts of 6 patients receive escalating doses of glycosylated MUC-1-KLH until the dose for
      optimal antibody response without unacceptable toxicity is determined. Patients are followed
      at 2 and 12 weeks, and then every 3 months thereafter as long as detectable immunity against
      MUC-1 persists.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-24 patients will be accrued for this study.
