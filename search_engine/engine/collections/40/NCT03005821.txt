      diarrhea for hundreds of years (since Ming Dynasty). The history of Chinese pediatric massage
      for health promotion is much longer, it can be traced back to more than one thousand years
      ago (652 AD). Many of the acupoints adopted in Chinese pediatric massage are unique if it is
      compared with those for adult massage. The manipulation is found to be easily accepted by
      children, as the strength of massage is gentle and soft. No severe adverse reaction in
      regards of Chinese pediatric massage was reported, the mild adverse reaction such as skin
      abrasion can be completely avoided with correct operating instructions.
