    
      OA is the most common rheumatic disease and the most important from the social-economic point
      of view because of its frequency, causing functional impairment and disability in older
      people, important health resource utilization and costs (drugs, physical therapies, spa
      therapy, surgical prothesis, early retirement).

      Thermal therapy is one of the most commonly used non-pharmacological approaches for OA, but
      it is still being discussed and its role in modern medicine is still not clear. The action
      mechanisms of mud packs and thermal baths are not completely known, and it is difficult to
      distinguish the effects of thermal applications from the benefits that could be derived from
      a stay in a spa environment. Furthermore, there are no data about cost analysis of spa
      therapy in OA.

      The aim of this study is to analyze for the first time the cost/effectiveness- cost/utility
      for spa therapy in comparison to conventional treatments in knee OA (one-year-follow-up)and
      to assess changes of some biomarkers or mediators of cartilage damage in order to identify
      new possible mechanisms of action of spa therapy in rheumatic diseases.
