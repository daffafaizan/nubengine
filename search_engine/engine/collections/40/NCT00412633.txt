      intervention to improve physical activity and dietary behaviors in overweight and moderately
      obese men age 25 through 55 years. The study will complement our currently funded NCI project
      evaluating a similar intervention among overweight female primary care patients. Overweight
      is related to multiple cancers, CVD, and NIDDM, and the prevalence of overweight is
      increasing rapidly (NIH 1998). Patient-centered Assessment and Counseling for Exercise plus
      Nutrition - Internet (PACEi) targets weight-related behaviors and gives patients a tool for
      addressing these behaviors with their primary care practitioners should they choose to do so.
      PACEi includes a web-based assessment and progress planning tool, and 12 months of tailored
      Internet and telephone contact. The components are integrated through a common theoretical
      framework. Subjects will be randomized to PACEi or to a low intensity intervention.
