      led to a decrease in length of stay without compromising patient safety and clinical outcome
      . In recent years outpatient THA and TKA has gained popularity, especially as major focus is
      placed on reducing cost and increasing efficiency in all medical treatments . Studies have
      shown outpatient arthroplasty to be feasible both for THA and TKA patients , with up to 70%
      of unselected patients being potentially eligible for outpatient surgery. Various results are
      published on success rate of discharged patients on the day of surgery, ranging from 25% to
      99% , depending on patient selection and logistic setup. While the majority of published
      studies utilizes a modern fast-track setup with early mobilization and multimodal pain
      treatment, the optimal logistic setup remains unknown.

      The purpose of this single center randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to investigate whether
      outpatient arthroplasty surgery in a dedicated daycare facility will improve discharge on day
      of surgery, as opposed to surgery followed by subsequent stay in the ward and also same day
      discharge, without compromizing safety and outcome.
