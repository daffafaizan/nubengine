    
      This study will be performed at two sites and two-hundred and fifty (250) healthy male and
      female subjects will be included. Treatments comprise single doses of an experimental
      Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) and Nicorette Freshfruit gum 4 mg, which are chewed during
      30 minutes. All subjects will be given both treatments in a crossover setting. The length of
      the time interval separating treatment visits, and during which no NRT must be used, will be
      at least 36 hours.

      The subjects will abstain from smoking from 8 pm the evening before until the end of each
      visit. The subjects will take the gums according to instructions from the study personnel.
      After chewing, used gums will be collected for nicotine analysis.

      Electronic diaries will be used to collect data. Urges to smoke will be scored on a 100 mm
      visual analogue scale (VAS) before the start of treatment and during 5 hours thereafter.
      Subjects will also be monitored to capture any adverse events that may occur.
