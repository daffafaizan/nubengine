      balding, or hereditary thinning. In AGA, there is a gradual transformation of large terminal
      hair follicles to miniaturized ones under the influence of circulating androgens that produce
      smaller and finer hairs with a shorter anagen cycle. This transformation, which can be seen
      as early as the prepubescent years, occurs only in certain regions of the scalp: the frontal
      hairline, top and vertex scalp. The temporo-occipital region is largely unaffected even in
      those with extensive balding.

      The first drug to be approved for the FDA for the treatment of AGA was topical minoxidil
      solution (TMS). Despite its successful use, the mechanism of action of TMS is not well
      understood. Minoxidil is a potent vasodilator and potassium channel opener, but its mechanism
      of action in promoting hair regrowth appears to be independent of its vasodilation
      properties. Improved knowledge of the changes in gene expression associated with AGA before
      and after treatment with TMS and compared to placebo may lead to a greater understanding of
      the underlying mechanisms of action of TMS. Furthermore, there is potential for
      identification of those patients who would best respond to or benefit from treatment.
