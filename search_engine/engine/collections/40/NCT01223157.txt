      treatments of this chronic disease are still lacking. A better understanding of the systems
      that regulate energy balance and eating behavior is mandatory to better understand the
      disease and find appropriate treatments. The endocannabinoid system (ECS) which comprises
      cannabinoid receptors, such as CB1 and CB2, endogenous ligands (named endocannabinoids) and
      specific biosynthetic and degradative pathways is a key system in the regulation of energy
      balance and obesity. Obesity is characterised by an hyperactivity of the system both in
      animal and humans. Moreover, the activity of the ECS is influenced by feeding status although
      only one study has only been performed in humans. The investigation of the ECS in humans
      needs invasive procedure (blood sampling or adipose or liver biopsy). The aim of our study is
      to evaluate a new tool for the ECS evaluation in humans i e the determinations of saliva
      concentration of endocannabinoids both in normal weight and obese subjects before and after
      food intake. Blood and saliva sampling will be performed after an overnight fast, one hour
      before, just before and one hour after a lunch in12 normal weight subjects and 12 obese
      characterised with anthropometric (Weight, height, BMI (Body Mass Index), waist
      circumference, blood pressure) and metabolic (glycaemia, insulin, lipid profile, liver
      profile) evaluations. The endocannabinoids concentrations will be measured with mass
      spectrometry in blood and saliva and gut hormones (PYY (peptide YY) and ghrelin) will be
      measured in plasma.
