      The purpose of this study is to allow currently enrolled participants to complete their
      three-year course of subcutaneous Copper Histidinate treatment under the protocol. We
      hypothesize that subcutaneous injections of this drug will raise serum copper levels and
      ceruloplasmin levels in enrolled participants, improve neurodevelopmental and neurological
      outcomes, and reduce mortality compared to untreated affected subjects.

      Objectives:

      -Primary Objective: Evaluate responses to Copper Histidinate treatment for clinical care.

      Endpoints:

      -Completion of three years treatment by 13 remaining subjects

      Study Population:

      The 13 remaining subjects

      Phase: Clinical Care/Treatment only

      Description of Sites/Facilities Enrolling Participants: The study will occur at the NIH
      Clinical Center

      Description of Study Intervention:

      The study intervention is administration of Copper Histidinate in dose(s) prescribed as
      follows: 250 microgram sc b.i.d. in infants up to 12 months of age, and 250 microgram sc q.d.
      for infants and children older than 12 months. The total duration of copper histidinate
      treatment will not exceed three years.

      Study Duration:

      The estimated time from when the study opens to enrollment until completion is approximately
      151 months (02/27/2009-09/30/2021). (May end sooner pending FDA new drug approval.)

      Participant Duration:

      The time it will take for each individual participant to complete all participant visits is
      approximately 36 months. There are 13 subjects with a total of 31 visits to complete.
