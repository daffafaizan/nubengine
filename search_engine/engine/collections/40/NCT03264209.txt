      intellectual and social abilities of an individual affected by cancer. Internet-and
      mobile-based lifestyle intervention have emerged as potential modalities to complement and
      increase accessibility to after-care. In order to meet the growing need for after-care
      services, we developed a Smart after-care system that will assess the efficacy of a web-based
      smartphone-enabled intervention. The system provided specialized tools on after-care of
      prostate cancer including information on nutrition, physical activity, medication adherence,
      and mobile device that can connect to the smartphone. Patients with prostate cancer on
      androgen deprivation therapy will be screened for having adequate musculoskeletal and
      cardiopulmonary function.The study design is a randomized controlled trial. The patients were
      randomly assigned to intervention or usual care groups. Intervention patients received Smart
      After-Care management for 3 months. Primary endpoint was an increase in patients' physical
      function as assessed using 2 minute walking test. Secondary endpoints included improvement in
      muscle strength, short physical performance battery, body composition, and health-related
      quality of life.
