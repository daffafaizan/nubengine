      study subjects will undergo cryoablation using the 28 mm Arctic Front™ Cryoablation Catheter.
      A double transseptal approach will be followed in all study patients, allowing for use of
      regular guide wire and circular mapping catheter, respectively, if required.

      Use of the 20 mm Achieve™ circular mapping catheter is preferred. The 15 mm AchieveTM
      catheter may be used at the physician's discretion. If stable balloon positions cannot be
      obtained, the Achieve™ catheter will be replaced by a regular guide wire and pulmonary vein
      isolation will be assessed by a circular mapping catheter (Lasso™; Biosense Webster)
      introduced through a second transseptal puncture. Cryoablations will be applied for 5 minutes
      each. Premature terminations will be allowed at the physician's discretion but should be
      avoided to allow for detection of late pulmonary vein isolation during cryoenergy
      application. Cryoballoon catheter manipulations (e.g., pull down maneuver) may be performed
      during energy application. During ablation of septal pulmonary veins, electrical phrenic
      nerve stimulation will be performed to exclude phrenic nerve palsy. If additional single
      point ablations are required to achieve electrical isolation of pulmonary veins, a linear
      cryocatheter (Freezor™ Max; Medtronic) will be used.
