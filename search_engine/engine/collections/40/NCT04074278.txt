      University First Hospital.Two equations for estimating LBM based on midarm muscle
      circumference (MAMC) or hand grip strength (HGS)were developed and validated in CKD patients
      with dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) as referenced gold method. Demographic data,
      comorbidity, and other clinical variables were also recorded.
