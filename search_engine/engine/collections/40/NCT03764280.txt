      physician adjusted basal-bolus parameters using a randomized parallel clinical trial in
      children and adolescents at a Camp Carowanis. The investigators hypothesize that using this
      optimization algorithm will be non-inferior to the physician-adjusted basal-bolus parameters
      regarding time spent in target glucose range (3.9 mmol/L - 10mmol/L).

      Between 40 and 68 children and adolescent type 1 diabetes patients undergoing MDI treatment
      at Camp Carowanis will randomly undergo one of two interventions:

        1. MDI with Physician Adjusted Basal-Bolus Parameters: Participants will be wearing the
           Freestyle Libre glucose sensor (Abbott Diabetes Care). Participants will undergo their
           conventional multiple daily injection (MDI) therapy. At breakfast, the research team
           will download the sensor data. Camp physicians will review each participant's sensor and
           insulin data and make changes to their parameters based on their clinical judgement, as
           they would for all campers, regardless of study participation. These new parameters will
           be entered into the patient's camp file.

        2. MDI with Basal-Bolus Optimization Algorithm Adjusted Basal-Bolus Parameters:
           Participants will be wearing the Freestyle Libre glucose sensor (Abbott Diabetes Care).
           At breakfast, the data from the glucose sensor and injection information will be entered
           into a computer and the optimization algorithm will be run. Camp physicians will review
           the algorithm's recommendations before they are entered into the patient's camp file.
