    
      Specific Aim #1: To assess environmental health-related risk and outcomes in a low income
      peri-urban area of Zambia with a high percentage of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA)
      (longitudinal observational cohort study and baseline) (Year 1). We will assemble a rich
      dataset on environmental health-related risk factors in a well defined population, with a
      focus on household drinking water quality and other water, sanitation, and hygiene (WSH)
      exposures.

      Specific Aim #2: To quantify the WSH-related disease burden among PLWHA, compared with those
      without HIV/AIDS (individual and household level stratification) (conclusion of baseline).
      After nine months of data collection, we will perform an initial analysis to determine
      WSH-related risk by HIV status.

      Specific Aim #3: To assess the impact of a water quality intervention on the longitudinal
      prevalence of Highly Credible Gastrointestinal Illness (HCGI) among PLWHA (randomized
      controlled trial, year 2). We will conduct a randomised, controlled trial of a safe water
      storage intervention. We will assess the health impacts of this intervention, with particular
      focus on the high-risk groups of PLWHA and children under 5 years of age.
