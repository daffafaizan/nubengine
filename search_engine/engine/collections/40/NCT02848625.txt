    
      Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic progressive fibrotic (scarring) disease of
      the lung of unknown cause. Approximately 100,000 Americans will die from IPF this year. There
      is no cure for IPF other than lung transplantation, which only 1% of patients will receive.
      Recently, 2 drugs were approved by the FDA to slow the rate of decline in lung function among
      patients with IPF. These drugs do not decrease symptoms or improve quality of life.

      Symptoms of IPF include shortness of breath, cough, and fatigue, all of which may also
      adversely affect quality of life. Yoga is a practice of exercises, including breathing
      exercises, that has been shown to be relatively safe and to improve quality of life in some
      patients with other advanced lung diseases. We hypothesize that regular yoga and breathing
      exercises, specifically designed for patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis, over a
      period of 12 weeks will lead to improved quality of life as measured by several different
      quality of life questionnaires.
