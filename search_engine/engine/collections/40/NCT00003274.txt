      IIA or IIB melanoma treated with vaccine comprising tyrosinase peptide and gp100 antigen
      emulsified in Montanide ISA-51 (ISA-51) alone or in combination with sargramostim (GM-CSF).

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to stage
      (IIA vs IIB). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms: Arm I: Patients receive
      vaccine comprising tyrosinase peptide and gp100 antigen emulsified in Montanide ISA-51
      (ISA-51) alone subcutaneously (SQ) once a week on weeks 0, 2, 4, 6, 10, 14, 18, and 26. Arm
      II: Patients receive treatment as in arm I followed by sargramostim (GM-CSF) SQ for 5 days
      after each vaccination. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for
      3 years, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients (25 per arm) will be accrued for this study within
      3 years.
