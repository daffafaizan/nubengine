      a 12-week double-blind treatment phase. In the lead-in phase, subjects receiving
      antipsychotic medication, who manifest moderate to severe and persistent negative symptoms,
      will remain on their maintenance regimen for at least four weeks. The treatment phase will be
      a 12-week, parallel groups, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of adjunctive rasagiline
      (1 mg/day), a selective MAO-B oxidase inhibitor.
