      after PCI using drug eluting stent is not clear enough Aim: to study short term effect of
      stent size and number on left ventricular mechanical dyssynchrony after elective PCI to LAD
      artery.

      Patients and methods: the study included 150 adult patients with electively stented LAD
      lesion with DES. Patients were evaluated pre PCI then follow up at 1m and 3m using tissue
      synchronization image (TSI).
