      Finland. From each doctor the aim is to get 25 children from both grades 1 and 5 (at ages 7
      and 11) from 1-2 schools. Before the school doctor's check-up, the parents, nurses and
      teachers fill a questionnaire to identify any potential concerns about each child. The
      questions were partly chosen from the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ).
      Additional questions concerning the child's growth, physical well-being, learning, school
      absenteeism and the well-being of the whole family are included. The doctor is blinded to the
      answers of the questionnaires. After the health check the doctors fill an electronic report
      including any instructions given, significant discussions and follow-up plans and their
      estimate of the potential benefit or harm of the medical appointment. The child and the
      parent fill patient-reported experience measure (PREM) forms where they evaluate the benefit
      or harm of the health check. The researchers compare the need for a doctor's appointment to
      the benefit gained. At one year after the check-up, the implementations of the follow-up
      plans are analyzed.

      A data balance sheet has been prepared. The coordinating ethics committee of the Hospital
      District of Helsinki and Uusimaa (HUS) has approved the study protocol. Permissions for the
      study from the Department of Social Services and Healthcare and the Department of Education
      from all participating cities have been obtained. Informed consent will be obtained from all
      participating children, parents, doctors, nurses and teachers.
