      differ in the magnitude of 100:1. For achieving MB concentrations possibly effective against
      malaria when using different pharmaceutical formulations, determination of oral
      bioavailability of MB is necessary. To investigate this 12 healthy subjects (6 females, 6
      males) will receive in a randomised cross over design MB 50 mg i.v. and MB 500 mg as a oral
      solution.

      For generating this information for a planned phase II/III study in Africa, an intravenous
      and an oral MB preparation will be investigated.

      A second part of the study will explorative investigate the influence of MB on chloroquine
      (CQ) plasma concentrations. During this part 6 healthy subjects (3 females, 6 males) will
      receive either CQ alone or in combination with MB 500 mg, the design of this part will be a
      parallel design.
