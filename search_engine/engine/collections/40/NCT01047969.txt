      assessment) to assess for a continued incremental response to CRT. Surgery is NOT withheld
      from patients entering this study. Indeed, surgery is an option at each stage of patient
      follow-up and is a crucial component of a patient's treatment pathway should no further
      regression of disease be detected through stringent follow-up. If a status of 'no detectable
      disease' by serial MRI, CT-PET and clinical assessment is achieved and the patient wishes not
      to have surgery, they will continue to be carefully monitored within the framework of the
      trial follow-up protocol.
