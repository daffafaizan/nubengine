      who were diagnosed as dilated cardiomyopathy by echocardiography, will be recruited with a
      median follow up of 5 years.Patients will be excluded who develop cardiac enlargement caused
      by other factors such as myocardial ischemia, myocarditis, diabetic cardiomyopathy, valvular
      heart disease, congenital heart disease; who had underwent heart transplatation; who are not
      suitable for the present study due to maligant tumor or severe trauma.

      Eligible individuals, identified based on echocardiography and medical records, were invited
      to a community clinic by phone. For eligible individuals, study data were comprised of a
      self-administered questionnaire, anthropometric features, laboratory examinations,
      echocardiographic and/or cardiac magetic resnonance data. Anthropometric data were measured
      by experienced research staff in the morning under standardized conditions. Echocardiographic
      measuring were performed by three skilled sonographers independently, based on routine
      protocols on an HP5500 (Phillips Medical System, Boston, Massachusetts, USA) per current
      guidelines. Venous blood samples were collected in the morning following overnight fasting.
      Laboratory procedures were performed under standardized conditions.

      Endpoints including all-cause mortality, cardiovascular death, sudden death (ICD-Code I46.1,
      R96), ventricular tachycardia(ICD-code I47.2)/fibrillation/flutter(ICD-code I49.0),
      hospitalization for heart failure(ICD-Code I50), heart transplatation ((ICD-Code Z94.1),
      non-fatal stroke(ICD-Code I60, I61, I63, I64), non-fatal myocardial infarction (ICD-Code
      I21), sudden death (ICD-Code I46.1, R96), successful cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ICD-Code
      I46.0) will be evaulated.

      Across the whole observational study, 50 endpoints are anticipated to occur annually, and
      therefore the sample size was estimated to be approximately 500 subjects.

      Data collection and management will be conducted via electronic data collection (EDC). Source
      data will be checked regularly to assess the accuracy and completeness. For statistical
      analysis, continuous variables are presented as mean±standard deviation (SD), and compared by
      the Student t-test. Categorical variables are presented as frequency and assessed by the χ2
      test. SAS 9.4 for Windows (release 6.11, USA) is to be utilized for statistical analysis.
