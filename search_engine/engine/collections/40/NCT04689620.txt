      used. In the countries of the European community, the closure of one ulcer as an outpatient
      procedure costs 800-1500 euros, and supporting anti-relapse treatment makes 100-150 euros per
      month. In the United States, for closure of venous ulcer within 3 months, direct medical
      costs reach US$1500- 2000. Prolongation of the treatment for a longer time results in
      increased cost up to US$30 000 or more.

      Poor efficiency of the known methods of treating patients with venous ulcer necessitates the
      search for new ways and modes of laser therapy (LT) based on a comprehensive approach.
      Application of physical therapy, primarily with the use of LLLT, capable of influencing
      various stages in the pathogenesis of the disease, allows a high therapeutic effect in many
      cases, while ensuring systemic response of the patient's body with the proper exposure
      procedure.

      So, the current study will be conducted to compare the effect of different laser wavelengths
      on venous ulcers and provide an effective treatment method for patients with venous ulcers
      with low cost and in short duration.
