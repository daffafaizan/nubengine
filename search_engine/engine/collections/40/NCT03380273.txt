      incidence of surgical site infection at each participating site will be determined. At the
      beginning of the third year, the bundle will be implemented and data on 4,238 additional
      patients will be collected. The incidence rate on surgical site infection before and after
      the intervention will be compared. We hypothesize that this intervention will reduce the
      infection rate within the first 3 months after surgery from 6% to 4.5% (5% to 3.75% in closed
      fractures and from 10% to 7.5% in open fractures).
