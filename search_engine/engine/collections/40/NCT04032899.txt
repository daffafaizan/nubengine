      development and future health. One of the key processes is when the microbiota is established
      in the baby. Contamination during delivery with the mother's vaginal flora, as well as
      bacteria from the microbiota of breast milk, are important sources for intestinal
      colonization. However, the mother's microbiota can suffer alterations that affect the health
      of the mother and can also have an effect on the baby.

      Mastitis is a condition of the mammary gland that can affect between 3-30% of women during
      the period of lactation and is the first cause of abandonment of it. It is associated with a
      dysbiosis with the proliferation of microorganisms in milk such as Staphylococcus and
      Streptococcus.

      Previous studies carried out with the strain L. fermentum CECT5716 have demonstrated a
      powerful regulating activity of the microbiota of breast milk that translates into a
      preventive and curative effect on mastitis. The highest incidence of mastitis occurs during
      the first weeks after delivery, so the investigator's working hypothesis is that the
      modulation of the maternal microbiota before delivery would improve the effectiveness of the
      probiotic strain consumption.
