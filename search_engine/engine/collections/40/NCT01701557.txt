    
      A randomized trial of two initial volumes of IVF and subsequent administration rates. Group I
      received 10 mL/kg of NS intravenous bolus over the first hour followed by ¾ NS with potassium
      replacement at 1.25 times maintenance and Group II received 20 mL/kg of NS intravenous bolus
      over the first hour followed by ¾ NS with potassium replacement at 1.5 times maintenance. The
      specific variables measured included demographics (age, gender, and race/ethnicity) and
      routine laboratory values (pH, pCO2, plasma glucose, electrolytes, bicarbonate, sodium,
      chloride, BUN. Length of treatment was defined as a time of the hospital stay after the start
      of IVF infusion.
