      neonates which represent a major concern for the vital prognosis. It is therefore important
      to propose a tool for early diagnosis of these intestinal complications in order to avoid
      extended interruptions of enteral feeding at a period of life where growth (and digestive
      maturation) is in the foreground. Currently, the diagnosis of digestive impairment is based
      on classical clinical, biological (CRP, procalcitonin, fecal calprotectin, NFS) and
      radiological (abdomen without preparation) approaches, which induce on one hand a prolonged
      interruption of enteral feeding sometimes useless and even harmful for the intestinal
      maturation and, secondly, the establishment of a parenteral nutrition which is not risk-free.
      The study propose to dose the fecal calprotectin, a non-invasive marker of digestive
      inflammation, in order to validate the threshold decision proposed in a pilot study (350 Âµg/g
      of feces). Measurement of fecal calprotectin levels will be used as an integrated tool to
      build a powerful screening score combined to the usual parameters used in routine care for
      the diagnosis of and enteropathy and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) in premature neonates. A
      cohort of preterm infants born at a gestational age of 33 weeks or less will be included from
      birth. A stool sample will be collected from the diaper once a week, from birth until
      discharge from the hospital, and every day during gastrointestinal events (interruption of
      enteral feeding over 48 hours). The study will evaluate the performance of the rapid assay of
      fecal calprotectin by quantitative immunochromatography compared to the reference method by
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
