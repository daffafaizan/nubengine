      have non tumor portal vein thrombosis will be enrolled. The baseline Doppler parameter will
      be recorded and the patient will be randomized into either interventional (warfarin) or
      control (aspirin) group. From postoperative day 3, patients in interventional (warfarin)
      group will receive oral Warfarin 2.5mg qd with titration of dose to maintain a target INR of
      2-3 for 1 year, patients in control (aspirin) group will receive oral Aspirin Enterie Ccoated
      Tablets 100mg qd for 1 year, and both groups will be along with five days of subcutaneous
      injection of Low Molecular Weight Heparin and three months of oral Dipyridamole. Every 3
      months the Doppler screening for the occurrence of portal vein thrombus (PVT) or
      spleno-mesenteric thrombosis will be done for all patients. Both groups will receive the
      therapy for one year irrespective of the Doppler findings in relation to portal vein thrombus
      occurrence. Then one year monitoring will be done in the both groups as per the primary or
      secondary outcome.
