      ventricular tachycardia may receive implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) devices. ICD
      devices provide life-saving shocks to terminate ventricular tachycardia. There is however
      substantial evidence that correlates each life-saving shock with worsening prognosis.

      Catheter ablation is a procedure that can treat the cause of ischaemic ventricular
      tachycardia (VT). Most catheter ablation procedures for ischaemic VT are performed in normal
      rhythm, with an end-point of arrhythmic substrate modification. Arrhythmic substrate
      modification refers to the process by which abnormal electrical activity in cardiac scar
      tissue (from ischaemic heart disease) is identified and treated by ablation.

      Substrate modification catheter ablation procedures for ischaemic VT have been demonstrated
      to reduce ICD shocks and VT episodes in randomised trials compared to medications. However,
      ablation procedure outcomes are still imperfect with a recurrence rate of 50-60%.

      Ripple Mapping is a method of mapping the hearts electrical signals, that may allow better
      identification of the abnormal activity within scar and so improve recurrence rates following
      ablation.

      Patients referred for ablation of ischaemic VT, who have an ICD, will undergo their procedure
      with Ripple Mapping and subsequently followed up over a year, at 3 monthly intervals. The
      main assessed outcome will be ICD or VT events over a year. This will be compared to the
      number of ICD or VT events the year prior to ablation.
