      sought medical attention amongst older men. Visual-aid and shared decision-making (SDM) are
      potential solutions to address LUTS. The study aimed to determine the effect of a novel
      pictorial Visual Analogue Uroflowmetry Score (VAUS) and primary care physicians (PCP) SDM
      training on the decisional quality amongst men selecting their treatment options for LUTS.

      This study recruited 60 multi-ethnic Asian men aged ≥50 years with moderate-to-severe LUTS
      (International Prostate Symptoms Score≥8 and/or QOL≥3) in a Singapore public primary care
      clinic. Men used the VAUS to report their symptoms. 60 men were randomly assigned to PCPs
      trained in SDM in the intervention group (n=30) and the other 30 to the control group (PCPs
      without SDM-training). Patient-physician dyad decision quality was measured using the
      validated SDMQ-9 (patient) and SDMQ-Doc (physician) questionnaires.
