    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the response rate of treatment with sorafenib (BAY43-9006) in patients with
      recurrent aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphomas.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the duration of response and progression free survival of treatment with
      BAY43-9006 in patients with recurrent aggressive Non-Hodgkin's Lymphomas.

      II. To characterize the toxicity of treatment with BAY43-9006 in patients with recurrent
      aggressive Non-Hodgkin's Lymphomas.

      III. To further characterize the pharmacokinetics properties of BAY43-9006 and assess
      influence of monooxygenases polymorphisms and multi-drug resistance transporter (MDR) on
      pharmacokinetics.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral sorafenib twice daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for 1 year.
