    
      Cohort 1 will evaluate safety, tolerability, and PK of single doses of a 150-mg and a new
      300-mg tablet formulation of miricorilant. Cohort 1 treatment will be randomized and open
      label.

      Optional Cohorts 2 and 3 will evaluate single- and repeated-dose administration of
      miricorilant using a formulation, dose, and dose-regimen determined after interim evaluation
      of PK and safety data from previous cohorts. Cohort 2 and 3 treatments will be randomized,
      blinded, and placebo controlled.
