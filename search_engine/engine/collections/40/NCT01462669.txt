    
      Ezogabine/retigabine (GW582892), N-[2-amino-4(4-fluorobenzylamino)-phenyl] carbamic acid
      ethyl ester, is a novel anti-epileptic compound which has been developed as an adjunctive
      treatment for partial onset seizures in patients with refractory epilepsy.

      This is an open-label, randomized, single-center, 4-way crossover study to investigate the
      pharmacokinetics of single oral doses of ezogabine/retigabine and the n-acetyl metabolite of
      ezogabine/retigabine (NAMR) in healthy male and female Taiwanese volunteers. The study
      consists of a screening phase, 4 treatment periods and a follow-up visit. Subjects will
      receive each of the following four treatments administered in a randomized four-way crossover
      design: 50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg and 400 mg ezogabine/retigabine tablets administered once
      orally. Serial blood samples will be obtained at pre-defined timepoints for pharmacokinetic
      analysis of ezogabine/retigabine and NAMR. Safety assessments will include measurements of
      vital signs, collection of adverse events, clinical laboratory tests and the Columbia Suicide
      Severity Rating Scale.
