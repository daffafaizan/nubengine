      Research participation involves up to three experimental imaging examination visits in
      radiology: a baseline before the patient starts a cancer treatment, a follow-up a few days
      later, and a later follow up to see how the treatment may affect normal or abnormal
      processing of Tryptophan.

      The research imaging results will be linked with other evidence of the patient's disease, but
      will not effect their care.
