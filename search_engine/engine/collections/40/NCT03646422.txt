    
      Registry of patients with Primary Cutaneous Lymphoma seen at participating centers in Spain.
      The registry will identify patients with this disease and includes information about stage,
      diagnostic and therapeutic interventions and willingness to participate in further studies.

      Data is entered in the registry in each of the participating cutaneous lymphoma clinics.
      These data are updated at least yearly. Participants receive specific training before
      starting, and there is an online continuous monitoring system.
