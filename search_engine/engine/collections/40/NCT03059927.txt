      and quality of life in patients with osteoarthritis. In 2015, 6093 patients received primary
      TKA in Norway. Despite the procedureÂ´s general success, 20% of patients report persistent
      postoperative pain and/or dissatisfaction with the surgical outcome. Efforts to further
      improve the procedure have raised considerable debate regarding the role and management of
      the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL). Prostheses for TKA have evolved into designs that
      either preserve or sacrifice the PCL. In patients with a functional PCL, the decision of
      which design is selected depends largely on the favor and training of the surgeon. To further
      improve TKA patient outcomes, a better understanding of the role of these differing PCL
      treatments is needed. Thus, the aim of this study is to determine whether patients' perceived
      outcome, implant stability and clinical outcome differ between 3 TKA implant designs (2
      PCL-sacrificing and 1 PCL-retaining). We will conduct a 3-arm randomized controlled
      prospective trial with 5-year follow-up. This study will have impact on clinical practice by
      addressing the lack of evidence supporting use of these different types of implants.
