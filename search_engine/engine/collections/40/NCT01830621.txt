      treatments for colon or rectal cancer.

      The purpose of this study is to compare the effects on colon cancer of a new drug, BBI608,
      and best supportive care (BSC) compared to BSC alone.

      BBI608 has been shown to shrink tumours in animals and has been studied in a few people and
      seems promising, but it is not clear if it can offer better results than the usual care which
      is best supportive care alone.

      The standard or usual treatment for this disease is treatment with drugs and other treatments
      that may help to make a patient feel better or may improve their quality of life. This
      treatment is known as "best supportive care" (BSC). Although patients with best supportive
      care can feel better for some months, the cancer usually continues to grow.
