      patients undergoing surgery of the shoulder. Long-term data collection will include
      information on the functional status of the patients' shoulder as well as quality of life
      information and radiographic results. The database will be an essential element in the
      development of an academic shoulder service at the University of Ottawa. Many areas in
      shoulder surgery are in their infancy in terms of minimally invasive techniques. Several
      large areas require substantial research in order to refine decision making. The database
      will allow these questions to be answered using a retrospective model and will provide the
      background information required to mount larger scale randomized controlled trials. The
      nature of the database information collection will also allow meaningful research to be
      completed by the residents in the program in a timely and cost-effective manner. This will be
      in keeping with the training requirements in Orthopedic surgery and will help promote
      interest in the area of research for the trainees.The following are examples of questions
      that the database information could answer through research:

        1. Does the length of time taken to access Orthopedic care influence the outcome of surgery
           in rotator cuff disease? in instability? in arthritis?

        2. How does the choice of implant in arthroplasty affect outcome (stemmed implants versus
           resurfacing arthroplasty)?

        3. In subscapularis repair, does technique influence outcome (open subscapularis repair
           versus arthroscopic subscapularis repair)?
