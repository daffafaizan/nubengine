      consisting of 80 patients with chronic periodontitis. Study consists of 4 groups, with 20
      patients in each group. Group 1 received only NSPT, Group 2 received NSPT+LANAP, Group 3
      received NSPT+LLLT, and Group 4 received NSPT+LANAP+LLLT. Clinical measurements of patients
      and gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) were taken before treatment and after 1 and 3 months. In
      GCF, interleukin-1beta, interleukin-10 and vascular endothelial growth factor were analyzed.
      Standard periapical radiographs were taken for radiographic measurements.

      In moderate (4-6 mm) and deep pockets (7 mm and above), it was found that all groups treated
      with laser significantly decrease pocket depth (PD) and clinic attachment level (CAL)
      compared to Group 1. Group 3 caused significantly less gingival recession than all other
      groups. There was no statistical difference between the groups in biochemical markers.
      Radiographic analysis revealed that only Group 2 achieved significant bone filling compared
      to Group 1.

      Bot LANAP and LLLT application in the deep pockets provide an additional contribution to
      NSPT. It has been found that LLLT administration leads to decrease in PD by creating a
      minimum recession.
