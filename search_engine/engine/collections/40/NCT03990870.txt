      Ecological Momentary Assessments (EMAs) data collected from mobile devices, the WASABI
      closed-loop algorithm to detect exacerbation of social anxiety, and 1:1 and group-based
      videoconferencing and Instant Messaging with peers and providers. This study will test WASABI
      as an adjunct to digital Cognitive Behavioral Group Therapy (dCBGT) in adolescents with
      Social Anxiety (SA), in a parallel arm, double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trial
      to assess feasibility and initial efficacy, to investigate the generalization of trained
      cognitive skills in the natural environment and improving anxiety and social functioning, and
