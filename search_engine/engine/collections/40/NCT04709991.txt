      which resulting in a loss of hemodynamic load. Endovascular (or percutaneous) procedures
      performed at the infrainguinal level (axefemoro-popliteal) are very common in affected
      patients. Therenva offers a complete and consistent lightweight navigation solution
      (EndoNautÂ®) based on artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, and providing technology
      accessible to all operating rooms for PAD procedures. The aim of this study is to demonstrate
      that the use of EndoNaut for endovascular procedures on the femoropopliteal axis has a
      clinical impact for the patient (decrease in irradiation and the volume of contrast product)
      as well as for nursing staff (reduction in irradiation) compared to the procedures performed
      by EndoNaut.
