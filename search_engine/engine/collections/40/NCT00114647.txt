      it is often necessary to obtain larger quantities of plasma or mononuclear cells than can be
      safely obtained by simple phlebotomy. These components can be easily and safely obtained
      using apheresis procedures in the Clinical Center Apheresis Unit. Other specimens are also
      sometimes needed for research, such as other blood components, body fluids (such as semen or
      urine) or secretions (from nose, mouth, or different skin areas). While this protocol is
      specifically designed to conform to the requirements of the Apheresis Unit for donors to have
      apheresis and other collection procedures, it also permits collection of these other donor
      specimens. However, the protocol, by itself, is not an independent research study but rather
      designed to facilitate sample collections that may aid other studies.
