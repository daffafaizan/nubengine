    
      Patients with suspected localized prostate cancer will undergo biopsies spotting different
      prostate sites, as per standard clinical practice. Patients with histologically confirmed
      prostate adenocarcinoma and candidate for prostatectomy, after signing the Informed Consent
      Form, will receive Ruxolitinib for 4 weeks (the time normally elapsing between histological
      diagnosis and surgery) and will thereafter undergo prostatectomy.

      Remaining biological material from the diagnosis and the prostatectomy will be sent to the
      Molecular Oncology Laboratory for molecular analysis.

      In addition, blood samples will be drawn before, during Ruxolitinib treatment (Week 2), at
      the end of treatment (Week 4), and after prostatectomy (Week 5), to assess the frequency and
      subtype of immune subsets and the circulating levels of cytokines and secreted.

      Patients will be monitored for occurrence of adverse events/surgical complications during
      treatment and up to 4 weeks after the intervention.
