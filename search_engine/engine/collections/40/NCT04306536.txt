      muscle mass and increase the efficacy of a rehabilitation program in patients suffering from
      sarcopenia. Femure fracture is responsible for increased immobilization resulting in loss of
      muscle mass which may be further emphasized by surgical stress. This randomized,
      observer-blinded trial tested the hypothesis that nutritional supplementation with
      muscle-target nutritional supplementation would increase the efficacy of a physical
      rehabilitation program in old adults with femur fracture treated with surgery.
