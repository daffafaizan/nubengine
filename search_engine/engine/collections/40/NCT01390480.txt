    
      This is a bicentric, randomized placebo controlled, double blind study, with the aim to
      evaluate the effect of vitamin D supplementation in subjects with new onset of type 1
      diabetes on immunological, endocrine and metabolic parameters.

      The primary study goal is to evaluate the influence of vitamin D supplementation on the
      number and function of the master regulatory T-cells under controlled conditions within 13
      months. The secondary study goals are a comprehensive immune phenotyping to determine whether
      Vit D produces changes consistent with a general improvement in immune homeostasis that
      supports ß-cell tolerating interventions, the assessment of ß-cell function in all subjects
      to obtain preliminary data on the effects of Vit D on ß-cell survival.
