      concentration in the broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL). This technique which is clinically
      relevant and reliable could determinate the pulmonary diffusion level for antibiotics by
      calculating the ratio between plasmatic and intra-alveolar antibiotic concentration. This
      ratio will be correlated with potential limitation factors of pulmonary diffusion as
      respiratory diseases (COPD, cystic fibrosis, fibrosisâ€¦), sepsis, hypoalbuminemia. We have
      chosen to study the beta lactamin antibiotics because they are the most frequently used in
      pneumonia. Moreover, the beta lactamins pulmonary diffusion is likely to be the lowest.
      Finally, for patients with a known pathogen, we will divide this pulmonary concentration with
      minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC). Indeed, in severe pneumonia, to be sure of
      bactericidal activity, a pulmonary concentration of beta lactamines should be always higher
      than 4 to 5 times MIC.
