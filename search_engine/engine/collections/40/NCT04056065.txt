      Name (INN) recently approved by WHO is centhaquine) has been found to be an effective
      resuscitative agent in rat, rabbit and swine models of hemorrhagic shock, it decreased blood
      lactate, increased mean arterial pressure, cardiac output, and decreased mortality. An
      increase in cardiac output during resuscitation is mainly attributed to an increase in stroke
      volume. Centhaquine acts on the venous α2B-adrenergic receptors and enhances venous return to
      the heart, in addition, it produces arterial dilatation by acting on central α2A-adrenergic
      receptors to reduce sympathetic activity and systemic vascular resistance.

      Unlike presently used vasopressors, centhaquine increased mean arterial pressure by
      increasing stroke volume and cardiac output, and it decreased systemic vascular resistance.
      The most common adverse effects of vasopressors as a class include arrhythmias, fluid
      extravasation, and ischemia. Centhaquine does NOT act on beta-adrenergic receptors, and
      therefore the risk of arrhythmias is mitigated. It is NOT a vasopressor; however, it
      increases blood pressure and cardiac output by augmenting venous blood return to the heart
      and enhanced tissue perfusion by arterial dilatation. Enhancing tissue perfusion is a
      significant advantage over existing vasopressors.
