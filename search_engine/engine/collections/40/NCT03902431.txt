    
      Our project has two major aims:

      Aim 1: To assess the impact of the implementation of an evidence-based, multilevel strategy
      to reduce cardiovascular vascular disease (CVD) among PLH.

      Aim 2: To assess the process of implementation of these strategies using RE-AIM QuEST. Using
      both quantitative and qualitative methods, we evaluate the process of implementation by
      assessing Reach, [Effectiveness addressed in Aim 1], Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance
      whilst integrating Qualitative Evaluation for Systematic Translation.
