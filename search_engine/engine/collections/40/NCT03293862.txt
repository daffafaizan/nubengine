      than 8.5% of high-risk patients. Current preventive measures described are control of risk
      factors and optimization of surgical technique. Despite that, the incidence of such
      complication remained stable in the last decades, highlighting the low efficacy of such
      measures. Polypropilene onlay mesh has been used to avoid incisional hernias in selected
      elective patients, and could be useful in the prevention of fascial dehiscence. In emergency
      situations, especially in contaminated and infected surgical procedures, safety and efficacy
      of mesh is controversial. In this study the investigators aimed to evaluate the influence of
      polypropilene prophylactic onlay mesh on the incidence of fascial dehiscence in high-risk
      patients undergoing midline emergency laparotomy. As secondary outcome, the associated
      morbidity, including surgical site occurence, will be analyzed. The study design will be a
      randomized controlled trial.
