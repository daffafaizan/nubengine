      growth factor tyrosine kinases. HER2 forms hetero- and homo-dimers with other members of this
      family of tyrosine kinases. As a result of dimerization at the cell surface, intracellular
      signal transduction is initiated, resulting in cell proliferation.

      HER2 expression has been observed in a variety of human tumors including breast cancer,
      non-small cell lung cancer, prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer, renal cell cancer, and
      ovarian cancer. HER2 overexpression is associated with clinically more aggressive breast
      cancer, and is an independent predictor of poor prognosis in patients with breast cancer.

      TAK-165 is an active and selective inhibitor of tyrosine kinase activity of HER2 being
      developed for patients with lower levels of HER2 expression. This study will seek to
      determine the safety, tolerability, maximum tolerated dose and pharmacokinetics of TAK-165
      administered to subjects with tumors known to express HER2.

      The total duration of the study will be at minimum 8 weeks, or 56 Days. Subjects without
      progressive disease after 8 weeks may continue to receive study drug, provided that they do
      not meet criteria for withdrawal.
