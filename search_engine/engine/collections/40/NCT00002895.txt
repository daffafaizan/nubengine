        -  Compare the benefit of early chemotherapy based on CA 125 level only vs chemotherapy
           based on conventional clinical indicators in patients with relapsed ovarian epithelial,
           fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer.

        -  Compare the overall survival of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the quality of life of patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients whose CA 125 levels rise to more
      than two times the upper limit of normal are randomized to one of two treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: The clinician is informed of the initial rise in CA 125 level. A confirmatory
           test is performed immediately. Within 4 weeks of the initial CA 125 elevation, patients
           with a second confirmed elevation receive treatment for recurrent disease according to
           standard local practice. Patients with a normal CA 125 on the confirmatory test receive
           no treatment until clinically indicated.

        -  Arm II: The clinician is blinded to the CA 125 results. Patients undergo normal
           monitoring. When clinically indicated, patients commence treatment according to standard
           local practice.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, at each follow-up visit, and, if treatment is
      instituted, before each chemotherapy course.

      Patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 1,400 patients will be accrued for this study.
