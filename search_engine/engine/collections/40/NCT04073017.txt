      - To assess the ability of enterade to reduce bowel movement frequency in NET patients with
      and without carcinoid syndrome.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To assess subject-reported health-related quality of life measures in subjects before
           and after compound administration.

        -  To characterize the side effect profile and tolerability of the compound as measured by
           the number of total 8-oz enterade® bottles consumed throughout the trial.

        -  To evaluate changes in serum electrolytes before and after administration of the
           compound.

        -  To assess differences in intravenous fluid requirement and/or hospitalizations for
           dehydration in patients between observation period and active enterade® period.

        -  To evaluate differences in utilization of standard-of-care anti-diarrheal medications in
           patients between observation period and enterade® period.

        -  To compare subjective bloating and flatulence in patients before and after
           administration of the compound.

        -  To evaluate changes in patient weight before and after administration of the compound.

      Exploratory Objectives:

        -  To assess changes in serum and stool inflammatory markers before and after the study
           compound.

        -  To evaluate changes in fecal lactoferrin before and after study compound administration.
