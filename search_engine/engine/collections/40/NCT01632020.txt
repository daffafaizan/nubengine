      of short term oral Metformin therapy on biomarkers for tumor growth in subjects with newly
      diagnosed colon or rectal adenocarcinoma. Metformin is a well-tolerated drug widely
      prescribed for treatment of Type 2 diabetes mellitus. Preliminary studies have generated the
      hypothesis that metformin may have positive effects on both prevention and survival of colon
      cancer subjects. Clinical trials are ongoing to explore this possibility in breast cancer
      (NCT01101438). This investigation is the first study of Metformin in colorectal cancer (CRC)
      patients, and is designed to understand the mechanism of its anti-cancer actions, if any, and
      its interactions with biomarkers in colorectal cancer patients.

      Based upon epidemiological studies, it is hypothesized that there are independent actions of
      Metformin on the outcome of subjects with CRC. Also hypothesized is that metformin effects on
      CRC cell growth will correlate with this drug's effects on markers mentioned above, because
      the markers are closely related to tumor growth and metastases.
