      relapsed/refractory CD19+ B-ALL. The T cell doses originally proposed in this study were
      based on doses administered safely in prior T cell adoptive therapy trials, but the dose has
      been modified based on the toxicities observed in adult patients with morphologic evidence of
      relapsed B-ALL treated on MSKCC IRB 09-114.
