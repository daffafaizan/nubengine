      separated by 2 weeks. Each protocol will comprise one exhausting training session (20-min
      warm-up consisted of 15-min of continuous self-paced running followed by 5-min of fast-finish
      progression runs increasing speeds (from approximately 60% to 80% of maximal heart rate,
      participant controlled), 10 x 500 m sprints at 90% of maximal heart rate with a 2-min rest
      period between bouts and a recovery phase consisting of 10-min of slow jogging). Twenty-four
      hours after this exhausting training, subjects will perform an incremental running test on a
      treadmill (Pre-intervention test) where subjects will start at 10 km/h for 6 min after which
      speed will be increased by 2 km/h every 6 min until a 16 km/h trial is completed. One hour
      after this test, in one protocol subjects will receive Tecar therapy (Tecar treatment group);
      in the other group (Control group) participants will rest passively in a sitting position for
      30-min period. To evaluate the relevance of the changes induced by Tecar therapy/passive
      recovery, subjects will repeat the treadmill test 48 hours after the first test in both
      groups (72 hours after the exhaustive training).
