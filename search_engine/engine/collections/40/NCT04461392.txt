      longitudinal strain (GLS) with blood pressure values obtained non-invasively, being less load
      dependent than standard GLS. The investigator hypothesize that myocardial work could be a
      useful marker for predicting the exercise performance after chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy
      in oncological patients undergoing rehabilitation. Moreover, this study may provide
      additional information in optimal selection for rehabilitation programs.
