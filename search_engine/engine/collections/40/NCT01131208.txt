        -  To identify genes predictive of clinical outcome (failure-free survival and overall
           survival) among patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma treated with CHOP or R-CHOP
           induction on ECOG-E4494 using the nuclease protection assay for measuring gene
           expression in paraffin-embedded tissue.

        -  To identify genes that change their prognostic profile with the addition of rituximab to
           CHOP chemotherapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Unstained formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples are analyzed for gene expression via
      nuclease protection assay.
