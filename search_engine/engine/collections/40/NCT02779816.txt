    
      This study is of an unblinded crossover design. Each patient will be randomly assigned to
      initiate a one week observation period with either the pen alone or the pen with the device.
      The following week, the patient will switch to the other assignment. This will be repeated
      one more time for a total of two weeks with the device and two weeks without it.

      At the end of every week, the patients will be given a questionnaire to fill out. Questions
      will include a measurement of their satisfaction with their insulin (or other medication)
      delivery system for that week. Patients will be instructed to continue their usual dosage of
      medication as prescribed by their physician. If the patients have any problems with the
      device or feel uncomfortable with it, they are instructed to discontinue use of the device
      and continue using their pen as usual.

      The patients may keep the device at the end of the study. The questionnaires that the
      patients fill out will be the primary source documents.
