    
      A multi-centre, phase II study of ertumaxomab in metastatic breast cancer patients who became
      progressive after hormonal therapy. Each eligible patient will receive three ascending doses
      of ertumaxomab, administered intravenously. Ertumaxomab will be administered as a 3-hour
      constant rate infusion with a dosing interval of 7 days. Each patient will participate in
      this study for up to 7 months (includes the up to 21 days screening period, 14 days treatment
      period, and up to 180 days/6 months follow-up), with 3-monthly post-study follow-up until the
      patient becomes progressive.
