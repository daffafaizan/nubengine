      after cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), the course is usually marked by a
      post-resuscitation syndrome including multiple organ failures of various intensity and anoxic
      brain damage. The cardiocirculatory failure usually dominates the clinical picture, and it
      often leads to multiorgan failure. This hemodynamic failure is multifactorial, including at
      various levels vasoplegia, myocardial dysfunction, endotoxin release and adrenal dysfunction
      and is at least partly related to a hormonal defect that could be counteracted by hormonal
      supplementation. Such a substitutive opotherapy by hydrocortisone and AVP could improve
      hemodynamic failure and decrease overall mortality in this setting.

      This trial is a superiority multicentric trial and patients will be randomized in a 1:1:1:1
      ratio using an electronic CRF.

      Investigational medicinal products:

      - Arginin-vasopressin or AVP (REVERPLEG) The solution for infusion is prepared by diluting 40
      I.U. REVERPLEGÂ® with sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution. The total volume after dilution
      should be 50 ml (equivalent to 0.8 I.U. AVP per ml).

      AVP will be administered according to mean arterial pressure to target a 65mmHg blood
      pressure for max 3 days.

      - HYDROCORTISONE HEMISUCCINATE Vials with lyophilisate (100mg hydrocortisone) are provided by
      SERB laboratory. Hydrocortisone hemisuccinate will be administered as a 50mg intravenous
      bolus every 6 hours after an initial dose of 100mg, for 7 consecutive days. Stop of treatment
      by hydrocortisone will be performed without tapering.

      Comparator treatment: placebos.

      17 ICU centers in France will participate to this study targetting 380 patient's enrollment
      in the study.
