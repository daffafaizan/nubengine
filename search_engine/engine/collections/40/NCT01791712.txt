           dialysis session. The percentage of reductions were calculated from the before and
           ending samples. The values of postfilter samples were corrected for changes in plasma
           volume, based on hemoglobin (Hb) of prefilter.

        2. VEGF and other cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and TNF-α) were determined in the plasma
           separated from EDTA blood. After collection, plasma separation was achieved by
           centrifugation for 10 min at 1,500 g. Immediately after separation, the samples were
           stored at -70 ºC until further analysis.

        3. All determinations were carried out in duplicate. The panels of cytokines (VEGF, IL-6,
           IL-8, IL-10, and TNF-α) were measured using the Luminex xMap-based multiplex technology.
           Assays were performed using the MILLIPLEX MAP (multi-analyte panels) 5-plex Cytokine Kit
           (Millipore, Billerica, MA) on the Luminex® instrument according to the manufacturer's
           procedure.
