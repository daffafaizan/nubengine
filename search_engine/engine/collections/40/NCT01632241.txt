      placebo (no active medicine) or belimumab. The controlled period of the study is 52 weeks.
      The random assignment in this study is "2 to 1" which means that for every 3 participants, 2
      will receive belimumab and 1 will receive placebo. Participants who successfully complete the
      52-week study may enter into a 6-month open-label extension. All participants in the
      open-label extension receive belimumab plus standard therapy.
