      healing. Both will be compared to the effects of electrical stimulation of high voltage
      (HVES) and neuromuscular transcutaneous electrical stimulation (TENS) in the treatment of
      donor sites (DA) of burn patients. It is a prospective, controlled clinical, randomized,
      blinded. Will be assessed 60 subjects aged 18-59 years, of both sexes, underwent the surgical
      procedure of grafting (PCE) were randomly divided into small blocks 5:5:5 three groups:
      undergoing therapeutic procedure with HVES undergoing therapeutic procedure with TENS and
      control. Therapeutic procedures will be applied around the DA, thigh or scalp, after 24 hours
      of PCE until complete healing. The variables will be the healing time estimated by the
      removal of the dressing rayon, clinical evaluation, scar quality, the Vancouver scale; pain,
      the pain numerical scale evaluation (PNS); blood perfusion by thermography; quality of
      healing by digital imaging, quantification of areas of crusts by the software Image J; skin
      biomechanical aspects as firmness, the durometer being performed reassessment at the end of
      treatment. Data will be submitted to analysis of normality by the Shapiro-Wilk test and the
      effect of behavior among groups and pre- and post-intervention will be evaluated by ANOVA-two
      way followed by post-hoc (Bonferroni) or Friedman, with p <0.05. Comparing groups, before a
      normal distribution is applied ANOVA followed by Tukey, and otherwise will be applied the
      Kruskal-Wallis test and post-hoc Dunn, p<0.05.
