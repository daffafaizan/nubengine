      have anaesthetic, sedative and analgesic-sparing effects. Besides, Dexmedetomidine has been
      reported to cause sedative effects and reduce opioid requirements in the perioperative
      period. Many studies had been conducted to reduce the side effect of opioid analgesic. The
      current trend of reducing opioid analgesic side effect is direct combination of other drugs
      in PCA. The advantages of this method are convenient in clinical use and preventive for side
      effects.

      In this study, 50 patients who is undergoing elective colorectal surgery will be randomly
      allocated into two groups (Control group and Dexmedetomidine group). Patients in both groups
      will be given a patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pump in post anesthetic recovery unit
      (PACU) after surgery.

      The PCA protocol of Control group is dezocine 0.6mg/kg, flubiprofen 3mg/kg, diluted into
      120ml and administer at a background infusion of 2ml/h, and a bolus of 2ml, with a lock-out
      of 15min. The PCA protocol of Dexmedetomidine group is dezocine 0.6mg/kg, flubiprofen 3mg/k
      and dexmedetomidine 6Î¼g/kg diluted into 120ml and administer at a background infusion of
      2ml/h, and a bolus of 2ml, with a lock-out of 15min.
