      is not well understood. It is also not clear regarding the efficacy of inhibitory or
      excitatory stimulation protocol. The aim of the study is to investigate language response to
      these new strategies and to determine the longevity of the therapeutic outcome. Advanced MR
      neuroimaging techniques, such as fMRI and DTI, are powerful tools to evaluate the concomitant
      nervous changes after rTMS treatment on aphasic patients. The knowledge from fMRI and DTI
      microstructural evolution provides insight into underlined mechanism operating the language
      improvement
