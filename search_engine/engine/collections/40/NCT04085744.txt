      and different densities of saline which were applied to decrease airway complications. In
      this study researchers intended to compare effects of local anesthetic agents and topical
      steroids applying around tracheal tube on airway complications which may occur in the first
      24 hours after surgery. All pediatric patients scheduled for elective surgery will be
      recruited. enrolled patients will randomly assigned in to three groups: Control group, local
      anesthetic group and topical steroid group.
