      of two WISE-MD computer-based learning modules. Students were randomized to 1 of 4 study
      arms. The 4 content-equivalent conditions were: screen shots with voiceover and no
      interactivity; learner control of pacing through multi-media content; social networking
      features; and social networking features plus user interface enhancements.
