      trimester of pregnancy (spontaneous abortion vs voluntary pregnancy interruption), in order
      to correlate the presence of infective viruses/bacteria and the incidence of miscarriage.

      The first objective of this project will be to find the viral DNA of HPV, BK and JC
      polyomaviruses and bacterial DNA of Chlamydia trachomatis, Ureaplasma parvum, Ureaplasma
      urealyticum, Mycoplasma hominis in the aborted tissues collected from spontaneous abortions,
      and to compare the prevalence of these DNAs to those derived from elective specimens.
