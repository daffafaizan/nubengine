      bone marrow, adipose tissue, and placenta) and have been used as therapy in multiple
      conditions, especially in immune-mediated inflammatory diseases, such as graft versus-host
      disease (GVHD) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with evidence of benefit.

      In preclinical models, MSC are effective in ameliorating acute lung injury due to their
      ability to secrete paracrine factors that regulate lung endothelial and epithelial
      permeability, including growth factors, anti-inflammatory cytokines, and antimicrobial
      peptides. Based on the promising pre-clinical preliminary data and intriguing results in
      patients with COVID-19 associated pneumonia and ARDS as well as an established safety profile
      of MSC generally and in ARDS in particular, the researchers propose multiple dosing of MSCs
      as a study treatment to ameliorate the severity and duration of SARS-CoV-2 associated
      pneumonia and ARDS potentially improve survival.

      Patients will receive study agent (MSC or placebo) within 48 hours of enrollment. Three doses
      will be administered unless a severe infusion adverse event occurs that is related to the MSC
      infusion. Doses will be repeated approximately every 48-72 hours with the aim of completing 3
      doses within 7 days of the first dose. All patients will receive standard of care treatments
      for ARDS.
