      Transfer (FET) directly compared to standard clinical procedures. In addition, women's
      likability and stress associated with timing a FET cycle using both methods will be evaluated
      by collecting qualitative data using standardised questionnaires.

      The impact of psychological stress on FET outcome such as implantation rates and viability at
      first scan will be considered in order to gather information for the design of a larger
      clinical study and basic financial data will also be collected, in order to pilot a
      cost-effectiveness evaluation of the two FET timing methods.

      A subset of volunteers will collect daily urine samples from day after embryo transfer until
      confirmation of pregnancy.
