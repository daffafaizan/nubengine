      characterised by the progressive development of airflow limitation (shortness of breath -
      SOB) and is poorly reversible with currently available drugs -is increasing. Cigarette
      smoking is strongly linked with the ongoing inflammation; inflammation that can continue even
      when the patient has stopped smoking. The severity of airflow limitation (SOB) is correlated
      with the degree of pulmonary (lung) inflammation.

      Histone deacetylases (HDACs)are important molecules in suppressing this pulmonary
      inflammation. We have recently shown that patients with COPD have a reduction in total HDAC
      which correlates with the severity of their lung disease.

      Corticosteroids (anti-inflammatory treatment) act, at least in part, by recruitment of these
      HDACs to the site of active inflammatory gene transcription (which reduces the production of
      inflammatory molecules) and are widely used in COPD in patients with severe disease.
      Unfortunately, in COPD, inhaled corticosteroids seem to have little effect on the underlying
      inflammation (though in a selective group of patients with COPD they do reduce the number of
      infections a patient may have by a small amount).

      Theophylline has been used in the treatment of asthma and COPD for over 70 years, but its use
      has recently declined. Data so far obtained in primary cells (cells from patients used in the
      laboratory) from COPD patients suggests that low dose theophylline (~5mg/l) should be
      effective in restoring steroid sensitivity in patients with COPD (and hence reduce
      inflammation thus improving SOB).
