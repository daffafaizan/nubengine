      most often transient but can sometimes be permanent when it persists for more than 6 months
      after surgery. The rates are variable, of the order of 32% for transient hypoparathyroidism
      and 1% for definitive hypoparathyroidism. Untreated permanent hypoparathyroidism is the
      source of many complications in general and therefore requires lifelong replacement therapy.
      The result is a significant deterioration in quality of life.

      The mechanisms responsible for hypoparathyroidism during thyroidectomy are direct damage to
      the parathyroid glands, involuntary excision of these glands, and devascularization of these
      glands.

      The detection of parathyroid glands and the prevention of hypoparathyroidism after
      thyroidectomy therefore represents a major challenge.

      The intraoperative use of indocyanine green angiography has recently been described as a
      reliable means of detecting parathyroid and predicting the risk of postoperative
      hypoparathyroidism.

      In addition, prior studies and intraoperative observations suggest that indocyanine green
      angiography during thyroid surgery may be a means of preserving parathyroid in vivo and thus
      reducing post-operative hypoparathyroidism rates.
