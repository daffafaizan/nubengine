      daily wake up trials. This is shown to reduce the time receiving mechanical ventilation
      compared to no wake up trials.

      We would like to study whether no sedation but only analgesics administered as bolus doses,
      reduce the time receiving mechanical ventilation. The study is planned as a randomised
      prospective study, not blinded. The control group is patients receiving sedation with daily
      wake up trials. The intervention group is not sedated, but receives bolus doses of analgesics
      (morphine). The endpoint is the time spend receiving mechanical ventilation, lengths of stay
      on the intensive care unit, and total lengths of stay on the hospital.

      We also examine the frequency of ventilator associated pneumonia and CT scans of cerebrum.
      Also we would like to examine the long term psychological effects of sedation, we plan to
      send some of the patients to a post traumatic stress screening. The effect on the next of kin
      we plan to study with a questionnaire. As a last thing we would like to study the workload on
      the nurses.
