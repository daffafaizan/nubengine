      50g glucose drink (2 occasions), or 50g carbohydrate equivalent of cooked purple, red, yellow
      and white potatoes. Further blood samples will be obtained at 15,30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 180,
      240 mins. Bloods from the first 2 hours will be analyzed for glucose and insulin to determine
      the glycemic response. Hourly blood samples will be analyzed for polyphenol to determine the
      bioavailability of polyphenols from the different potato variety. Urine samples will be
      collected before ingestion of the food items and again at 4 hours, and will be used to
      determine polyphenol bioavailability.
