      undergone surgery with a muscle sparing, minimally invasive technique for unstable ribcage
      after trauma. The investigators plan on seeing the participants as out patients 6 months and
      1 year after surgery. The results will be compared to results from a historical cohort with
      patients who participated in earlier studies with a different surgical method with large
      incisions and simultaneous thoracotomy. The investigators plan on including 50 patients since
      a preliminary analysis has suggested this should be enough to notice statistically
      significant differences between the groups.
