      remote monitoring enrollment model that is integrated with routine clinical care at Penn
      Family Care (PFC), an academic family medicine practice in West Philadelphia. Among patients
      with poorly controlled HTN the investigators will:

        1. Compare the effect of sending eligible patients a blood pressure cuff with the mailed
           invitation letter and opt-out framing versus the more conventional method of phone calls
           following mailed letters.

        2. Evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of a remote monitoring program with
           individualized stepped escalation for hypertension management.
