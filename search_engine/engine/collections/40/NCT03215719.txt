      quality of life, and late toxicity. Quality of life outcomes can be assessed with a
      validated, self-reported questionnaire. Late toxicity can be assessed using the National
      Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. Additionally, the prognostic
      value of positive HPV in salivary rinse as well as plasma at mid and post- treatment time
      points will be evaluated with a baseline evaluation pre-treatment. Radiomic analysis of
      pre-treatment imaging will be correlated with outcomes.
