      This is a randomized, placebo controlled study.

      Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms:

      Arm I: Patients receive topical dihematoporphyrin derivative (DHP) every 3 hours on days -3
      and -2. Patients undergo laser surgery on day 0. After photodynamic (PDT) therapy, patients
      receive topical prednisolone phosphate four times a day for 90 days. Ninety days following
      PDT, patients may undergo corneal transplantation.

      Arm II: Patients receive placebo topical gel and undergo sham laser surgery following arm I
      schedule, then receive topical prednisolone phosphate four times a day for 90 days. Patients
      may be crossed over to arm I if disease progression is observed.

      Arm III: Patients receive a compressed 1 day schedule of DHP with 5 doses in the morning and
      then undergo laser surgery in the evening.

      Patients are assessed on days 1, 7, 30, and 90 after PDT therapy.
