      of diabetes, and to test whether early diagnosis of diabetes and comprehensive professional
      support will:

        1. facilitate the adjustment of children and their families to the rigors of diabetes care

        2. improve adherence to medication regimens

        3. reduce acute complications of diabetes and organ rejection.
