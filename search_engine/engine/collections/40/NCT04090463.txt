      completion of FOLFIRINOX-based chemotherapy and radical resection. A growing body of
      literature is demonstrating that Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) and
      Intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT), within a multimodal approach, allow to obtain better
      oncological outcome, at the price of low to negligible rates of morbidity and mortality. The
      investigators hypothesize that a "total neoadjuvant" scenario, with the best current therapy,
      based on up to 6 months of FOLFIRINOX (minimum 4), SBRT and IORT (in situ or after surgery)
      would increase the disease-specific survival of borderline resectable pancreatic cancer
      patients. An historical cohort will be used as a comparison group.

      Considering the intention-to-treat design and the institutional rates of chemotherapy
      completion and exploration/resection of borderline resection pancreatic cancer patients, a
      total of 100 patients will be enrolled in this phase II trial. Patients submitted to IORT,
      will receive IORT of 10 to 20 Gy according to the resection status (to the tumor bed after
      resection, or to the tumor in situ in case of non-resection).
