      treatments for biliary calculi from January 1, 1999, to August 31, 2016, focusing on
      percutaneous endoscopic methods and/or ESWL. The primary outcomes of interest were symptom-
      and stone-free rates, length of hospital stay, and complications. Our institutional ethics
      review board approved the study (IRB-2018-01-119). Due to the retrospective nature of the
      study, the need for informed consent was waived. One endourologist evaluated all patients
      preoperatively.
