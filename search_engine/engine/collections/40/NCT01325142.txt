      developing osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ). The bisphosphonates are an important supportive
      therapy in the care of patients with metastatic bone disease; they are able to prevent
      catastrophic events such as fracture and spinal cord compression. However, ONJ has been
      associated with the use of the bisphosphonates and ONJ carries significant morbidity.
      Presently, there are insufficient data to calculate the ONJ risk benefit ratio of
      bisphosphonate use. An ONJ risk assessment tool would improve both the oncologist's and the
      dental health professional the ability to anticipate and potentially mitigate oral toxicities
      from bisphosphonate therapy.

      This protocol consists of a case (ONJ) control (no ONJ) study to identify factors associated
      with the risk of ONJ and to build an index predictive of an individual's risk of developing
      ONJ. The index of ONJ risk will be comprised of clinical, epidemiologic and genetic factors
