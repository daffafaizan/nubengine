      to explore safety, efficacy and PK of TMC207 in Japanese participants with pulmonary MDR-TB.
      The participants will receive TMC207 for 24 weeks in combination with individualized BR drugs
      selected by the Investigator on Day -1. Participants will primarily be assessed for sputum
      culture conversion at Week 24. Safety will be monitored throughout the study.
