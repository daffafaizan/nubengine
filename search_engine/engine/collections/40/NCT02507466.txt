      contributions of intensity and variability of stepping training on lower extremity (LE)
      function, health and community participation in patients with chronic hemiparesis
      post-stroke. Using a RCT design/Intervention Efficacy paradigm, Aim 1 will investigate the
      independent and combined (paired) contributions of intensity and variability of stepping
      training on locomotor function, with secondary measures of health and community mobility. For
      Aim 2, we will evaluate the independent and combined effects of intensity and variability of
      stepping training on non-walking LE tasks. In Aim 3, we will evaluate the cost effectiveness
      of providing these interventions to accelerate motor recovery and health. Our central
      hypothesis is that results of this study will provide a theoretical foundation for
      implementation of physical therapy interventions which can facilitate short-term gains in
      locomotor function, and contribute to long-term improvements in health, function and
      participation through increased community mobility.
