      Assiut university hospitals, chest injuries (17.7%) considered as second cause of mortality
      after head injuries (34.6%) of registered deaths by cause of injury at trauma unit, Assiut
      university hospitals in a study conducted between,2002-2009. In United States, thoracic
      injuries are the primary factor in approximately 35% of these deaths, one -third of which
      occur immediately following the injury, and are contributing in nearly 75% of trauma -related
      deaths. Up to 15% of patients who sustain thoracic trauma undergo emergent thoracotomy for
      resuscitation, massive hemothorax, cardiac tamponade, large thoracic wounds, major thoracic
      vascular injuries, tracheobronchial injuries, or evidence of esophageal injury. The remaining
      85-90% of patients who reach the emergency department does not require emergent thoracotomy
      are initially managed with tube thoracostomy, pain control, pulmonary toilet, and observation
      .Patients failing this management ultimately require elective thoracotomy for further
      evaluation and treatment(clotted hemothorax, empyema and diaphragmatic hernia. The current
      role of VATS in trauma includes evaluation and control of continued chest tube bleeding,
      early evacuation of retained hemothorax, evacuation and decortication of posttraumatic
      empyemas, evaluation and limited treatment of suspected diaphragm injuries, evaluation and
      treatment of persistent air leaks, and evaluation of mediastinal injuries.
