      groups - an intervention group and a control group - to test the effects of an early physical
      therapy education intervention for breast cancer survivors who are candidates for breast
      cancer surgery. Because of the nature of the intervention (patient early education with 1:1
      discussion of educational materials) we will be unable to introduce blinding of the
      participant as well as the staff.
