      still die worldwide. The gastroduodenal ulcer disease is the most common cause of
      gastrointestinal bleeding. Even lower gastrointestinal bleeding occurs especially in patients
      of older age.

      The goal of our data acquisition and evaluation is to learn whether existing diagnostic or
      therapeutic procedures are of relevance in the management of acute gastrointestinal
      bleedings. Unlike the management of patients with various forms of accidents (e.g.
      polytrauma), only a few data exists on patients with acute gastrointestinal bleedings. The
      aim of our study is to develop optimal diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms of acute
      gastrointestinal bleeding. Therefore our prospective data registry should answer different
      questions:

      When is the right time for a gastroscopy or colonoscopy? Should every patient with a
      suspected gastrointestinal bleeding receive endoscopy? Which clinical und laboratory findings
      influence the success of therapy? Does endoscopic procedures have an influence on the length
      of hospital stay?

      Against this background we will record treatment findings separately. This includes clinical
      (e.g. age, sex, date of admission, department of admission, onset of symptoms), laboratory
      (e.g. blood count), history of medications (e.g. new anticoagulation's) and endoscopic
      findings (e.g. active bleeding). Furthermore the length of inhospital stay will be recorded.

      Participants will be followed for the duration of hospital stay, an expected average of 7
      days.
