      thousands years. Due to the feasible and relatively safe in acupuncture management, now the
      west countries had been well document about acupuncture in medicine. The acupuncture therapy
      applied in post stroke functional recovery has been considered as more benefit than physical
      therapy only to post stroke rehabilitation. However, the effect of combined acupuncture
      therapy with standard management in acute stroke patient still remains unknown. The aim of
      this study is to evaluate the therapeutic effect of acupuncture in acute ischemic stroke
      patients. The prospective study was designed as a randomized, single blinded, control trial.
      We collected newly onset of acute ischemic stroke patient without underling systemic major
      illness, and randomized assign the collected patients into two groups as experimental
      (acupuncture)group and normal control group. The two groups both treat with routine western
      medicine as standard stroke therapy. The outcome measurement will evaluate by the changes
      from baseline at one and three months. The assessed scales including NIH stroke scale, the
      Barthel index, the Functional Independence Measure score, the Fugl-Meyer Assessment, and the
      Modified Rankin Scale. We compared the all variable measurements to see if any benefit from
      acupuncture group than the control group.
