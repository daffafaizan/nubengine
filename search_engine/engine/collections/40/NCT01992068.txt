      -induced esophageal injury, this is routinely assessed by patient reported accounts, and the
      symptoms are then managed supportively (e.g. with pain medicines, parenteral nutrition,
      feeding tubes etc). Manometry has been frequently used to study the effects of RT on
      gastrointestinal function in the setting of numerous malignancies, including colorectal,
      cervical and prostate cancers. What is often seen after RT is decreased sphincter function in
      the anorectal region leading to problems with continence and fecal urgency, however there has
      not been as rigorous of an evaluation of esophageal function after RT.

      One study performed more than 15 years ago included only 4 patients with lung cancer and
      concluded that mucosal irritation was likely the primary cause of RT-associated esophageal
      injury and no abnormalities in motility were seen. Radiation is known to cause long-term
      esophageal injury including stricture, and there is manometric evidence of impaired motility
      long-term after RT. The recent introduction of high-resolution manometry permits more
      extensive evaluation of the effects of RT on esophageal function.
