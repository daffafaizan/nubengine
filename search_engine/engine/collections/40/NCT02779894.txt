    
      Sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome (SAHS) is a prevalent disease with significant morbidity
      resulting in long waiting lists and high health care costs. Therefore, alternative
      cost-effective approaches are urgently needed. A possible procedure is telemedicine based on
      ICT.

      The design of the study is prospective, randomized, controlled, open and parallel.

      A ICT-based out of hospital management of SAHS is implemented to be compared with the
      classical in-hospital management.

      The main objectives were the evaluation of both groups and the analysis of efficacy and cost
      effectiveness of two SAHS management programs.

      This is a 3 month randomized, with parallel groups study. Participants will be patients with
      suspicion of SAHS derived to the Investigators' Sleep Unit.

      Patients are randomized in two groups; 1) classical in-hospital group: polysomnography or
      home respiratory polygraphy (HRP), CPAP titration and treatment and hospital follow-up; and
      2) ICT group: 3 consecutive HRPs, automatic CPAP treatment and control by phone/video
      conferences and data transmission by using a custom designed platform.
