      chronic schizophrenia. The research was a randomized controlled trial. The setting was the
      chronic inpatient wards at a psychiatric teaching hospital in Northern Taiwan. A total of 63
      participants, 30 in the hot footbath group and 33 in the control group, were completed the
      study from November 2019 to June 2020. Participants were randomly allocated to the
      experimental group and the control group. The experimental group was given a hot footbath
      with a temperature of 41℃±1℃ for 20 minutes at about 1-2 hours before sleep, and this was
      repeated five times a week for four weeks; the control group was given routine care for four
      weeks. The CPSQI was used to collect the pre- and post-test data. Through this method, we
      explored whether the trial could effectively improve patients' sleep quality.
