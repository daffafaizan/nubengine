      I. Determine the efficacy of imatinib mesylate, in terms of 6-month progression-free
      survival, of patients with recurrent meningioma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES I. Determine the response rate and overall survival of patients treated
      with this drug.

      II. Evaluate the safety profile of this drug in these patients. III. Determine the
      pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients. IV. Develop exploratory data concerning
      surrogate markers of of angiogenic activity in vivo using functional neuro-imaging studies
      and in vitro assays of serum angiogenic peptides of this drug in these patients.

      V. Develop exploratory data concerning evidence of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)
      inhibition in tumor specimens taken from patients undergoing surgery VI. Develop exploratory
      data correlating molecular abnormalities in the tumor with response in patients treated with
      this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to concurrent use of
      enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (yes vs no), histology (benign vs atypical or malignant),
      neurofibromatosis positivity (yes vs no), and preoperative candidacy (yes vs no).

      Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate once or twice daily. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients (30 per stratum) will be accrued for this study
      within 8-12 months.
