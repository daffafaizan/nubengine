      adults with asthma. There has been progress in identifying mechanisms and risk factors for
      severe respiratory symptoms, and in particular, wheezing. Given this close relationship, it
      would be attractive to apply antiviral strategies to the prevention and treatment of asthma,
      and both RV and RSV are obvious targets. Unfortunately, attempts at developing an RSV vaccine
      have so far been unsuccessful, and vaccination to prevent RV infection does not seem to be
      feasible due to the large number of serotypes. Antiviral medications have been tested in
      clinical trials, however one problem with this approach is that once the clinical signs and
      symptoms appear, viral replication is well underway.

      The other potential therapeutic approach for respiratory viral infections would be to
      selectively inhibit pro-inflammatory immune responses induced by the virus. The beneficial
      effects of systemic glucocorticoids indicate that this approach is valid; the challenge will
      be to develop treatments with greater efficacy and a reduced potential for adverse effects.
      The large body of information linking cysteinyl leukotrienes to viral infections, allergic
      inflammation, and asthma exacerbations, strongly supports the hypothesis that virus-induced
      leukotrienes contribute to the severity of respiratory infections and in susceptible
      individuals, lead to lower airway obstruction and exacerbations of asthma. We propose to use
      montelukast in an experimental viral challenge model to explore this hypothesis.
