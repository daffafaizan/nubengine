      cell activating functions. Chimeric antigen receptor T cell Immunotherapy has more advantages
      compared with conventional immunotherapy, especially in dealing with patients of hematologic
      malignancies and solid malignant tumors.This study design a novel specific Chimeric antigen
      receptor aiming at GD2 antigen. After CAR-T cell infusion, At periodic intervals, the
      investigators will evaluate clinical symptoms Improved conditions of this disease.Through
      this study, the investigators will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of CAR-T cell
      immunotherapy in treating with GD2 positive glioma patients.
