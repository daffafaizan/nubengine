      disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Patients with metabolic syndrome have an increased
      general low grade inflammation and, consequently, of oxidative stress that affects properties
      and functions of lipoproteins (Dandona et al 2005). Intentional weight loss can improve or
      prevent many of the metabolic syndrome-related risk factors and these benefits are often
      found after weight loss of at least 5% of initial weigh.

      Aim: i) to investigate the structure and functionality of plasma lipoproteins, oxidative
      stress and the inflammatory condition in subjects with BMI between 25kg/mq and 35 kg/mq and
      with or without metabolic syndrome; and ii) to test the effects of weight loss of at least 5%
      of initial weigh promoted by an hypo-caloric balanced diet on these parameters.

      Methods: Eighty overweight and moderately obese subjects (BMI: 25 - 35 kg/m2) with or without
      metabolic syndrome were recruited for the study. Fasting blood samples were taken and
      analyzed for routine laboratory analysis, lipoprotein isolation and analysis, and oxidative
      stress and inflammation markers measurements. The subjects received an hypo-caloric balanced
      diet. Fasting blood samples were taken from subjects who had lost at least 5% of their
      initial weight at the end of the intervention period and analyzed for same markers determined
      at baseline.
