    
      This study, Study 1.1, is a prospective, observational, two-center, short- term
      cross-sectional study to assess the reproducibility and repeatability of a set of specified
      ultrasound-based quantitative imaging biomarkers. The primary focus will be on imaging
      biomarkers of the liver fibrosis component of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD),
      rather than the steatosis or inflammation component. The rationale is that the fibrosis
      component is linked most closely to survival and other clinical outcomes. Study 1.1 will also
      collect data to explore vendor- or device-specific investigational biomarkers on other
      components of NAFLD such as steatosis and possibly inflammation. The data collected will be
      used to inform a decision of which of these biomarkers have sufficient precision to be
      advanced to NIMBLE Stage 2.
