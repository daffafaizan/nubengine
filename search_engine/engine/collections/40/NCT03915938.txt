      Î³-aminobutyric acid agonists. Evidence suggest that analgesic effect of ketamine is primarily
      related to the affective than the sensorial aspects of pain interpretation. The investigators
      investigated whether ketamine, a noncompetitive NMDA antagonist, would modify the perceived
      emotional valence of pain-related words when compared to non-pain-related ones in healthy
      volunteers. Using a single session double-blind parallel placebo-controlled design, 24
      healthy volunteers were randomized to receive intravenous S-ketamine (n=12) or placebo
      (n=12). During infusion (plasmatic target of 60 ng/ml), the effects of ketamine were recorded
      using EEG and oddball behavioral data was monitored. Evoked potentials (N200 and P300
      components) were recorded during performance of a semantic written word oddball task
      containing pain-related (targets) and non-pain-related words (standards). Expected results:
      The findings of this study can help in the understanding of neurophysiologic mechanisms
      involved in ketamine's effects both in psychiatric diseases as in the treatment of
      postoperative acute and chronic pain.
