      and studies have shown increased concentrations of an endogenously generated Nitric Oxide
      Synthase inhibitor, amongst women with PE.

      Nitrate and nitrite are required to produce Nitric Oxide (NO). NO is released from the
      endothelial lining of blood vessels, and acts to relax smooth muscle within the vasculature,
      acting as a potent vasodilator. Reduced NO concentrations are hence thought to contribute
      towards the systemic vascular constriction seen in PE.

      Hypertensive diseases in pregnancy are an important cause of morbidity and mortality in both
      maternal, fetal and neonatal health. Treatment options are limited in pregnancy and hence
      alternative methods to improve blood pressure control should be sought.

      In this randomised placebo controlled double blinded trial we aim to assess the effect of
      dietary nitrate supplementation on the hypertensive diseases of pregnancy and the subsequent
      maternal, fetal-neonatal outcomes. The safety and acceptability of dietary nitrate
      supplementation will also be confirmed in this study.
