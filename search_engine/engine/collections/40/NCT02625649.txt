    
      One hundred Danish type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients who underwent Roux-en-Y gastric
      bypass surgery (RYGB) between 2006-2011 will be evaluated clinically together with 50 T2DM
      patients, matched on gender, age, presurgical body mass index, and diabetes duration.

      The clinical follow-up consists of a physiological check-up, a thorough paraclinical work-up,
      and a whole body dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (body composition and bone mineral density)
      a peripheral quantitative compute tomography (HR-pQCT), stool samples (microbiota),
      ophthalmological examination including retina photo, and a questionaire.

      More over, a liquid meal test with sampling of total bile acids, fibroblast growth factor 19
      and 21 (FGF 19 and FGF 21), plasma glucose, and insulin will be performed on a smaller part
      of the patients.
