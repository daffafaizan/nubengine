      to moderate and heavy alcohol users.

      The specific aims are to:

        1. Determine if chlorzoxazone alters daily alcohol consumption by comparing the mean drinks
           consumed per day during chlorzoxazone administration compared with the mean drinks per
           day consumed during placebo administration.

        2. To determine if polymorphisms in genes encoding for neurotransmitters or receptors
           involved in alcohol reward, abuse, dependence, craving, or relapse may predict the level
           of response to chlorzoxazone's effects on alcohol consumption or craving.

        3. To investigate any change in alcohol craving during a cue induced craving task where
           participants view and respond to a number of images.
