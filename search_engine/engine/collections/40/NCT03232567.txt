    
      This is a Phase 2a, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the safety
      and immunogenicity of NasoVAX in healthy adults 18 to 49 years of age. Subjects will be
      screened within 28 days of randomization (Day 1). Approximately 60 subjects who meet all
      inclusion and no exclusion criteria and provide written informed consent will be enrolled
      into 3 sequential cohorts of 20 subjects each defined by the viral particle dose (1×10(9th),
      1×10(10th), and 1×10(11th) vp). Within each cohort and its sentinel group, subjects will be
      randomized in a 3:1 ratio to receive 1 intranasal dose of NasoVAX or placebo (Day 1). A
      sentinel group of 5 subjects from each cohort will be dosed and followed through Day 8.
      Dosing of the remainder of each cohort may proceed if no events meeting stopping criteria
      have occurred. The SRC, consisting of the Investigator, the Medical Monitor, and a Sponsor
      Representative, will review AE, reactogenicity, and laboratory data through Day 8 for all
      subjects in each cohort before subjects are randomized to the next higher dose. If any event
      meeting stopping criteria occur, the SRC will review all available safety information before
      additional patients are dosed.
