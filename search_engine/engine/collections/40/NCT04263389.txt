      a matched normal group. This study include two groups, 40 subjects with mechanical chronic
      cervical pain and 40 healthy subjects representing the control group. The primary outcome
      measure was the shoulder proprioception test of both upper limbs during active repositioning
      and quantified with angular displacement error. Test was applied using an isokinetic
      dynamometer device at angle 30° for both shoulder internal and external rotation on both
      sides with an angular velocity 30°/sec.
