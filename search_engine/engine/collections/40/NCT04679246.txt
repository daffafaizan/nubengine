      group and a control group of three schools each. Acatlán de Juárez has a total of 11
      elementary schools.

      The strategies will be implemented in collaboration with the authorities of the Acatlán de
      Juárez community, the school authorities, ITESO staff, CUTonalá, CUCS, and AJANUT. Key actors
      from both the school and community levels will be involved through the study to adapt the
      strategies socially and culturally to promote community project ownership. An initial study
      of the viability of the project and the current conditions of food and physical activity in
      school facilities will be carried out, as well as the perception of the community. The
      research team will design the contents and materials of the intervention taking into account
      the opinions and suggestions of the community and the results of the initial study. The
      schools of the control group will be chosen from the municipality of Villa Corona, Jalisco,
      which is similar to Acatlán de Juárez.

      The strategies proposed for intervention by the research team, which will be agreed with the
      community, including the following:

        -  Surveillance in compliance with the regulation of the sale of food in school buildings,
           according to official guidelines

        -  Sensitization of children, parents, teachers (especially those in charge of the physical
           education class) and personnel in charge of the food supply (school cooperative), to
           improve acceptance and commitment to the regulation of the sale of food

        -  Training for the preparation of hygienic and healthy food for the personnel in charge of
           food sale

        -  Promotion of the consumption of simple water and healthy foods

        -  Rescue and promotion of the consumption of regional foods

        -  Reconditioning of the infrastructure for the consumption of simple water, free and
           healthy food, and the realization of physical activity

        -  Organization of events and support in the coordination of groups that promote physical
           activity at the community level

        -  Optimization of physical education classes at school sites

        -  Implementation of health promotion and care actions in the school context

        -  Development of skills in the school community for health care and generation of healthy
           school environments

        -  Creation and strengthening of health and nutrition committees in schools, with the
           participation of directors, teachers and parents to generate necessary and permanent
           conditions that favor healthy environments

      To achieve a greater rapprochement with the population, qualitative instruments will also be
      implemented before the intervention, such as focus groups and in-depth interviews, which
      allow the identification of barriers and possible solutions to improve eating habits and
      promote physical activity in the population. Likewise, during the intermediate and final
      measurement phases, similar qualitative strategies will be applied to rescue successes and
      points for improvement of the intervention.

      During the implementation of the strategies, meticulous monitoring of the localities will be
      carried out to identify significant changes that may affect the eating habits and physical
      activity in either of the two groups (intervention and control).
