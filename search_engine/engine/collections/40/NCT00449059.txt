      transplantation. Its use, however, comes at the cost of significant side effects, such as
      arterial hypertension. Our aim was to investigate the effect of acute administration of
      nitroglycerin in heart-transplanted patients with cyclosporine-induced hypertension.

      Methods: We included 18 hypertensive patients (HT) scheduled for elective cardiac
      catheterization after heart transplantation and treated with cyclosporine, as well as
      6-matched HT. Simultaneous measurements of BP in the aorta and pulmonary artery before and
      after administration of nitroglycerin were done.

      Results: After injection of 50μg and 100μg nitroglycerin a significant BP decrease was
      observed both in heart-transplanted patients (sBP p=0.0001; dBP p=0.0001) and in controls
      (sBP p=0.006; dBP p=0.05). This reduction was more pronounced in heart-transplanted patients
      (sBP p=0.022; dBP 0.018 for group comparison). 8±3 minutes after the last nitrate infusion BP
      remained significantly reduced vs baseline in heart-transplanted patients (p<0.001) while it
      comes back to baseline in controls. The reduction in sBP (p=0.04 after 50μg nitroglycerin;
      p=0.05 after 100μg nitroglycerin) but not dBP correlated to cyclosporinemia.

      Conclusions: This study indicates that nitroglycerin reduces sBP in heart-transplanted
      patients with cyclosporine-induced hypertension. Further studies are needed to evaluate the
      long-term effect of nitrates in these patients.
