      disease is the leading cause of mortality in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients. After
      renal transplantation one-half of all deaths are cardiac, usually in the first 5 years in the
      presence of a functional graft. Because of this renal transplantation candidates are
      undergoing cardiac pre-transplant risk stratification.

      There is no consensus regarding which modality should be use for detection of CAD in this
      cardiac pre-transplant risk stratification. CAG is known as gold standard but is a invasive
      procedure with risk of complication.

      The investigators wish to investigate the ability of detecting CAD as defined by invasive
      Coronary angiography (CAG) by clinical examination, blood test and non-invasive test (cCTA,
      MPS and acoustic CAD Patch). The investigators hypothesize that a single modality or
      combination of these with high sensitivity and specificity could diagnose significant CAD
      without the need of further invasive procedures.

      This study will include 150 renal transplantations candidate.
