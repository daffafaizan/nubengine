      underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy in year 2015 when intraoperative fluid therapy were managed
      using goal directed fluid therapy technique. The second cohort consists of patients who
      underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy in year 2017 when intraoperative fluid therapy were based
      on the consideration of the anaesthesiologist. In 2015 most of the patients spent the first
      postoperative night in the ICU where the fluid management and monitoring of the urine output
      and vital functions were more controlled than in the normal ward. In 2017 most of the
      patients got in the regular ward right after the surgery. The aim of the study is to examine
      whether there are differences in the amounts of the intraoperative and postoperative fluids
      between the cohorts and does the perioperative fluid therapy affect to the complication
      rates.
