    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if patients with advanced transitional cell carcinoma treated with
      bevacizumab, gemcitabine hydrochloride (gemcitabine) and cisplatin will have increased
      overall survival when compared to patients treated with gemcitabine, cisplatin, and placebo.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the progression-free survival of these two regimens in patients with advanced
      transitional cell carcinoma.

      II. To compare the proportion of patients who experience an objective response on each
      regimen.

      III. To compare the grade 3 and greater toxicities in patients treated on the two regimens.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days
      1 and 8, cisplatin IV, and placebo IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21
      days for 6 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients
      then receive placebo IV over 30-90 minutes every 21 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride and cisplatin as in arm I. Patients also
      receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 6
      cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then receive
      bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for up to 7 years.
