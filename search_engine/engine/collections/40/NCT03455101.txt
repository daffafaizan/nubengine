      worldwide.The prevalence of diabetes is also increased significantly in Turkey, from 7.2 % in
      2002 to 13.7% in 2012.This increasing prevalence leads to serious public health problems and
      a significant economic burden. Therefore, the optimal treatment of diabetes and prevention of
      diabetic complications, especially the cardiovascular outcomes, is utmost important. Although
      achieving glycemic targets in patients with diabetes is of great importance, blood glucose is
      not the only predictor of cardiovascular outcome in diabetes. Optimization of other metabolic
      parameters such as lipids, arterial blood pressure (ABP), and body weight as well as a
      healthy lifestyle are utmost important. As there is hardly enough data about glycemic and
      other metabolic control parameters in Turkish adult patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes,
      this nationwide survey was performed.
