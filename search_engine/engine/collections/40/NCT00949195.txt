      exercise in patients with COPD is unpredictable from lung function data. The non-invasive
      assessment of pulmonary hemodynamics during exercise by semi-supine echocardiography and
      flow-mediated vasodilatation measurement may give useful data in the rehabilitation of COPD
      patients.

      Methods: Patients with stable, severe COPD and healthy, age-matched subjects (H) perform semi
      supine echocardiography with PAPs measurement. COPD patients perform ramp protocol with gas
      exchange detection. Serum hsCRP level is also determined in COPD patients. All of the
      subjects perform complete lung function with body pletysmography and diffusion capacity
      measurement. Endothel dysfunction is detected by flow mediated vasodilation measurement after
      arm strangulation with Doppler ultrasonography.
