    
      This single-center, investigator-masked, crossover study is designed to investigate the
      circadian rhythms of aqueous humor dynamics in human subjects with ocular hypertension (OHT)
      before and after intervention with a commonly used ocular hypotensive medication,
      brimonidine. Thirty volunteers with ocular hypertension (intraocular pressure greater than
      20mmHg) will be enrolled.

      The subjects will undergo a baseline phase and medication phase using brimonidine. At both
      phases, they will attend a daytime and a nighttime study visit in which fluorophotometry will
      be used to calculate aqueous flow (production), trabecular outflow facility, and uveoscleral
      outflow. At the completion of the study, subjects will return to their previous ophthalmic
      clinic.
