    
      Objectives: 1) To determine the effectiveness of a patient-specific, real-time e-health
      alerts delivered at point-of-care in reducing rates of AET discontinuation and to understand
      patient-level factors related to AET discontinuation. 2) To assess integration of e-health
      alerts regarding deviations from best practices in administration of AET by cancer care
      teams.

      Methods: A prospective, two group controlled comparison pilot study will be conducted at two
      urban, McGill University-affiliated hospitals, the Royal Victoria Hospital and St. Mary's
      Hospital. A minimum of 43 patients per study arm will be enrolled through site-level
      allocation. Follow-up is 1.5 years. Healthcare professionals at the intervention site will
      have access to the e-health tool which will report to them in real-time: medical events with
      known associations to AET discontinuation, AET adherence monitor, and a discontinuation
      alert.
