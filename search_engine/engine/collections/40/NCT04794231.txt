    
      The single-center randomized controlled trial study aimed to compare chlorhexidine gluconate
      (CHG)-impregnated dressing and standard dressing with respect to their effects on the
      frequency of central-line associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI), catheter related
      bloodstream infection (CRBSI), primary bloodstream infection (BSI) and catheter colonization
      in critically ill pediatric patients with short-term non-tunneled central venous catheter
      (CVC) in a pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) of a tertiary referral hospital in Turkey..
      Pediatric patients aged 1 month to 18 years admitted to our PICU between May 2018 and
      December 2019, who had received placement of a short-term non-tunneled CVC which had stayed
      in place for at least 48 hours were included into the study. The patients were grouped with
      respect to the type of catheter fixation they had received, either with CHG-impregnated
      dressing or standard dressing, which were assigned in a randomized fashion. The groups were
      compared with regard to the frequencies of CLABSI, CRBSI, primary BSI and catheter
      colonization, as well as microorganism etiology. Any adverse event related to catheter
      dressing were recorded. Independent risk factors of CLABSI frequency were analyzed.
