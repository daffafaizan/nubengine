      mediated by the ipsilateral (intact) motor cortex (M1). This proposal has not been
      conclusively tested experimentally and represents an important question in stroke
      rehabilitation. In this protocol, we will study the behavioral consequences of transient
      inactivation of ipsilateral M1 on motor performance of the affected arm in chronic stroke
      patients with complete and incomplete motor recovery. The results from this study will
      provide fundamental information on the role of ipsilateral M1 in recovery of motor function
      after chronic stroke.
