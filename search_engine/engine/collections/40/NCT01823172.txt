      lymphatic mapping was then performed with methylene blue dye by injecting the SLN with
      0.05-0.10 cc non dilute methylene blue and tracing via the efferent lymphatic channel to the
      second echelon lymph node (Figure 1). For our initial patients a 27 gauge needle and 3cc
      syringe was utilized but this was modified over the study to a 30 gauge needle and 1cc
      syringe. The blue efferent lymphatic was traced with minimal spreading of the surrounding
      tissue to visualize its drainage into the next lymph node(s). A second echelon lymph node was
      considered any blue lymph node or any lymph node with blue dye leading directly into it. The
      number of second echelon lymph nodes was recorded. The second-echelon lymph node(s) was not
      removed.
