      within the past 2 months were enrolled in this study, and treated with 200 mg/day of
      etidronate cyclically. The bone mineral density (BMD) of lumbar spines (L2-4) was examined by
      QDR2000. OFH was evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). ClinicalTrials.gov
      identifier: NCT00679978.

      Forty-four patients completed the 2-year study including annual X-rays and the BMD analysis.
      MRI evaluation at entry and 2 years was performed in 41 patients. The BMD values with
      anteroposterior (AP) and lateral views decreased by 6.4% and 9.7% respectively in the first
      year, but were stable in the second year. Eleven patients developed VF and 9 patients
      developed OFH. The risk factors for VF included previous VF and a low BMD value (T score <
      -1.5) of AP view at baseline with odds ratio (OR) 14.9 (95%CI 2.9-76.4), while the risk
      factor for OFH was the recent maximum GC dosage (>1.2 mg/kg/day versus ≦; OR=7.7, 95%CI
      1.3-45.5) and the decrease in BMD value of lateral view (>15% versus ≤; OR=6.7, 95% CI
      1.2-36.1) in the first year.
