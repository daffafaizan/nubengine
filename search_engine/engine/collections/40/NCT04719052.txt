      and gender norms. The effectiveness of the intervention will be evaluated by comparing the
      BMI z-score between the control (low-fat diet) and intervention (MD) groups.

      The secondary outcomes are: Adherence to the DM, KidMed questionnaire; Level of physical
      activity, PAQ-A questionnaire; Habit/food intake: 3-day dietary record, Helena study food
      frequency questionnaire, Knowledge about food and nutrition, a questionnaire from Helena's
      study; Quality of life, kid screen-27 Index; Sociodemographic data of the parents;
      Anthropometric data: weight, height, BMI, body composition, waist circumference, waist-hip
      ratio; Clinical variables: blood pressure, Biochemical variables and omic determinations: in
      urine, blood and feces.

      In total, the adolescents will receive 5 visits:

        -  1 pre-selection visit (to check inclusion / exclusion criteria in the study) (V0)

        -  1 inclusion visit (V1) in which stool, urine, and blood samples will be collected,
           anthropometric measurements (such as weight and waist circumference) and blood pressure
           will be taken, and questionnaires and records will be answered dietary.

        -  1 follow-up visit (V2), at 2 months, in which anthropometric and blood pressure
           measurements will be taken and questionnaires and dietary records will be answered.

        -  1 final visit (V3), at 4 months, in which stool, urine, and blood samples will be
           collected, anthropometric and blood pressure measurements will be made, and
           questionnaires and dietary records will be answered.

        -  1 post-intervention follow-up visit (V4), 4 months after the end of the intervention, in
           which anthropometric and blood pressure measurements will be taken and questionnaires
           and dietary records will be answered.
