      factors and depression and anxiety pathogenesis (2,8) Brain-derived neurotrophic factor
      (BDNF), a member of the neurotrophic family known to regulate neuronal plasticity and
      survival , may play an important role in the pathophysiology of depression and anxiety (3,9).

      Different studies indicated patients who were exposed to traumatic events have anxiety
      comorbidity and lower levels of serum BDNF compared to those without a history of traumatic
      events (4) .

      BDNF has an antidepressant and anxiolytic effect which suggest that BDNF is implicated in the
      regulation of anxiety-related behaviors. which leads to a valine-to-methionine change in the
      proBDNF protein, was associated with lower activity-dependent secretion of BDNF (5)and has
      been implicated with increased susceptibility to neuropsychiatric disorders including
      depression, anxiety-related dysfunction, and bipolar disorder , all these studies suggest
      that BDNF is likely to be an important etiological factor in memory, depression and anxiety
      disorders (6,10).

      BDNF arises from a precursor, proBDNF, which is cleaved to produce the mature protein through
      the tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) pathway, and represents one mechanism that can
      regulate the action of BDNFarises from a precursor, proBDNF, which is cleaved to produce the
      mature protein through the tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) pathway, and represents one
      mechanism that can regulate the action of BDNF (7).

      The purpose of this study is to examine the quality of life after stroke of patients treated
      with thrombolysis .
