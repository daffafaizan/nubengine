      of Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in their sputum will be identified by
      their primary physicians and by laboratory record review. If they meet the inclusion
      criteria, they will be invited to participate in the study. The primary outcome variables
      include pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic indices. The study end points include completion
      of the sputum and blood sampling for pharmacokinetic studies of both intravenous and oral
      formulations of linezolid and collection of microbiologic specimen (sputum and anterior nares
      cultures) one month after discharge. Additionally, pharmacokinetic data will be analyzed for
      effects of age and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) mutation on
      clearance of linezolid and for relationship between levels of linezolid achieved in sputum
      and blood and clinical outcome
