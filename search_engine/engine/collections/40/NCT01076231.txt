      I. To assess feasibility. (Phase I) II. To determine dose-limiting toxicity and maximum
      tolerated dose. (Phase I) III. To determine the pathologic CR rate. (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess late complications from irradiation using proton beam therapy in place of
      conventional photon beam therapy. (Phase II) II. To assess acute side effects from
      irradiation using proton beam therapy in place of conventional photon beam therapy. (Phase
      II) III. To compare the dose distribution to tumor and surrounding normal structures using
      DVH's (Dose Volume Histograms) generated from the proton plan used to treat the patient and
      the photon plan generated for comparison purposes. (Phase II) IV. To determine
      progression-free survival (Phase II) and late toxicity.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of proton beam radiation therapy followed
      by a phase II study.

      Patients undergo proton beam radiotherapy over 5.5-7.5 weeks. Patients receive concurrent
      chemotherapy comprising cisplatin IV on days 1, 8, 29, and 36 and etoposide IV on days 1-5
      and days 29-33.Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Beginning 4-6 weeks after completion of chemoradiotherapy, patients may undergo surgical
      resection or additional chemoradiotherapy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for 3 years.
