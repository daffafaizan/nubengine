      Phase III study in women with non-bulky FIGO (International Federation of Gynecology and
      Obstetrics) Stage II - IV ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer that had not
      progressed (i.e., complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD) after
      completing their first-line chemotherapy for advanced ovarian cancer. Approximately 900
      subjects were to be enrolled into the study. Study was closed following 3rd overall survival
      (OS) interim analysis as planned per protocol, which confirmed futility.
