      ocular medications through innovative technical solutions. The Devers Drop Device (D3) will
      accurately track when a patient removes an eye drop bottle cap, communicate usage data
      wirelessly to a database that researchers can access, and send alerts to patients when a
      medication is due. In addition to helping patients maintain their dosing schedule, the D3
      will also provide adherence information to researchers and eye care providers, which will
      help to understand poor treatment outcomes and to develop improved treatment strategies.The
      clinical benefits of the device in improving adherence will initially be assessed and
      targeted towards glaucoma, but the ability of the device to be attached to all FDA-approved
      eye drop bottle caps will make this device attractive to all patients that need consistent
      daily use of eye drops.

      Randomized, prospective clinical trial: The investigators will enroll 50 participants (25
      male, 25 female) into a prospective trial with duration of up to 50 days. The inclusion
      criteria are those who are prescribed latanoprost eye drop to be used once per day at
      bedtime, and own a functioning Android or Apple iphone smartphone (iOs) with Bluetooth and
      cellular connectivity. The investigators will exclude patients who currently use smartphone
      medication reminders and those with severe cognitive impairment limiting their ability to
      understand a questionnaire. The 50-day period is useful for glaucoma studies because patients
      revert to their normal dosing pattern within two weeks after their last visit. This study
      will include two stages: Stage 1) a 25-day period evaluating baseline patient adherence with
      the D3 device; and Stage 2) a subsequent 25-day period to determine the effect of no reminder
      versus daily reminder using the D3 app, which includes integrated audio and visual reminders.
