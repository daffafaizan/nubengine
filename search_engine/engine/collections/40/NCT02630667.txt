      children. However, the acute benefits of defined nutrient consumption on brain and cognitive
      health are not well understood, particularly in preadolescent children. One factor that may
      relate to brain health and learning in children is the contribution of carbohydrates to the
      digestion rate of a meal (and associated effects on post-prandial glycemia).

      The effects of differentially absorbed carbohydrates on brain and cognition are unknown,
      especially when ingested via a fortified nutritional beverage providing a balanced array of
      nutrients. The aim of this study is to investigate the acute, transient effect of nutrient
      supplementation with varied carbohydrate systems in preadolescent children (i.e., 9-10
      years).

      Participants will be randomized to receive one of three treatment nutritional formulations
      containing carbohydrates with varying absorption rates along with a non-caloric placebo.
      Participants will perform a cognitive battery in the fasted condition, shortly after
      treatment ingestion, and an hour after ingestion. Group differences in performance will be
      contrasted to assess the effects of different carbohydrate types on children's cognitive
      function following an overnight fast.

      Findings from this study will inform our understanding of the macronutrient profile of
      breakfast that may potentially improve children's cognitive performance in the morning.
