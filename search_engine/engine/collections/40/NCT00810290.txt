      home contacts over one year and was implemented by individuals from the community with
      training and supervision by a clinical research nutritionist and a behavioral psychologist.
      Study measures included demographics, Stern predictive equation components (age, gender,
      ethnicity, fasting glucose, systolic blood pressure, HDL-cholesterol, body mass index, and
      family history of diabetes), glycosylated hemoglobin, dietary intake, physical activity,

      baseline, 6-months, and one-year; all other measures were assessed at baseline and one-year.
      All surveys were orally administered in Spanish.
