      separate room near the operating room, imaging staff will test it with the Structured Light
      Imaging system. The testing may take several extra minutes to capture the images. After this
      imaging, the surgeon will complete the surgery. Following surgery, and per routine medical
      care, the patient's breast tumor tissue sample will be sent to DHMC's lab for testing. The
      patient will see her primary doctor for standard surgery follow-up.

      No additional imaging or testing will be required for this research study following the usual
      surgery.
