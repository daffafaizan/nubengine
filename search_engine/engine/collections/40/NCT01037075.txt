      Specific aim 1: To test the hypothesis that individuals with comorbid schizophrenia and drug
      dependence will show impaired neurocognitive functions in anticipatory learning of
      eyetracking, attention, and memory performance compared to healthy controls subjects.

      Specific aim 2: To test the hypothesis that nicotine will dose-dependently improve
      anticipatory learning of eyetracking, attention, and memory performance in individuals with
      comorbid schizophrenia and substance dependence.

      Study Population:

      Male and nonpregnant-female smokers 18 to 55 years of age, from the following subject groups:
      (1) patients with a DSM IV diagnosis of schizophrenia (2) patients with dual DSM IV diagnoses
      of schizophrenia and heroin and/or cocaine dependence or abuse, or on methadone or
      beprenorphine maintenance and (3) healthy individuals with no family history of psychotic
      illness.

      Design:

      This study will be a double-blind, placebo controlled trial of nicotine or placebo nasal
      sprays. Participants will have four visits. After the training session, participants will be
      administered one dose (0, 1 or 2 mg) of nicotine nasal spray during each of the 3
      experimental sessions. The dose will be given 5 minutes prior to the cognitive task
      batteries.

      Outcome Measures:

      Vital signs, moods, and performance on tasks assessing eye movement (initiation latency,
      initiation acceleration, closed-loop pursuit gain), attention (Continuous Performance and
      Digit Symbol Substitution Tasks), and memory (delayed recognition and nback).
