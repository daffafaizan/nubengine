      the primary direction of the passive diagnostic test motions (cervical side-bending right and
      left), as well as angular rotations (deviations) occurring around these motions. Our
      secondary hypothesis is that examination of the kinematic data will provide objective inter-
      and intra-examiner data to assess similarities/differences occurring during the passive
      clinical exam before and after OMT. Lastly, we hypothesize that significant differences in
      the kinematic patterns will result between the two subject groups.

      This experiment is designed for the following clinical and biomechanical observations:

        -  comparisons of diagnostic data between three osteopathic physicians,

        -  comparisons of within-subject kinematic profiles pre- and post-treatment,

        -  inter-examiner comparisons of kinematic motion paths occurring during diagnostic
           motions,

        -  evaluate kinematic patterns between the two subject groups, and assess between group
           similarities/differences,

        -  evaluate diagnostic and kinematic data relative to VAS, cervical disability, health
           status information, and SNF,

        -  re-classify aspects of the kinematic data using a cluster (statistical) analysis
           procedure to compare with initial and secondary physician diagnostic data, and

        -  to assess the stability of changes made by the OMT procedures and the kinematic response
           three days post-treatment.
