      following treatment with mRNA vaccine, in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) who are
      treated with immune modulating medication. Each consenting subject will provide approximately
      30 mL of whole blood via venipuncture before and 45, 90 and 180 days after the first vaccine
      injection. These samples, obtained at Providence St. Vincent Medical Center, will be
      transferred to the Laboratory of Molecular and Tumor Immunology at the Earle A. Chiles Cancer
      Research Institute, where the blood will be processed and cryopreserved. Serum samples will
      be analyzed for the presence and titer of neutralizing antibodies to the SARSCoV-2 virus.
      Isolated peripheral blood lymphocytes will be used for analyses of T cell responses to
      SARS-CoV-2 spike peptides. Responses will be compared to the immune responses of 10 subjects
      who have been enrolled in the CORVax spike plasmid DNA vaccine study and are subsequently
      referred to in this protocol as "healthy controls." The unused portion of the samples will be
      stored for future deep cytokine and genomic analyses if funding becomes available to perform
      these latter studies. This study will include 4 cohorts, each will enroll 10 subjects who are
      being treated with an immunomodulating therapy for MS. The 4 immunomodulating medications
      selected, because each differs in their mechanisms of action, include ocrelizumab (B-cell
      lytic), fingolimod (prevents mobilization of B and T cells from peripheral lymphoid organs),
      natalizumab (blocks transmigration of monocytes, and lymphocytes into the central nervous
      system), and dimethyl fumarate/diroximel fumarate (reduces inflammation-induce oxidative
      stress).
