      maturation and ovulation induction in ovarian hyperstimulation protocols for in vitro
      fertilization (IVF). However, hCG is related to the occurrence of the ovarian
      hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), a potentially life-threatening complication and
      hyper-responding patients are particularly in high risk. An alternative to exogenous hCG is
      the administration of a GnRH agonist inducing an endogenous rise in both LH and FSH levels
      due to the initial flare effect.

      Comparisons: Pregnancy rates and embryological data will be compared from hyper-responding
      patients receiving either GnRH agonist (Arvekap) or hCG (Pregnyl) for ovulatrion induction
      following a GnRH antagonist treatment cycle.
