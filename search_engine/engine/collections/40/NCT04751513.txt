      Oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy (OIPN) is a common adverse effect that becomes
      worse as the drug dose accumulation impacts cancer patients' daily activities and quality of
      life. This study aims to evaluate the immediate and carry-over effects of auricular
      acupressure on OIPN symptoms and quality of life for colorectal cancer patients.

      Methods :

      This randomized trial will recruit 76 participants with colorectal cancer and OIPN from the
      oncology outpatient department in Taiwan. The control group will receive usual care, whereas
      the experimental group will receive usual care in addition to auricular acupressure for 8
      weeks. Outcomes will be assessed by using the chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy
      assessment tool, neuropathic pain symptom inventory, pain visual analogue scale, and the
      European Organization for research and treatment of cancer-quality of life questionnaire-core
      30. These assessment tools are used before the intervention, biweekly during the
      intervention, 2 weeks after the intervention, and one month after the end of the chemotherapy
      course.

      Hypothesis:

      Ultimately, the result of this study will determine the immediate effects of the 8-week
      auricular acupuncture intervention on alleviating the participants' OIPN symptoms and
      enhancing their quality of life. This study will continue to evaluate the carry-over effects
      of auricular acupuncture after the chemotherapy course ends.
