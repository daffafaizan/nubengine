      their antiretroviral treatment to Doravirine+Emtricitabine/TAF. After 4 weeks of treatment
      all subjects will undergo lumbar puncture and bloods in order to assess CSF and plasma (total
      and unbound) Doravirine concentrations. HIV RNA also will be assessed. All subjects will
      complete a follow up visit 4 weeks after
