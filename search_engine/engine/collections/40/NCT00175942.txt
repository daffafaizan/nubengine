      arrhythmias and is responsible for 50% of the mortality from cardiovascular disease in
      developed countries (1). Chronic elevation of indicators of coagulation activation and
      inflammation has been found in patients with coronary heart disease and may contribute to
      vasculatory disorders probably contributing to the development of arrhythmogenesis. However,
      the role of coagulation activation as a potential risk factor for ventricular fibrillation
      during acute myocardial infarction has not been investigated yet.
