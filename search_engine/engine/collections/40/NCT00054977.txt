      different type of solid tumors who have failed standard, approved treatments can be enrolled
      in the study. Escalated doses of GM-CT-01 will be given alone in Cycle 1, and in combination
      with 5-fluorouracil in cycle 2. Patients will be on study for approximately 60 days for
      determination of safety. However, with patient consent treatment can continue until disease
      progression is determined by CT scan. The study secondary reason is to determine whether
      treatment has stabilize the tumors or change it in size (get bigger, smaller or stay the
      same)after Cycle 2 and any additional cycles of treatment.
