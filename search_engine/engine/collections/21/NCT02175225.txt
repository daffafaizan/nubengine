    
      This is a prospective, multi-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, phase-II
      clinical trial.

      Subjects will be randomized to either deferoxamine mesylate (DFO) at 32 mg/kg/day (up to a
      maximum daily dose of 6000 mg/day), or saline placebo, given by IV infusion for 3 consecutive
      days.

      Treatment will be initiated within 24 hours after ICH symptom onset. Randomization will
      control baseline imbalances associated with baseline ICH score, ICH onset-to-treatment time
      (OTT), ICH volume, baseline NIHSS score, and warfarin use.

      All subjects will be followed for 6 months and will receive standard of care therapy while
      participating in the study.

      Throughout the study, we will continue to assess the safety of DFO. At the conclusion of the
      study, the proportion of DFO-treated subjects with a good clinical outcome at 3 months
      (defined as modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 0-2) will be compared to the placebo
      proportion in a futility analysis to determine if it is futile to move DFO forward to Phase
      III efficacy evaluation.
