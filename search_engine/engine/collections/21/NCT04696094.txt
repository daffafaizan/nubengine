      bilateral internal carotid and intracerebral arteries with the compensatory growth of fragile
      small vessels. The etiology of disease is still unclear. The pathology is associated with
      blood vessels, characterizing the molecular changes of blood in patients with MMD may yield
      insights into the disease. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is identified to be the most common and
      abundant RNA molecular modification in eukaryotes, and involves in a variety of metabolic
      processes of RNA, such as RNA transcription, shearing, nuclear transport, and translation
      ability. The propose of this study is to investigate the change of m6A RNA modification in
      patients blood with moyamoya disease and its influence on clinical indicators, aiming to
      provide potential pathogenesis of moyamoya disease.
