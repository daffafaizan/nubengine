      gastrointestinal tract sequelae after radiotherapy to the abdomen and pelvis. II. Determine
      the toxic effects of this drug in these patients. III. Determine the effect of this drug on
      symptoms and quality of life of these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. Arm I:
      Patients receive oral pentosan polysulfate three times a day for 2-6 months. Arm II: Patients
      receive oral placebo three times a day for 2-6 months. Both arms: Patients may receive
      retreatment for two months if symptoms return and last for at least 2 weeks. Quality of life
      is assessed before treatment, and at each follow up visit. Patients are followed every 2
      months for 6 months, then every 3 months for 18 months, then annually for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 174 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years.
