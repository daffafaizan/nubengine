      oral iron in patients with varying hepcidin levels correlating the treatment
      response/hepcidin levels to more common laboratory parameters such as ferritin and CRP
      (C-Reactive Protein) levels and possibly determine if any of these select IBD or Gastric
      Bypass patients may demonstrate to be inappropriate for oral iron therapy.
