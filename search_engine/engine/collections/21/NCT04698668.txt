      with 14 ones achieved with the fusion approach (group 2). The two population were homogenous
      for age, sex, pancreatitis etiology and indication for drainage whereas PFCs of group 2 were
      larger (663 cm3 vs 437 cm3), more frequently WON than pseudocysts and were treated more
      precociously. As for procedure, in the group 2, thanks to fusion imaging, endoscopists didn't
      need ever contrast media - that was pivotal with traditional radiology - to adequately define
      lesion morphology. LAMS (Axios) stents were placed mainly in group 2, while in group 1 other
      types of stent were used.
