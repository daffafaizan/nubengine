    
      This is a double-blind, randomized controlled trial at an urban pediatric emergency
      department. Sample size (162) was based on a threshold equivalence of 7% (Î± = 0.05, power =
      80%). Inclusion criteria were: non-toxic, immunocompetent, 3 months to 18 years old,
      English-speaking patients with clinical or ultrasound identified skin abscesses who were not
      on antibiotics. Patients were block randomized to receive placebo or
      trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole following incision and drainage. Follow-up was a call at 2-3
      days & a repeat visit or call at 10-14 days. Treatment failure was defined as: persistent
      erythema, tenderness, and/or draining lesions. New lesion was defined as: primary resolution
      with development of new lesion (furuncle, carbuncle or abscess) at a different location.
      Compliance was evaluated by the return of the study medication or by patient report.
