      position is the most commonly used position at most centers. However prone position is
      another alternative.

      The left decubitus position is advocated for its the same position as the open procedure and
      easy to learn, as well as easy to emergent conversion to open thoracotomy .However, the
      disadvantage of this position is the need of lung retraction for better exposure and
      definitely one lung ventilation. They are regarded as potential causes leading lung injury.

      Prone thoracoscopic esophageal mobilization has been advocated for its potential benefits of
      increased operative exposure, no lung retraction, avoid one lung ventilation, improved
      surgeon ergonomics. But it is difficult to make emergent conversion under this positon and
      not familiar with most thoracic or digestive surgeons. A longer learning curve may be needed.

      A few publications have compared the two position with thoracoscopic mobilization of the
      esophagus in retrospective study of a small cohort. Until now, no prospective randomized
      study has been carried out in this field.
