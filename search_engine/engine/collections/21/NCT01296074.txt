      cardiopulmonary bypass. "Emergency Hematopoiesis" is the pathological process induced by the
      inflammation. The investigators previously confirmed that emergency hematopoiesis induced by
      cardiopulmonary bypass led to dynamic changes of quantities of monocyte subsets, there is a
      significant increase in the number of two monocyte subsets: 1) CD14highCD16+ monocyte with
      strong immunomodulatory activity; 2) CD14lowCD16- monocyte with potential ability of
      proliferation and differentiation. Therefore, a new hypothesis risen: "the change of the
      function and the number of monocyte subsets induced by emergency hematopoiesis play an
      important role for SIRS occurrence after cardiopulmonary bypass, correcting emergency
      hematopoiesis is a new breakthrough in the prevention and treatment of SIRS." To identify the
      mechanism of function changed in different monocyte subsets during the pathogenesis of SIRS,
      the research intended to target perioperative-period patients with heart valve replacement,
      monitor dynamically the number and phenotype of peripheral blood monocyte subsets by flow
      cytometry; sort out of different monocyte subsets for cell culture in vitro, observe the
      ability of proliferation and differentiation and effects between monocyte subsets and T
      lymphocyte; investigate the mechanism of immune function changes with antibody-blocking and
      compartment culture in patients; observe the impact of glucocorticoid treatment on the
      emergency hematopoiesis, offer new objects for evaluation of immune status in patients and
      provide new evidence for anti-inflammatory therapy .

      Patients should be follow the protocol of cardiopulmonary bypass according to normal hospital
      routine practice.

      A total of 30 patients will be enrolled in this clinical trial.
