      if tumor expansion is limited to the liver. One of palliative treatment is the the Selective
      Internal Radiation Therapy (SIRT) with Therasphere®. This treatment is made secure by
      performing a diagnostic angiogram coupled with a hepatic perfusion scintigraph with which
      patients at risk of complications are identified and excluded. The treatment objective, with
      the standard dosimetric approach, is to deliver an absorbed dose of 120 ± 20 Gy to the
      treated hepatic volume, most often one lobe. Recent retrospective trials show that an
      optimized dosimetric approach, considering the dose absorbed by the tumor, is technically
      achievable and would probably make it possible to obtain a better effectiveness. In our
      experience, treatment personalisation have been described to be used for 60% of the patients
      with a tumor larger than 7 cm underlying the clinical impact of this new approach.
