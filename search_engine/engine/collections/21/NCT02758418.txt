      and can result in suicidal thinking and/or behavior. However, unlike mood and anxiety
      disorders, AD has received little attention from scientific community and very few studies
      have been carried out to develop evidence-based treatments (EBT) for this problem. Besides,
      although a cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) protocol is currently available for the
      treatment of AD, many patients with this diagnosis remain untreated. There is therefore an
      evident need to design strategies that guarantee the patients receive adequate treatment. A
      feasible solution might be self-administered computerized CBT (cCBT).

      A growing body of research has found that cCBT is highly effective for anxiety and depressive
      disorders, achieving clinical improvements similar to those obtained with traditional
      face-to-face interventions. The use of internet to administer EBT allows reducing the contact
      time between the patient and the therapist and this way reach people who otherwise would not
      receive treatment. Therefore, the development of a cCBT for AD will mean an improvement in
      the delivery and dissemination of the current treatment programs. This is especially relevant
      for this problem considering the scarce attention received by the scientific community and
      the high interference caused in the patients' life. As far as we know, there is no cCBT
      program specifically designed for the treatment of AD. As a consequence, further research in
      this area is needed.
