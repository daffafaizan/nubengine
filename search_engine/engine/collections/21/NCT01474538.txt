      subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) in participants with type 2 diabetes. This study is
      designed to allow comparison of the 2 rapid-acting insulin analogs, with regard to their
      efficacy and safety, when used as a pump insulin therapy in this participant population. Each
      participant will be randomized to 1 of the 2 sequence groups in a 1:1 ratio and randomization
      will be stratified according to screening A1C (less than or equal to 8.0% or greater than
      8.0%) and thiazolidinedione (TZD) use (yes or no). The study design includes the following
      periods: Screening/Randomization, Treatment Period 1 (16 weeks), and Treatment Period 2 (16
      weeks).
