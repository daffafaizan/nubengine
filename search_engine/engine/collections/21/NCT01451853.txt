      carboplatin) are well noted and studied for their ability to cause ototoxicity which includes
      hearing loss, tinnitus, vertigo, or dizziness. It is the objective of this study to determine
      the safety and efficacy of SPI-1005 at three dose levels when delivered orally twice daily
      for 3 days, surrounding each cycle of platinum chemotherapy for head and neck or non-small
      cell lung cancer patients to prevent and treat chemotherapy induced hearing loss and
      tinnitus.

      SPI-1005, a proprietary oral formulation of ebselen is a small molecule mimic and inducer of
      the enzyme Glutathione Peroxidase. GPx reduces reactive oxygen species (ROS) by reacting with
      glutathione. SPI-1005 has been shown to reduce cisplatin induced hearing threshold shift in
      animal studies.
