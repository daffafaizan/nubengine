      ratio occurred on day 60 post-autologous stem cell transplantation. The treatment consisted
      of the following four phases:

        1. induction with 3-5 cycles of vincristine plus doxorrubicin and dexamethasone (VAD) every
           21-28 days: vincristine 0.4 mg , doxorubicin 9 mg/m² and oral dexamethasone 40 mg daily
           for 4 days;

        2. cyclophosphamide (4 g/m2 ) plus filgrastim (G-CSF) (5 μg/kg twice a day) for stem cell
           mobilization;

        3. melphalan (200 mg/m2 ) and one autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT);

        4. Sixty days (D +60) after ASCT: RANDOMIZATION in two arms of maintenance: Arm A (oral
           dexamethasone alone 40 mg/d for 4 days every 28 days) and Arm B (dexamethasone plus
           thalidomide 200 mg daily by mouth) for 12 months or until disease progression.
