      directional deep brain (dDBS) stimulation undergoing subthalamic deep brain stimulation
      operation (STN-DBS) under general anesthesia versus local anesthesia.

      In awake group, 10 patients with Parkinson's disease were treated with St Jude Medical/Abbott
      Infinity DBS system, and the electrode implantation and testing were performed while the
      patients were awake. In asleep group, 14 patients with Parkinson's disease were treated with
      St Jude Medical/Abbott Infinity DBS system, and the electrode implantation were performed
      while the patients were under general anesthesia. The clinical outcome of the DBS treatment,
      possible adverse effects and the electrode placement will be compared within these two
      groups.
