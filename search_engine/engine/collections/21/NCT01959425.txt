    
      Patients undergoing successful cardiac ablation for atrial fibrillation who remain AF
      recurrence-free 3 months after successful ablation and continue to meet the
      inclusion/exclusion criteria will be screened for enrollment in the trial. After fulfilling
      all of the inclusion/exclusion criteria, patients who consent to participate in the study and
      remain AF recurrence-free will be randomized to one of two study arms: (1) OAT Withdrawal
      (Test) Group or (2) OAT (Control) Group and participate in the Evaluation Period (12 months).
