    
      This trial has been designed as an open label, single center combination phase I trial. The
      primary objective is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for chloroquine (CQ) in
      combination with concurrent radiotherapy with daily temozolomide in patients with a newly
      diagnosed GBM.

      Eligible patients will receive radiotherapy and chemotherapy according to standard protocol
      for newly diagnosed GBM. This consists of 33 daily fractions of 1.8 Gy to the tumor and
      surrounding margin in combination with TMZ 75 mg/m² per os daily (po qd) and six adjuvant
      cycles of TMZ 150 - 200 mg/m² po qd. Treatment will be combined with daily intake of
      escalating doses of chloroquine. Chloroquine will start with week before the start of
      radiotherapy and end on the last day of radiotherapy.

      The rate of subject entry and escalation to the next dose level will depend upon assessment
      of the safety profile of patients entered at the previous dose level. Toxicity will be
      evaluated according to the NCI common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE),
      Version 4.0.

      The 3 + 3 cohort method is used. A minimum of three patients will be entered at each dose
      level. All three will be followed during the concomitant radiotherapy and a 4 week
      observation period before escalation to the next dose level.

      The start dose is 200mg chloroquine daily. Before opening the next higher dose level all
      toxic effects at the preceding dose level will be reviewed and expansion or escalation will
      be undertaken as appropriate
