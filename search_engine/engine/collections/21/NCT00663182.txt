      leading to liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Previous studies demonstrated that
      patients with active viral replication, defined as the presence of detectable serum HBV-DNA
      or HBeAg, were at increased risk of developing progressive liver disease or death.The
      prognosis of decompensated cirrhosis resulting from chronic hepatitis B virus infection is
      poor. Anti-viral therapy in decompensated HBV-related cirrhosis has been recommended by the
      American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases. However, no high quality research on
      the effectiveness of anti-viral therapy in decompensated cirrhosis has been performed.

      Entecavir is a new nucleotide analogue, which has been proved effective in suppressing viral
      replication and decreasing the necroinflammatory response, was recommended as a first-line
      medication in AASLD guideline. Our purpose was to evaluate the effect of Entecavir for
      patients With decompensated HBV-Related cirrhosis. The main outcomes were liver function,
      HBV-DNA, disease progression, hepatocellular carcinoma, Child-Pugh score and the survival.
