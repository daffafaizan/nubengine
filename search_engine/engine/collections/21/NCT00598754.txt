      A. Aims The overall purpose of this study is to perform ground-based research, development,
      and validation aimed at optimizing diagnostic ultrasound in manned spaceflight, with the
      following unifying hypothesis: Serial 3D ultrasound examinations will enhance diagnostic
      capabilities in manned spaceflight.

      Specific Aims:

        1. To optimize acquisition methods for 3D sonography using reconstruction and real-time
           techniques

        2. To determine the utility of serial 3D ultrasound examinations in identifying renal
           calculi and their complications including the development and resolution of
           hydronephrosis and calyceal dilatation.

        3. To determine the utility of serial 2D and 3D ultrasound examinations in demonstrating
           cardiac remodeling (changes in cardiac dimensions, volume, mass and function) and
           defining its determinants after left ventricular unloading following aortic valve
           replacement for aortic stenosis or regurgitation.

        4. To determine whether changes in plasma BNP levels accurately reflect changes in LV mass
           and volume.

      Hypotheses:

        1. Serial 3D ultrasound examinations will allow accurate diagnosis of nephrolithiasis and
           tracking of complications including hydronephrosis and calyceal dilatation

        2. Serial 2D and 3D ultrasound will allow accurate tracking of changes in LV mass and
           volume following aortic valve replacement (AVR) for aortic stenosis or regurgitation.

        3. Changes in plasma BNP levels will fall in proportion to the decrease in LV mass and
           volume.
