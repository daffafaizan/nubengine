      I. To determine whether somatic tumor genome alterations identified in tumor tissue before or
      after the initiation of CYP-17 inhibition with abiraterone acetate therapy are associated
      with a 12-week composite progression free survival (PFS) endpoint.

      II. To use tumor tissue obtained prior to the initiation of therapy and from the 12 week
      biopsy to develop tumor xenografts for mechanistic and functional studies which will
      determine whether mutations identified in the tumor genome are associated with response to
      drugs that target the observed mutated genes and/or associated pathways.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether somatic tumor genome alterations identified before or after
      initiating CYP-17 inhibition with abiraterone acetate therapy are associated with overall
      survival.

      II. To determine whether somatic tumor genome alterations identified in tumor tissue before
      or after the initiation of CYP-17 inhibition with abiraterone acetate therapy are associated
      with progression free survival (PFS).

      III. To evaluate circulatory markers in blood and urine specimens for response and/or
      resistance to treatment. (Exploratory and correlative objectives)

      OUTLINE:

      Tissue, blood, and urine samples are collected at baseline and after 12-14 weeks of treatment
      and assessed for circulating tumor cells, genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP),
      and exome sequencing.
