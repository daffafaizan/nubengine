      techniques such as percutaneous needle electrolysis (PNE) was being developed, obtaining
      promising results for tendon pathology. PNE technique is a minimally invasive treatment that
      consists of an application of a galvanic electrolytic current that causes a controlled local
      inflammatory process in the target tissue. This allows for phagocytosis and the subsequent
      regeneration of the affected tissue. Nowadays, PNE is being used in clinical practice to
      manage MTrP, but there are no studies supporting that they have an additional beneficial
      effect over DN.

      From a biological point of view, it seems reasonable to ascertain that a patient will obtain
      benefits thanks to the mechanical effects provided by the needle and that patients may
      benefit more if the electrolysis effect is added to the mechanical stimuli provided by the
      needle. Therefore, the aim of this randomized controlled study is to compare the
      effectiveness of DN versus PNE for the level of pain in patients suffering from PHP.
