    
      This study included an Initial and a Repeat Treatment period.

      The Initial Treatment period was a subject and evaluator-blinded, randomized split face study
      in which subjects received DGE in one nasolabial fold and Restylane in the other nasolabial
      fold. Both safety and efficacy were evaluated.

      In the Repeat Treatment Period, participants received DGE in both NLFs. Safety was evaluated.
