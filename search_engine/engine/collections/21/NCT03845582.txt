      by an age-related degeneration of the retina.

      The root cause for this degeneration or why some people develop AMD while others do not, is
      unknown. Over 20 years ago, it was hypothesized that the dimerization of vitamin A may be a
      significant contributor to the etiology of AMD. The eye indeed uses vitamin A as a cofactor
      to sense light, and a striking chemical signature of the aging and degenerating retina is the
      accumulation of vitamin A dimers in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and the underlying
      Bruch's membrane. In rodent models, high levels of vitamin A dimers correlate with poor
      retinal health, and a variety of mechanisms have been proposed by which vitamin A dimers may
      induce retinal toxicity. It has been argued that these mechanisms participate in the
      development and progression of AMD.

      ALK-001, the study drug, is a modified form of vitamin A. When taken once a day as a capsule,
      it replaces natural vitamin A in the body with one that forms vitamin A dimers more slowly.
      This study will measure the extent to which treatment with ALK-001 slows the progression of
      Geographic Atrophy.
