      will contact participants by phone, once a week, for about 5-10 minutes at a pre-arranged
      time. Participation will be needed for 10 weeks in total (6 weeks of active participation and
      a survey 1-month after the study intervention ends).

      Subscription-based self-help resources being tested during the study will not be freely
      available after the study period. However, the researchers will share information on how to
      access these resources for a fee after the study period to all participants.

      In addition to the time above, the researchers will collect information from participant's
      medical records for another 10 months after participation. The entire study is expected to
      last about 2 years.
