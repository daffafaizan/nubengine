      the primary treatment method. The beach chair (BCP) and lateral decubitus (LDP) positions are
      both considered as reliable techniques for performing effective arthroscopic shoulder
      surgeries. The usage of BCP for shoulder arthroscopic operations started from early 1980s.

      The advantages of BCP include lack of brachial plexus strain, good intra-articular
      visualization, with the ease of conversion to an open approach if required.

      The BCP combined with deliberate hypotension has been used to decrease intraoperative blood
      loss and allow a relatively blood-free surgical field. However, this combination has the risk
      to impair cerebral perfusion pressure and oxygenation during surgery and produce cerebral
      ischemia.

      Lidocaine, a commonly used local anesthetic and class IB antiarrhythmic drug, that readily
      crosses the blood - brain barrier. Evans et al. initially reported cerebral protection of
      lidocaine in a feline model of cerebral arterial gas embolism. Later on, the effects of
      lidocaine on perioperative neuroprotection were detected. However, the mechanisms underlying
      lidocaine treatment-induced neuroprotection remain incompletely understood.

      Lidocaine may provide cerebral protection through many mechanisms, including decreasing the
      cerebral metabolic rate, decelerating the ischemic transmembrane ion shift, and reducing the
      ischemic excitotoxin release.
