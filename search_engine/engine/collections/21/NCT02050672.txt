      cell signaling pathways and it is involved in the regulation of intracellular calcium.

      Literature data have demonstrated the MI play a crucial role in reproduction, indeed, oocyte
      and spematozoa are nursed in a medium congaing hig MI concentration.

      Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that, in oligoasthenoteratozoospermic patients, in
      vitro incubation with 2 mg/ml of myo increase significantly the number of spermatozoa with
      high mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). Moreover, it has been found that the in vitro
      fertilization rate is correlated with the percentage of high MMP spermatozoa.
