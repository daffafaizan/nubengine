    
      This is a prospective, multicenter, randomized open-label trial including patients with
      severe AS and small aortic annulus (mean aortic annuli diameter Ë‚22mm, evaluated by 3D-CT or
      3D-TEE). Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to either TAVR or SAVR. The TAVR
      procedure will be performed with the Edwards SAPIEN 3 valve (20 or 23mm) or the CoreValve
      Evolut R or Evolut PRO valve system (23 or 26 mm).New iterations of these valve models may
      also be included. The SAVR procedure will be performed using standard techniques, with no
      limitation in terms of type and size of the valve prosthesis or surgical procedure (e.g.
      enlargement of the aortic root). For both TAVR and SAVR, the choice of the type and size of
      valve, access route (for TAVR), utilization of additional procedures such as root enlargement
      will be left at the discretion of heart team of the site treating the patient.
