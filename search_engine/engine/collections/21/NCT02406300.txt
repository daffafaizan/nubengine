      departments. Mortality is high among these patients and is reported to range from 10% at 30
      days, up to 32% at one-year post-operative.

      Several strategies to reduce mortality have been used, but mortality rate has plateaued since
      1998. Attempts to show benefit from regional or general anesthesia have shown inconsistent
      results. New techniques with peripheral nerve blocks have been used, but their effect on
      mortality when used as major anesthesia component have not been studied.

      The investigators hypothesise that smaller physiologic impact of peripheral nerve blocks
      associated to light general anesthesia may improve survival rates and reduce short term
      delirium after proximal femur fracture surgery. Recovery of quality of life will also be
      assessed.

      Patients will be randomized into two groups, being allocated for a subarachnoid anesthesia or
      a combination of peripheral nerve blocks and light general anesthesia.

      Patients will be followed up for short-term post-operative complications such as incidence of
      delirium, recovery of quality of life and survival up to one year.
