      is not known. The effectiveness of PEN may be improved if treatment is begun when the
      parasite burden (the number of organisms in the lung) is still small, and before respiratory
      symptoms appear. If PFT of HIV-infected patients is able to identify patients in the early
      stages of infection, outpatient treatment of these patients offers a possible alternative to
      the expense and toxicity of continuous preventive therapy of all high-risk patients.

      Patients are treated with aerosolized PEN on an outpatient basis. The aerosol therapy is
      given by a respiratory therapist 5 times a week, for a total of 21 days of treatment. In
      addition, patients participate in two radioactive aerosol studies in which the patient
      inhales a radioactive gas while sitting with his/her back against a gamma camera. The
      resulting picture outlines the lungs. Then the gas is exhaled and the patient breathes an
      aerosol of PEN. This mist contains a single dose of PEN mixed with a small amount of
      radioactivity (99mTc-pertechnetate). The gamma camera determines where the particles deposit
      in the lungs. The radioactive exposure is equivalent to a typical x-ray of the ribs. Patients
      also undergo diagnostic bronchoscopy with lavage, and PFT. Blood is drawn to measure the
      blood level of PEN. Patients are followed (clinical exams and PFT's) for 6 months after the
      end of therapy. Prophylaxis for PCP is allowed during the 6-month follow-up.
