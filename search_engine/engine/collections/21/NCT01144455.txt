      cancer. The presence of hypoxia in solid tumors is associated with a more malignant phenotype
      and resistance to chemotherapy. The hypoxia-activated prodrug, TH-302, is designed to
      selectively physiologically target the hypoxic microenvironment. There is an absence of
      therapeutic options for subjects with metastatic pancreatic cancer. Gemcitabine provides
      clinical benefit as a single agent, but median survival is about 6 months. Combining
      gemcitabine with TH-302 may enable the targeting of both the normoxic and hypoxic regions of
      pancreatic cancer.
