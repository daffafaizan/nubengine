      into three different groups to receive one of the following anesthetic agents; Sevoflurane,
      Propofol or Dexmedetomidine.

      The primary outcome of this pilot study is to evaluate and compare the incidence of adverse
      events in mitochondrial patients undergoing a diagnostic or therapeutic procedure up to 48
      hours post anesthesia. The secondary outcome is to compare the metabolic derangements between
      three study groups by comparing changes in blood sugar, serum pH, serum bicarbonate, serum
      lactate and serum pyruvate levels before, during and after anesthesia in the groups.
