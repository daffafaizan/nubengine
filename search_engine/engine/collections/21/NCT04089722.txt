      submental area have been extensively evaluated. Deoxycholic acid injections have also been
      used successfully off-label to dissolve adipose tissues in other body areas. Our clinical
      experience in addition to a few case reports have shown the effectiveness and safety of
      deoxycholic acid injections to dissolve the adipose tissue in the anterior and posterior
      aspect of the axilla or the so called "brassiere strap fat" (BSF).

      This is a single-center, prospective, single-arm, single-blind trial study.

      This study is expected to benefit the existing literature by potentially adding a new
      non-invasive injectable treatment to a condition of excessive adipose tissue in the anterior
      and posterior aspect of the axilla that until now could only be treated with invasive
      surgery.
