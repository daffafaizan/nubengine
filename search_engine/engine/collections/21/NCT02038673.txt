      novel small-molecule FGFR 1,2,3 and 4 inhibitor, multiple dosing once-a-day (q.d.), multiple
      dosing twice-a-day (b.i.d.) or 5-day on/2-day off dosing twice-a-day (5on-2off)) is
      administered to participants with solid tumors in an increasing dose manner, and the
      tolerability, safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) and efficacy of ASP5878
      are evaluated in these participants. Cycle 0 consists of 3 days and Cycle 1 and subsequent
      cycles consist of 28 days each in the dose-escalation part. In the expansion part, 16mg
      twice-a-day 5-day on/2-day off dose of ASP5878 (5on-2off) is administered to participants
      with solid tumors and safety, PK, PD and efficacy of ASP5878 are evaluated. The expansion
      part starts from Cycle 1 and each cycle consists of 28 days.
