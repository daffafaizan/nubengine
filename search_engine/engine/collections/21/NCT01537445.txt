      outcome for these patients. The beneficial effect of pancreas transplantation for renal
      function is not clear. It is of major importance to early find patients who develops a
      decrease in renal function and start treatment early and closely monitor these patients in
      order to avoid further deteriorating renal function. In order to achieve this, there is a
      need for a easy, fast and sensitive method to evaluate renal function. In this study the
      investigators plan to use the non-invasive MR to evaluate changes in renal function.
