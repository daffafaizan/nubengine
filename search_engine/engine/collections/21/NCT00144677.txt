    
      -  Therapy to prevent GVHD will consist of an infusion of tacrolimus intravenously and
           sirolimus orally once daily starting 3 days before stem cell infusion. This will take
           place in the hospital where the patient will remain for the duration of the transplant.

        -  Sirolimus will continue for approximately 100 days at a stable dose, then it will be
           tapered slowly over the course of weeks to months to prevent a flare in GVHD.

        -  Patients will be seen in the clinic weekly for the first 2 months after discharge from
           the hospital. If GVHD is present, tapering schedule will be slower and based on the
           patient's clinical condition.

        -  Tacrolimus will also be given orally after the patient is discharged and will be tapered
           on the same schedule as sirolimus.

        -  During the year following stem cell transplant, blood tests will be performed to
           evaluate the immune system and graft versus host disease.
