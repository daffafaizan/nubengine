      similar protocols based on the BFM treatment strategy, which include induction,
      consolidation, reinduction and continuation-therapy phases. At the beginning of the
      continuation-therapy phase, those patients in complete remission are randomly assigned to
      either a treatment or a control group. Control patients are given conventional mercaptopurine
      and methotrexate chemotherapy only. Patients in the treatment arm are also given pulses of
      vincristine (1.5 mg/sqm weekly for 2 weeks) and dexamethasone (6 mg/sqm daily for 7 days)
      every 10 weeks for six cycles.
