    
      The primary endpoint is to evaluate the effectiveness of the Idys™ TLIF (Transforaminal
      Lumbar Interbody Fusion) 3DTi (Porous Titanium additive manufacturing) by measuring the
      evolution of the rate of fusion during the postoperative period.

      The secondary endpoints are to analyze the safety and the patient's benefit of the Idys™ TLIF
      3DTi by evaluating several point of view:

        -  The adverse events related to the surgery;

        -  The functional improvement between preoperative state and the different follow-up time
           points using the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI);

        -  The improvement of back pain between preoperative state and the different follow-up time
           points using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) (legs and back);

        -  The evolution of several radiologic lumbar parameters to assess the correction and its
           stability.
