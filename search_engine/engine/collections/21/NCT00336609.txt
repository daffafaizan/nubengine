      and health and economic burdens of mucosal toxicities associated with anti-cancer drug and
      radiation therapy. This study will examine the burden of illness of gastrointestinal
      mucositis (defined as mucositis involving the mouth, esophagus, or small intestine) in the
      most significant regimens used to treat the most common types of cancers. It is an
      international investigation in which 1600 patients being treated with specific regimens for
      cancers of the head and neck, breast, colon, lung (NSCLC)and Non-Hogkin's Lymphoma will be
      prospectively enrolled from centers throughout the US, Canada, Europe and Australia.
