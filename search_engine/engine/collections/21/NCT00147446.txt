      United States. More than two decades of research has consistently shown a relationship
      between stressful life events (SLEs), in particular non-traumatic family and work stressors,
      and subsequent clinical exacerbation. Furthermore, we have shown that non-traumatic SLEs
      increase the risk of the subsequent appearance of new gadolinium enhancing (Gd+) magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) brain lesions, an early marker of MS inflammation and blood-brain
      barrier (BBB) breakdown. The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of cognitive
      behavioral stress management for MS (CBSM-MS) in reducing the occurrence of new brain lesions
      in people with relapsing forms of MS. Patients must have a documented new Gd+ MRI brain
      lesion or clinical exacerbation within the previous 12 months to be enrolled. One hundred and
      twelve patients will be enrolled for 12 months. Patients will be randomly assigned to either
      an intensive CBSM-MS program, consisting of 16 individual meetings with a behavioral medicine
      specialist, or a condensed CBSM-MS program, consisting of a one-day workshop offered after
      the 10th month of participation. Outcomes include MRI, clinical neurological end-points, and
      psychosocial functioning. We will also enhance our understanding of mechanisms by examining
      potential psychosocial, immune, and endocrine mediators of the relationship between SLEs and
      clinical and neuroimaging markers of MS inflammation.
