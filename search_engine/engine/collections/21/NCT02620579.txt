      genotype for high pain sensitivity and pain catastrophizing questionnaire score will be
      eligible for randomization into intervention groups (stratified by sex). Exercise induced
      shoulder injury will serve as the pain generating mechanism on Day 1 and participants will
      receive pharmaceutical and education interventions over Days 1-4, and Days 2-4 respectively.
      Statistical analysis will determine whether the combined personalized intervention group
      experienced shorter shoulder pain duration, lower peak pain intensity, or decreased
      upper-extremity disability and determine which molecular, psychological, and pain sensitivity
      regulation mechanisms are associated with pain relief. A preliminary analysis is planned
      after the first 300 subjects are equally randomized to the 4 intervention groups. The
      comparison of interest for the preliminary analysis is the combined personalized intervention
      group with the placebo and general education group for the primary outcome. Depending on the
      results of this preliminary analysis the randomization pattern may change, with details of
      these changes available in the protocol paper.
