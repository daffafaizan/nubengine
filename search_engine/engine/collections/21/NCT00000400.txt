    
      This is a randomized, prospective, open-label study in which osteoporotic postmenopausal
      women self-administer synthetic hPTH-(1-34), alendronate, or both, every day for 2.5 years.
      Participants initially come to Massachusetts General Hospital once a month, and subsequently
      once every 3-6 months, for measurements of serum and urine indices of bone formation and
      resorption, serum and urine toxicity tests, and DXA/QCT measurements of bone mass. One-third
      of the participants take hPTH-(1-34) daily, one-third take alendronate once daily, and
      one-third take both daily (Phase A, months 0-30).

      Participants who complete Phase A are eligible for a 12 month extension study (Phase B,
      months 30-42), during which any alendronate treatment is continued without change and any
      hPTH 1-34 treatment is stopped.

      Participants who complete Phase B are eligible for a second 12 month extension study (Phase
      C, months 42-54), during which any alendronate treatment is continued without change and
      every participant takes hPTH 1-34.

      During Phases B and C, these participants come to Massachusetts General Hospital once every 6
      months for measurements of serum and urine indices of bone formation and resorption, serum
      and urine toxicity tests, and DXA/QCT measurements of bone mass.
