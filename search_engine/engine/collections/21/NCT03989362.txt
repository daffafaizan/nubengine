      Inducible CO-Stimulator of T cells (ICOS) to generate an anti-tumor immune response. This is
      a Phase 2, open label study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of vopratelimab in
      combination with ipilimumab in adult subjects with advanced and/or refractory non-small cell
      lung cancer and urothelial cancer.
