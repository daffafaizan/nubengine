        -  Determine the response rates (confirmed complete and partial responses) in patients with
           unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic gallbladder cancer or cholangiocarcinoma
           treated with gemcitabine and capecitabine.

        -  Determine the overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the quantitative and qualitative toxic effects of this regimen in these
           patients.

        -  Determine the feasibility of accruing patients with these disease sites.

        -  Evaluate, preliminarily, relevant prognostic markers in these disease sites and the
           prognostic implications as predictors of survival in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral capecitabine twice daily on days 1-14 and gemcitabine IV over 100
      minutes on days 1 and 8. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months until disease progression and then every 6 months for up
      to 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study within
      approximately 10-20 months.
