    
      In this randomized, open-label, controlled trial, HIV-infected patients who are failing
      3TC/FTC-containing highly active antiretroviral therapy, (HAART), will be offered individual
      treatment selection based on best clinical judgment and genotypic HIV-RNA resistance
      analysis. Patients who meet entry criteria will first be randomized to either continue or
      discontinue 3TC/FTC while they remain on their current therapy. HIV-1 viral load will be
      measured 4 times over a period of 14 days to determine the virologic response to this change.
      At day 14, each patient's regimen will be optimized to a new combination based on a genotype
      test taken at study entry. Patients will then start on the new salvage regimen, including or
      not including 3TC/FTC based on their initial randomization. Additional HIV-1 viral load
      measurements will be obtained to determine the virologic response to the new salvage regimen
      over 24 weeks.
