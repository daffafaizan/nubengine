      neurocritical care is limited and no definite conclusion can be drawn. There is a need for
      The use of dexmedetomidine might be a useful adjunct in clinical situations when the increase
      in CBF could be detrimental such as vasogenic cerebral edema (i.e., TBI, large brain tumors).
      However, dexmedetomidine sedation is questionable in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage
      and acute stroke, since the associate drop in arterial pressure could worsen the coexisting
      increase in circulating catecholamines and massive sympathetic outflow. Further high-quality
      RCTs to evaluate the use of dexmedetomidine as a sedative agent both in general ICU patients
      and in patients with TBI.

      Transcranial Doppler (TCD) is a simple noninvasive bedside tool to assess the cerebral blood
      flow pattern. The new development of transcranial color Doppler with angle correction option
      helps to improve the sensitivity of test results. TCD can assess the evolution of CBF
      alterations and possibly cerebral autoregulation performance and ICP estimation in patients
      presenting with cerebral pathology.
