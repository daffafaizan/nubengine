      of human milk fat and enabling optimal intake of the essential calcium and energy (in the
      form of fatty acids) and easy digestion. These benefits are the results of a unique fatty
      acid composition on the glycerol backbone, which ensure high level of palmitic acid at the
      middle (sn-2) position.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of high sn-2 palmitic acid based infant
      formula on bone strength parameters, anthropometric parameters, wellbeing and stool
      characteristics in term and preterm infants.
