    
      The study is a multicentric, randomized, controlled trial to compare effects of standard
      versus intensive motor rehabilitation treatment for people with ALS.

      Eligible patients are going to be randomly assigned to the Standard or Intensive treatment
      (controlling for ALSFRSR rates at enrollment, age and site of onset). Randomization ratio is
      1:1.

      Standard treatment: 2 sessions/week of motor rehabilitation treatment (45 minutes each one)
      for 10 weeks for a total of 20 sessions. The program consists of exercises for aerobic
      endurance, reinforcement at low load and stretching. At the end of the 20 sessions patient
      and caregiver are going to continue activity with supervision through regular follow up.

      Intensive treatment is characterized by an increased volume of the above mentioned exercises:
      5 sessions/week (45 minutes each one) for 10 weeks for a total of 50 sessions. At the end of
      the 50 sessions patient and caregiver are going to continue activity with supervision through
      regular follow up.

      Collection and analysis of data

      Recruitment: during the first 18 months of the study. Outcome measures: evaluated at
      T0-T3-T6-T9-T12-T15-T18-T21-T24. Rating scales will be administered by a neurologist in singe
      blind method with respect to the treatment.

      Data collection will be done through an ad hoc Case Report Form and entered into a database
      on a dedicated website.
