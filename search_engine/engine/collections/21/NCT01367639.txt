      life, psychological and physical status in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers.

      Secondary-goal: To Assess feasibility of IBSR intervention by examining attendance, drop-out
      rates, and program satisfaction.

      Hypothesis Participants' ability to deal with emotional difficulties will be improved
      following participation in the IBSR intervention. This will be reflected in improving the
      values of psychological measures, such as quality of sleep, cancer related worry, family
      support, depression and anxiety, after the intervention (among participants in the
      intervention group, but not in the control group).

      Study population: Eligible individuals are women who are carriers of one of the predominant
      Jewish mutations in BRCA1/2 genes at the Meirav Center, Sheba Medical center over the past 10
      years. All eligible women will be contacted by the staff of the Meirav Center and will be
      offered participation during routine follow up visits at the high risk clinic, by phone or a
      letter. Interested individuals will be scheduled to attend a meeting at a time of their
      convenience with the PI or the Co PIs to explain the study aims and goals. After the
      participant has agreed and signed the informed consent she is considered eligible.
