        -  Determine whether local sustained delivery of cytokines (interleukin-2, interleukin-12,
           or sargramostim [GM-CSF]) in biodegradable microspheres augments antitumor response in
           human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) obtained from patients with squamous cell
           carcinoma of the head and neck, as evaluated in a human/SCID chimeric mouse model.

        -  Assess the potential of cytokine-loaded microspheres combined with dendritic cells
           (pulsed with tumor peptide) obtained from these patients to enhance long-term immunity
           against the tumor, as evaluated in a human/SCID chimeric mouse model.

        -  Evaluate the antitumor effect of the more effective approach (objective I or II) against
           established tumors in the mouse model.

      OUTLINE: Biopsies of tumor are obtained during surgical resection. Patients undergo
      phlebotomy or leukapheresis to obtain peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs). PBLs, tumor
      tissue, and cytokine-loaded microspheres are coengrafted into SCID mice. Tumor growth and
      immune response are determined.

      Dendritic cells are obtained from PBLs, expanded in culture, and pulsed with either
      autologous tumor cell lysates or peptide eluted from the tumor cells. The dendritic cells are
      coengrafted with tumor cells, PBLs, and cytokine-loaded microspheres into SCID mice. The mice
      are then challenged with autologous tumor cells, and antitumor response is determined.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study.
