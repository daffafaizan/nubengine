      significant. The current technique for performing a tonsillectomy is "cold steel
      tonsillectomy" with electocautery hemostasis and a newer technique of coblation
      tonsillectomy. Postoperative pain has been shown to be increased in patients undergoing
      extensive electrocautery, with less pain seen in patients undergoing coblation tonsillectomy.
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the clinical efficacy and complications of Floseal
      matrix hemostatic sealant for use in patients undergoing adenotonsillectomy compared with two
      other currently used techniques.

      The study is a prospective, controlled clinical trial comparing Floseal hemostasis in "cold
      steel" knife dissection tonsillectomy with cautery hemostasis in "cold steel" knife
      dissection tonsillectomy and coblation tonsillectomy in a pediatric population. All children
      under the age of 18 without previous documented coagulopathy scheduled to undergo
      tonsillectomy will be offered enrollment in the study. Informed consent will be obtained from
      the patient's legal guardian. The goal of this study is to determine if Floseal reduces
      intraoperative blood loss, time to hemostasis, and postoperative morbidity in patients
      undergoing tonsillectomy compared with two other commonly used methods. Also, we wish to
      evaluate the complication rates following Floseal administration compared to those of
      electrocautery and coblation.
