      disorder (PTSD). Identifying the pathophysiological mechanisms of disrupted sleep in PTSD has
      therefore assumed considerable clinical importance. We previously reported an increase in
      rapid eye movement activity (REM activity) during REM sleep (REMS) in Vietnam War combat
      veterans with PTSD, and this finding can be seen as consistent with the view that most,
      although not all, dreaming occurs during REMS and the repeated observation that REM activity
      correlates with the intensity of dream mentation. There is a growing body of evidence that
      post-traumatic nightmares can respond to psychological treatment interventions. Namely, a
      cognitive-behavioral technique entitled imagery rehearsal (IR) has been reported to be
      effective in the treatment of such nightmares in victims of crime and in women who have been
      sexually assaulted. In a small pilot study, it has also been reported to be effective in the
      treatment of Vietnam veterans with combat-related PTSD. The two objectives of this proposal
      are: 1. To compare, in a study with random assignment and a parallel group design, the
      effectiveness in controlling the subjective sleep disturbance in veterans with PTSD of IR and
      Sleep and Nightmare Management (SN), a psychological treatment that targets life stressors
      and problems with sleep hygiene that may exacerbate insomnia and nightmares. 2. In a subset
      of these subjects, to compare the effectiveness in reducing REM activity of IR and SN.
