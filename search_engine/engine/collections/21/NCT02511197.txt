      cell-extracellular matrix adhesion. The αvβ3-integrin plays a pivotal role in promoting and
      sustaining angiogenesis and fibrosis. Cyclic arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) peptide is
      the key integrin recognition motif that can strongly bind to the αvβ3-integrin, which makes
      the RGD-based peptides hold a promise for imaging and treatment of diseases characterised
      with angiogenesis and fibrosis including LI and PF.

      Animal study in bleomycin induced lung fibrosis showed good uptake ratio of 68Ga-NOTA-PRGD2
      in lung vs background. For interests in clinical translation of 68Ga-NOTA-PRGD2, an
      open-label dynamic whole-body PET/CT study was designed to investigate safety and diagnostic
      performance of 68Ga-NOTA-PRGD2 in patients with LI or PF.
