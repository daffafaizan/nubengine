    
      This survey was designed to investigate the treatment status of hypertensive patients with
      metabolic syndrome-related risk factors treated with candesartan cilexetil tablets (Blopress
      Tablets), as well as to assess relationships between risk factors (example, visceral fat
      accumulation) and the incidence of cerebrovascular/cardiovascular events in an exploratory
      manner.

      For adults, 4-8 mg of candesartan cilexetil is typically administered orally once daily. The
      dose is increased up to 12 mg, as necessary. For patients with complications of renal damage,
      however, administration of candesartan cilexetil should be started at 2 mg once daily, and,
      as necessary, the dose increased up to 8 mg.
