      To assess the effect of zinc supplementation in the natural history of HIV, emphasizing on
      the immunological recovery of patients in a health care provider program in Medellín in 2012.

      METHODS:

      A prospective, randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial will be conducted. The
      selected group will consist of male and female patients over 18 years of age, who comply with
      the inclusion criteria, with digital clinical history, in an HIV/AIDS program of a health
      care provider in Medellín. They will receive zinc supplements for 3 months. A comparison will
      be made between the immunological recovery among those patients taking the zinc supplement
      and those who are not. The CD4 lymphocytes value will be taken as an independent variable.
