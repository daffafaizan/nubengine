    
      Patients applied imiquimod (250 mg) topically to a designated area of healthy skin on the
      upper inner arm or inner thigh (the cream remained on the skin overnight for 6-10 hours)
      every day for 5 consecutive days (i.e., for the first 5 days of Cycles 1-3 and for the first
      4 days of Cycle 4). The NY-ESO-1 protein (100 Î¼g) was injected intradermally into the
      imiquimod-pretreated area on Day 3 of each cycle for 4 consecutive 21-day cycles.

      Safety was monitored continuously. Immunization was assessed by the generation of
      NY-ESO-1-specific cluster of differentiation (CD)4+ and CD8+ T cell responses in
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISPOT) assays and by the development or augmentation of
      NY-ESO-1-specific antibody titers, assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).

      Blood samples were obtained for the assessment of clinical biochemistry and hematology, and
      physical examinations were performed at baseline, on Day 1 of each cycle, and at a follow-up
      visit at Week 13.

      Skin biopsies of the vaccinated area were obtained 48 hours after the last injection (Day 5
      of Cycle 4). To avoid irritation, imiquimod was not applied after the biopsies.
