      initiation.Based on current data available, the mortality rate for ventilated patients is
      assumed to be 80% in the current design. An interim futility analysis will be conducted after
      16 evaluable patients have received the ultralow dose-whole lung radiation therapy
      (ULD-WLRT). If at least 3 patients survive for at least 30 days, we will enroll additional 8
      patients (total of 24 patients). Otherwise, the trial will stop for further evaluation. Due
      to the limited data currently available in local institutions about a 30 day mortality rate ,
      we will retrospectively evaluate the mortality rate of the ventilated patients without the
      ULD-WLRT in our institution when data is available.

      Time to event secondary objectives (e.g. overall survival, time to discharge) analyses will
      be performed using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, with a competing risk model (leaving the
      study because of death), including effects for demographic/clinical characteristics in the
      model. Proportional endpoints (such as % patients off ventilator) will be calculated along
      with the 95% Clopper-Pearson exact confidence interval. Pre/post measurements will be
      evaluated using linear mixed models for repeated measures (with proper data transformation as
      needed). Association between demographic/clinical characteristics and other secondary
      objectives (size of ground glass opacities (GGO)/opacification, for example) will be
      accomplished with generalized linear models.
