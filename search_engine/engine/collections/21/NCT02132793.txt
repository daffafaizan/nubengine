      with a Veteran population using the RELAX application, collected weekly feedback from
      participants, and collaborate with the Sponsor to document initial efficacy, feasibility, and
      safety of the RELAX system. Outcome domains included: 1) clinical outcomes (symptom severity,
      social functioning); 2) process outcomes (perception of treatment, satisfaction, group
      therapy alliance, treatment compliance, and attrition and treatment credibility); and (3)
      Technical feasibility of the RELAX application. Study clinicians were 1) trained to conduct
      baseline and follow-up assessments 2) trained to conduct the standardized Anger Management
      Therapy (AMT) protocol at acceptable levels of adherence and competence and 3) trained how to
      use the technology and how to respond to technical difficulties. Study clinicians tested the
      feasibility of the RELAX application and showed that it can be integrated with CBT anger
      management therapies and support therapist communication through the technology.
