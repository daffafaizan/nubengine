      adults 18 years of age and older who were enrolled in the KPNC database during the risk
      intervals after vaccination analyzed for this study who were vaccinated with Flublok or an
      IIV (either IIV3 or IIV4) will be identified for analysis. The rates of occurrence of
      specific MAEs of interest in pre-specified risk intervals following Flublok and IIV will be
      compared.
