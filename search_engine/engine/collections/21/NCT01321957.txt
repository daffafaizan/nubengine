      as standard first-line treatment in metastatic colorectal cancer [Saltz et al., 2008].
      Current studies established the role of the FOLFOXIRI regimen [Souglakos et al., 2006,
      Falcone et al., 2007]. A further intensification of the therapy seems feasible yielding
      response rates up to 84% and a disease control rate up to 100% [Falcone, 2008, Santomaggio,
      2009, Masi, 2010]. This trial evaluates the activity of an intensified first-line therapy for
      metastatic colorectal cancer compared to standard treatment.
