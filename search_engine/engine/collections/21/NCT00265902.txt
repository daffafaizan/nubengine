      Primary

        -  Compare ultra-sensitive infrared thermographic images with visible light digital
           photographic images and clinical dermatologic examination as methods of measuring
           cutaneous lesions in patients with Kaposi's sarcoma (KS).

      Secondary

        -  Compare differences in modulation of temperature detected in KS skin lesions with
           non-involved skin of the same patient and with normal skin of healthy volunteers by
           sequential imaging using the infrared thermographic camera.

      OUTLINE: This is a controlled, pilot study.

      Patients undergo clinical assessment followed by simultaneous digital photographic camera
      imaging and high-resolution infrared thermographic camera imaging of designated normal skin
      areas and selected marker lesions. Before imaging, a metal bar chilled to 0ยบ C, 10ยบ C, and
      25ยบ C is applied to the lesions and designated normal skin areas for up to 90 seconds.

      Healthy volunteers (controls) undergo the same procedure as for the patient except only
      designated normal skin areas are used.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients and 10 healthy volunteers (controls) will be
      accrued for this study.
