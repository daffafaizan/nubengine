      eligibility criteria who have provided informed consent will be randomized 1:1 to
      convalescent plasma versus placebo. Transfusion of convalescent plasma or placebo will be
      administered by clinical or research personnel while the patient is hospitalized on Study Day
      1. On Study Days 1-7, participants will be monitored for adverse reactions to the
      transfusion. Research personnel will also assess patients at Day 14 and Day 28; these
      assessments will be completed by phone if the participant has been discharged from the
      hospital.
