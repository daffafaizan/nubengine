        1. There will be statistically significant correlations between blood levels of fatty
           acids/folate/beta-carotene and their corresponding levels of dietary intake as estimated
           by the DQPN.

        2. There will be statistically significant correlations between the DQPN and FFQ methods of
           dietary intake assessment. This includes individual dietary components as well as
           overall dietary quality and disease risk assessments.

        3. User experience surveys will demonstrate that the DQPN can be completed more quickly and
           more enjoyably than the FFQ.

      In addition, investigators will assess whether blood levels of fatty
      acids/folate/beta-carotene are similarly associated with the DQPN method and the FFQ method,
      and will measure the test-retest reliability of the DQPN method.
