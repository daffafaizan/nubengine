      cartilage, synovial inflammation and joint dysfunction. This study evaluates laboratory-based
      method to estimate the degrees of activity of medium and large joint OA. Samples of synovial
      fluid (SF) from the patients with the OA (ICD-10 codes: M15, M16 and M17) will be assessed
      for T-cell subsets, msast cells, fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) and macrophage-like
      synoviocytes (MLS) by flow cytometry. Subpopulations of blood T-cells involved in the
      inflammation will also be assayed. Standard clinical investigation will be performed and the
      results will be used to estimate the laboratory criteria or degrees of activity of medium and
      large joint OA.
