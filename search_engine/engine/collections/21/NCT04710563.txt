      (PAD). One of its extreme expressions is Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI). It is one of the most
      severe vascular conditions associated with devastating outcomes, including poorly healing
      wounds, extreme pain, and a high amputation risk. It is also one of the deadliest conditions,
      with 6-month and 5-year mortality rates estimated to be 20 and >50%, respectively. To date,
      however, there is a paucity of prospective clinical evidence about the variability in
      patients' presentations, their management or their outcomes. Accordingly, little progress has
      been made in adequately staging the disease and to risk-stratify treatment approaches to
      patients' individual characteristics. What is desperately needed to advance the care and
      management of patients with CLI is a focused research effort to set new standards for
      diagnosing, describing detailed patient-centered outcomes, and evaluating the variability in
      therapeutic approaches and their association with outcomes. The specific aims of SCOPE-CLI
      are to generate new evidence on the clinical characteristics, treatment patterns and outcomes
      of patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI); to describe treatment patterns and variability
      across practices to identify gaps in delivering quality care; and to perform a series of
      analyses to examine the associations of patient and treatment characteristics with outcomes.
      The central objective of SCOPE-CLI is to systematically quantify patients' CLI-specific
      health status and clinical outcomes and to perform subgroup analyses as a function of
      different PAD treatments and patient characteristics.
