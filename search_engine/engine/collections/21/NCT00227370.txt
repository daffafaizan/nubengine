    
      A multi-center two phase, double-blind, placebo controlled, randomized prospective study of
      130 lung transplant recipients. Patients will be screened and consented prior to transplant.
      All consented patients will receive IV ganciclovir within 24 hours of transplant for not more
      than 14 days. Patients will enroll in Phase I of the study is an open label safety and
      efficacy analysis of three months of oral valganciclovir in adult transplant recipients who
      are at risk for CMV. After completion of 3 months of open label therapy, patients that meet
      the criteria for Phase II of the study will be randomized to 9 months of blinded therapy
      (Placebo/Valgan). Phase II of the study is designed to assess the efficacy of short course
      sequential IV ganciclovir followed by oral valganciclovir as compared to the extended period
      of oral valganciclovir prophylaxis in the prevention of CMV disease in at risk lung
      transplant recipients
