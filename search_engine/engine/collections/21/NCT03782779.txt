      as well as the osteoarticular and muscular tissues. Therefore, the European and North
      American Respiratory Societies highlight in their recommendations the importance of
      prevention of respiratory diseases. They also insist on the need to maintain the integrity of
      the anatomical elements that participate in the thoraco-abdominal movements and on preventive
      treatments in those at risk before the symptoms appear.

      Objective. The main objective of this study is to apply a program of supervised breathing
      program in old people with no respiratory health issues and evaluate the effects on
      respiratory variables such as forced vital capacity (FVC) forced expiratory volume in one
      second (FEV1) Tiffeneau Index (FEV1/FVC) and oxygen satutarion (SO2).

      Material and Methods Sample: over 60 year old subjects, institutionalized and with no
      respiratory condition.

      Study design. Randomized clinical trial with 2 groups: Group 1. diaphragmatic breathing
      program and upper and lower limbs maintenance exercises ; Group 2. control group which only
      do upper and lower limbs maintenance exercises.

      Evaluations. Clinical interview with anthropometric data and health characteristics.

      There will be 2 evaluations: at the beginning of the study and at the end of the supervised
      program (at 8 weeks).

      In addition, it includes the following evaluation instruments:

        -  Mini-mental State Examination (MMSE)

        -  Spirometry: obtaining FVC, FEV1, FEV1/FVC.

        -  Pulse oxymetry: it measure the SaO2 and cardiac frequency.
