    
      Eosinophilia, defined by a blood eosinophil granulocytes rate greater than 500 / mm3, is
      frequently encountered in internal medicine.

      Its causes are varied: atopy, drug allergies, parasitic infections, autoimmune diseases and
      solid neoplasias. Over 200 etiologies have been reported, some difficult to diagnose and can
      be life-threatening

      Eosinophilia can be a diagnostic dilemma, as the etiologies are extensive and varied.

      The aim of this study is to assess the feasibility of a diagnostic approach based on a
      decision algorithm in a group of patients with eosinophilia.

      The contribution to the diagnosis of a hierarchical strategy for prescribing additional tests
      , based on clinical examination as well as some simple diagnostic tests, has never been
      evaluated

      We assume that a procedure with a hierarchy of additional tests would increase the frequency
      of diagnosed cases while decreasing the time to diagnosis.

      This procedure defined by an algorithm would even reduce the number of tests necessary to
      reach a diagnosis.

      All types of patients are tacked into account: those coming from the university hospital,
      referred by general practitioners or by other hospitals.

      In addition we address the internal medicine patients ,but also those of Hematology and
      Infectious Diseases. A comparison of these various groups would be relevant, since disorders
      that may be different.

      Once enrolled, the patient is drived by the investigator through the various steps and exams
      imposed by the algorithm.

      Indeed, during 5 months (Day1 5, 43, 71 , 85 , 99 ,113 and month 5), patient is asked to
      comply to the various exams and assessment imposed by the algorithm and that should lead to a
      diagnosis
