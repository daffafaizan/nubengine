      dose-dependence activity. Rabeprazole is rapidly eliminated by hepatic metabolism and renal
      clearance. In previous studies in healthy volunteers, interactions between sodium rabeprazole
      and drugs such as warfarin, theophyline, diazepam and phenytoin have not been found. The
      objective of the study is to evaluate the safety of rabeprazole as concomitant treatment and
      examine the clinical practice of the interaction with drugs whose absorption has a gastric pH
      dependence. This is an observational, multicenter, open and prospective study. It is expected
      to enroll 500 patients receiving rabeprazole and a concomitant drug (one or more). All data
      collected will be prospective and will include the following: demographic data, adherence and
      compliance with treatment, lifestyle (smoking and alcohol consumption) and dose of
      rabeprazole. Safety analysis will be based on adverse events. Observational Study: For
      patients with duodenal or gastric ulcer: rabeprazole 20mg per day, orally, for 4-6 weeks; For
      patients with erosive or ulcerate gastroesophagic reflux: rabeprazole orally 20mg/ per day,
      4-8 weeks; For patients with gastroesophagic reflux requiring prolonged treatment:
      rabeprazole orally 10 or 20 mg per day; For patients with H. Pylori: rabeprazole orally 20mg
      twice per day , Clarithromycin orally 500mg 2 times per day and Amoxicillin 1gram orally
      twice daily for 1 week.
