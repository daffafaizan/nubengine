      injections, but despite frequent blood glucose checks, are unable to control their glycemic
      variability or lower their A1C levels. The MiniMed Paradigm REAL-Time System transmits sensor
      glucose values to the insulin pump every 5 minutes, allowing users to view their current
      glucose values as well as glycemic excursions and trends over a 24-hour period. The System
      will also alert users of high and low glucose levels, allowing subjects and their clinicians
      to make carefully monitored modifications to therapy. Additionally, data can be uploaded from
      the monitor into a personal computer, allowing the subject and clinician to see a complete
      picture of trends over time.

      Subjects learning this technology would require a new approach to training if they were to
      master operation of an insulin pump, make effective use of the sensor technology and
      understand the complete picture provided by the software component. Subjects will be trained
      to first use the insulin pump, add the sensor and then utilize the software and the
      effectiveness of the training methods and timing will be measured using questionnaires
      designed to evaluate understanding of the device, Self Efficacy and User Acceptance. The
      group wearing the System will also be compared to subjects that continue on their current MDI
      therapy over a 15-week time period.
