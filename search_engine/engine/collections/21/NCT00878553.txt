      21-day Screening Period, 4 Treatment Periods each followed by washout periods, and a final
      Follow-up Visit. Patients will receive their randomly assigned study medication and spend 2
      nights in a sleep laboratory, subsequently returning home for a 4- to 7-day washout period
      between each treatment period. The fourth and final treatment period will include a third
      night at the site during which all patients will continue to receive the same study
      medication as on the first 2 nights of this treatment period. Blood will be drawn from all
      patients for pharmacokinetic analyses at specific time intervals. Patients will undergo final
      safety assessments 2 to 5 days after the last dose of study medication.
