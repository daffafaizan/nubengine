    
      Home care staff often have insufficient knowledge and skills of caring people with dementia
      at home. Many lack empathy for those with dementia. Training courses for home care staff
      often are not developed according to their educational background and workplace needs.

      This two-group cluster randomised controlled trial aims to evaluate a dementia care training
      with virtual reality and peer support program on dementia care knowledge, attitude, care
      competence, work stress, and empathy of home care staff.

      The dementia care training consists of dementia care e-books, dementia virtual reality
      activity and peer support program.

      The interventional group will receive a dementia care training using dementia care e-books,
      dementia virtual reality activity and peer support program.

      The control group will only receive dementia care e-books and peer support with no dementia
      virtual reality activity.

      Both groups will be assessed for their dementia care knowledge, attitudes, care competence,
      work stress and empathy at baseline, month 3, 4, and 6.
