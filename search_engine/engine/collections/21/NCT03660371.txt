      together in patients with diabetic retinopathy In the landmark study Protocol S, about 30% of
      PDR subjects had DME at baseline and 53% of subjects receiving panretinal photocoagulation
      (PRP) underwent treatment for DME during the 2-year study interval. Vitreous hemorrhaging is
      one of the most common indications for pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) in patients with PDR. PDR
      patients undergoing PPV for the treatment of vitreous hemorrhaging often have coexisting DME,
      although it is often difficult to identify preoperatively because of the media opacification
      from the vitreous hemorrhage. Following successful PPV and vitreous hemorrhage resolution,
      PDR patients may then require prolonged DME treatment with repetitive intravitreal injections
      and/or focal lasers.

      PPV with internal limiting membrane (ILM) peeling has been reported to reduce retinal edema
      and improve visual acuity in patients with DME. Although numerous studies report favorable
      outcomes in patients undergoing PPV with ILM peeling for the surgical indication of DME,
      there are presently not any studies evaluating ILM peeling in PDR patients undergoing PPV for
      the primary indication of vitreous hemorrhaging. Performing ILM peeling in conjunction with
      the usual techniques for addressing a vitreous hemorrhage (i.e. endolaser PRP, endodiathermy,
      etc.) during PPV may offer the benefits of better postoperative visual acuity and/or fewer
      postoperative treatments required to manage DME. In this randomized controlled trial, the
      authors evaluate the merits of ILM peeling in PDR patients undergoing PPV for the primary
      indication of vitreous hemorrhaging.
