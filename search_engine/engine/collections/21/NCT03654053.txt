      beneficial in liver diseases by reducing endothelial dysfunction, intrahepatic
      vasoconstriction, inflammation and fibrosis, and can reduce portal vein blood pressure.
      Clinically significant portal hypertension (hepatic vein wedge pressure greater than or equal
      to 10mmHg) is the most important predictor of decompensation and death in patients with
      cirrhosis.

      This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center Phase III interventional
      study seeks to demonstrate that statin therapy in patients with cirrhosis at high-risk for
      hepatic decompensation will reduce the incidence of hepatic decompensation, hepatocellular
      carcinoma or all-cause mortality.

      Patients with compensated cirrhosis at high-risk for hepatic decompensation will be
      stratified based on the presence or absence of varices and randomized to simvastatin 40mg/day
      for up to 24 months. Patients will be observed for the development of hepatic decompensation
      (variceal hemorrhage, ascites, encephalopathy), hepatocellular carcinoma, liver-related
      death, death from any cause, and/or complications of statin therapy. Additionally, the
      interaction of SLCO1B1 and KIF6 polymorphisms on safety and clinical efficacy of statin
      therapy and the impact of statin exposure on health-related quality of life in patients with
      compensated cirrhosis will be examined.
