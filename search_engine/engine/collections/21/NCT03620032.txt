    
      1. st cohort: Standard Arm with Radiotherapy, Nimotuzumab and vinorelbine Nimotuzumab 150
           mg /m2/d as iv short-term infusion for 30 min weekly in week 1-12 and Vinorelbine 20
           mg/m2/d weekly in week 1-12 as iv short-term infusion for 30 min (Induction phase).1st
           re-evaluation week 13 (day 85-91). In case of non-progressive disease: Nimotuzumab 150
           mg/m2/d iv short-term infusion for 30 min and Vinorelbine 25 mg/m2/d as iv short-term
           infusion for 30 min every two weeks in week 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24 (Consolidation phase
           I) 2nd re-evaluation week 25, thereafter in case of non-progressive disease.Nimotuzumab
           150 mg/m2/d iv short-term infusion for 30 min and Vinorelbine 25 mg/m2/d as iv
           short-term infusion for 30 min every two weeks , with re-evaluation at week 37 and any
           12 weeks until progression or maximum at week 108. Irradiation will be scheduled to
           begin in the 3rd week after starting the nimotuzumab and vinorelbine treatment. A total
           dose of 54 Gy will be delivered, in 1.8 Gy daily fractions 5 days a week, with a 6 MV
           linear accelerator. To plan radiotherapy, CT images will be acquired with a 2 mm slice
           thickness, with patients positioned ready for treatment, their heads immobilized with a
           custom-made thermoplastic mask. Each patient's CT images will be co-registered with
           T2-weighted, gadolinium enhanced T1-weighted, and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery
           MRI sequences to identify the gross target volume (GTV) precisely. A three-dimensional
           conformal radiotherapy technique with 5 or 6 coplanar or non-coplanar beams or an
           intensity modulated radiotherapy technique will be adopted.

           Re-irradiation at progression.In case of local progressive disease, after obtaining a
           new consent from parents/patient if the case, a full course of re-irradiation will be
           proposed with 19.8 Gy, fractionated over 11 days.

        2. -cohort: Experimental arm with Nimotuzumab + Vinorelbine and refracted radiotherapy
           doses. Nimotuzumab 150 mg/m2/d as iv short-term infusion for 30 min weekly in week 1-12
           and Vinorelbine weekly 20 mg/m2/d in week 1-12 as iv short-term infusion for 30 min
           (Induction phase, as for standard arm); 1st re-evaluation week 13. In case of
           non-progressive disease, any other week, Nimotuzumab 150 mg/m2 as iv short-term infusion
           for 30 min and Vinorelbine 25 mg/m2/d as iv short-term infusion for 30 min until
           progression or maximum at week 108;2nd re-evaluation week 25, thereafter in case of
           non-progressive disease re-irradiation one for a total of 19.8 Gy in 11 fractions at 1.8
           Gy/day from week 26 to week 28 together with vinorelbine/nimotuzumab continuation any
           other week;3rd re-evaluation week 37, thereafter in case of non-progressive disease
           vinorelbine/nimotuzumab continuation any other week;4th re-evaluation week 45,
           thereafter in case of non-progressive disease: re-irradiation two for a total of 19.8 Gy
           in 11 fractions at 1.8 Gy/day from week 46 to week 48 together with
           vinorelbine/nimotuzumab continuation any other week;Further re-evaluation will be done
           at week 61 and thereafter any 12 weeks as for standard arm continuing vinorelbine and
           nimotuzumab until progression or maximum at week 108 .Patients will continue with
           re-irradiation courses also in case of progressive disease, and will continue to be
           evaluated for OS.Irradiation will be scheduled to begin in the 3rd week after starting
           the nimotuzumab and vinorelbine treatment. For the first course, a total dose of 36 Gy
           will be delivered, in 1.8 Gy daily fractions 5 days a week, with a 6 MV linear
           accelerator. To plan radiotherapy, CT images will be acquired with a 2 mm slice
           thickness, with patients positioned ready for treatment, their heads immobilized with a
           custom-made thermoplastic mask. Each patient's CT images will be co-registered with
           T2-weighted, gadolinium enhanced T1-weighted, and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery
           MRI sequences to identify the gross target volume (GTV) precisely. A three-dimensional
           conformal radiotherapy technique with 5 or 6 coplanar or non-coplanar beams or an
           intensity modulated radiotherapy technique will be adopted.The second course will be
           planned after second evaluation. It will be scheduled from week 26 to week 28 and
           planning will follow same guidelines as first course. The course of re-irradiation will
           be proposed with 19.8 Gy, fractionated over 11 days.

      The third and last course will be planned after forth evaluation. It will be scheduled from
      week 46 to week 48 and planning will follow same guidelines as first and second course
      (radiation and first re-irradiation). The course of re-irradiation will be proposed with 19.8
      Gy, fractionated over 11 days.

      Re-irradiation at progression. n case of local progressive disease after the whole three
      radiotherapy courses, after obtaining a new consent form parents/patient if the case, a
      course of re-irradiation will be proposed with 9 Gy total dose, fractionated over 5 days.
