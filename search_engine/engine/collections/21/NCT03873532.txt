    
      This is a randomized, open-label, active-control, multi-center, phase IIb/III clinical study
      to evaluate the efficacy and safety of surufatinib vs. Capecitabine as a second-line therapy
      in patients with unresectable or metastatic biliary tract cancer (BTC). About 298 subjects
      are randomly assigned to two study treatment groups in the ratio of 1:1 by IWRS.

        -  Active group: 300 mg of surufatinib is given by oral administration once a day (QD)
           every 3 weeks;

        -  Control group: In each 3-week cycle, Capecitabine is given at 1250 mg/m2 by oral
           administration twice a day (BID) for 2 weeks, followed by 1 week rest period (equivalent
           to 2500 mg/m2 total daily dose).

      Patients are randomized with the following stratification factors:

        -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status (0 or 1);

        -  Years from the first diagnosis of BTC to the randomization date (â‰¤ 1 year or > 1 year);

        -  The primary site of the tumor (intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma or extrahepatic
           cholangiocarcinoma or gallbladder cancer).

      All patients will be treated based on the arm to which they have been randomized. Treatment
      on study will continue until disease progression, death, intolerable toxicity or other
      criteria for discontinuation from study treatment. The tumor assessments are performed with
      imaging every 6 weeks (+3 days) until progressive disease (RECIST v1.1) or death on the study
      treatment period, and the treatment and survival of the patients after progressive disease
      are recorded. Safety indicators include adverse events, laboratory tests, vital signs, and
      changes in electrocardiograms and echocardiograms.
