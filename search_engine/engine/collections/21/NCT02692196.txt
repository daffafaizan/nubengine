      neurofeedback training can enable individuals to gain volitional control over their
      fronto-limbic circuitry. Given that this circuitry has been abundantly implicated in
      emotional perception and regulation this could facilitate emotional control. Suitable
      participants underwent fronto-limbic connectivity feedback training and sham training in a
      cross over design. During both trainings participants are instructed to regulate the neural
      indices during feedback. We expect that receiving fronto-limbic feedback enhances emotion
      regulation during the training.
