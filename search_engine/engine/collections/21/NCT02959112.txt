      Mexico: the National Institute of Medical Sciences and Nutrition "Salvador Zubir√°n" (INCMNSZ)
      in Mexico City, and Bernardette Hospital in Jalisco. The study was approved by both
      institutional review boards. All patients provided written informed consent.

      All patients were given a dose of rectal indomethacin (100 mg) at the beginning of the ERCP.
      Depending on the experimental group, either 10 ml of sterile water or 10 ml of a 1:10,000
      epinephrine dilution (0.1 mg/ml) was sprayed on the ampulla through a biliary balloon or a
      sphincterotome, avoiding any direct contact with the papilla during irrigation at the end of
      the procedure.

      After the procedure, patients were monitored in the recovery room for 2 hours and then
      discharged. Symptoms of acute pancreatitis or any other complication were interrogated at
      baseline while in the recovery room, and then by telephone 24 hours and 7 days after the
      procedure. Serum levels of pancreatic enzymes were determined only if the patient developed
      abdominal pain after ERCP.
