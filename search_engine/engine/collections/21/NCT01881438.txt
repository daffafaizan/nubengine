      participants but do not intervene by, e.g, assigning the treatments) and retrospective (a
      study in which the exposures and outcomes occurred before the study began) study. It will use
      data from the Optuminsight and Truven Commercial Claims and Encounters databases, each of
      which will be evaluated separately using 3 designs: (1) Case-control (a design that compares
      the cases [study participants], ie, those with retinal detachment to controls, ie, a sample
      of similar people who did not have a retinal detachment) to assess whether their exposures to
      fluoroquinolones (FQs) differed. Two case-control studies are planned, one (replication) that
      mimics a previously reported study, the other (revised) that addresses more potential
      confounders than did that study , (2) Cohort (a design that follows the participants exposed
      to FQs and those not exposed to FQs to assess whether the two groups had different risks of
      developing retinal detachment), (3) Case-only (a design where the exposure history of
      individuals who had retinal detachment are examined to assess whether they were more likely
      to have had it when they were exposed to FQs than when they were not).
