    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To test whether the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) lifestyle intervention (versus [vs.]
      control) improves serum fasting glucose.

      II. To test whether the DPP lifestyle intervention (vs. control) improves serum biomarkers of
      glucose regulation (insulin, C-peptide, insulin-like growth factor-1 [IGF-1], IGF binding
      protein 3 [IGF-BP3] and adiponectin).

      III. To test whether the DPP lifestyle intervention decreases the levels of insulin receptor
      or insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) in prostate cancer (PCa) tissue epithelium
      on follow-up prostate biopsy.

      IV. To test whether PCa patients randomized to the DPP lifestyle intervention sustain the
      lifestyle changes for at least 6 months after the end of the intervention period.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate whether the DPP lifestyle intervention improves health-related quality of
      life.

      II. To evaluate whether the DPP lifestyle intervention effects on pathologic features of
      follow-up prostate biopsies.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients meet with a nutritionist 11 times during the first 6 months to receive the
      structured diet and exercise instruction. Participants complete exercise sessions supervised
      by an exercise specialist, and will wear a heart rate monitor periodically during the study.

      ARM II: Patients receive oral and written information based on general U.S. dietary and
      physical activity guidelines along with a 20-30 minute individual session with a dietitian
      and a goal of 30 minutes of physical activity 5 days a week.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 3, 6, and 12 months.
