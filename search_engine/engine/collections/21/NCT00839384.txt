      bradycardia pacing and diagnostics and atrial tachycardia detection and therapy.

      The study will be a prospective, non-randomized, multicenter clinical study, conducted.

      To allow for sufficient experience with the device, a maximum of 80 subjects may be implanted
      with the Advisa device. Data will be collected at baseline (enrollment), implant, 1-, 3- and
      6- months post implant and every 6 months thereafter or until study closure (whichever occurs
      first), unscheduled follow-up visits, System Modifications, Technical Observations, Study
      Deviations, Study Exit, upon notification of new or updated Adverse Events and in case of
      death.
