      evaporative heat loss, the most prominent form of heat loss in premature infants due to their
      increased body surface area and immature stratum corneum. By potentially increasing humidity
      around the infants and decreasing evaporative heat losses, plastic bags may improve incubator
      warming. This study will compare the incidence of hypothermia in infants placed in an
      incubator for at least one hour randomized to receive standard incubator protocol (control
      group) or standard incubator protocol plus a plastic bag covering their torsos and lower
      extremities (intervention group). The axillary temperature of each infant will be taken
      before placement into the incubator and one hour later when the bag will be removed. Blood
      pressure, blood sugar, seizures, weight gain, hyperthermia, death, observation for
      respiratory distress syndrome, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, pneumothorax, sepsis,
      intraventricular hemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia, necrotizing enterocolitis,
      intestinal perforation, pulmonary hemorrhage, incubator temperature, and humidity, and length
      of time in an incubator will be recorded throughout the hospitalization for all infants. With
      an estimated baseline hypothermia rate of 90% and a hypothesized 20% absolute risk reduction
      (22% relative risk reduction), a sample size of 118 will be used to have a power of 80% and a
      confidence interval of 95%.
