      15 HRD-negative patients will be recruited to receive AT or TP regimen as neoadjuvant
      therapy. If more than 5 patients in the HRD-positive group achieve pCR(pathological complete
      response) , the trial expands to stage 2, otherwise the trial terminates. In stage 2, another
      31 HRD- positive and 31 HRD-negative patients will be enrolled.
