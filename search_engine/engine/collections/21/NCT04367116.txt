    
      The Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Spinal Cord Stimulation on Progressive
      Supranuclear Palsy is an open-label, prospective, single-arm, unicentral and exploratory
      clinical trial.

      In the screening stage, patients clinically and radiologically diagnosed as progressive
      supranuclear palsy with prominent gait disturbance will be enrolled. Then comprehensive
      evaluations and spinal cord stimulation will be performed on patients eligible for
      stimulation. In the subsequent process of neuromodulation, changes of clinical presentations
      and cerebral metabolism of participants will be assessed. Any unsafe incidents in process
      will be recorded in detail.
