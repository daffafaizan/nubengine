      pembrolizumab designed to evaluate the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of demcizumab in
      combination with pembrolizumab in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors. This
      study consists of a screening period, a treatment period and a post-treatment follow up
      period in which patients will be followed for survival for approximately 12 months. Patients
      will be enrolled in two stages: a dose-escalation stage and an expansion phase.

      Approximately 42 patients will be enrolled in this study at approximately 10 study centers in
      the United States (U.S) and Europe.
