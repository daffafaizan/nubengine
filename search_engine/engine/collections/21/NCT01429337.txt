      nonhematological malignancies. However, disease complications and various co-medications made
      it difficult to perform a hepatic impairment study in the targeted patient population.

      Metabolism and elimination of midostaurin predominantly occurs in the liver. Patients with
      impaired hepatic function may have a higher risk to have a decreased elimination or
      metabolism of midostaurin which may lead to increased systemic exposure or toxicity, hence
      understanding the impact of an impaired hepatic function on midostaurin PK is important.

      Cumulative safety data from over 900 subjects exposed to midostaurin showed that the drug was
      well tolerated in patients and in healthy subjects, thus, it was appropriate and justifiable
      to study midostaurin in subjects with varying degrees of hepatic impairment.

      Due to the difficulty in enrolling subjects with severe hepatic impairment, an interim
      analysis was performed when all mild and moderate hepatic impaired subjects, and the
      respective control subjects, had completed the trial, in order to obtain interim results on
      the PK and safety of midostaurin in patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment. The
      protocol was amended in April 2018 to make the inclusion / exclusion criteria more fitting
      with enrolling the severe hepatic impairment group. The final study analysis was performed
      when all severe hepatic impaired subjects, and the matching controls, had completed the
      study.
