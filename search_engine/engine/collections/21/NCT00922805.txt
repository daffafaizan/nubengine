      portion of the intestine leading to poor nutrient absorption. Infants with short bowel
      syndrome suffer from diarrhea and poor growth. The care of these infants is limited by the
      lack of effective therapies. As the intestine tries to grow back some of its length, a
      process that can take many months, these infants become dependent on intravenous (IV)
      nutrition in order to survive. Liver disease and sepsis (a blood stream infection) are common
      complications of IV nutrition and are the two most common causes of death in this population.
      Therefore, clinicians have tried different ways to improve feeding and shorten the amount of
      time of IV nutrition, for example continuous feedings through the intestine, use of partly
      digested formulas and change in diet.

      Soluble fiber (guar gum) is an indigestible form of sugar that is mostly contained in fruits
      and vegetables. Soluble fiber can reduce the severity and duration of persistent (constant)
      diarrhea in children.

      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the many effects of fiber added in the diet
      of infants with SBS.
