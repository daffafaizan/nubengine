      goal of surgery is to alleviate symptoms and minimize the risk of symptomatic recurrences.
      The standard surgical technique includes burr-hole craniostomy, followed by intraoperative
      irrigation and placement of subdural closed-system drainage. The drainage is removed after 48
      hours, which can be described as fixed-time drainage strategy. According to literature, the
      recurrence rate is 5-33% with this strategy. In the investigators' retrospective study,
      postoperative hematoma volume (p=0.001, B=0.028, Exp(B)=1.028, 95% CI 1.011-1.046) was found
      to significantly increase the risk of recurrence. Based on these results, an exhaustive
      drainage strategy may minimize postoperative hematoma volume and achieve a low recurrence
      rate and good outcomes. This is a prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled trial
      designed to include 304 participants over the age of 18 years presenting with a symptomatic
      CSDH verified on cranial computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. After informed
      consent is obtained, participants are randomly allocated to an exhaustive drainage or
      fixed-time drainage group. The primary endpoint is recurrence indicating a reoperation within
      6 months. Secondary outcomes include modified Rankin Scale, Markwalder Grading Scale,
      European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions-5 Levels (EQ-5D-5L), rate of complications, rate of
      adverse events and effect on comorbidity.
