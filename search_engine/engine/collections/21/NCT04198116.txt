      design (varenicline + guanfacine vs. varenicline alone). Following titration to steady state
      levels, the investigators will evaluate sex differences in medication effects on
      stress-induced smoking behavior and smoking-related reinforcement in the laboratory, and on
      abstinence outcomes during a subsequent 12-week treatment period.
