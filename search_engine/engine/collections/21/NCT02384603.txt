      therapeutic exercises reduce the shortening of myofascial structures and recover the body
      flexibility. It is indicated for the treatment of chronic pain caused by osteo-myo-articular
      dysfunction. The pain behavior may be defined as the adoption of body postures and attitudes
      that a person communicates his/her pain. In this way, the global postural reeducation - a
      method of muscles chains stretching exercises - could be an important intervention. In
      addition, negative thoughts and dysfunctional beliefs are usual in situations of chronic
      pain, compromising the health recovery process. As part of a pain catastrophizing-related
      therapeutic approach, physiotherapist may help patients with chronic pain to develop
      positive, realistic and hope attitudes as based on the cognitive behavioral therapy model.
