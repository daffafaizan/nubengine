           shared tumour-associated antigens (TAAs). The BioNTech Group (henceforward the
           "company") has identified a set of target antigens commonly expressed in TNBC. The
           selected breast cancer-associated antigens have been shown by immunogenicity testing to
           constitute suitable targets for immunotherapy and form the basis for the development of
           a novel RNA-based immunotherapy approach.

        -  The IVAC® MUTANOME concept is based on the identification of tumour-specific mutations
           by next-generation sequencing (NGS) and on-demand RNA manufacturing for use in single
           patients to target multiple neo-antigens derived from mutated epitopes. The novel
           therapeutic concept is supported by a series of research projects and high level
           publications that have led to a broad acceptance that mutation-specific T cells bear
           enormous potential to confer anti-tumoural activity in cancer patients.

        -  The TNBC-MERIT study will introduce the novel therapeutic concept for the individualized
           treatment of breast cancer that is based on (i) treatment with a patient-specific
           liposome complexed RNA tailored to the antigen-expression profile of any given patient's
           tumour (WAREHOUSE immunotherapy - IVAC_W_bre1_uID) and (ii) on treatment with de novo
           synthesized RNAs targeting up to 20 individual tumour mutations (IVAC® MUTANOME
           immunotherapy - IVAC_M_uID) following optional treatment with WAREHOUSE. The scientific
           rationale for the combination of the two IVAC® approaches is based on the assumption
           that immunotherapies that (1) acknowledge tumour heterogeneity on a single-patient level
           and (2) target the whole range of antigens selectively expressed on tumours ("cancer
           antigenome"), including immunogenic shared and unique antigens, bear the highest
           potential to constitute an effective treatment of tumours.
