      in obese patients with Prader Willi syndrome refractory to conventional treatment. Patients
      will be implanted with hypothalamic DBS electrodes. Calorimetric and anthropometric measures,
      body mass index, side effects, neuropsychiatric evaluations will be carried out at 6 months
      for measuring primary and secondary outcome. Side effects will be monitored at 1, 3, 6 and 12
      months following surgery.
