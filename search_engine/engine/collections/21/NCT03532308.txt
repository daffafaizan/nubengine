      aim is to assess the efficacy of Fermented Soy vs. placebo in 72 adults with prostate cancer.
      This study has 1 primary aim and 3 (1a thru 1c) sub aims. Aim 1 is to assess the effect of
      Fermented Soy (QC) on PSA (prostate specific antigen) In parallel, in Aims 1a-1c will assess
      tumor-specific effects of QC:

      Aim 1a: Identifying the anti-tumor effects of QC. This will be done by culturing multiple
      human cancer cell lines with QC at a range of concentrations, followed by readouts at
      different time points, of tumor cell apoptosis, proliferation, and senescence.

      Aim 1b: Identify a hierarchy of tumors that are responsive to QC. From the data in aim one an
      attempt will be made to identify a hierarchy of anti-tumor effects.

      Aim 1c: Investigate the signaling pathways in tumor cells that are modified by QC. To do
      this, full genomic profiling will be conducted for breast and prostate tumor cell lines, and
      will be done in conjunction with analysis of the relevant signaling pathways, and will
      include P53 and P21 activation pathways.
