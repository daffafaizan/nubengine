    
      This study begins with a Preparatory Phase, wherein all eligible participants receive up to
      25 sessions of Exposure and Ritual Prevention (EX/RP) therapy. At the end of the Preparatory
      Phase, those who have achieved wellness (mild to minimal symptoms) enter the Study Phase.
      Those who do not achieve wellness will not continue in the study and are referred for
      treatment elsewhere. Those who enter the Study Phase are then assigned by chance to one of
      two groups. One group will continue on the SRI medication and the other group will
      discontinue the SRI gradually over 4-6 weeks as it is replaced with a placebo (sugar pill).
      Neither patients nor study staff will know which group a participant is in. Both groups will
      continue to receive monthly sessions of EX/RP. The study will examine who has the best
      response to treatment in this study, including taking blood samples for genetic testing to
      see whether there are genes that can predict who will or will not benefit from EX/RP.
