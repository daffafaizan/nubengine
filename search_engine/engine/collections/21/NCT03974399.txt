      tolerability, and potential effects of Bacopa on BDNF, MoCA and GDS. Potentially eligible
      subjects will be invited to screening (Visit 1) at the study site. Subjects will sign an
      informed consent followed by collection of medical history and history of current
      medications, have their height, weight, vital signs (blood pressure, pulse, and temperature)
      measured, complete study assessments (MoCA , BDS and LEC) Routine clinical laboratory tests
      (hematology and chemistry) will be performed. Blood samples will be taken for analysis of
      BDNF and genetics (APOE, BDNF).

      Subjects will be instructed to orally self-administer the provided supplement (Bacopa)
      preferably with food with no dietary restrictions once a day in the morning.

      Subjects will be contacted by phone at 1 week (+/- 3 days) to be reminded to go to two pills
      per day, 1 month (+/-1 week) to check on compliance or any AE's and 2 months (+/- 1 week) to
      report any Adverse events for review by the Principal Investigator.

      Subjects will return to the study site for Visit 2 at the end of 12 weeks (+/- 1 week). Study
      staff will question subjects about any changes in the subject's health since the first visit.
      They will be asked about their exercise activity and if there have been any changes to their
      LEC-5. Subjects will have their weight and vital signs measured. Routine clinical laboratory
      tests (hematology and chemistry) will be performed, and blood samples will be saved for
      analysis of Bacopa and other biomarkers
