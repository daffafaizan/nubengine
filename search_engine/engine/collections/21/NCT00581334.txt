      instruments, 2) "wristed instruments" with increased degrees of freedom, 3) enhanced 12X
      magnification, 4) 3-D depth perception, 5)tremor filtration, 6) enhanced surgeon comfort and
      ergonomics, and 7) a steeper learning curve. With robotic assistance, the surgeon can
      comfortably perform precise, repetitive motions, with greater dexterity and vision. To date,
      there have been a small number of published cases of laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy and two
      cases of series utilizing robotic-assistance. There have been no prospective, randomized,
      controlled trials comparing either of these modalities to conventional abdominal
      sacrocolpopexy.
