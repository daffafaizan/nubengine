      precisely, for 80 patients, the investigators will measure mould domestic exposure
      (determination of mould frequency during an environmental investigation at the patient's
      home), search for mould sensitization and colonization (complete bio clinical check-up
      including spirometry, inflammatory and mycological markers at inclusion), and do a clinical
      follow-up of exacerbation's (frequency and severity). At last, clinical and environmental
      mould and P. jirovecii isolates will be characterized at the phenotypic and genotypic level.
