    
      This Phase 2, multicenter, open-label single-arm segment (2A) followed by a double-blind,
      randomized, active-controlled segment (2B) is designed to evaluate ACX-362E in the treatment
      of CDI. Segment 2A of this trial was an open-label study of up to 20 patients at 6 study
      centers and was terminated early at 10 patients based on the protocol-specified Trial
      Oversight Committee's assessment of the compelling efficacy and safety data. Patients were
      treated with 450 mg of oral ibezapolstat bid for 10 days. In segment 2A all (10 of 10)
      patients were cured of CDI at end of treatment and all (10 of 10) were sustained clinical
      cures 30 days after EOT. Ibezapolstat was well tolerated with no reported SAEs. The trial
      will advance to Segment 2B which is a double-blind comparison of ibezapolstat to the standard
      of care, oral vancomycin, in approximately 64 subjects (1-1 randomization) at up to
      approximately 20 sites.

      Subjects will be evaluated for cure, safety, and tolerability. All subjects in both segments
      will have stool samples tested for microbiome profiles. Pharmacokinetic (PK) testing for
      systemic exposure will be performed on blood samples. Stool samples will be tested for study
      drug concentration.
