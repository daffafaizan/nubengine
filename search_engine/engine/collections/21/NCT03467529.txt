      The study presents the following characteristics:

        -  Observational

        -  Non interventional imaging study

        -  Single-centre

        -  Not controlled

        -  Prospective Tests and analysis CRF

        -  Filled by the investigator

        -  Data from the medical file of the patient Imaging

        -  As standard of care

        -  Before endoscopic resection the lesion will be characterized and pictures will be made
           using white light endoscopy, magnification techniques and electronic chromoendoscopy

        -  Immediately after endoscopic resection, the specimen will be prepared, oriented and
           scanned using the FFOCT device (CE marking)

        -  Imaging movies will be then reviewed by trained readers and compared to movies of
           healthy patients, findings will be described

        -  Imaging movies will be compared to pathology slides

      Pathology

        -  After scanning the specimen will be sent to pathology for analysis

        -  The pathology slides will be scanned to be kept in the study record together with their
           interpretation
