      determined, and the protocol will proceed only if it is fully determined that the tissue will
      be fully resectable. The overstitch device affixed to a standard double channel gastroscope
      will then be advanced transanally into the segment of planned resected colon, away from the
      area of disease so as to not interfere with oncologic principles or post-resection pathologic
      evaluation. Endoscopic sutures and knot tying cinching elements will be placed, with a limit
      of 15 minutes for the total procedure. The entire procedure will be closely monitored under
      laparoscopic or open surgical visualization. After suture placement, the surgical resection
      will continue as planned. The specimen will then be examined for depth of suture placement,
      evidence of perforation, and quality of the suture approximation with the knot tying element.
