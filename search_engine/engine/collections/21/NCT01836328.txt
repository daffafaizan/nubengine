      presence of lower toxicity in the ratio 1:1.2 against 1:2 while still maintaining a good
      control of pain in patients with advanced cancer that are hospitalized in different
      palliative care units.

      METHODOLOGY: Prospective randomized single blind study in patients with cancer pain treated
      with parenteral MTD and that would move into MTD oral provided there is good control of pain.
      The patients will be randomly split into two groups: (Group A = ratio 1:1.2 and Group B=ratio
      1:2). Patients will be evaluated during the two days before the switch is applied, the day of
      the change and during the 3 days post-ROP. The patients who display significant toxicity
      and/or bad analgesic control within the first 72 hours post-ROP will be considered negative
      cases. The size of the sample required will include 44 patients distributed in balanced
      groups in order to obtain a size effect of 45% and a statistical power of 80%. The
      significance level will be 0.05 for two tails.

      STATISTIC ANALYSIS: By means of Chi-squared to compare the proportion of Opioid Rotation (OR)
      failure in both groups of study.
