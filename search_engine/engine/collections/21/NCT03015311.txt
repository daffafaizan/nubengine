      increasing among persons older than 60 years of age. Elevated blood pressure (BP) is an
      important public health concern which contributes to several adverse health outcomes,
      especially coronary heart disease, stroke, heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and decline
      in cognitive function. Clinical trials have shown that a lower systolic blood pressure goal
      will lead to greater reduction in cardiovascular disease (CVD) incidence, but the effect of
      intensive treatment of systolic blood pressure below 120 mm Hg in reducing of CVD risk has
      long been debated. In particularly, among the elderly hypertensive patients aged 60 years or
      older, the most appropriate targets for blood pressure lowering to reduce cardiovascular
      events still remain uncertain.

      The STEP trial will randomize about 8000 participants aged between 60 and 80 years with
      SBPâ‰¥140 mm Hg and <190 mm Hg, and without a history of atherothrombotic or hemorrhagic
      stroke. Target SBP goals are 110-130 vs 130-150 mm Hg, respectively. The purpose of the STEP
      trial is to test whether a treatment program aimed at reducing systolic blood pressure (SBP)
      to a lower goal (<130 mmHg, intensive treatment) than currently recommended (<150 mmHg,
      standard treatment) will reduce CVD risk among hypertensive patients between 60-80 years.
      Participants will be recruited at approximately 40 clinic centers in China within
      approximately a 1-year period, and will be followed for 4 years. Furthermore, this trial will
      also examine the effect of blood pressure APP management strategy via WeChat network on
      medication compliance, blood pressure control and CVD benefits.
