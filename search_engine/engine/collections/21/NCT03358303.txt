      as a growing epidemic. Digital health interventions are the most recent iteration of an
      effort to promote individualized outpatient care through positive behaviour change theory.
      The UHN team has developed a highly automated and user-centered smartphone-based system,
      Medly, which allows for the telemonitoring of patients diagnosed with heart failure

      Patients with heart failure will be provided with a smartphone and commercial home medical
      devices, such as a blood pressure monitor and weight scale. The measurements from the medical
      devices will be automatically sent to the smartphone, and from there to a data server at the
      hospital for analysis and storage. Both clinicians and patients will be able to access these
      data and will be sent alerts by the system if the measurements are outside of the normal
      range. The system will be evaluated through interviews and comparing outcomes between the
      intervention and control groups.
