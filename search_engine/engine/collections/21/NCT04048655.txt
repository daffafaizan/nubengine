      neuromuscular blockade with neostigmine, some patients start to relax spontaneously again
      after the tof ratio has already recovered to the safe level (90%). The mechanism behind this
      in not well understood and the incidence of the phenomenon is unclear.

      The aim of this study is to monitor the reversal of rocuronium induced neuromuscular blockade
      with neostigmine. The neuromuscular blockade is monitored with train of four stimulations
      using electromyography. After the reversal agent is given and train of four ratio has
      recovered to the level of 90%, the neuromuscular blockade is monitored another 30min to see
      if tof ratio starts to spontaneously fall again under the 90%. If aforementioned postrecovery
      relaxation happens, the investigators are able to calculate the incidence of the phenomenon.
