      and drug-coated balloons (DCB) are considered as the strategies of choice in this setting.
      However, data on the value of BVS in patients with ISR is scarce. BVS are very effective to
      inhibit neointimal proliferation and they avoid the need of implanting a new permanent metal
      layer. Accordingly, currently, there is a major interest to elucidate the potential value of
      BVS in patients with ISR.

      This prospective Spanish multicenter study will assess the clinical and angiographic outcome
      of patients with ISR treated with BVS. BVS will be implanted in selected patients (fulfilling
      inclusion and exclusion criteria) presenting with either BMS-ISR or DES-ISR. Care will be
      paid to ensure device optimization. Angiographic follow-up will be obtained at 6-9 months. A
      centralized angiographic corelab will be used to provide QCA measurements. Clinical follow-up
      will be also obtained at 1 year and then yearly. Clinical events will be adjudicated by an
      independent Clinical Event Committee.
