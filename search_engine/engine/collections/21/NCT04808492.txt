      intensity laser devices are class 4 producing > 40 W of power at longer wavelengths, thereby
      allowing deeper tissue penetration. Currently, there is little evidence to demonstrate the
      effectiveness of high intensity laser treatment in those with chronic LBP. Optimal dosing
      strategies are still unknown as well as patient response based on chronicity of symptoms.
      Therefore, our study seeks to evaluate the effectives of high intensity laser therapy using
      CureWave in those with LBP of a duration longer than 3 months and with a dosing strategy of
      two times/week for three weeks.

      Hypothesis

        1. CureWave laser therapy will increase total oxygenated hemoglobin and muscle blood flow
           in patients with chronic LBP.

        2. CureWave laser therapy will reduce inflammation as assessed by muscle edema in patients
           with chronic LBP.

        3. CureWave laser therapy will improve paraspinal echogenicity (muscle quality) following
           treatment in patients with chronic LBP.

        4. CureWave laser therapy will decrease muscle sensitivity in patients with chronic LBP

        5. CureWave laser therapy will demonstrate improve patient reported outcomes, including
           decreased pain, reduced disability and improved function in patients with chronic LBP.

        6. CureWave laser therapy will increase muscle activation during maximal strength testing.

        7. CureWave laser therapy will decrease performance fatigability as assessed by maximal
           muscle activation and force production.
