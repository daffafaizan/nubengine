      electrophoresis coupled with high-resolution mass-spectroscopy reproducibly identified unique
      urinary proteomic (UP) signatures associated with subclinical left ventricular dysfunction,
      renal impairment and adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Consensus criteria currently applied
      for the selection of patients for heart transplantation (HTx) leave an inconvenient margin of
      uncertainty, because of the unpredictable course of the disease and the shortage of donor
      hearts. Furthermore, monitoring graft function and adjusting immunosuppression remain major
      challenges after HTx. Endomyocardial biopsies, up to 20 in the first year after HTx, are the
      standard approach to detect graft rejection, but require an invasive risk-carrying procedure.
      uPROPHET aims to develop UP profiling: (1) as a prognostic tool helpful in selecting
      terminally ill heart failure patients for HTx with the greatest probability of survival while
      adding a maximum of high-quality years to life; and (2) as an instrument to monitor graft
      performance and immune system activity and to manage immunosuppression. The new UP
      classifiers will be initially validated by demonstrating analogy between the proteomic
      profiles in urine and tissue samples of explanted hearts.
