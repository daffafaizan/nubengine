      acid to healthy voluntary obese after oral and intra venous administration

      Secondary objectives

        -  Define dosage plans optimized with the antibiotic treatment to the obese subject

        -  Ensure an adequacy of the treatment with the related infection

        -  Formulate recommendations of dosage adaptations for a better individualization of
           treatments, by estimating several plans of doses by simulation to reach various PK/PD
           goals according to different theoretical MIC

      Methodology

      The pharmacokinetic analysis will be realized by approach of population allowing the
      estimation of the average parameters of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid as well as the
      interpersonal variability after an administration IV and an oral administration. Parameters's
      population and their variability will be estimated with the SAEM algorithm implemented in the
      software Monolix ( www.lixoft.eu ).

      For the main objective, PK parameters PK of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid will be
      determined to day 1 and day 2. They will be described by means of indicators of position
      (average and median) and of dispersal (standard deviations, quartiles).

      For secondary objectives, the profiles concentration/time of 1000 obese subjects will be
      determined by Monte Carlo method from PK parameters estimated at the balance by the model.
      For every feigned profile, the time during which the plasmatic concentration of amoxicillin
      and clavulanic acid is superior to a panel of theoretical MIC will be calculated by means of
      curves concentration - time determined for each of the subjects.
