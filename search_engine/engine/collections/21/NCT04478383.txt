      avulsion and observe the short-term curative effect.

      Methods:In total, 11 patients diagnosed with Achilles sleeve avulsion underwent this new
      surgical technique and were followed for a mean time of 40 months. Clinical outcomes were
      measured using the visual analog scale (VAS), American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society
      (AOFAS) score, Victorian Institute of Sports Assessment-Achilles (VISA-A) score, Tegner
      score, and time taken to return to activities. Preoperative and postoperative MRI, the
      ability to perform heel rise, and complications were also evaluated.
