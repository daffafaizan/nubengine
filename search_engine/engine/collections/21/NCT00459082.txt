      of the drug in infants who remain tracheally intubated postoperatively. An exploratory
      pharmacodynamic study of a non-invasive device measuring sedation will be performed. Although
      the pharmacokinetics of dexmedetomine have been described for pediatric patients, the drug
      disposition in infants has not been well described. A range of doses has been studied, yet
      there are no reports describing the optimal dose for post-operative pediatric patients. This
      study will provide data that may allow for improved dosing recommendations in this critically
      ill population of children.
