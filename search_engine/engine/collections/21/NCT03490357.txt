      undergoing laparoscopic abdominal surgeries with the Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS)
      Protocol. The Quadratus Lumborum (QL) is another established abdominal fascial plane block
      that is comparable in procedure and risks and may potentially be more beneficial. The study
      compares the two blocks in hopes of establishing a new standard of care for patients
      undergoing laparoscopic abdominal surgeries with the ERAS protocol.

        -  Compare QL and TAP blocks cephalad spread via mapping in the Postoperative Acute Care
           Unit (PACU) within 6 hours after block placement.

        -  Compare efficacy of blocks via Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) pain scores in PACU and
           postoperative day (POD) 1.

        -  Compare amount of opioid pain medications consumed within 24 hours after block.
           Hypothesis

        -  The QL block will prove superior to the TAP block in both cephalad spread and pain
           control for abdominal surgery patients and decrease the amount of opioid pain
           medications required while in effect up to 24 hours after surgery.

        -  The quadratus lumborum will have increased cephalad spread. We predict mapping will show
           greater (2 or more dermatomal levels) or equal analgesic coverage by the QL block when
           compared to the TAP block.
