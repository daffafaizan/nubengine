      (ICU). ICU care is quite expensive, even in resource rich countries. The most common reason
      for ICU admission globally is respiratory support for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure
      (AHRF). In patients with AHRF, the need for invasive mechanical ventilation is associated
      with high mortality, especially in low income countries (LICs), given the scarce availability
      of invasive mechanical ventilation. Some studies suggest that administration of ventilatory
      support through a mask may be effective in resource-limited settings. However, there is no
      clinical study data in adults to support this evidence. Human and material constraints are
      major barriers for the care of critically-ill patients in resource limited settings ,
      advocating the need for a frugal approach. Furthermore, the scarcity of intensive care unit
      care in LICs contributes to a high mortality among acutely ill patients. The current corona
      virus pandemic has further highlighted the need for frugal acute care interventions in LICs.

      Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is a simple to use and affordable technique for
      noninvasive ventilatory support. High-flow oxygen through a nasal cannula (HFNC) may also
      offer an alternative in patients with hypoxemia. The high flow rates may also decrease
      physiological dead space by flushing expired carbon dioxide from the upper airway, a process
      that potentially explains the observed decrease in the work of breathing.

      Frugal CPAP or HFNC , as compared with standard oxygen therapy, could reduce the mortality
      among adults presenting with AHRF in a resource-limited setting.
