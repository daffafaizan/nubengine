      Arthroplasty (TKA) is evaluated.

      Level of systemic inflammatory markers (CRP and IL6) are measured preoperatively and 4 and 24
      hours postoperatively. These measurements are correlated to postoperative pain (a detailed
      assessment of pain at rest and during ambulation).

      We pole blood-samples collected prospectively (from two data set)
