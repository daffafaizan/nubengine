      Primary

        -  Determine the efficacy of low-dose testosterone, in terms of average intra-patient
           change in libido, in postmenopausal female cancer survivors with a decreased libido.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the levels of estrogen and testosterone and SGOT in patients reporting a
           decreased libido before and after treatment with this drug.

        -  Determine whether increasing libido significantly positively affects pleasure from
           sexual activity in patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the effect of this drug on vitality, general quality of life, and overall mood
           in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, crossover, multicenter
      study. Patients are stratified according to antidepressant medication use (yes vs no), age
      (under 50 vs 50 to 60 vs 61 to 70 vs over 70), tamoxifen or other selective estrogen receptor
      modulator use (yes vs no), and ovarian status (in place [natural menopause or hysterectomy]
      vs not in place [bilateral oophorectomy]). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive topical testosterone once daily for 4 weeks.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive a topical placebo once daily for 4 weeks. After 4 weeks,
           patients cross over to the other treatment arm.

      Changes in sexual functioning, mood states, and medical outcome vitality are assessed at
      baseline and then at the end of weeks 4 and 8.

      Patients who continue or restart testosterone cream after the 8-week study period are
      followed at 6 months.
