    
      The study protocol is organized in two phases: the "short-term follow-up" and the "long-term
      follow-up".

      PD patients in need of IPG replacement will be screened for enrollment eligibility.

      For the "short-term follow-up", randomized patients will undergo 2 days of experimental
      sessions (i.e. one per each type of stimulation mode, cDBS and aDBS), in a well-controlled
      environment (i.e. during hospitalization). This part of the study will collect information on
      safety and potential efficacy endpoints as assessed by experienced neurologists. The "short
      term follow-up" phase will be considered complete when the endpoint assessment has been
      performed for all patients.

      Patients, who will not experience severe side effects and who will be deemed suitable by the
      neurologist, will be eligible to continue in the "long-term follow-up" phase (i.e. 1 month)
      in their "home" environment. The "AlphaDBS" System will deliver the stimulation in aDBS or
      cDBS mode, for two weeks in each mode.
