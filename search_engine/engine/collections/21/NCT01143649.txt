      movement therapy (CIMT) in stroke patients (exp 1) as well as in healthy subjects (control
      population - exp 2). Finally we will investigate the effect of tACS - transcranial
      alternating current stimulation - as an alternative to tDCS, on motor function in healthy
      subjects (exp 3). The two experiments on tDCS are parallels (exp 1 & 2), while the experiment
      on tACS uses a crossover design (exp 3).

      For stroke patients (Exp1), our primary outcome measure is a clinical scale (Jebsen-Taylor
      Hand Function Test), while for healthy subjects (Exp 2) we investigate the effect of tDCS and
      CIMIT on cortico-spinal excitability using TMS - transcranial magnetic stimulation. Finally,
      for the third experiment using tACS, our primary outcome is cortical oscillation, as measured
      by EEG - electroencephalogram.
