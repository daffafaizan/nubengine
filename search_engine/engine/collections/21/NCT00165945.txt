      prescribed by their physician. These MRI DICOM images will be transferred to a SGI Fuel
      workstation, where they will be manipulated using the newly developed 4-D Visualization
      software. No additional scanner time or new imaging sequences are required as presently
      prescribed sequences and produced data can be analyzed. The workstation is designed to
      include acceleration hardware for volume rendering, and was developed for advanced cardiac
      MRI viewing.
