      blood will be higher in people with an all metal total hip prosthesis than in those with a
      plastic and metal prosthesis. To find out if this is true, we will test blood samples for the
      levels of metal in the blood and compare the values from 3 groups of people:

        1. people with metal on metal hip replacements

        2. loosening of a plastic and metal prosthesis and

        3. evidence of osteoarthritis and are awaiting a total hip replacement.
