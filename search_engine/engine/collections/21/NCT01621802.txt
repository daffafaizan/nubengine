      to as Inv_MMR vaccine and Com_MMR vaccine respectively. 2 lots of the comparator vaccine
      (Com_MMR_L1 and Com_MMR_L2) will be used, but the 2 lots will be analysed as a pool.

      The Inv_MMR vaccine will be administered as a second dose to children who already received a
      first dose Com_MMR vaccine. Since the second dose of a MMR vaccine in the US is routinely
      co-administered with DTaP-IPV vaccine (Kinrix®) and varicella vaccine (VV) (ProQuad® or
      Varivax®), some children will receive one dose of these vaccines along with either of the MMR
      vaccines.
