      recruited in the first year as will age-matched healthy controls from the military and
      civilian populations. MRI, single voxel MRS, and two-dimensional correlated spectroscopy (2D
      COSY) MRS will be acquired from each participant at the Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH).
      This data will be anonymized and transferred to the Draper Laboratories. Biomarkers for each
      disease will be identified by comparison with control data. These biomarkers will then be fed
      into classifiers that will then be validated with a similar cohort acquired in the second
      year. The second cohort of subjects will then be incorporated into the classifier algorithms
      for a stronger and more robust classification from which a diagnostic test will emerge. To
      test this diagnostic evaluation the data analysis by both BWH and Draper labs will be blinded
      to the characterization of the participants and from the MRS results, the investigators will
      predict if the participant has mTBI, PTSD, both, or neither. Finally, all data will then be
      fused into the algorithms to provide a final classifier. The results of the final classifier
      will then be correlated with clinical, neuropsychological, and neuroanatomical indices of
      mTBI and PTSD. These correlations will provide the most complete biochemical analysis of mTBI
      and PTSD which may lead to insight into alternate pathways for drug development.
