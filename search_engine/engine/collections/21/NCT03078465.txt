    
      This is a multi-center, randomized, single-blind, investigator-initiated study with a
      parallel design. Patients with coronary artery disease undergoing percutaneous coronary
      intervention and presenting high platelet reactivity on clopidogrel as assessed with the
      PL-11 analyzer (platelet maximum aggregation ratio [MAR%] ≥ 55 %) at 2 hours post-clopidogrel
      300mg LD (Day 0), will be randomized after informed consent, in a 1:1 ratio to the following
      treatment groups:

      Group Α: Ticagrelor 180 mg immediate loading (on Day 0) followed by 180mg/day starting from
      Day 1 until Day 365 (12 months after randomization).

      Group Β: Clopidogrel 150mg per day, starting from Day 1 until Day 365 (12 months after
      randomization).

      Platelet reactivity assessment will be performed before randomization (Day 0), and 3-day
      after randomization (Day 3). Documentation of major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular
      events (death, myocardial infarction, stent thrombosis, stroke, revascularization procedure
      with PCI or CABG) and serious adverse events (bleeding, other adverse events) will be
      performed until 12 months.
