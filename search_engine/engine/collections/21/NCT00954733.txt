    
      A group of _40 patients scheduled to undergo Hysteroscopy surgery with deep sedation will be
      studied. Standard monitors will be utilized. Additionally a transcutaneous CO2 electrode will
      be attached to the ear lobe and a BIS monitor will be applied to the forehead.

      The anesthetic management will be left to the discretion of the anesthesia provider
      (Anesthesia resident or CRNA, under the supervision of a faculty attending
      anesthesiologist).All patients will receive supplemental oxygen at 3L/ minute via nasal
      cannula, to maintain oxygen saturation greater than 90%.

      Both the end tidal CO2 (ETCO2) and transcutaneous CO2 (TcCO2) (Linde Medical Sensors, Basel ,
      Switzerland ) will be calibrated before use, according to the manufacturer's instruction..
      The anesthesia provider will be blinded to the TcCO2 monitor but will have access to the
      ETCO2 values. The ETCO2 and TcCO2 values will be recorded simultaneously by an independent
      observer.

      One arterial blood samples will be collected from each subject for measurement of PaCO2 at a
      deep level of sedation defined by a modified Ramsey score greater or equal to 5 (1=
      anxious/agitated/restless; 2= cooperative/oriented/tranquil; 3= drowsy/responds to commands
      only; 4= brisk response to shaking/loud sound; 5= sluggish response to shaking/loud sound; 6=
      no response) The ETCO2 and .TcCO2 will be recorded throughout the time of obtaining the blood
      sample every 15 seconds and the mean value will be used for comparison. Hypoventilation will
      be defined as a PaCO2 level greater than 45mmHg.

      Sedation score (OASS) will be recorded on admission to recovery area. Time to meet discharge
      criteria will be recorded.

      The experimental procedures: ABG draw, ETCO2 monitor placement on the ear, 2 Ramey scale
      assessments.
