      antibody (Rituximab, MabTheraÂ®) represents one of the most innovative aspects in the indolent
      lymphoma treatment. Preliminary data show from 40% to 50% of response with a median response
      duration between 6 and 11 months in patients with relapsing FL. This response rate increase
      when rituximab is administered as initial treatment.

      Therefore, not only due to the clinical results but also to the tolerance, and based on an
      innovative mechanism of action and in its minimal toxicity, it seems reasonable to raise the
      possibility to incorporate the administration of the monoclonal antibody with
      chemotherapeutic agents.

      The development of a new treatment scheme that includes Rituximab administration within
      treatment protocols that combine fludarabine and cyclophosphamide, whose results are better
      than the ones obtained with conventional treatments such as CHOP, should increase the
      molecular response rate and contribute therefore to increase the disease-free time interval
      (time to progression), without adding any toxicity, in addition to achieve a higher
      proportion of clinical responses (as global as complete responses). In order to increase the
      time interval to progression, a maintenance treatment will be carried out for 2 years, which
      has shown an evident benefit in the time to progression in preliminary studies.
