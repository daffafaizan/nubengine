      vitrification. Despite a lack of randomized control trials comparing slow-freezing and
      vitrification, vitrification seems to show better recovery rates and pregnancy outcomes.
      However vitrification is a manual, labour-intensive and highly skilled procedure, results can
      vary between embryologists and clinics. The GAVI system, an automation instrument with a
      novel closed system device has been developed. The present study would like to assess the
      outcomes for embryos automatically vitrification processed with the GAVI system compared with
      those processed with conventional reference technique of slow freezing.

      The meta-analysis comparing the cryopreservation of human embryos by vitrification or
      slow-freezing suggested that more well design studies as randomized trials are necessary to
      identify the most successful method for cryopreservation. The efficacy of the vitrification
      with the GAVI system will be compared with the conventional slow freezing method through a
      randomized control trial. Couples in IVF attempt will be randomized at the day of embryo
      cryopreservation by the biologist. Supernumerary frozen embryos will be thawed and
      transferred in utero in case of failure of the "fresh" embryo transfer. The outcomes of the
      thawing and frozen/thawed embryo transfer will be assessed. In the two groups, the patients
      will benefit of the standard IVF procedures applied in the Assisted Reproductive Technologies
      center of Toulouse.
