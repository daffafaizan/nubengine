      hummus and pretzels, granola bars, or no snack between 2-4 pm and refrain from eating
      anything else during this time. On day 7, the participants will consume a standard breakfast,
      at home, and will come in to the investigator's facility 1 h prior to their habitual lunch
      time. The participants will be placed in a comfortable room, void of all time cues and a
      standardized lunch will be consumed. At 3 h after lunch, the participants will complete
      baseline appetite, satiety, and mood questionnaires. The respective snack will be given to
      the participants, and they will have 20 minutes to eat the snack. Snack palatability will
      also be assessed. The participants will continue to complete the previous questionnaires
      until they voluntarily choose to eat (again). At 3 h after snack, they will be presented with
      ad libitum dinner and evening snacks. They will be permitted to eat as much or as little as
      they would like to eat over the remainder of the day. In addition, from day 3 to day 8 of the
      testing week, continuous glucose monitoring will be completed to assess glucose control.
