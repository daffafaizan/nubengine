      with pulmonary infection. The order of hyperinflation or control (without changes in
      parameters) was randomized. Hyperinflation was performed for 5 minutes in the controlled
      pressure ventilation mode, with progressive increases of 5cmH2O until reaching a maximum
      pressure of 35cmH2O, maintaining PEEP. After reaching 35cmH2O, the inspiratory time and
      respiratory rate were adjusted so that the inspiratory and expiratory flows reached the
      baseline, respectively. Static compliance (Cest, sr), total resistance (Rsr) and airway
      resistance (Rva), slow pressure drop (ΔP2) and peak expiratory flow (PEF) were assessed
      before (PRÉ), immediately after the maneuver (POSSimed) and after aspiration (POSPasp).
      Two-way ANOVA was used for repeated measurements with Tukey post-test, considering a
      significant p <0.05.
