      management interventions (cognitive behavioral therapy [CBT] or relaxation training [RT]) vs
      a time-matched 5-wk group-based health education (HE) condition on psychosocial adaptation
      (negative and positive mood, social disruption) and physiological adaptation (cortisol and
      immune function) in women with non-metastatic breast cancer who are undergoing primary
      treatment. Participants are recruited in the weeks after surgery and before the start of
      adjuvant chemotherapy or radiation, are assessed for baseline psychosocial and physiological
      adaptation indicators, and are then randomly allocated to either CBT, RT or HE. They are
      re-assessed for psychosocial and physiological adaptation at 6 and 12 month follow-up.
      Primary hypothesis is that women assigned to CBT or RT will show greater reductions in
      negative affect and social disruption, and greater increases in positive affect over time
      compared to women assigned to HE. Secondary hypothesis is that women assigned to CBT or RT
      will show greater decreases in cortisol and greater increases in immune functioning over time
      compared to those assigned to HE.
