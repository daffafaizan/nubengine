      a new paradigm and a novel device to simultaneously measure the biomechanical properties of
      various pelvic structural components that are impacted during vaginal delivery, and to
      develop a risk prediction model of maternal birth injury. Ultimately, such a model will
      enable individualized patient counseling regarding the mode of delivery and/or the need for
      obstetrical interventions to reduce child birth trauma. The approach will utilize the vaginal
      tactile imaging technology that the investigators have developed and validated for clinical
      use.

      The benefits to physicians, patients and society are expected to be significant because the
      painful event in woman's life , given the large proportion of women suffer PFD caused by
      childbirth.

      This new system may open a new technical capability in woman's healthcare and change the
      established clinical practice.
