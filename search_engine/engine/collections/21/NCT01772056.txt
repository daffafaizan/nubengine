      multicentre, randomized, double-blind, controlled study if they present an acute flare of AD
      (<30% affected body surface area; no head). After successful treatment of the flare in an
      acute phase, patients will receive either, FP twice weekly plus vehicle or vehicle alone over
      a 16-week maintenance phase. The primary study end point will be probability of a relapse of
      AD occurring. We will conduct survivor analysis of results.
