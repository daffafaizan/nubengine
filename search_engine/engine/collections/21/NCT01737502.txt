      I. To establish the maximum tolerated dose of auranofin plus sirolimus after at least one
      line of platinum based chemotherapy for lung cancer (squamous, ras-mutated adenocarcinoma, or
      small cell lung cancer) patients with no acceptable standard treatment options. (Phase I) II.
      To assess the progression-free survival at four months of patients treated with auranofin
      after at least one line of platinum based chemotherapy for lung cancer (squamous, ras-mutated
      adenocarcinoma, or small cell lung cancer) patients with no acceptable standard treatment
      options. (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the overall survival in this population in comparison to recent historical
      controls.

      II. To determine the adverse events (AE) profile and safety of the regimen. III. To determine
      the overall response rate, per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST)
      criteria, and duration of tumor response in those patients with measurable disease.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the relationship between molecular correlates and progression-free survival
      (PFS), overall survival (OS), response and adverse events.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of auranofin followed by a phase II study.

      Patients receive auranofin orally (PO) on days 1-28 and sirolimus PO on days 1-28 (days 8-28
      of course 1). Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3-6 months for 5 years.
