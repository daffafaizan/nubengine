      against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are effective in controlling cytomegalovirus (CMV)
      retinitis. Patients with non-progressive retinal disease consistent with inactive CMV
      retinitis in a location that is not immediately sight threatening, who are currently
      receiving systemic maintenance therapy with ganciclovir, foscarnet, or cidofovir, and who
      have a total CD4 cell count greater than 150 cells per microliter will have their anti-CMV
      therapy discontinued. Patients will then be closely followed for progression of their CMV
      retinitis. The primary endpoint of the study will be progression of CMV retinitis. Secondary
      endpoints will include the occurrence of extraocular CMV disease, morbidity, mortality,
      virologic data, and HIV burden.
