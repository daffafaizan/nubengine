    
      This trial has two phases (a monitoring and an intervention phase).

      Monitoring Phase: Prior to starting radiotherapy for non-metastatic breast cancer,
      participants will be approached and consented for the monitoring phase of the study, which
      involves longitudinal monitoring of fatigue in order to establish whether a patient develops
      fatigue after starting radiation. The level of pre-radiotherapy fatigue will be obtained
      during the final two weeks before radiotherapy is started. All participants will undergo
      weekly monitoring of fatigue via a brief self-report questionnaire. The monitoring period
      will continue up until one month after the conclusion of radiotherapy. Those whose fatigue
      symptoms increase above the pre-specified threshold at any point during the monitoring period
      will be approached about enrollment into the intervention phase of the study.

      Intervention Phase: This is a randomized, double-blind, parallel-arm 5-week clinical trial
      which will be used to determine the effect of naltrexone on fatigue emerging during radiation
      therapy for non-metastatic breast cancer.
