    
      This is a randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, non-inferiority clinical trial
      investigating the efficacy and safety of a new treatment regimen with Corifollitropin Alfa, a
      recombinant gonadotropin applied to initiate and sustain follicular stimulation in controlled
      ovarian stimulation for Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART). For this regimen,
      participants receive a single injection of Corifollitropin Alfa and one week later, treatment
      is continued with daily recFSH up to the day of triggering final oocyte maturation. In the
      reference group participants receive daily injections of recFSH up to the day of triggering
      final oocyte maturation. Non-inferiority in ongoing pregnancy rates (assessed at least 10
      weeks after embryo transfer) will be the primary endpoint for this trial. The number of
      oocytes retrieved will be analyzed as co-primary endpoint.
