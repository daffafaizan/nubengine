      ointment twice daily at home. However, on Days 1 and 14 there was only a single application
      of ointment and this was applied by the Investigator or his/her designee in the clinic. An
      area of the affected skin was selected for skin biopsy of sufficient size for 5 biopsy
      samples. The biopsy samples were taken from the same lesion(s) if possible or from an
      adjacent lesion in the same anatomical area at all times. All areas selected for treatment
      were treated with tacrolimus ointment 0.1% for a period of two weeks with a follow up period
      of one week. Two pharmacokinetic profiles (Days 1 and 14) and five skin biopsy samples (Days
      1, 2, 15, 18 and 21) were taken.
