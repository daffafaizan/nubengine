      intravescical route at the Recommended Dose of 600 mg, once a week, for six weeks evaluating
      the ablative activity on a papillary marker tumor in patients suffering from non-muscle
      invasive cancer of the bladder. When a patient will present a Complete Response at the end of
      the six weekly administration of Oncofid-P-B , he/she can enter a second phase of the study
      defined maintenance phase. During this phase, the patients will be treated with the study
      drug administered by intravesical infusion once a month for 2 cycles of treatment with the
      duration of 6 months separated by a period during which study drug will not be administered,
      due to the necessity to perform histological evaluation of efficacy. This scheme will follow
      a clinical usual approach for the maintenance treatment of patients suffering from non-muscle
      invasive cancer of the bladder.

      Complete Response is defined as follows: complete disappearance of the marker lesion, as
      confirmed by negative post-treatment cystoscopy including a biopsy at the marker lesion site
      and the absence of new tumors at other site and negative cytology.
