      Disease-Turkey partnership and being carried out 10 centers throughout Turkey. COPD patients
      who are prescribed long-term oxygen therapy for hypoxemic respiratory failure and/or
      noninvasive ventilation for hypercapnic respiratory failure will be included in the study and
      will be randomized to either intervention or control arm. The intervention mainly consists of
      not only education about the disease and medications but also the education of the equipment
      and how to use it to have the best benefit. Control arm patients will receive usual care,
      which consists of basic education of the patient about the therapies. The primary outcome of
      the study is readmission in 90 days.
