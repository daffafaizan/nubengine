    
      Method:

      The method presented is based on the method employed successfully by one of the applicants in
      an earlier stuy of the first day postoperative review following cataract surgery which has
      been peer-reviewed and published in the scientific literature. An earlier draft has been
      presented to a patient panel and has the benefit of external review by a potential steering
      group.

      Patients undergoing routine elective phacoemulsification cataract surgery will be randomly
      assigned to either a routine review at 4-6 weeks post-operatively (routine care) or to be
      discharged from the cataract service immediately post-operatively. All patients will be
      advised to see their own optometrist at 4-6 weeks for new spectacles if appropriate and will
      then be reviewed in a research clinic at 3 months post operatively.
