      death worldwide. The prevention of risk factors can reduce the development of cardiovascular
      diseases. The final goal of our study is to find new protective or new risk factors that can
      be modulated to reduce the incidence of cardiovascular events.

      Gut microbiota and its main metabolite, the bile acids, are implicated in the metabolic
      regulation. Some bile acids, especially the secondary bile acids, transformed from the
      primary bile acids by the bacteria of the gut microbiota, are now demonstrated in murine
      experimental atherosclerosis models, to be anti inflammatory and anti atherogenic molecules.

      We want to compare the pool of bile acids and the composition of gut microbiota between the
      coronary patients and the healthy subjects to identify the potential protective or
      deleterious bacteria / bile acids.

      All patients admitted for a scheduled coronary angiogram will be included, then divided into
      two groups: coronary or healthy, based on the presence or the absence of atheroma during the
      coronary angiogram.

      Feces and blood samples, and clinical and biological data, will be collected during the
      patient's hospitalisation. No additional exam will be performed. The blood sample will be
      collected during the coronary angiogram or during a routine blood test.
