    
      Pelvic organ prolapse develops as a result of a loss of support provided by the muscles and
      fascia that constitute the pelvic floor. Several recent population studies have estimated the
      prevalence of pelvic organ prolapse at between 10% and 30%. One in nine women will undergo
      surgery for these disorders in her lifetime and of these, one third will undergo repeated
      surgeries. The correction of pelvic organ protrusion is aimed at restoring the pelvic floor
      functional status and ultimately improving the patients quality of life. There are a few
      studies that have explored the genetic predisposition to developing pelvic organ prolapse but
      none so far looks at genetic factors involved in prolapse recurrence after adequate prolapse
      repair. There are two groups of women: women who underwent adequate repair of their prolapse
      and had an unexplained early recurrence. And a second control group of women who underwent
      the same prolapse repair procedure and had no further prolapse recurrence.
