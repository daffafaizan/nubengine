      patient-reported outcomes measures included in the PROMIS item banks. It is designed as a
      randomized cross-over study. Two non-overlapping alternate forms (Form A [FA] and Form B
      [FB]) with eight unique items each from three of the PROMIS domains (emotional
      distress-depression, fatigue, physical function) will be developed. Respondents will answer
      one of the forms by automated phone interview using interactive voice response (IVR)
      technology, paper and pencil questionnaire (PP), personal computer (PC), or personal digital
      assistant (PDA) technology. The other form will always be answered by PC. The order in which
      the forms are administered will be randomized. The two assessments will be separated by a
      short interval (e.g., 5 to 10 minutes), but will take place on the same day. The study is
      powered to evaluate equivalence within a score difference of +/-2.0 on a T-score metric
      (standard deviation of 10) with 85% power. Data for the IVR-PC, PP-PC, and PC-PC modes will
      be collected via Polimetrix (n=200 per arm, with random assignment to arm); data for the
      PDA-PC mode will be collected via Stony Brook (n=200). Respondents will have one or more of
      the chronic conditions studied in other Wave 2 studies (COPD, depression, or rheumatoid
      arthritis).
