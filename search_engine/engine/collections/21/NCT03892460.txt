    
      Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery is a common surgical procedures and an important
      treatment option for coronary artery disease. The post-surgery period of rest and recovery is
      associated with cardiorespiratory and skeletal muscle deconditioning. The goal of this
      research study is to understand whether an at-home exercise program started soon after CABG
      surgery, and continuing for 4 weeks following discharge from the hospital, can serve as a
      bridge between surgery and the start of cardiac rehabilitation to preserve or improve
      physical function. Volunteers will be randomly assigned to receive neuromuscular electrical
      stimulation (NMES) of their quadriceps muscles or not to receive NMES (control group).
      Volunteers will be evaluated prior to CABG, upon discharge and 4 weeks Post-CABG surgery.
      Assessments will include measurements of physical function by the Short Physical Performance
      Battery, 6 min walk tests and body composition analysis, as well as assessment of subjective
      physical functional capacity and quality of life using the Medical Outcomes Short form 36.
      Additionally, accelerometry will be used to monitor weight-bearing physical activity during
      the 4 week treatment phase.
