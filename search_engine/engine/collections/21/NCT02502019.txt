    
      HEMOBLAST™ Bellows is intended for use in surgical procedures as an adjunct to hemostasis
      when control of bleeding by conventional procedures is ineffective or impractical.

      This is a prospective, multicenter, single-arm pilot clinical investigation. There will be 36
      subjects enrolled across 4 investigational sites.

      The subjects will be followed at hospital charge and 6 weeks postoperatively.

      The primary endpoint of this clinical investigation is the mean paired Kappa statistic for
      the assignment of SBSS scores by 2 Investigators.

      Secondary endpoints of this clinical investigation consist of:

        -  Proportion of subjects achieving hemostasis within 6 minutes of HEMOBLAST™ Bellows
           application;

        -  Proportion of subjects achieving hemostasis within 10 minutes of HEMOBLAST™ Bellows
           application;

        -  Proportion of subjects achieving hemostasis within 3 minutes of HEMOBLAST™ Bellows
           application; and

        -  Incidence of adverse events through final follow-up.
