      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of sorafenib and bortezomib in patients with
      advanced malignancies.

      II. To describe the toxicities associated with the combination of sorafenib and bortezomib.

      III. To evaluate the therapeutic antitumor activity of the combination of sorafenib and
      bortezomib.

      IV. To evaluate the effects of sorafenib on the disposition of bortezomib.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 groups according to
      disease type.

      GROUP I (solid tumors-dose-escalation group): Patients receive oral sorafenib twice daily on
      days 1-21 and bortezomib IV over 3-5 seconds on days 1, 4, 8, and 11. Courses repeat every 21
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients
      receive escalating doses of sorafenib and bortezomib until the MTD is determined. The MTD is
      defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience
      dose-limiting toxicity.

      GROUP II (multiple myeloma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia-maximum tolerated dose [MTD]
      group): Patients receive oral sorafenib at the MTD twice daily on days 3-21 of course 1 and
      on days 1-21 of each subsequent course. Patients also receive bortezomib IV over 3-5 seconds
      at the MTD on days 1, 4, 8, and 11.

      Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 3 months.
