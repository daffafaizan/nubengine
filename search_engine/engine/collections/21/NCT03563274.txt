      colorectal carcinoma, CRC) origin. Both HCC and CRC are common causes of death from cancer
      worldwide. The overall incidence of HCC and CRC remains high in developing countries and is
      steadily rising in most industrialized countries. Available treatment options depend on the
      size, number, and location of tumors, on liver status, overall performance status and
      comorbidities, on patency of portal vein and presence of extrahepatic metastatic disease.
      They include surgical (liver resection, liver transplantation), systemic (e.g. chemotherapy,
      immunotherapy), ablative (thermal ablation, chemical ablation) and intra-arterial
      (chemoembolization, radioembolization) modalities. Radioembolization, also known as Selective
      Internal Radiation Therapy (SIRT) with microspheres containing a radiation-emitting isotope
      (Yttrium-90 or Holmium-166) delivers localized radiation in the vasculature around liver
      tumors with relatively limited concurrent injury to the surrounding normal/healthy tissue.
      Yttrium-90 radioembolization is currently included in several guidelines (EASLEORTC, ESMO).
