      moderate to severe cancer pain (NRS ≥ 4) who agreed and signed informed consent will be
      enrolled to receive oxycodone with continuous around-the-clock pattern. The study is to
      evaluate the safety and tolerability of cancer patients who receive CR and/or IR oxycodone.
      The number and percentage of patients with adverse events and serious adverse events will be
      recorded throughout the study.

      The study will continue for 3 months to observe the safety and tolerability. After screening
      at Screening visit, patients begin the study by the first day visit (Day 1). Pain assessment,
      study related questionnaires are giving out to measure the baseline scale of each patient.
      Questionnaires including rate of quality of analgesia, EQ-5D and clinical opiate withdrawal
      scale (COWS). The prescription of the study drug will be recorded from Day 1. Patients will
      need to visit bi-weekly, including Wk 2 (Day 14±3), Wk 4 (Day 28±3), Wk 6 (Day 42±3), Wk 8
      (Day 56±3), Wk 10 (Day 70±3) and Wk 12 (Day 84±3). Pain assessment will be assessed in each
      visit, drug accountability will be recorded accordingly. The rate of quality of Analgesia
      will be assessed in each visit; QoL (EQ-5D) will be recorded in Wk 4, Wk 8 and Wk 12. The
      COWS will be assessed again in Wk 12.

      The safety for individual patient will be followed during study up to 2 weeks after the end
      of treatment (EOT) or early termination (ET). The telephone contact for safety follow-up is
      acceptable for this study.
