      of deterioration will be asked to wear vital signs sensors for the duration of their hospital
      stay. These sensors are an established method of recording patient vital signs and are CE
      marked. Patients enrolled in the study will continue to receive routine medical care as
      directed by their treating team.

      All data recorded from the wearable sensors in this study will be analysed in conjunction
      with routine data collected during the patient's treatment. Several models will be created
      using deep learning AI techniques with the aim of reliably predicting several important
      clinical outcomes. The study will identify whether continuous monitoring alone can improve
      identification of deteriorating patients compared to traditional vital signs and if the
      addition of AI technology / algorithms can provide even earlier identification.
