      KTP-001 in male and female subjects between the ages of 30 and 70 years with a single
      herniated lumbar disc. After obtaining informed consent, subjects were evaluated during a
      screening period of no more than 3 weeks (21 days). This study was conducted in 10 centers in
      the US.

      Subjects that met all screening requirements and inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion
      criteria were enrolled into the study. Overall, 24 subjects were enrolled and treated: 6
      subjects in each cohort. Cohort 1 received a 5 μg/disc dose of KTP-001 by intradiscal
      injection. Following administration of study drug, subjects were confined to the study center
      for 24 hours to collect data for safety and efficacy measures and collect blood samples for
      safety, PK evaluation, exploratory PD and anti-KTP-001 antibody and then returned for further
      assessments at various intervals from weeks 1 through to month 24.

      After all subjects in Cohort 1 had received study drug, safety measures were evaluated by a
      Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) to determine whether to escalate KTP-001
      administration to the next dose level. If appropriate, Cohort 2 subjects received 15 μg/disc
      of KTP-001, Cohort 3 subjects received 50 μg/disc of KTP-001, and Cohort 4 subjects received
      150 μg/disc of KTP-001 by intradiscal injection. All safety, PK, and exploratory efficacy
      assessments were performed for the subjects in the subsequent cohorts as were performed for
      Cohort 1.
