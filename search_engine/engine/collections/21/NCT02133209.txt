      sessions over another 8 weeks that further emphasize and train subjects on MBSR concepts and
      skills. The SMH group will have 12 sessions spread out in a similar fashion to MBSR. Clinical
      outcomes are compared between groups at 3, 6, and 12 months to assess efficacy of MBSR. MRI
      scans are performed at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months changes in MRI metrics after MBSR and
      changes in MRI metrics associated with long-term MBSR practice. 30 healthy controls will also
      undergo MRI scanning to determine abnormal brain activity and structure in migraineurs
      compared to healthy controls across the 6 month period of observation.
