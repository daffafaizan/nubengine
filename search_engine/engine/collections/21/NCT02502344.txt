      course of type 2 DM is as follows: obesity, insulin resistance(hyperinsulemia), abnormal
      glucose tolerance, DM and complications of DM; correspondently, the function status of
      pancreas islet β cells are: normal, compensatory, decompensatory, impaired and failure. Post
      researches have proved that using medical interventions after the period of insulin
      resistance when the function status of β cells were compensatory, the course could not be
      reversed. There were few clinical researches about effects of medical interventions in the
      period of insulin resistance . This research would take medical interventions in subjects of
      insulin resistance without abnormal glucose tolerance, to see if there were different
      prevalence of abnormal glucose tolerance in different groups.
