      malaria control and this partly depends on patients' compliance to treatment. Uganda adopted
      Artemether-Lumefantrine (AL) as first line treatment for uncomplicated malaria. This is
      available at the health facilities in form of 6 dose pre-packs with different doze strengths
      in different packages. However, concerns about the costs and stock-outs of these packages
      have been raised and alternative equally efficacious alternatives need to be determined in
      order to reduce these problems. This study will assess if AL blister-packs can act as
      alternatives to the unit dose age specific pre-packs in the public sector
