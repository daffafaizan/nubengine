      cancer(LABC). By down-staging LABC, NAC is able to make inoperable cases operable as well as
      to make breast conserving surgery an option again for some patients.Neo-adjuvant chemotherapy
      is more and more widely used in operable breast cancer since it provides critical information
      on chemotherapy response. However, only 15% to 20% of the patients can benefit from
      Neo-adjuvant chemotherapy and achieve pCR. Although we obtained the information chemotherapy
      response for the rest of the patients who received Neo-adjuvant chemotherapy, there are still
      controversies on how the information will be used for further treatment. Therefore, it is a
      problem that needs resolving how these patients can benefit from the information Neo-adjuvant
      chemotherapy provides and whether Neo-adjuvant chemotherapy can replace conventional adjuvant
      chemotherapy at all. Our study aims to make Neo-adjuvant chemotherapy benefit more patients.

      Registered patients in stage Ⅰ- Ⅲ A breast cancer is randomly split into two groups(study
      group and control group).In the study group, patients achieving pCR will be followed up for 5
      years while patients that do not achieve pCR after neo-adjuvant chemotherapy will be treated
      with Capecitabine for 8 cycles after surgery. On the other hand, patients in the control
      group will accept surgeries and conventional adjuvant chemotherapies. Follow-up study will
      last 5 years. DFS and OS will be compared between the two groups.

      This study provides an important basis and methods for the further treatment of patients
      after neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. It discusses whether neo-adjuvant chemotherapy could replace
      conventional adjuvant chemotherapy and become a new standard for breast cancer treatment.
