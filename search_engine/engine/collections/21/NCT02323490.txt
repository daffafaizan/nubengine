      meniscus increases rate of joint degeneration. Partial meniscal removal is the most popular
      procedure and meniscal repair remain in minority of arthroscopic surgeries. As criteria of
      inclusion to meniscal repair are very rough, still success rates of meniscal repair remain in
      the 60-80% range for isolated repairs. This rate is greater when performed with ACL
      reconstruction. We believe that augmentation with bone marrow stimulation techniques will
      induce more complete and possibly faster healing.
