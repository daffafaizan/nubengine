      carbohydrates with polyunsaturated fat (PUFA) on liver fat content and cardiometabolic risk
      in individuals with prediabetes and T2D are lacking. This study therefore aims to:

        -  Investigate the effects of the diets on liver fat content at 12 months (primary aim)

        -  Investigate the effects of the diets on pancreatic fat, visceral fat, lean tissue,
           glycemic and lipid control

        -  Investigate the effects of the diets on plasma markers of de novo lipogenesis (DNL) and
           desaturation (i.e. stearoyl-Coenzyme desaturase 1, SCD-1) as well as on hepatic DNL
           using MRI spectroscopy

        -  Investigate gene-diet interactions, especially if common gene variants (e.g. in PNPLA3)
           known to increase liver fat and dyslipidemia, may modify the dietary effects. Also the
           potential influence of genetic variation in genes involved in the DNL pathway and fatty
           acid metabolism (e.g. SCD-1 and FADS) will be investigated.

        -  Perform lipidomic/metabolomic and proteomic analyses to identify potential mechanistic
           pathways that may associate with diet-induced changes in liver fat, pancreatic fat,
           visceral fat, insulin sensitivity, dyslipidemia or DNL

      Our hypothesis is that customized diet will effectively reduce liver fat through suppression
      of hepatic DNL and SCD-1 activity, and thereby improve atherogenic dyslipidemia, hepatic
      insulin resistance and hyperglycemia in individuals with prediabetes and T2D.
