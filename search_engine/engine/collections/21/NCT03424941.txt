    
      Prospective, randomized, controlled, open label, multicenter, international, non-inferiority
      trial

      If the Heart Team decides that a coronary revascularization and aortic valve replacement is
      needed and the patient complies with inclusion and exclusion criteria then the patient will
      be randomized in a 1:1 fashion between FFR-guided PCI + TAVI and CABG + SAVR.

      Patients will receive optimal medical treatment at discharge. Follow-up will be performed at
      30 days and at one year. During the 30 day follow-up visit (after TAVI) patients will be
      evaluated for symptoms of angina.
