      InfoMedics, Inc., a company with a system for developing such patient-physician feedback
      programs. Participating physicians will ask their patients to participate in the program
      after Metanx® has been prescribed and provide them with a brochure containing an introduction
      to the program and instructions on how to enroll. Patients self-enroll, take a brief survey
      before starting their Metanx® prescription, and then two brief follow-up surveys at 6 weeks
      and 12 weeks. As patients complete surveys within the study, their physician will receive
      individualized feedback reports outlining their patient's treatment experience and progress.
      Patients will also receive a copy of their own reports, to help encourage them to continue
      taking Metanx® as directed. Patients will also receive educational materials about managing
      their diabetic neuropathy.
