      evaluate the efficacy of the PRT protocol. The study will recruit approximately 30 veterans.
      The primary inclusionary criterion will be that participants must show some evidence of
      olfactory perceptual bias toward military-relevant stimuli (e.g., burning rubber, decay,
      fuel). Investigators are not requiring current suicidal ideation as an entry criterion
      because investigators believe that a fair percentage of veterans will have some suicidal
      ideation/intent but making this an entry requirement will limit the investigators ability to
      recruit given the tight timeline for the study.

      The study will consist of the development and evaluation of a novel intervention. The
      essential feature of this intervention is the use of a gradient of triggering smells (e.g.,
      burning rubber, decay, fuel, etc.), to which participants will be systematically exposed in
      an effort to facilitate habituation to these odors. The PRT protocol will be administered
      over two 1-hour sessions. Participants will return 1 month after their final PRT protocol
      session to complete a battery of follow-up measures, as well as the CAPS-5.

      The primary outcome measures of interest are: olfactory perceptual bias (as measured by the
      olfactory bias assessment), suicidal ideation and behaviors (as measured by the Beck Suicide
      Scale and Depressive Symptom Inventory- Suicidality Subscale), and symptoms related to
      suicide, such as anxiety and trauma (as measured by the Beck Anxiety Inventory and PTSD
      Checklist for DSM-5, respectively).
