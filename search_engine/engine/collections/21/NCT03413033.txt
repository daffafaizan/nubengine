      partially occlude or elongate the vocal tract. It causes a change in the vibration pattern of
      the vocal folds. SOVT postures have been postulated to produce changes in contact quotient
      (CQ), measured with electroglottograph (EGG). This study aims to observe the physiological
      effects of two different SOVT exercises in larynx when they are executed by people with
      constant vocal effort and without vocal pathology. In order to do so, EGG will be performed
      before and after 43 volunteers execute two SOVT exercises (tongue trill and resonance tubes).
      The following parameter will be captured: CQ. A t-paired test will be performed to compare
      pre and post-test information. Furthermore, a generalized estimating equation will be fit to
      find the effects of each exercise in the subjects.

      This protocol was modified due to different administrative issues related to the use of the
      stroboscopy (one of the assesment tools previosly considered), so that stroboscopy was
      removed from the protocol.
