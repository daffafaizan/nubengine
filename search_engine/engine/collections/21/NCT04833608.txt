      Patients were introduced to the study by Foot and Ankle orthopaedic surgeons if they were
      identified as having hallux rigidis. If the patient agreed, an authorized member of the study
      staff went through the study in detail and addressed any questions the patients had. If the
      patient was willing to participate, informed consent was obtained. We emphasized that not
      participating in the study will not affect their care now or in the future.

      Once informed consent was obtained, the patient was randomized into one of two groups.

        -  Morton Extensions along with current pain management protocol

        -  VKTRY insoles along with the current pain management protocol

      Explanatory variables gathered:

        1. Basic patient characteristics

        2. Range of motion at 1st MTP joint

        3. Hallux Rigidus severity grading

      Patients were evaluated at the initial appointment, 2 weeks, 6 weeks, and 12 weeks following
      their initial appointment. The surveys were given to the patients during each evaluation time
      point.

      Sample Size Calculation:

      Based on power analysis to detect a minimal clinically important difference of 10.6 (+/- 4.6
      SD) points in the PROMIS pain intensity score between patients using the Vktory carbon fiber
      insole and patients using Morton's extension insole with an overall two-tailed Type-1 rate of
      5%, 80% statistical power and accounting for a 30% lost to follow up, we needed 14 patients
      in total.
