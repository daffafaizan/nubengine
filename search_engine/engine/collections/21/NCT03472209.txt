      minimally invasive technique, the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is
      53-72%. In such operations, intra-abdominal pressure due to trandelenburg position and
      carbondioxide insufflation causes intra-cranial venous obstruction and intra-cranial pressure
      increase. In addition, intra-cranial blood flow and ultimately intra-cranial pressure
      increase due to gravity and increased venous return resistance (peripheral vascular
      resistance). Intra-cranial CO2 concentration increase results in intra-cranial vascular
      dilatation, followed by ICP increase. High intracranial pressure may cause an increase in the
      incidence of PONV after gynecological laparoscopic surgery. Measurement of optic nerve sheath
      diameter with USG, a noninvasive method for detecting intracranial pressure increases, has
      been used frequently in intensive care units in recent years. we aimed to evaluate the
      different ETCO2 levels (during the operation with 10 minute intervals, and also with the help
      of ultrasonographic optic nerve sheath diameter) in preventing gynecological laparoscopic
      surgeons' postoperative nausea induced by intracranial pressure change due to
      pneumoperitoneum and trandelenburg position.
