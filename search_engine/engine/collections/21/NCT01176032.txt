      not achieve the required blood pressure (<140/90 mmHg) after 8 weeks of treatment at the
      maximum doses of study medication were given 5 mg of amlodipine in addition to the study
      medication in order to reach the required BP (<140/90 mmHg).

      The patient's blood pressure was assessed at visit 4 (week 18) and if it was still not at the
      required level (<140/90 mmHg), the dose of amlodipine was increased to 10 mg.

      Blood pressure was again assessed at visit 5 (week 26) and if the required values had not
      been reached (<140/90 mmHg), a 12.5 mg dose of hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) was prescribed
