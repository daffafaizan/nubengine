    
      To examine the response of therapy on visual functions in amblyopic and strabismic
      participants.

      The following visual functions will be measured prior to treatment. Eye movements, contrast
      sensitivity, grating acuity, visual acuity, vernier acuity, binocular visual functions,
      reading and visual scanning will be measured. The testing will comprise of one or more of the
      above paradigms depending on participant's cooperation and understanding as majority of the
      study participants will be children. The above measurements will be repeated during amblyopia
      therapy ( which comprises of glasses, patching and/or atropine eye drops) and at the
      completion of treatment. For participants with strabismus requiring strabismus surgery the
      measurements will be repeated after strabismus surgery.
