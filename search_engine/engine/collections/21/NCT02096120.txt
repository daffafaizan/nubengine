    
      Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a currently incurable disease of unknown origin characterized by
      joint inflammation and the breakdown of immune tolerance to a variety of antigens, including
      citrullinated peptides generated by peptidyl-arginine-deiminases (PAD's). Porphyromonas
      gingivalis (P. g.) derived PAD enzyme (PPAD) citrullinates preferentially C-terminal arginine
      residues, which may be generated by P.g. derived gingipain protein (Rgpb) cleavage, but
      several of the originated peptide sequences from enolase, collagen, vimentin or fibrinogen
      may be cross-reactant to citrullinated RA candidate autoantigens.

      Antigen-specific autoantibodies in RA may be present years before clinical disease onset of
      arthritis, and their precise role in the initiation or perpetuation of the characteristic
      articular immune processes is currently unclear. The situation for autoantibodies was in
      similar poorly understood for decades until an unanticipated reduction of RA disease activity
      could be achieved by therapeutic B cell depletion using anti-CD20 therapy. While anti-CD20
      therapy may affect the regeneration of autoantibody producing cells, the investigators aim in
      the present study to reduce potential oral trigger mechanisms or antigens for cross-reactant
      autoreactive B cell or plasma cell populations. The study follows the concept of improved RA
      disease activity by minimization of any inflammatory stimuli associated with periodontitis,
      e.g. by any underlying microbial colonization, the amount of microbial foreign antigens,
      achieved by standard oral hygienic means, full mouth disinfection plus adjuvant short term
      antibiotic therapy in established periodontitis.
