      and continues into adulthood in at least 50% of affected adolescents. Pharmacotherapy for
      ADHD in adults has paralleled that used for children, with generally positive results
      (Spencer, 1998). Never-the-less, it is not clear that the dimensions of medication response
      in adults are the same as in children. The extent to which the symptoms change with age
      remains open to question. This trial is created to include a variety of outcome measures
      which will enhance the number of symptoms assessed.

      Methylphenidate was the first medication shown to be effective in treatment for adults with
      ADHD and continues to be widely used. Several studies have demonstrated the usefulness of
      methylphenidate in adult ADHD (Wender et al, 1985, Spencer et al, 1995). These studies have
      not shown any unexpected drawbacks to treatment with methylphenidate. The extended release
      formulations represent an improvement over the immediate release versions for many patients.

      This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, crossover trial comparing OROS
      methylphenidate with placebo. The double-blind trial will be preceded by an enrollment period
      consisting of a screening visit followed by a baseline visit. Patients who continue to meet
      admission criteria at baseline will be randomized into the first of two 4-week treatment
      periods. We will attempt to reach the highest tolerated dose size within 2 weeks and then
      observe the response over the last two weeks of each crossover phase. The double-blind period
      will be followed by a 180 day open-treatment, flexible-dose phase designed to assess
      long-term effects.
