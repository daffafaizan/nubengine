      of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) and the European Society for Gynaecological
      Endoscopy (ESGE) (ESHRE/ESGE) consensus on the classification of congenital genital tract
      anomalies, which was formerly known as "T-shaped uterus" in the American Fertility Society
      (AFS) Classification of Anomalies of the MÃ¼llerian Duct that leads to poor reproductive and
      obstetric outcomes.

      The reproductive performance of dysmorphic uterus is not well-known issue. We designed a
      randomized trial in unexplained infertile couples women with dysmorphic uterus. After
      allocation of properly selected women, hysteroscopy group will be undertaken metroplasty
      procedure and 9 months follow-up period with natural conception. Second group will be
      undertaken to six months spontaneous coitus and three cycles clomiphene citrate and
      intrauterine insemination cycles. After nine months of follow-up of both groups, the
      pregnancy and reproductive outcomes will be evaluated.
