      the world. The impact of this national intervention on cardiovascular prevention behaviour
      (physical exercise, nutrition, smoking) is unknown. The COLA Trial aims to help clarifying
      these questions.

      An online survey was distributed among bavarian students with standardized questions about
      physical activity, nutritional behavior, smoking and alcohol intake before and during
      lockdown.
