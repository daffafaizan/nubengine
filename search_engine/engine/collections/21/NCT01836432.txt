      to xenotransplantation in humans to increase the efficacy of immunizing patients against
      their pancreatic cancer. In this protocol, the transfer of the murine α(1,3)
      galactosyltransferase [α(1,3)GT] gene to immunotherapy component cells results in the cell
      surface expression of α(1,3)galactosyl-epitopes (αgal) epitopes on membrane glycoproteins and
      glycolipids. These epitopes are the major target of the hyperacute rejection response. This
      response occurs when organs are transplanted from lower animal donor species into primates
      and results in rapid destruction of transplanted tissue and an augmented response against
      transplant antigens, including antigens not related to the αgal epitopes. Human hosts have
      pre-existing anti-α-gal antibodies that are thought to result from chronic immunological
      stimulation due to exposure to α-gal epitopes that are naturally expressed on normal gut
      flora and these antibodies may comprise up to 1% of serum immunoglobulin G (IgG).
      Opsonization and lysis of the immunotherapy component cells mediated by this antibody is
      believed to increase the efficiency of antigen processing by targeting vaccine components to
      antigen presenting cells via the Fcγ receptor.
