      patients receiving long term treatment. Although treatment guidelines recommend
      discontinuation after sustained remission, discontinuing antidepressants appears to be
      challenging for both patients and general practitioners. Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy
      (MBCT) is an effective intervention that reduces the risk of relapse in recurrent depression
      and might facilitate discontinuation by teaching patients to cope with withdrawal symptoms
      and fear of relapse. The current study aims to investigate the effectiveness of the
      combination of Supported Protocolized Discontinuation (SPD) and MBCT in comparison with SPD
      alone in successful discontinuation of long-term use of antidepressants in primary care.

      Methods/Design This study involves a cluster-randomized controlled trial conducted in primary
      care patients with long-term use antidepressants with baseline and 6, 9 and 12 months
      follow-up assessments. Patients choosing to discontinue their medication will be offered a
      combination of supported protocolized discontinuation (SPD) and MBCT or SPD alone. Our
      primary outcome will be full discontinuation of antidepressant medication (= 0 mg) within 6
      months after baseline assessment. Secondary outcome measures will be the severity of
      withdrawal symptoms, symptoms of depression and anxiety, psychological well-being, quality of
      life and medical and societal costs.
