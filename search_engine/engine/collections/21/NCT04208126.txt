    
      Patients suffering acute ARDS defined according to the Berlin Definition starting from severe
      stage with acute onset and (i) ratio partial arterial pressure of oxygen fraction of inspired
      oxygen inspired oxygen fraction (PaO2/ FiO2) â‰¤ 200 (ii) Bilateral opacities consistent with
      pulmonary edema on frontal chest radiograph, and (iii) requirement for positive pressure
      ventilation via an endotracheal tube or non-invasive ventilation (iv) no clinical evidence of
      left atrial hypertension, or if measured, a Pulmonary Arterial Wedge Pressure (PAOP) less
      than or equal to 18 mm Hg will be treated by ECMO either within 24 hours to referral to an
      ARDS ECMO center or as rescue therapy after failure of conventional therapy.

      Outcome measures have been chosen according to robustness and sensitivity to change. They are
      of high clinical impact and reflect the treatment effect desired by clinicians. Primary
      efficacy endpoint: All cause mortality by 28-days. Key secondary endpoints are: 1) 90 day all
      cause mortality 3) ICU length of stay 4) duration of mechanical ventilation support 5)
      frequency and duration of renal replacement therapy 6) bleeding requiring transfusions in the
      ICU 7) SOFA score
