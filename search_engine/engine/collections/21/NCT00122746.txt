      advantage over the same radiotherapy given alone in AIDS patients with cervix cancer.
      External beam radiotherapy is used with 50 Gy in 25 daily fractions (last interim analysis,
      October 2005) suggested lowering the total dose down to 46 Gy in 23 daily fractions).
      Brachytherapy component was specified as either 30 Gy of LDR in a single fraction or 3
      fractions of 8 Gy using HDR. Cisplatin was administered weekly at a dose of 30 mg/sqm.
