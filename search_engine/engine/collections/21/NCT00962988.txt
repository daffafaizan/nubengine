    
      Smokers with Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) or stroke attending a Stroke Prevention Clinic
      and willing to quit smoking will be randomly assigned (1:1) to either a prescription only
      (PO) usual care group or a cost-free (CF) pharmacotherapy experimental group. Participants
      assigned to the prescription only usual care group will be asked to have their prescription
      for smoking cessation pharmacotherapy filled at their own cost at their local community
      pharmacy. Participants assigned to the cost-free pharmacotherapy group will be provided with
      a 12-week supply of NRT, or a 12-week supply of bupropion or varenicline. The pharmacotherapy
      will be provided by the research nurse to the patient immediately. All participants will
      receive identical advice regarding smoking from the attending neurologist, nurse counseling
      for smoking cessation, and follow-up tracking and telephone-based support for up to 26 weeks
      after the target quit date. Non-treatment follow-up will continue to week 52 after the target
      quit date.
