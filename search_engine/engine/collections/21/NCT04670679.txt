    
      This is a first-in-human, Phase 1/1b, open-label, multicenter clinical study of ERAS-601 SHP2
      inhibitor as a monotherapy and in combination with a MEK inhibitor. The study will commence
      with dose escalation of ERAS-601 monotherapy, followed by dose escalation of ERAS-601 in
      combination with a MEK inhibitor. Once the monotherapy maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or
      recommended dose (RD) has been determined, then dose expansion of ERAS-601 monotherapy may
      commence. Dose expansion of ERAS-601 in combination with a MEK inhibitor may commence after
      the combination RD has been determined. Dose expansion will enroll participants with advanced
      or metastatic solid tumors harboring specific molecular alterations.
