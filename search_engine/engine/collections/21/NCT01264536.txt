      (anti-microbial, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory) and is one of the most important
      proteins present in mammalian milk. We hypothesize that lactoferrin as an oral supplement
      given daily to low birth weight will improve their health by mimicking their protective role
      in milk. There is extensive literature showing in vitro and in animal models the benefits of
      lactoferrin. However, there are few clinical trials designed to translate this knowledge into
      patient care.

      We will conduct a pilot randomized, double-blinded placebo-controlled trial comparing daily
      supplementation with bovine lactoferrin versus placebo in neonates to reduce the incidence of
      sepsis in the first month of life. We will enroll 190 neonates with a birth weight less than
      2,500 g, younger than 3 days of age in the neonatal intensive care unit of 5 pediatric
      hospitals in Lima, after informed consent of both parents. Infants will be followed in the
      hospital until death or discharge and then at home up to 1 month of age. Bovine lactoferrin
      will be used in this trial (200 mg/Kg per day). Although bovine and human lactoferrin are not
      identical, their bioactivity is quite comparable. Maltodextrin (an inert sugar) will be used
      for controls. The primary study outcome will be the number of first late-onset sepsis
      episodes (occurring >72h after birth with isolation of any pathogen in blood or cerebrospinal
      fluid).
