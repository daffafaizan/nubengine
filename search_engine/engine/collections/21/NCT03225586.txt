           and chronic noncommunicable diseases. Societal determinants are measured by an index of
           measures from each of the 4 domains of interest: built environment, food and nutrition
           policy, psychosocial/socioeconomic factors, and tobacco.

        2. To examine the relationship between societal determinants and incidence of chronic
           noncommunicable disease events (e.g. cardiovascular disease, cancer) and on changes in
           rates of selected risk factors (e.g. smoking)

        3. To examine the relationship between health related behaviors (e.g. diet, physical
           activity, smoking, alcohol) and health outcomes (e.g. death, non-communicable diseases)

        4. The quality of health systems across a diverse range of health resource settings, and
           how this impacts health outcomes

        5. Genetic factors for non-communicable diseases
