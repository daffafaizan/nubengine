      the biomarkers/protein signature associated with urological diseases; (ii) To clarify the
      clinical role of the risk factors and their interactions for early detection and optimized
      treatment of urological diseases, and improvement of post-treatment quality of life; (iii) To
      develop algorithms and nomograms to accurately predict the outcome of urological diseases.
