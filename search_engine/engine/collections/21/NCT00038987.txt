      preliminary efficacy, and immunogenicity of Aventis Pasteur smallpox vaccine (APSV) in
      healthy, vaccinia-naive adults. Four concentrations of APSV, derived from 2 lots of vaccine,
      will be tested; ranging from 10 (exponent 6 pfu per ml) to 10 (exponent 7.5 pfu per ml). Four
      concentrations of Dryvax (ranging from 10 exp 6 per ml to 10 exp 8 per ml) will be evaluated
      as a positive control. This study is designed to assess the feasibility of the use of APSV
      and dilutions of APSV in an emergency vaccination scenario. The study will be conducted in
      two phases. The initial phase will consist of a single-center, randomized, open-label study
      in 45 subjects to evaluate the safety and approximate the take rate of undiluted APSV (two
      lots APSV plus a Dryvax control arm: n=15 per arm). A 14 day post vaccination safety
      follow-up will be completed for all subjects vaccinated in the initial phase prior to
      initiation of the second phase of the study with an additional 285 subjects. All subjects
      will be followed for 56 days post vaccination with a clinic visit at day 180 for stage 1
      subjects and a follow-up phone call at day 180 for stage 2 subjects. The expansion phase of
      the study will be conducted at three additional sites.
