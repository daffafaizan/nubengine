      Primary

        -  Determine the clinical efficacy of maintenance therapy comprising imatinib mesylate and
           bevacizumab after completion of first-line, platinum-based chemotherapy and bevacizumab,
           in terms of progression-free survival, in patients with stage IIIB or IV non-small cell
           lung cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Assess the safety profile of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate twice daily on days 1-21 and bevacizumab IV over 30
      minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 1 year in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study.
