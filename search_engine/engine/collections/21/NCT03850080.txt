      for this study. Each patient received 4 injections of ACS (OrthokineÂ®) at the site of OA once
      per week for 4 weeks. Clinical and functional evaluation were performed using VAS scale for
      pain, WOMAC scale and KSS functional and clinical scores before the first injection, at one
      week, at two weeks, at three weeks, at one month and at six months. Statistical analysis was
      done with the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test.
