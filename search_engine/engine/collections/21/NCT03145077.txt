      I. To determine whether DCE-MRI following external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) can be used
      to reliably predict osteoradionecrosis (ORN).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Define dose-response relationships between DCE-MRI derived imaging biomarkers and
      subsequent development of ORN.

      II. Evaluate the use of DCE-MRI parameters to monitor ORN response to treatment.

      III. Assess the use of DCE-MRI parameters in preoperative planning in advanced ORN subjects.

      IV. Develop MRI-based biomarkers inclusive predictive models for development of
      radiotherapy-attributable tissue injury within the field of radiation.

      V. Determine the association of patient-related outcomes (PROs) to clinical and imaging
      findings of tissue damage, such as the onset of ORN.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 4 cohorts.

      COHORT 1: Patients with newly diagnosed tumors undergo DCE-MRI within 4 weeks prior to the
      first radiation fraction, within 3-5 weeks after radiation start, and at 2, 6, 12, 24, and 36
      months post radiation. Patients who were previously irradiated and are at various stages of
      oncologic follow-up undergo DCE-MRI for a total of 2-5 times at baseline and at 6, 12, 24,
      36, and/or 48 months post radiation. Patients in the third or subsequent years post treatment
      may undergo subsequent yearly imaging studies.

      COHORT 2: Patients undergo DCE-MRI within 4 weeks prior to the first re-radiation fraction,
      within 3-5 weeks after radiation start, and at 2, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months post radiation.

      COHORT 3: Patients undergo DCE-MRI before and at 2 and 6 months post ORN treatment. Patients
      may undergo DCE-MRI during the mid-ORN treatment.

      COHORT 4: Patients undergo DCE-MRI within 4 weeks prior to and at 5-10 weeks and 12 months
      post surgery.
