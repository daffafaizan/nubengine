      stimulate tenocytes to proliferate, differentiate and produce matrix components including
      collagen. Studies have demonstrated that nitroglycerin transdermal patches, which release
      nitric oxide, reduce pain and increase function in patients with chronic tendonitis. The
      purpose of the present study is to examine the efficacy of three dose levels of
      nitroglycerin, compared to placebo, in reducing pain and increasing function in patients with
      chronic (greater than three months' duration) lateral epicondylitis.
