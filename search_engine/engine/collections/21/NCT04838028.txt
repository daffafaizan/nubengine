      have been prospectively collected in the Swedish Hernia Registry (SHR), which covers > 95% of
      all groin hernia repairs in Sweden. The very large cohort of more than 37,000 TEP (totally
      extraperitoneal) and TAPP (transabdominal preperitoneal) repairs enable assessment of the
      relative risks for CPIP depending on different combinations of mesh and mesh fixation. Each
      participant was entered at the date of surgery when demographic and intraoperative data were
      registered. The possible presence of CPIP after 1 year postoperative was evaluated with a
      PROM questionnaire.
