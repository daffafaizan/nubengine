    
      Primary Objective

      To evaluate if out-patient (clinic-based) therapy of young infants with possible serious
      bacterial infection with 7 days of intramuscular procaine penicillin and gentamicin
      (reference therapy) is equivalent to:

        -  (1) injectable gentamicin once daily and oral amoxicillin twice daily for seven days;

        -  (2) injectable penicillin and gentamicin once daily for two days followed by oral
           amoxicillin twice daily for five days; and

      Hypothesis

      The proportion of babies who fail therapy at (or before 7) days will be 10% in each group. A
      5% or less difference in failure rates will be considered equivalent.

      Study Design

      This will be a randomized, three arm, open-label equivalence trial among young infants, 0-59
      days of age who are diagnosed as having possible serious bacterial infection in one of the
      Karachi field clinics, and whose families refuse facilitated hospital referral, and the
      infants meet other specified inclusion criteria.

      Eligible young infants will be recruited from among those referred to the clinics by trained
      community health workers as having clinical signs predictive of possible serious illness
      during regular home visits in the surveillance area, or those presenting directly to the
      clinics from the areas under pregnancy and newborn surveillance. A diagnosis of possible
      sepsis will be made by clinicians if specified clinical criteria are met.
