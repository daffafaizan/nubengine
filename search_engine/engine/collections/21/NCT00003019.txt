      diagnosed or recurrent desmoid tumors in children who are not good candidates for treatment
      with surgery or radiation therapy.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive vinblastine and methotrexate IV weekly for 26 weeks, then every 2
      weeks for an additional 26 weeks. Treatment continues for a maximum of 1 year in the absence
      of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Patients with a complete response receive an
      additional 8 doses of chemotherapy. Patients are followed every 6 months for 4 years and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 13-25 patients will be accrued for this study.
