      procedural pain during lumbar puncture in children has been demonstrated. In adults the use
      of an inhaled equimolar mixture could prevent pain.

      Although nitrous oxide was initially considered innocuous, evidence began to be gathered
      later that it had potentially side effect. It has been demonstrated that nitrous oxide
      inactivates the vitamin B12-dependent enzyme methionine synthetase and impairs DNA synthesis
      in bone marrow cells.

      Therefore this prospective, multicenter randomized placebo controlled, double-blind trial was
      design to determine whether an inhaled equimolar mixture of nitrous oxide and oxygen would
      significantly reduce pain during bone marrow biopsy with aspiration. In addition we performed
      a careful cytological examination of bone marrow samples in order to evaluate the quality of
      the picture sample.
