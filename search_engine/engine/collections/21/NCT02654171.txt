      tract infections in infants and young children and a major cause of hospitalization due to
      severe respiratory infection. Despite four decades of effort, there are still no effective
      methods to control RSV infection. Treatment of RSV has been limited to supportive measures.
      There is an urgent need for safe and effective drugs to treat and prevent RSV disease.

      AK0529 is an investigational antiviral agent that targets the RSV fusion protein on the
      surface of the viral envelope and exerts antiviral activity against RSV by inhibiting viral
      entry into host cells and preventing fusion protein induced cell-cell fusion. AK0529 was
      generally well tolerated in healthy volunteers.

      This study is designed as a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, phase
      2 study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and
      antiviral effect of single and multiple dosing of AK0529 in infants hospitalized with RSV
      infection. It will consist of two parts, Part 1 and Part 2. Each part will consist of three
      phases, a pre-treatment phase, a treatment phase and post-treatment follow-up phase.
