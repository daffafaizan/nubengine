      lymphomas (NHL). The distinction between a LL and an acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) is
      difficult; it is arbitrarily based on the percentage of medullary blasts. Above 20% of
      blasts, it is an ALL. In both cases, the same type of cells is affected: the lymphoblast.
      Thus the LL were treated either as aggressive NHL or as ALL. The results of the various
      clinical studies, have shown a best efficacy of ALL type treatments(in terms of overall
      survival and disease free survival). These treatments are based on an induction phase with
      reinforced cyclophosphamide and L-asparaginase, and a re-use of the first drugs after
      consolidation (delayed intensification). The prognostic factors of ALL are now better
      defined, determining risk groups. According to these prognostic indicators, the allograft
      could be proposed in first complete remission. Indicators are biological (hyperleukocytosis,
      chromosomal abnormalities as t(4;11), t(9;22), t(1;19) translocations), clinical (central
      nervous system involvement), evolutive (salvage therapy needed to obtain complete remission),
      consideration of early response (cortico-sensibility and chemo-sensibility) and molecular
      responses (residual disease). On the other hand, the prognostic factors of LL are not well
      known. This study should permit to better define them. So the prognostic indicators of ALL,
      in this study, will be decisional for the indication of allograft. This treatment is based on
      a parallel currently recruiting adult patients with ALL (protocol GRAALL 2003).
