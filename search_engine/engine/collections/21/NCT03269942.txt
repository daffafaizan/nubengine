      that endovascular flow-diversion is better than revascularization in treatment of complex
      intracranial aneurysms by postoperative modified Rankin Scale (mRS). Sample size was measured
      by Fisher exact test. Depending on a type of the procedure, the patients are divided into two
      groups: Endovascular Flow Diversion Procedure (include 55 patients) and Revascularization
      Procedure (include 55 patients). Randomization is performed by random number generation.The
      study was approved by Institutional Review Board
