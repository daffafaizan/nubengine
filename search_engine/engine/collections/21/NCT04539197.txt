    
      300 IgG4-RD patients, 200 other autoimmune diseases, 60 IgG4-RD mimickers (pancreatic cancer,
      cholangiocarcinoma, vasculitis, lymphoproliferative diseases, inflammatory bowel disease,
      kimura disease) and 100 healthy controls were enrolled. Peripheral blood samples of 5-10 ml
      were collected from all patients and healthy controls. Serum was separated for ELISA
      detection. Circulating plasmablast/plasma cells were detected of all patients at baseline and
      healthy controls. IgG4-RD patients were followed up every 3-6 months. Circulating
      plasmablast/plasma cells were also detected at disease remission and relapse. IgG4-RD
      patients' clinical data and laboratory parameters were collected. Data were analyzed to
      evaluate plasmablast/plasma cells in diagnosis and relapse prediction of IgG4-RD.
