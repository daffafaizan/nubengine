      planned for ADT will be recruited. Fecal sample will be collected before initiation of ADT,
      and then at 3 and 6 months after initiation of ADT. Anthropometric, blood metabolic
      parameters, serum inflammation markers and panels of microbiome metabolites will be measured
      at these timepoints. Changes in gut microbiome from baseline to 6 months after initiation of
      ADT will be assessed. Correlation of changes in gut microbiome and metabolic changes, as well
      as inflammation and microbiome metabolites, will be assessed and possible mechanisms will be
      explored.
