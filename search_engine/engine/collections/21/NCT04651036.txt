    
      This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, single-dose, 2-period parallel-arm study
      designed to assess the immunogenicity of QL0605 and US-Neulasta.

      A total of 300 healthy male and female subjects aged 18-55 years (inclusive) will be included
      and randomized to receive either 2 s.c. doses of QL0605 or US-NeulastaP®P in a ratio of 1:1.
      After the Screening Period of up to 4 weeks the subject will be randomly allocated to one of
      the 2 parallel treatment arms. All subjects will receive 1 s.c. injection of 6 mg QL0605 or 6
      mg NeulastaP®P (US) in Treatment Period 1 and 1 s.c. injection of 6 mg QL0605 or 6 mg
      NeulastaP®P in Treatment Period 2. The interval between doses is ≥ 42 days.
