      receive Ketamine (1 mg/ml solution prepared in normal saline) infusion at a rate of 20 mg/h
      for a period of 24 hours. The infusion will start at a rate of 5 mg/h, and then gradually
      tapered up during the first 3 hours by 5 mg an hour. Similarly, the infusion rate will be
      gradually tapered down at a rate of 5 mg/h during the last 3 hours of infusion. The patients
      randomized to the 'placebo arm' of the trial will receive normal saline infusion at the same
      rates. In order to prevent the psychogenic adverse effects associated with Ketamine, the
      patients will be administered Midazolam at a dose of 1 mg IV every 4 hours. Midazolam will
      also be administered at the same rate to the patients randomized to the placebo arm. Blood
      Ketamine levels will be measured before starting the treatment, and daily while the infusion
      is on. While receiving treatment, the patients will be admitted to the telemetry floor in the
      hospital, on a monitored bed.
