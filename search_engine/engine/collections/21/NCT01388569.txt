    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To correlate circulating myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) and Treg frequencies
           with clinical outcome.

      Secondary

        -  To correlate circulating anti-sargramostim (GM-CSF) antibody levels with clinical
           outcome.

      OUTLINE: Archived peripheral blood mononuclear cells and serum samples are analyzed for
      circulating myeloid-derived suppressor cells, Treg (CD3+/CD4+/CD25hi/FOXP3+) frequency, and
      anti-sargramostim (anti-GM-CSF) antibody levels by flow cytometry and anti-GM-CSF
      neutralizing antibody assay.
