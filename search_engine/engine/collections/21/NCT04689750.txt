    
      This is a single centre prospective and retrospective cohort study. This study involves
      allo-HSCT recipients and their donors at Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong. Information on the
      presence of gene mutations in donor peripheral blood or bone marrow sample; gene mutations in
      recipient peripheral blood or bone marrow post-allo-HSCT; and donor and recipient outcome
      will be collected in either prospective, partial-prospective/retrospective or retrospective
      manner. The information will be used to determine the association between the presence of
      clonal haematopoiesis in the donor and recipient outcome following allo-HSCT.

      Data will be collected through routine clinical visits and/or reviewing medical records. Data
      will be collected at the time of peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) or bone marrow stem cells
      donation, at the time of allo-HSCT, one month post-allo-HSCT and every 6 months thereafter
      until death/study termination.

      Genetic profile of donors will be collected at the time of PBSC or BM stem cell donation.
      Genetic profile of recipients will be collected at 1-month, 6-month, 12-month post-HSCT and
      at time of relapse or occurrence of leukaemia.

      Gene mutations and pathogenic gene fusion will be determined in the peripheral blood and/or
      marrow samples by next-generation sequencing (NGS) using a myeloid-gene panel and nanopore
      long-read sequencing.
