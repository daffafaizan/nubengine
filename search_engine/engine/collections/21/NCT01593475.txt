      and cisplatin followed by CRT for locally advanced unresectable pancreatic cancer. Previous
      studies showed that approximately 20% of patients with locally advanced disease developed the
      early distant metastasis.[6, 7] Thus, it will be expected that at least 80% of total patients
      will be eligible for induction chemotherapy after completion of induction chemotherapy. An
      experimental arm that result a compliance of 80% would merit further study. If the true
      compliance rate of the patients who will eligible for CRT is â‰¤ 60%, null hypothesis will be
      rejected with a power of 80% and a type I error of 5%. Thus, the required number of evaluable
      patients is 24. Considering the 10% follow-up loss and 20% distant metastasis rate after
      induction chemotherapy, a total of 34 eligible patients will be enrolled.
