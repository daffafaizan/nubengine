      including VEGF, PDGF, and bFGF. In addition, RCC tumors overexpress the receptors for these
      peptides. These ligands and receptors may be involved in the autocrine stimulation of tumor
      cell growth, or in the paracrine stimulation of neovascular or stromal fibroblast growth that
      supports tumor expansion. Novel treatment that specifically interrupts these signaling
      pathways may have significant anti-tumor activity. When taken together, these data provide a
      rationale for investigation of a combination therapy with PEG-Intron, Sunitinib and Tarceva
      for clear cell and papillary RCC patients.
