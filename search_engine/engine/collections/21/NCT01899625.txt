      and preliminary efficacy of an MI-based program for weight loss in young adults. Participants
      will be assigned to either the MI Behavioral Weigh Loss or Behavioral Weight Loss arms - both
      arms will receive a 12-week Behavioral Weight Loss program, including 2 individual in-person
      sessions, followed by weekly Behavioral Weight Loss modules, reporting of key behaviors, and
      feedback on progress relative to goals, all via email. Session content will be quite distinct
      between the two arms, with an increased emphasis on personalized feedback relative to healthy
      norms, enhancing autonomous motivation, and choice surrounding diet and activity goals in the
      MIBWL arm. Assessments will take place at 0, and 3 months, followed by exit interviews to
      help refine the protocol.
