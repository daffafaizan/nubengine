      cartilage, hypertrophy of the bone at the margins and subchondral sclerosis. Osteoarthritis
      of the knee is a common problem causing significant knee pain and disability. Medial
      compartment osteoarthritis is predisposed to by varus deformity of the knee. High tibial
      osteotomy is a well-established method for treatment of medial unicompartmental knee
      osteoarthritis and correction of varus deformity. It is a joint preserving procedure
      especially preferred in young patients for whom arthroplasty is not desirable. The procedure
      promotes regeneration by causing lateral shift of the weight-bearing axis, thus decreasing
      load on the medial compartment and widening the medial joint space. The methods for Ø§igh
      tibial osteotomy include opening-wedge osteotomy and closed wedge osteotomy. An opening-wedge
      osteotomy has become increasingly popular compared to the other technique. One of the
      disadvantages of this technique is that the plate is placed subcutaneously on the medial
      aspect of the proximal tibia. Many of the patients complains of irritation through the plate
      and wish metal removal after healing of the osteotomy. Few papers assessed regeneration of
      the articular cartilage after medial opening-wedge osteotomy.
