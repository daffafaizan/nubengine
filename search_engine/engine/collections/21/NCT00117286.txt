    
      Participants who completed the main FE200486 CS14 study initially continued with the same
      dose in the FE200486 CS14A extension study. A protocol amendment changed the dosage to 160 mg
      (40 mg/mL) for all study participants.

      The data include data from the participants who participated in both the main study (FE200486
      CS14; NCT00116779) and the extension study FE200486 CS14A.
