      80 patients who perform artificial insemination and correlate this result to their sperm DNA
      fragmentation. Patients will be recruited from the reproductive biology unit of Saint-Etienne
      University Hospital. Aluminum assays will be carried out using an Atomic Absorption
      Spectrophotometry technique by Prof. Exley at Keele University in Great Britain, a world
      expert in aluminum toxicity. Measurements of sperm DNA damage will be carried out using flow
      cytometry by our research team (SAINBIOSE INSERM U1059) at the Medecine Faculty of
      Saint-Etienne.
