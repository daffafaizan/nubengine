      last two decades with the introduction of more effective treatment options. Proteasome
      inhibitors have an anti-myeloma effect and are often used as either initial treatment or at
      relapse in patients with multiple myeloma. MLN9708 is an orally bioavailable, potent,
      reversible inhibitor of the 20S proteasome. Phase I studies have shown MLN9708 to be very
      well tolerated with minimal peripheral neuropathy. It has also shown impressive anti-myeloma
      activity in both the relapsed/refractory setting and the upfront setting (Kumar et al. 2011,
      Berdeja et al. 2011, Richardson et al. 2011). These characteristics make MLN9708 an ideal
      proteasome inhibitor to use after allogeneic stem cell transplant. In this Phase II,
      open-label, multicenter, non-randomized study the investigators will investigate the role of
      MLN9708 as maintenance after allogeneic stem cell transplant in patients with high-risk
      multiple myeloma, and in patients with multiple myeloma who have relapsed after an autologous
      stem cell transplant.
