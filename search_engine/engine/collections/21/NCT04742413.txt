      and newly collected data of schizophrenia patients followed-up for one year in secondary care
      settings (psychiatric services).

      Patients will be selected by the specialist when required to switch the SGA therapy for
      schizophrenia (index data). Schizophrenia patients will be enrolled in a consecutive manner
      over a period of 6 month into two cohorts:

        -  Cohort A: patients who are prescribed to switch to lurasidone (lurasidone cohort)

        -  Cohort B: patients who are prescribed to switch to any other monotherapy SGA (other SGA
           cohort) The decision to switch the SGA treatment and prescribe the new treatment is done
           previously and independent from the decision to enter the patient into the study.

      Visit 0 will be performed when the investigator consider necessary to perform the treatment
      switch and patients give their informed consent to participate in the study. All patients
      will sign the Informed consent before starting the data collection.

      The duration of the study will be 12 months of follow-up after switching (visit 0): month 1
      (visit 1), month 3 (visit 2), month 6 (visit 3) and month 12 (visit 4). Moreover, the
      clinical data of the patients recorded previous the index data will be collected in order to
      ensure that these patients were on an SGA monotherapy for a minimum of 3 months before
      switching to maximize potential weight gain and dysmetabolic problems that occurs early
      during the treatment. Preferably, patients have to be on treatment for a year or more before
      switching so that they have reached a weight plateau.
