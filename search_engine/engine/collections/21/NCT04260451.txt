      volume (VT) 5 ml/kg of predicted body weight, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) 5 cm
      H2O and plateau pressure (Pplat) less than 25 cmH2O.

      However, a high incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications is still being observed
      even with a protective ventilatory strategy.

      Driving pressure is [Pplat - PEEP] and is the pressure required for the alveolar opening.
      Static lung compliance (Cstat) is expressed as [VT / (Pplat - PEEP)]. Thus, driving pressure
      is also expressed as [VT / Cstat]. Driving pressure has an inverse relationship with Cstat
      and orthodromic relationship with VT according to this formula. High driving pressure
      indicates poor lung condition with decreased lung compliance.

      Thus, investigator try to prove that driving pressure limited ventilation is superior in
      preventing postoperative pulmonary complications to existing protective ventilation in large
      scale multicenter study.

      Recruit maneuver perform all group after intubation (stepwise increase of positive end
      expiratory pressure 5,10,15 cmH2O with tidal volume 5mL/kg).

      The control arm receives existing conventional protective ventilation with tidal volume of
      5mL/kg of ideal body weight and PEEP of 5cmH2O during one-lung ventilation.

      The driving pressure arm receives driving pressure limited ventilation with tidal volume of
      5mL/kg of ideal body weight and individualized PEEP. Individualized PEEP is adjusted to
      minimize driving pressure, it find through decremental PEEP titration from 10 to 2 cmH2O
      during one-lung ventilation.
