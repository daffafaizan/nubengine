      recruitment prospectively for all consecutive patients aged between 45 and 75 years receiving
      a new diagnosis of diabetes, according to the criteria established by the American Diabetes
      Association (ADA) (fasting glucose greater than or equal 126 mg / dl, or random blood glucose
      greater than or equal to 200 mg / dl, or glycated hemoglobin greater than or equal to 6.25%).
      The recruitment will take place at the Sant'Andrea Hospital. The suitability of a subject to
      be included in the study will be evaluated by medical history, physical examination and any
      further investigations carried out by a medical researcher of the team, according to the
      inclusion and exclusion criteria. The research team will be multidisciplinary, translational,
      composed of medical specialists belonging to the departments of General Surgery, Internal
      Medicine, Diabetology and Occupational Medicine. An informed consent will be mandatory for
      the recruitment in the study. At recruitment Adrenomedullin serum levels will be recorded
      along with every relevant clinical and laboratory data. An annual telephone follow-up will be
      applied and if necessary the patient will benefit of an outpatient examination. A sample size
      of 440 patients will achieve 80% power to detect a statistically significant difference. The
      3 years clinical follow-up will allow the detection of symptoms and signs that could be
      related to the presence of a pancreatic mass (jaundice, pain, weight loss), further
      investigations will follow in such cases to confirm Pancreatic cancer diagnosis and proceed
      to the treatment.
