      cognitive impairment for participation in this project. The patients will be given Bluetooth
      devices appropriate for their condition and will be trained to use SymTrend and Apple Health
      software. They will use the software and devices for three months; will receive messages
      throughout from the system and/or a research coordinator about their progress, with
      encouragement and strategies to fully manage their symptoms; and their neurologist will be in
      communication with them about the progress charts and will adjust their care on the basis of
      this real-time data.
