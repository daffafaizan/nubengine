      of acute stroke patients with AF under different anticoagulation schemes before the index
      stroke.

      The investigators will address the following aims and objectives:

        1. Describing emergency management of stroke patients (IS and ICH) with AF in clinical
           routine including early diagnostic, therapeutic and preventive procedures and assessing
           variations in emergency management of patients with AF by anticoagulation schemes pre
           stroke.

        2. Identifying variations in risk of early complications (e.g. symptomatic secondary
           intracerebral haemorrhage in ischemic stroke patients) with AF by different
           anticoagulation schemes pre stroke.

        3. Determining factors influencing outcome of stroke patients with AF at three months and
           clarifying the potential influence of different anticoagulation schemes pre stroke.

      The registry consists of 2 separate substudies that cover two different patient cohorts:
      ischemic stroke and intracerebral hemorrhage.

      The study will collect information from prospectively enrolling Neurology departments with
      certified stroke units across Germany.

      The principal investigator, Prof. Dr. med. Roland Veltkamp, is affiliated with Imperial
      College London, UK, and Heidelberg University Hospital, Germany.
