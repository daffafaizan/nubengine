      STI-related cancers) reduce human performance and undermine military readiness. Service
      members face unique challenges to maintaining SRH during their military service. HRSBs (e.g.,
      multiple sexual partners, unprotected sexual behavior) offer potential intervention targets
      to improve SRH. Electronic-health interventions are cost-effective and dynamic, and have the
      potential to reach millions of users as part of an overall strategy for individual behavior
      and systems change. In civilian populations, e-health interventions have demonstrated success
      in reducing HRSBs. However, effective HRSB-prevention interventions must consider the
      specific values, mission, and context of military populations and settings. The MOST
      framework is used to develop highly effective, efficient, and economic behavioral
      interventions that is particularly well suited to be used in this context.

      This project aims to address this problem by delivering an optimized app-based prevention
      intervention package ready for evaluation via a subsequent randomized controlled trial (RCT).
      The specific purpose of this project is to determine which component(s) should be included in
      the packaged app-based intervention Mission Wellness for US service members based on their
      effects on the outcomes of interest (i.e., improved knowledge, motivation, and behavior
      skills related to SRH and reduced HRSBs) in no more than 25 minutes of content. The
      components tested in the factorial CSEs include: Narratives; Skills; Scenarios; Future; and
      Risk. Each component has two levels: "on" (included) or "off" (not included). Main and
      interaction effects of components will be measured to determine the components constituting
      the packaged intervention.
