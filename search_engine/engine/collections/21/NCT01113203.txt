      hemodynamic and neural determinators in elderly, 24 healthy normotensive older subjects were
      randomly divided into 2 groups: trained and control. The trained group was submitted a
      progressive high-intensity resistance training. Before and after 16 weeks, as well as, before
      and after the one training session, blood pressure (clinic and ambulatory), cardiac output
      (CO2 rebreathing), and autonomic modulation (spectral analysis of heart rate and blood
      pressure variabilities) were measured
