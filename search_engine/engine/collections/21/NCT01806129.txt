      programming (Didactics, Engendering Reproductive Health Within Oncologic Survivorship [EROS]
      Reproductive Health Assessment and EROS Trial Algorithm) among reproductive aged women
      (18-55) with cancer. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the degree of discrepancy between
      patients and their clinicians in estimates of significance of the reproductive health goals
      for the patient. II. To evaluate baseline and follow-up reproductive health assessments for
      trends in reproductive health choices relating to oncofertility, oncocontraception and
      pregnancy over the 5 year study period. III. To identify clinical and demographic factors
      that predict the adequacy of reproductive health care management. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To
      perform a longitudinal study following endocrine markers of fertility in a cohort of the
      first 200 registered EROS trial patients who agree to participate. II. To perform a
      longitudinal study of sexual function using the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement
      Information System (PROMIS) sexual function survey in all subjects participating in the EROS
      Trial. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms. ARM A: Patients undergo usual
      standard practice related to reproductive health. ARM B: Patients undergo reproductive health
      program comprising didactics, reproductive health assessment and navigating algorithm, and
      network development. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up
      periodically.
