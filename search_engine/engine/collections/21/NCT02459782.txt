      procedures. It is a blind technique which is traditionally carried out by inserting a needle
      in the infero-lateral aspect of the orbit below the globe and injecting a volume of 8 - 12 mL
      of local anesthetic in the periorbital space. The goal of this inejction is to achieve
      akinesia and anesthesia of the eye sufficient for surgery. The technique has a relatively
      high failure rate of up to 30%. A failure or insufficient block requires a second or rarely a
      third peribulbar injection to achieve success. Ultrasound can be used to guide needles in the
      human body and has been successfully used in many anatomic locations for anaesthesia. This
      study will assess whether ultrasound can guide the block needle in ophthalmic anesthesia to
      deliver local anesthetic via a single entry into two discrete locations within the
      periorbital space - the first in the infero-lateral quadrant and the second in the
      infero-medial quadrant. If this can be done the investigators may achieve a higher success
      rate for this block with a lower volume potentially improving the quality of the block and
      its safety.
