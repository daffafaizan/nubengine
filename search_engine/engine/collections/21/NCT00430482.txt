    
      This study study is designed to test further the efficacy of Cognitive-Behavior Therapy for
      Interoceptive Cues (CBT-IC - a treatment with a central focus on enhancing a patient's
      tolerance to the myriad forms of distress-sadness, boredom, anxiety, withdrawal sensations,
      etc.-that are linked to the stressful lives of drug-dependent individuals, and breaking the
      link between these emotional cues and drug-related attempts to avoid emotional distress) for
      intervening with chronically-stressed and treatment-resistant opiate-dependent outpatients.
      Features of this study of particular relevance to to RFA DA-04-001 include: (1) a focus on
      opiate-dependent patients undergoing chronic stress; (2) a model for the way in which chronic
      stress translates into chronic drug use; (2) a focus on the way in which stress-related
      symptoms serve as trigger for drug use; (3) a focus on both mediators and moderators of
      treatment that will inform treatment-matching efforts, including a focus on gender
      differences and emotional avoidance/distress intolerance; and (4) the examination of
      treatment outcome in a Stage II treatment trial.
