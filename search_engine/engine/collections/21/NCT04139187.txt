      power and strength exercises on lower extremity biomechanics in healthy individuals.

      The sample size was calculated with G*Power software using the ANOVA: Repeated measures,
      within-between interaction, 90% power, alpha 0.05, and 30% drop-out. Data from the tuck jump
      test (knee flexion range) by Makaruk (2014) were considered for this calculation with effect
      size 0.46. Thus, a total of 32 individuals (16 per group) is required for this study. To
      ensure the proper simple size, after collecting the first five participants per group, the
      sample size will be checked again.

      The participants will be randomized in experimental and no intervention groups inside each
      risk profile group. Randomization ratio will be 1:1 and interventions will last 10 weeks,
      with two weekly sessions for the exercise arms.

      The outcomes will include functional clinical tests, kinematic and kinetic variables during
      landing tasks, and strength of knee and hip muscles.

      The data analysis will be performed by intention to treat and per protocol. Generalized
      estimating equations will be used to identify interaction effects of groups and time followed
      by Bonferroni post-hoc. When effect are found, effect size will be estimated. Missing data
      will be estimate by statistical analysis.
