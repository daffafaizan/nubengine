    
      This is a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, active-treatment-controlled, three-arm,
      parallel study of chronic treatment with infliximab. This study will determine whether
      infliximab, at two different doses (3 mg/kg or 6 mg/kg) in combination with methotrexate
      (MTX), reduces the signs and symptoms (such as joint pain, swelling and stiffness) of
      rheumatoid arthritis. The study will also compare their effect on slowing down the joint
      damage associated with rheumatoid arthritis. Additional information on the safety of
      infliximab treatment will be obtained. The study will last for about 1 year. Patients will
      receive methotrexate and total of eight intravenous infusions of the study medication
      (Infliximab or placebo) spaced out over the first year. After the final infusion of study
      medication, several follow-up visits are to be made. Patients will receive methotrexate
      (start at 7.5mg/wk, increased to 20mg/wk by week8) and intravenous infusions of the study
      medication (Infliximab 3 or 6mg/kg, or placebo) at week 0, 2, and 6, and every 8 weeks
      thereafter through week 46.
