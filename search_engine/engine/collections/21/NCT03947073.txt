      rise. Diet and exercise can effectively control blood sugar levels in 70-85% of women
      diagnosed with gestational diabetes according to the American Diabetes Association. At the
      investigator's institution, only 50-54% of women with this diagnosis effectively reach the
      target blood sugar levels with diet and exercise alone. This has become a more commonly seen
      problem throughout the US. Those that fail to achieve target blood sugar levels require
      medication and have higher risks of poor maternal and neonatal outcomes. Studies have shown
      that an increase in education can increase compliance to diet and education. Specifically,
      media based education that are interactive may more effectively lead to changes in a person's
      behavior.
