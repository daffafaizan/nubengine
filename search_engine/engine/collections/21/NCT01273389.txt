    
      This is a multicenter (study conducted at multiple sites), randomized (the study medication
      is assigned by chance), double-blind (neither investigator nor the patient knows the
      treatment that the patient receives), placebo-controlled (an inactive substance that is
      compared with the study medication to test whether the study medication has a real effect in
      clinical study), parallel group (each group of patients will be treated at the same time)
      study of CNTO 136 in patients with active LN. The study consists of 3 phases, ie, the
      screening phase (approximately 8 weeks prior randomization), treatment phase (24 weeks), and
      the follow up phase (through week 40). An 8 week run-in period will be used to establish the
      stability of baseline renal parameters prior to randomization and the first study medication.
      The eligible patients will be randomly assigned in a 5:1 ratio to receive 1 of 2 treatment
      groups in the treatment phase: Group 1: CNTO 136 10 mg/kg intravenous (IV), at Weeks 0, 4, 8,
      12, 16, 20, 24; and Group 2: Placebo infusion, IV, at Weeks 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24.
      Patients' medication regimen for LN may be adjusted from the Week 24 visit and afterwards.
      Safety evaluations for adverse events, infections, clinical laboratory tests,
      electrocardiogram, vital signs, physical examination and skin evaluations will be performed
      throughout the study. The follow up phase or the end of study will be the Week 40 visit for
      the last patient randomized, or, in the event that the last patient randomized withdraws from
      the study early, the end of study is defined as the date of the last visit of the last
      patient participating in the study.
