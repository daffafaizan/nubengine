      sample group specified in the Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICU) in a private hospital that
      has other branches in Istanbul.

      During the data collection process, two methods will be applied to preterm infants during
      diaper change.

      In the control group of the study, diaper change will be performed after the legs of the
      babies are brought to extension, and in the experimental group, the diaper change will be
      performed after the legs of the babies are brought closer to the abdomen by maintaining their
      flexion. Data on the babies' heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation and comfort
      level will be collected using the Premature Infant Comfort Scale before, during, immediately
      after and 3 minutes after the procedure.

      The researchers will collect the data by using a form that questions individual
      characteristics and includes records of heart rate, respiratory rate and oxygen saturation
      and Premature Infant Comfort.
