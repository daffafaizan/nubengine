      post-natally. Therefore, we plan to review the outcomes in newborns with genetic
      abnormalities after cardiac surgery compared to those newborns without genetic abnormalities
      after cardiac surgery.

      We wish to examine the outcomes following cardiac surgery in newborns with genetic
      abnormalities compared to those newborns without genetic abnormalities. We will compare
      morality rates and co-morbidities in each group.

      We will retrospectively review the cardiac surgical database and patient medical records for
      all neonates (newborns < 30 days of age) who underwent cardiac surgery from January 1, 2002
      through May 31, 2006 at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta. We plan to collect data on
      approximately 1000 patients including date of birth, age, weight, gestation, prenatal
      diagnosis, genetic abnormality, cardiac defect, surgery, operative details, pre-op and
      post-op complications, length of time on ventilator, hospital stay and mortality for these
      patients.

      We will review the patient outcome data available after their initial surgery through May 31,
      2006. No patients will be contacted.
