      CI, stroke volume and total peripheral resistance are performed using the Clearsight
      non-invasive cardiac output monitoring system.. Measurements will be taken at baseline, after
      1,2 and 5 minutes of 15L O2/min, and then after another 2 and 5 minutes of flush rate oxygen
      and during the subsequent sedation.
