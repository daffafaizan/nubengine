      likelihood of family stressors, agitation, sleep disturbances, and negative behavioral
      changes. Post-procedural pain has been shown to negatively impact future interactions with
      healthcare personnel. The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility of using
      guided mindfulness meditation through a non-invasive device (virtual reality headset) to
      manage pre-procedure anxiety and post-procedure anxiety and pain.
