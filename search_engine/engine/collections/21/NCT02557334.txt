      the effect of freeze dried strawberry powder supplementation on LDL-C and vascular health.
      Research participants will be overweight or obese (BMI 25-39 kg/m^2) but otherwise healthy
      adults with moderately elevated LDL-C (>116 mg/dL or >3.0mmol/L), blood pressure <160/100
      mmHg, total cholesterol below 273 mg/dL for men and below 284 mg/dL for women, and
      triglycerides below 350 mg/dL. Subjects will be randomly assigned to three supplementation
      periods: 1) low dose freeze dried strawberry powder (13 g/d); 2) high dose freeze dried
      strawberry powder (40 g/d); and 3) a placebo powder. Each powder will be provided for 4-6
      weeks, separated by a 2-week washout period between treatment periods. Baseline and endpoint
      testing will include blood collection and vascular testing.
