      determine the rate at which neuronal repair can occur, and are associated with differences in
      expression of neurodegenerative processes, including traumatic brain injury. It is proposed
      that the accuracy of prediction of outcome after head injury will be significantly increased
      by inclusion of APOE genotype alone, or in combination with other variables such as severity
      of head injury, cognitive, electroencephalographic or neuroradiologic measures, or treatment
      strategies.
