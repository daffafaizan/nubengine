      to characterise simultaneously the main enzymes and transporters involved in drug metabolism.
      The doses of substrates administered will first assessed in terms of safety and their
      appropriateness for determination of pharmacokinetic parameters. Ten volunteers will be used,
      this number having been defined in view of the aims of this proof-of-concept pilot
      study,ie,safety and determination of pharmacokinetic parameters. The number was not the
      result of statistical calculation.
