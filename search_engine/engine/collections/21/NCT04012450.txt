      available in the delivery room including regional and systemic.

      After receiving the patient informed consent for regional anesthesia (epidural or
      spinal-epidural), patients will be offered to participate in our study.

      After receiving the patients' informed consent for participating in the study, patients will
      be randomized to either the epidural anesthesia group or to the spinal-epidural anesthesia
      group.

      A doppler ultrasound will be performed on each patient prior to and following the regional
      anesthesia, the flow in the uterine artery, umbilical artery, and the middle cerebral artery
      of the fetus will be recorded.

      Demographic and obstetrical information will be collected from the patients' electronic
      files.
