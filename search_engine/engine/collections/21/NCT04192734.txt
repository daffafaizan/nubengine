    
      Ramucirumab plus paclitaxel combination therapy has shown a survival benefit in patients with
      previously treated gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma. However, the
      real-world efficacy and safety of ramucirumab plus paclitaxel combination therapy in Korea
      have only been evaluated once outside of controlled clinical trials. Therefore, this large
      multicenter retrospective analysis was designed to evaluate the real-world efficacy and
      safety of ramucirumab plus paclitaxel under the Korea National Health Insurance System. The
      medical records in approximately 1400 patients with locally-advanced unresectable or
      metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma, who have received ramucirumab
      plus paclitaxel combination therapy between May 2018 and December 2018 will be collected.
      Eligibility criteria included age â‰¥ 19 years, histologically or cytologically confirmed
      gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma, locally advanced unresectable or
      metastatic disease, and previous first-line systemic therapy including fluoropyrimidine and
      platinum. Efficacy was evaluated by overall survival, progression free survival, time to
      progression, objective response rate, disease control rate, and duration of response. Safety
      was evaluated by hematologic or non-non hematologic toxicities and adverse events of special
      interest with ramucirumab plus paclitaxel combination therapy.
