      often even in one's own family, the feeling of a lack of identity and connection with one's
      own body and the experienced discrimination all lead to a considerable degree of suffering in
      TG and elevated levels of psychiatric symptoms as well as a reduced quality of life. Many TG
      people seek hormonal treatment. Physical and psychological consequences of this treatment
      still need to be revealed.

      To this aim, the investigators recruit TG people (MTF and FTM) who intend to seek
      gender-affirming hormonal treatment. Before treatment, various measures will be taken,
      including a semi-structured interview to assess psychiatric symptoms, self-ratings,
      behavioral experiments (to assess male/female face recognition and male/female voice
      perception), while functional MRI scans are taken to assess respective neural correlates. In
      addition, resting-state scans as well as anatomic images will be taken.

      Six months after having started gender-affirming hormone treatment, participants will be
      reinvited to undergo the same study protocol.

      In between testing sessions, patients will perform several online surveys regarding their
      psychological well-being.
