    
      This open label two-step phase II study is designed to determine the safety and efficacy of
      epigenetic priming with 5-Azacytidine immediately prior to reduced intensity conditioning for
      an in vivo T-cell depleted hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for high risk myeloid
      malignancies in complete remission (CR).

      Subjects will be given a five day course of subcutaneous 5-azacytidine, followed by a reduced
      intensity conditioning regimen of fludarabine, melphalan and total body irradiation (TBI)
      prior to an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from a related or unrelated
      Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) matched donor.

      The effect of 5-azacytidine on global gene methylation will be assessed. Evaluations for
      safety, in particular for graft failure, transplant related mortality and acute graft versus
      host disease will be made on a weekly basis. Efficacy, as defined by disease free survival,
      will be evaluated with a bone marrow biopsy at the standard time points, which are one-,
      three-, six-, and twelve-months after transplant and upon clinical suspicion within regular
      follow-up visits - weekly for the first 3 months, then biweekly for 3 months, then monthly
      until one-year post-stem cell transplant. Thereafter, unless otherwise dictated by the
      clinical scenario, the follow up visits will be every 3 months.
