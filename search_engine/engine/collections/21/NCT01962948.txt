      I. Determine the recommended Phase II dose of ganetespib with weekly paclitaxel. (Phase I)
      II. Probability of surviving progression-free for at least 6 months after initiating therapy.
      (Phase II) III. Clinical response rate (partial and complete responses as defined by Response
      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] 1.1 criteria). (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the nature and degree of toxicity of ganetespib and weekly paclitaxel in this
      cohort of patients as measured by the frequency and severity of adverse reactions. (Phase I)
      II. Determine the nature and degree of toxicity of ganetespib and weekly paclitaxel in this
      cohort of patients as measured by the frequency and severity of adverse reactions
      encountered. (Phase II) III. Duration of progression-free survival. (Phase II)

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of ganetespib followed by a phase II study.

      Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 1 hour and ganetespib IV over 1 hour on
      days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years,
      every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.
