      carried out in a portion of breast cancer patients. However, the role of NSM is still
      controversial, mainly because of concern about the oncologic safety of the nipple-areola
      complex (NAC). Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Giving
      radiation during surgery followed by external-beam radiation to the entire breast may kill
      more tumor cells.INTRABEAM (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) is the most widely used mobile
      intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) device to date. This study aims to broaden the application
      of the INTRABEAM system for breast cancer, investigating the feasibility of INTRABEAM IORT in
      NSM with breast reconstruction.
