      I. To assess the activity of copanlisib (BAY 80-6946) in patients with persistent or
      recurrent endometrial carcinoma harboring phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase,
      catalytic subunit alpha (PI3KCA) hotspot mutations with the frequency of objective response.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate 6 month progression-free survival (PFS) and median PFS. II. To estimate the
      distribution of the duration of overall survival (OS). III. To assess the safety profile of
      copanlisib in endometrial cancer patients.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To systematically evaluate by sequencing the site (i.e., exome) and characteristics of
      PIK3CA mutations in endometrial cancer patients and correlate such mutations to overall
      response (OR), PFS, and OS in patients treated with copanlisib.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive copanlisib intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for 3 years.
