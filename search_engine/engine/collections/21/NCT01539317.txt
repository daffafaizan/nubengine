      gynecological exam at the screening visit to determine the severity of pain associated with
      uncomfortable intercourse. A touch test using Q-tips will be used during screening exam so
      subjects can report pain during application of both study drug and placebo. Subjects will
      also report pain during tampon test. A sample of vaginal cells and liquid will be obtained at
      screening visit so that PI can rule out possible infection, disease, or disorders. PI will
      also show subject the area of the vestibule in a mirror so that subject can apply study drug
      at home properly. Subjects will fill out 4 questionnaires about medical and health history,
      cancer history, pain, and distress and sexual activity. Subject will be given a supply of
      either study drug or placebo to take home. The first visit will last approximately 2 hours.

      Subjects will return for a second visit after 4 weeks and a third visit after 8 weeks for
      diary review, questionnaires, and examination. The second and third visit examinations will
      be repeats of the examination done at the first visit, but there will be no comparison with
      placebo, the PI will use only study drug during the touch test. The second and third visits
      will last approximately 1 hour.

      Subjects will fill out questionnaires throughout study participation. Topics include; medical
      and health history, cancer history, pain, distress and sexual activity. Subjects will also
      fill out a diary that charts tampon test completed from home, sexual activity performed, pain
      levels and study drug application days.
