        -  To analyze the phenotype and the function of the tumor-induced suppressive network
           associated with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the head and neck in patients with SCC
           of the oral cavity or oropharynx treated with tadalafil followed by definitive surgical
           resection.

        -  To analyze the immune response before and after treatment with tadalafil to determine
           whether or not tadalafil treatment modulates in these patients.

        -  To compare two doses of tadalafil to determine whether there are measurable differences
           in immune response in these patients.

        -  To analyze treatment-related side effects of tadalafil at each of the two doses tested
           in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral tadalafil once daily on days 1-20 in the absence of
           unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral tadalafil (at a higher dose than in arm I) once daily on
           days 1-20 in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm III: Patients receive oral placebo once daily on days 1-20 in the absence of
           unacceptable toxicity.

      All patients undergo scheduled definitive surgical resection on day 23.

      Patients undergo blood sample collection at baseline, on day 20, and at 6 weeks after
      surgical resection for correlative laboratory studies. Patients also undergo tumor tissue
      sample collection at baseline and at the time of surgical resection. Samples are analyzed for
      immunological markers by Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and Immunohistochemistry
      (IHC).

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for at least 3 years.
