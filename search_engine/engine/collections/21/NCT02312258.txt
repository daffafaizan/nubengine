      tested to slow PD and improve overall survival in people who have NDMM who have had a major
      positive response to initial therapy and have not undergone SCT. This study will look at the
      effect of ixazomib citrate has on the length of time that participants are free of PD and
      their overall survival.

      The study will enroll approximately 700 participants. Participants will be randomly assigned
      (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the two treatment groups-which will remain
      undisclosed to the participant and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent
      medical need):

        -  Ixazomib citrate 3 mg

        -  Placebo (dummy inactive pill) - this is a capsule that looks like the study drug but has
           no active ingredient

      All participants will be asked to take one capsule on Days 1, 8 and 15 of each 28-day cycle,
      for up to 26 cycles.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted worldwide. The overall time to participate in this
      study is approximately 76 to 104 months. Participants will make 28 visits to the clinic
      during the treatment period and will continue to make follow-up visits every 4 weeks until
      the next line of therapy begins. Participants will also be contacted by telephone every 12
      weeks after last treatment visit for a follow-up assessment.
