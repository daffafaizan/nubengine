      difficulties in managing the resulting severe hemodynamic instability. The patients who are
      accepted to be listed for liver transplantation undergo evaluation of their cardiac function
      and are usually relatively stable with, at most, minimal cardiac problems (a requirement for
      inclusion in the liver transplantation program). Additionally, we observe completely
      unpredictable hemodynamic reactions during and after the graft reperfusion, requiring vastly
      different doses of catecholamine in order to maintain an acceptable level of perfusion
      pressure. The adverse cardiopulmonary effects are thought to be associated with the
      preexisting level of various proinflammatory factors, including cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-6)
      and proinflammatory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2) produced in the graft as a reaction to the
      conservation solution and cold temperature (necessary to keep the organ capable for
      transplantation) and released into the bloodstream during reperfusion. The massive release of
      cytokines after unclamping of the graft may be responsible for negative inotropy and
      significant vasodilatation.
