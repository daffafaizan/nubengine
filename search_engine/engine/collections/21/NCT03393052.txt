      femoral access. Based on the literature, a randomized study sample of a total of 150 patients
      was calculated with assumptions of 30 +/- 10-minute duration of the procedure, alpha = 5%,
      beta = 10% (power 90%) and non-inferiority limit Î” = 5 minutes. The primary endpoint of the
      study is the time it takes after placing the sheath at the initial puncture site until the
      completion of the diagnostic procedure (Net procedure time). Secondary endpoints include
      total time of the procedure, fluoroscopy time, total patient exposure radiation, amount of
      contrast used, possible vascular complications, major cardiovascular events and need for
      crossover access site.
