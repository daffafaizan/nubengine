      "Healthy Community Center". This is a program review of a program which will be planned in a
      community based participatory level, based on the socioecological model. A pre-post design
      will be utilized where all community centers in the study will be exposed to the intervention
      components. All community centers (n=15) will be evaluated by pre intervention questionairres
      and focus groups of community center Managers and health promotion professionals. The network
      will be designed upon the foundation of the "Healthy Cities network" with adaptations made in
      the process of participatory planning and designing according to the results of the focus
      groups. Intervention will include a a 12 week training session for designated "Health
      Coordinator" from each community center, Planning and implementing a personolized Health
      promtion Project in each community centre .It is hypothesized that community centers who will
      receive the intervention will have better skills at building sustainable participatory
      effective health promotion projects and will provide a healthy setting for the community
      within its juristiction.
