      shown that, in patients with intact atrioventricular (AV) conduction, unnecessary chronic
      right ventricular (RV) pacing can cause a variety of detrimental effects, including atrial
      fibrillation (AF), left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, and congestive heart failure (CHF).
      These effects are believed to result from the mechanical dyssynchrony and ventricular chamber
      dysfunction that occurs with chronic, single-site, apical ventricular stimulation.

      Therefore a new pacing modality, Managed Ventricular Pacing (MVP), was designed to give
      preference to natural heart activity by minimizing unnecessary right ventricular pacing. This
      is accomplished by automatically switching between single chamber atrial and dual-chamber
      pacing based on specific patient needs.

      MVP is an atrial-based dual-chamber pacing mode that provides functional AAI/R pacing with
      ventricular monitoring and back-up DDD/R pacing only as needed during episodes of AV block.

      The reversibility of the detrimental effects caused by ventricular pacing has been initially
      investigated in small patient populations with short pacing durations in AAI and needs
      further investigation.
