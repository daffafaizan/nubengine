      echocardiograms in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic drgs (APDs). The primary
      comparisons of interest are olanzapine (no QTc prolongation) to ziprasidone (QTc
      prolongation) and thioridazine (QTc prolongation) as well as ziprasidone (possibly low TdP
      risk) to thioridazine (TdP risk). Secondary comparisons will be among all APDs available. In
      a previously approved study, conventional 24 hr Holter electrocardiograms were recorded from
      a total of 78 subjects during the course of treatment with psychotropic medications and
      without medication (in the case of normals and unmedicated patients). These recordings will
      be analyzed to yield Tpe, QTc and heart rate, and other measures. Data from additional
      patients is needed, therefore this study will include only patients currently treated with
      Mellaril (thioridazine), Risperdal (risperidone) and Seroquel (quetiapine).
