      radial arterial punctures. They were assigned to receive either the insulin or the standard
      needle as the first puncture using block randomisation. The primary outcome was the pain
      score measured on a 100mm visual analogue scale (VAS) and the secondary outcomes were
      procedural complications and rate of haemolysis.
