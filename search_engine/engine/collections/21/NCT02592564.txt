      demonstrated to target and affect the brain´s fear network, typically neural response in the
      amygdala ameliorate after effective psychological treatment. Commonly, neuroimaging studies
      have performed brain imaging at pre- and post-intervention, yet, longitudinal study designs
      including several repeated measures of neural response over the course of treatment are
      currently missing in anxiety disorder. In the current study the participants will undergo
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at four occasion. a) Twice before treatment initiation (9
      weeks apart), b) at week 4 (during treatment), c) and directly after treatment termination.

      Biological aging can be quantified at the individual cell level by measuring telomere length
      in peripheral immune cells (leukocytes). Telomeres are located at the end of each chromosome
      and protect the genetic material during cell division. Telomerase is an enzyme that can
      lengthen telomeres, and have in this way a protective function against accelerated cellular
      aging. Variations in these bodily processes have been associated with psychiatric
      manifestations such as anxiety and depression. In the current study the participant´s
      telomere length and telomerase activity will be assessed at three occasion. a) Twice before
      treatment initiation (9 weeks apart), and b) directly after treatment termination.
