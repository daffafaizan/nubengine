      programme. The training protocol was built based on undulatory load manipulation 3:1, which
      was suggested to be effective to prevent overtraining and stress due to oscillations between
      volume/intensity. Throughout the study all participants took 4 identical-looking capsules per
      day (2 in the morning and 2 in the evening) containing either omega-3 fatty acids or medium
      chain triglycerides as placebo in total amount of 4g of fat per day. Before starting and at
      the end of the 12-week cycle, the runners performed an increasing intensity treadmill test
      where oxygen uptake and VO2 peak were assessed. Additionally, blood was collected to
      determine the concentrations of selected proteins (including eNOS, irisin, adiponectin) that
      may be associated with potential changes in participants' oxygen uptake during the treadmill
      test.
