      algorithms identifies elderly patients, who benefit from combined nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine
      therapy. The project uses a CGA, which includes various tests and scoring systems, to
      stratify patients as "GO-GO", "SLOW-GO" or "FRAIL" patients. Depending on test results
      patients receive chemotherapy (GO-GO group: nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine; SLOW-GO group:
      gemcitabine monotherapy) or best supportive care (FRAIL group). After the first cycle of
      chemotherapy (4 weeks) a subsequent CGA and a safety assessment will be performed to assign
      patients to their definite treatment arm. The primary objective is that CGA-stratified
      patients do not decline in their CGA performance in response to chemotherapy measured as a
      loss of five points or less in the Barthel's ADL (ADL1 vs. ADL2 during core CGA assessment).
