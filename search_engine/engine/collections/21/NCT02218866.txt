      in the toes, then progressing slowly up the leg. Neuropathy often causes pain, numbness, and
      weakness if the feet and can lead to reduced mobility, foot ulcers, and even amputation. The
      most common cause is diabetes, but work at the University of Utah finds that prediabetes and
      other consequences of obesity, including abnormal cholesterol levels, may be associated with
      neuropathy. Research has shown that these risk factors may damage nerves and interfere with
      the ability of nerves to grow back after an injury.

      This study aims to

        1. characterize peripheral nerve function and cutaneous nerve structure in obese bariatric
           surgery candidates;

        2. evaluate peripheral nerve regeneration capacity (and other nerve function measures)
           before and after bariatric surgery in obese subjects with no or mild neuropathy;

        3. examine the relationship between ectopic lipid accumulation, lipotoxic mediators,
           neuropathy and regeneration capacity in surgical candidates before and one year after
           surgery.
