      bladder dysfunction were divided equally into two groups randomly; Group A received
      biofeedback training (behavioral therapy) while group B received interferential training.
      Both groups were assessed by urodynamics for detrusor pressure and maximum flow rate before
      and after eight weeks of behavioral therapy and interferential training.

      Data analysis was managed using SPSS for windows, version 22 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL). The
      current test involved two independent variables. The first one was the (tested group);
      between subject factors which had two levels (group A received behavioral therapy and group B
      who received IF ) .The second one was the (measuring periods); within subject factor which
      had two levels (pre, post). In addition, this test involved two tested dependent variables
      (detrusor pressure and maximum flow rate ) .T independent and dependent tests were used to
      compare between and within groups respectively. Data was considered statistically significant
      when P < .05
