      to moderately stressed, healthy adults in a parallel groups fashion in this randomised
      placebo controlled trial. Oscillatory brain activity (EEG) during rest and performance on
      cognitive tasks of attention will be examined after treatment intake under conditions of
      acute laboratory stress. The effects of treatments on stress responses (cardiovascular,
      subjective and cortisol responses) will also be assessed.
