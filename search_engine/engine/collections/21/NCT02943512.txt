    
      Subjects who are implanted with a clinically indicated implanted cardiac pacemaker or
      defibrillator will be randomized to standard of care (next day discharge) versus same day
      discharge post implant. Both groups will under go standard of care assessments prior to
      discharge. The same day discharge group will receive a phone call the next day to assess for
      events and will transmit device data electronically. Both groups will be seen 10 - 14 days
      after implant for further evaluation.

      The subjects will also complete questionnaires regarding their knowledge of self care and
      satisfaction with care.
