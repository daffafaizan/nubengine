      effects of transdermal scopolamine vs. placebo on simulated ship navigation performance under
      conditions of heavy seas. We hypothesize that mariners will experience a greater decrement in
      navigational performance in the placebo condition vs. transdermal scopolamine, when faced
      with simulated heavy seas. Study staff will apply the transdermal scopolamine patch or
      placebo patch, 8 hours prior to performance assessment. Participants will surrender car keys
      and will agree stay on the Kalmar Maritime Campus until they are dismissed from the study. A
      study nurse and/or study physician will be on call from the time of patch application until
      study participants are dismissed from the study. Eight hours following patch application
      participants will perform navigation tasks, under stormy weather conditions, in the bridge
      simulation lab at Kalmar Maritime Academy. Participants will repeat the protocol one week
      later under the opposite dosing condition. This study will be conducted at the Kalmar
      Maritime Academy, Kalmar, Sweden.
