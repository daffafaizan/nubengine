        1. Describe foot posture in individuals with hemiplegia following stroke using a
           quantitative navicular drop test.

        2. Determine differences in people with normal, hypotonic, and hypertonic foot posture with
           regard to ankle range of motion, ankle strength, gait, and balance.

      This is an observational design study to describe relationships between the variables.
      Measurements will include both descriptive and quantitative measures.

      Thirty subjects with stroke will participate in one session of testing which will include:
      clinical assessment of foot posture using a descriptive classification system, quantitative
      measurement of navicular drop during standing, measurements of ankle range of motion, ankle
      strength, gait (lower extremity biomechanics and forceplate analysis), and static and dynamic
      balance. A chi-square test will be used to determine goodness of fit between classification
      with the descriptive system and the quantitative measurement. Independent one-way ANOVAs will
      be used to determine the mean differences in the foot posture groups for each of the
      dependent variables.
