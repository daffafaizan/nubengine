      protection for surgical procedures that buttress the stomach and other staple lines during
      roux-en-Y surgery. The study is designed as two separate patient groups. One will enroll
      patients into a group where linear staple lines are buttressed at the stomach. The second
      portion of the trial will enroll patients into a group where the circular staple line at the
      GJ and linear staple lines at the stomach are buttressed with PSD Veritas.
