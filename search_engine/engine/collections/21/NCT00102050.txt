      primary early stage indication of peripheral arterial disease (PAD). This trial is designed
      to assess the safety and efficacy of 4 mg and/or 8 mg NM-702 BID for 24 weeks to see if it
      improves peak walking time (PWT) more than placebo for the treatment of Intermittent
      Claudication.
