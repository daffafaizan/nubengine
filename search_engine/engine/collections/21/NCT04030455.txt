    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the clinical benefit rate (CBR) of patients with stage II or III larynx
      squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) after 2 cycles of pembrolizumab, cisplatin and docetaxel (PCD),
      and the pathologic complete response (pCR) rate after 4 cycles of PCD.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine safety and tolerability of PCD in patients with larynx SCC. II. To determine
      the laryngeal preservation rate (LPR) at 2 years in the overall population and in the
      subgroup who achieves a pCR.

      III. To determine the 2 year relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) in the
      overall population and in the subgroup who achieves a pCR.

      IV. To determine patient-reported outcomes (PROs) using M. D. Anderson Symptom Inventory-Head
      and Neck (MDASI-HN) and swallow function using Dynamic Imaging Grade of Swallowing Toxicity
      (DIGEST).

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess predictive tissue and blood-based biomarkers of benefit from PCD in larynx SCC.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive cisplatin intravenously (IV) over 1 hour, docetaxel IV over 1 hour (patients
      who develop significant adverse events to cisplatin treatment may receive carboplatin IV over
      1 hour instead), and pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21
      days for up to 4 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Patients who completely respond to the study drugs (the disease appears to go away) then
      receive pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1 for 4 additional cycles in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3 weeks, then every 6-12
      weeks for up to 2 years.
