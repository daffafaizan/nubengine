      nondemented older adults including individuals with Parkinson disease. Prior research
      suggests that NIR exposure may be neuroprotective and increases energy available to neurons.
      The current study will test whether age-related cognitive and mood changes in older adults
      and those with Parkinson disease will be affected by near infrared (NIR) stimulation.

      The study team will randomize older adults and those with Parkinson disease into treatment
      groups and evaluate neuroimaging and cognitive outcome measures, before and after an 12-week
      intervention involving transcranial and intranasal NIR. The protocol will involve both " lab"
      and " home-based" NIR stimulation. The overall hypothesis, drawn from previous literature, is
      that exposure to NIR stimulation will have positive effects on brain health and will result
      in better cognitive and mood performance.
