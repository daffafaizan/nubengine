      I. To define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of Combotox (deglycosylated ricin A
      chain-conjugated anti-CD19/anti-CD22 immunotoxins) when added to high-dose cytarabine during
      salvage therapy for adult patients with relapsed or refractory B-lineage acute lymphoblastic
      leukemia.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the efficacy of this regimen. II. To assess for the presence of a postulated
      CD34+/CD38-/low/CD19+ leukemic stem cell phenotype in the bone marrow at time of relapse and
      to assess its association with treatment outcome.

      III. To determine the development of human mouse or ricin antibodies (human anti-mouse
      antibodies [HAMA]/human anti-ricin antibodies [HARA]).

      IV. To determine the pharmacokinetic characteristics of Combotox. V. To evaluate the value of
      fractional excretion of sodium (FeNa) as early marker of toxicity.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of deglycosylated ricin A chain-conjugated
      anti-CD19/anti-CD22 immunotoxins.

      Patients receive high-dose cytarabine intravenously (IV) over 2-3 hours every 12 hours on
      days 1-3 and deglycosylated ricin A chain-conjugated anti-CD19/anti-CD22 immunotoxins IV over
      4 hours on days 8, 10, and 12. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 4 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 12 weeks.
