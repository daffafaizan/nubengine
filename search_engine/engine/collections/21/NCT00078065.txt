    
      This randomized Phase II clinical study is designed to examine the safety and efficacy of
      Xcellerated T CellsTM, an activated, autologous T cell product, in subjects with multiple
      myeloma. Subjects must have failed at least one, but no more than three, prior cytotoxic
      therapies prior to study registration and may not have relapsed or progressed within one year
      following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Patients will be randomized to treatment
      with either Xcellerated T Cells alone, or lymphoablative therapy with fludarabine followed by
      Xcellerated T Cells. Thirty subjects will be treated, with 15 patients in each arm. Patients
      will be followed for six months following treatment.
