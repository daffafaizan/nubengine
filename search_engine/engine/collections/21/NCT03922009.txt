      anxiety. which is It is normal to show obvious anxiety in patients undergoing surgery, but if
      the degree of anxiety is serious, it may lead Negative physiological manifestations, such as
      slow wound healing, increase the risk of infection and may affect the induction of anesthesia
      It requires more anesthesia dose during surgery, which hinders recovery time. Most studies
      have confirmed surgery Playing music in the room can alleviate the anxiety and pain of the
      patients, but the music preference is subjective and some people like it.

      There must be people who hate it, and the operating room is not a quiet space. There are many
      sound sources in the operating room., such as the sound of surgical instruments, the warning
      sound of physiological monitors, the voice of the staff, these It will be a source of anxiety
      for patients. Instrument noise averages up to 60 decibels, including neurosurgery,
      orthopedics It can even exceed 100 decibels. Foreign scholars believe that playing music at
      this time will only aggravate the noisy environment.The attention of the staff. Therefore, it
      is hoped that by using virtual reality to provide images and sounds during surgery, hijacking
      The patient's auditory, visual, and proprioception creates an immersive, distracting approach
      that reduces the cause of the ring Anxiety brought by the environment helps spinal anesthesia
      patients to reduce anxiety during surgery and increase psychological comfort To reduce the
      use of sedative drugs during surgery.
