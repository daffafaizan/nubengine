      million; prevalence in Italy: 750.000; incidence in Italy: 170.000), affecting 1-2% of
      overall population and accounting for a significant proportion of healthcare costs. Recurrent
      hospital admissions represent the majority of the disease-related cost. About 15-25% of
      patients with HF are diabetics: the presence of diabetes significantly worsens prognosis in
      patients with heart failure and increases the risk of death by 30% compared to subject
      without diabetes.

      The intensive control of glycemia during acute heart failure is an objective of primary
      importance, which can be obtained only with a proper strategy of patient management and with
      a considerable organizational effort. In a shared protocol aimed at a tight control of
      glycemia, the use of Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) is expected to allow an easier
      management of the patient and a more accurate implementation of the protocol.

      The main purpose of this study is to validate an intensive protocol of insulin infusion and
      subsequent subcutaneous insulin administration with the support of continuous glucose
      monitoring, in addition to reference finger-stick values.
