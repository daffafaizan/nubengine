      several autoimmune disorders including rheumatoid arthritis. BCD-089 is a novel fully human
      monoclonal antibody against the interleukin-6 receptor developed by JCS BIOCAD (Russia) which
      is now on the first step of clinical evaluation. BCD-089-1 study is the first-in-human
      clinical trial which is intended to evaluate tolerability, safety, pharmacokinetics,
      pharmacodynamics and immunogenicity of BCD-089 when used as a single step-by-step escalating
      subcutaneous dose in healthy male volunteers. During this study it is expected to determine
      diapason of safety doses of BCD-089 (incl. MTD) which thereafter can be evaluated in phase 2
      studies.
