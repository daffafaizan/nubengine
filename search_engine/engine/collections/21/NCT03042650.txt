      and smoke cigarettes. One-half of probation officers will be trained in the Intensive
      Referral Intervention (IRI) while one-half will deliver Standard Practice which is to
      encourage support group attendance. Research staff will assess fidelity to the IRI in trained
      probation officers. The investigators propose to enroll 150 probationers over a four month
      period and complete 3 and 6-month follow-up interviews to assess smoking and substance use
      measures.
