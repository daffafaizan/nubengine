      traumatic brain injury or stroke, can be improved using transcranial direct current
      stimulation (tDCS). tDCS is a non-invasive technique that applies a small amount of direct
      electrical current to the brain in order to temporarily alter brain processing. Adults with
      aphasia/alexia resulting from stroke or traumatic brain injury will undergo baseline
      behavioral testing of various language and cognitive functions. Subjects who are willing to
      undergo MRI evaluation will also be scanned. They will then receive five days of either real
      or sham tDCS with standardized speech-language therapy, under a double-blind randomized
      placebo-controlled design. Behavioral assessments, and MRIs for those participating in the
      MRI portion of the study, will be performed again at multiple time points after completing
      tDCS to assess for changes in these measures.
