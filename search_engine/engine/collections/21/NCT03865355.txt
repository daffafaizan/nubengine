      approach in the establishing diagnosis as well as an important prognostic factor in patients
      with glioma. The researches will assess the blood and CSF metabolic profile in patients with
      different types of gliomas as well as in patient without ones. This can help to find new
      biomarkers for low- and high-grade gliomas correlating with patient outcomes.

      Blood and CSF samples will be collected from patients with suspected newly diagnosed
      low-grade (I-II) or high-grade (III-IV) gliomas as well as from patients who have
      hospitalized for reconstructive surgery after craniofacial trauma. All samples will be
      collected before any surgical intervention and at various follow-up time points until
      progression or death. The results of the study are planned to be translated into the hospital
      setting as support to other diagnostics procedures and to the differential diagnosis between
      glioma grades.
