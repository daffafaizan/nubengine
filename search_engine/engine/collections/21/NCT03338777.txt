    
      This phase I clinical protocol is proposed to evaluate the safety of combined immunotherapy
      genetics in humans.

      This treatment combines the high local cytotoxicity of the suicide gene system (HSV thymidine
      kinase: HSVt k) / prodrug (ganciclovir: GCV) with the immunostimulation of interleukin2
      (hIL2) and immunoamplification of granulocyte and macrophage colony stimulating factor
      (hGMCSF) in the presence of tumor antigens.

      The proposed scheme consists in the periodic intra / peritumoral application of plasmid DNA
      complexes: cationic lipid (lipoplexes) containing the HSVtk gene, co-administered with the
      prodrug GCV, and subcutaneous injections of a vaccine (LGvax) produced with formolized
      extracts of allogeneic melanoma combined with lipoplexes carrying the hIL2 and hGMCSF genes.
