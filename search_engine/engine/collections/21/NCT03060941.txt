      increasing physical activity among breast cancer survivors. Individuals meeting
      inclusion/exclusion criteria will be randomized to one of sixteen intervention groups for the
      6 months. Intervention components will include print-based education, self-monitoring, Active
      Living counseling, supervised exercise sessions, and facility access. Blood samples will be
      collected at baseline. Assessments (anxiety, stress, sleep) and sample collection will also
      occur at 3 time points during the intervention (Weeks 13 and 25). Changes in physical
      activity will be assessed for each intervention group.
