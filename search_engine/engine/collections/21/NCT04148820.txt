      including aspirin, statins, ezetimibe, Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or beta
      blockers.

      These drugs are usually given at different timetables. Recent investigations, however, have
      demonstrated that adherence to medical treatment is significantly greater if a one daily
      strategy is adopted.

      Uncertainty about the optimal timing and clinical implications of administration of
      cardiovascular drugs still persists.

      The investigators will perform a pilot randomized trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety
      of a one daily administration of multiple drugs vs. twice daily administration.
