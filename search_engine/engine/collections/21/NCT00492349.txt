      measures include biomarkers and clinical symptoms and functions, and smoking cessation.
      Neurobiological and cognitive markers will be measured for short term (2 weeks) and
      longer-term (8 weeks). Current schizophrenia treatments are mostly ineffective against
      primary negative symptoms and the cognitive and information processing deficits associated
      with the disorder. Previous research has identified several neurophysiological deficits in
      schizophrenia that are enduring, frequently occurring before psychosis, and mark the disease
      liability. These schizophrenia endophenotypes provide important targets for novel treatment
      development as they represent the core deficits of the disorder. We hypothesize that
      sustained nicotinic and dopaminergic modulation by varenicline may ameliorate the core
      neurobiological deficits seen in schizophrenia patients, which would lead to subsequent
      clinical improvement. Neurobiological and neurocognitive markers and clinical and functional
      measures will be obtained to determine 1) short-term effect of varenicline on biomarkers; and
      2) longer-term improvement in clinical symptoms, smoking cessation, and functions; and how
      biomarker changes predict these improvements.
