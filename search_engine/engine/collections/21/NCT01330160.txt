      stroke patients without dementia. At inclusion in the cohort, main antecedents and risk
      factors, previous treatment and lifestyle, initial severity and etiology are recorded.
      Biological samples (for standard ans specialized analyses) and MRI are performed at 72h after
      stroke occurrence. Thereafter, patients are regularly (6 months, 12 months, 36 months, 60
      months) examined for clinical and cognitive assessment with biological samples and Magnetic
      Resonance Imaging. Patients with dementia will be compared to patients without stroke to
      identify, by logistic regression analysis and Cox model, the factors associated with dementia
      occurrence.
