      effectiveness of the simplified hybrid frozen elephant trunk repair technique Branched
      Stented Anastamosis Frozen Elephant Trunk Repair (B-SAFER) which involves a physician
      modified endovascular stentgraft to treat the proximal aorta in subjects with aortic disease
      involving multiple segments. The study will also evaluate the device functionality when using
      this operative technique for device implantation including multiple components.
