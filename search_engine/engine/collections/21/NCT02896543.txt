      to initiate a primary immune response to certain antigens by activation of "naive" T cells,
      and are actively related to the process of atherosclerosis. Two DC subsets, myeloid DCs
      (mDCs) and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs), were identified in humans. In our previous study, the
      investigators found that change of dendritic cells and fractalkine in patients with acute
      myocardial infarction. At the same time, the level of P-selectin increased. In addition, the
      interaction of dendritic cells and P-selectin promotes the progress of atherosclerosis. In
      this study, the investigators want to see whether the balance between mDCs and pDCs is
      altered in patients with acute myocardial infarction. sP-selectin is one of the members of
      the family of proteins, mediate leukocyte adhesion and rolling in vascular endothelial,
      studies have shown that in patients with unstable angina and acute myocardial infarction in
      serum sP-selectin protein increased significantly, showed that sP-selectin associated with
      the activity of coronary heart disease, causing plaque instability.However, there is few
      relevant studies about the relationship of dendritic cells and P-selectin in patients with
      acute myocardial infarction. This study valuates the relationship of dendritic cells and
      P-selectin in patients with acute myocardial infarction
