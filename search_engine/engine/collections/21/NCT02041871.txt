      response and outcome in postoperative period and has been proven to be beneficial in reducing
      significantly postoperative infectious complications and length of hospital stay in patients
      undergoing elective gastrointestinal surgery for tumors. To date, the effects of preoperative
      oral immunonutrition (ORAL IMPACT) in non cirrhotic patients undergoing liver resection for
      cancer are unknown. The purpose of this study is to determine whether the administration of a
      short-term preoperative oral immunonutrition can reduce postoperative morbidity in
      non-cirrhotic patients undergoing liver resection for malignant tumours.
