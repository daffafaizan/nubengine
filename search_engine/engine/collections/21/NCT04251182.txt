    
      Study Design & Methods: Phase 2 multi-center, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled
      study of T3D959 15 mg, 30 mg, 45 mg, or matching placebo administered orally once daily for
      24 weeks. There will be equal allocation of subject numbers across the four groups.
      Stratified randomization will be conducted on the basis of ApoE4 genotype so that subjects
      are randomized into one of the four dose groups within each stratum of ApoE4 status:
      ApoE4-positive (at least one E4 allele) vs ApoE4-negative (no E4 alleles).

      Following informed consent, subjects will enter the screening phase of the study.

      Once eligibility is confirmed and before the start of the first dose of study drug, subjects
      will be randomized on a 1:1:1:1 basis to placebo or T3D959 treatment (15mg, 30mg, 45mg) for
      the 24-week treatment period. Investigators, subjects, and caregivers will be blinded to the
      treatment assignment.
