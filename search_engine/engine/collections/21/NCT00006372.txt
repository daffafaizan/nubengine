        -  Determine the pharmacokinetic profile of gemcitabine, doxorubicin HCl liposome, and
           vinorelbine in patients with advanced solid tumors.

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the toxicity profile of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study.

      Patients receive doxorubicin HCl liposome IV over 1-2.5 hours on day 1, gemcitabine IV over
      30 minutes on days 1 and 8, and vinorelbine IV over 6-10 minutes on days 1 and 15. Treatment
      continues every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of doxorubicin HCl liposome, gemcitabine,
      and vinorelbine until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as
      the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for up to 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 9-24 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-18
      months.
