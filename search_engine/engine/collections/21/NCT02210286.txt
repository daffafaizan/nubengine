      Salt (L-TAMS) containing Vitamins C and D on cognitive performance suggests that
      supplementation may benefit individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD). This proof of concept
      will assess whether supplementation with Magtein (MGT), a constant release formula of
      Magnesium L-threonate, Vitamin C, and Vitamin D, is associated with changes in regional
      cerebral metabolism in elderly people with mild to moderate dementia.

      This is an open-label, two-month trial consisting of 15-20 participants aged 60 and older
      with mild to moderate dementia. Subjects will receive 1,800 mg/day of MgT-1219 for a total of
      60 days. They will be given neurocognitive testing, blood chemistries, and FDG-PET imaging at
      baseline, 60 days and more testing at 180 days to assess the acute effect of MgT-1219 on
      hippocampal and PFC-mediated executive function, attention, reasoning, and memory. Blood
      draws will be conducted prior to treatment initiation to assess kidney and liver function,
      complete blood count, fasting plasma insulin, and red blood cell magnesium.

      Our outcome measures include a combination of neuropsychological testing and neuroimaging.
      These will be employed to measure changes in the degree of cognitive impairment within
      subjects over time, as well as between subjects in the intervention and control groups.
      FDG-PET imaging will be used to assess the degree of synaptic activity and density within
      subjects at different time points in the study. These measures will be supplemented by
      measures of, sleep quality, daytime sleepiness, depression, and activities of daily living.
