      nonembolized lobe in patients undergoing major hepatectomy in order to prevent small-for-size
      remnant liver resulting in post-operative liver insufficiency.

      Although PVE is a safe and effective procedure, it does not always induce sufficient
      hypertrophy of the future remnant liver (FRL) even after a long time. In case of insufficient
      liver regeneration following PVE, some authors suggested to embolize hepatic vein(s) (Hwang,
      Ann Surg 2009).

      Interestingly, the sequential right hepatic vein embolization (HVE) after right PVE
      demonstrated an incremental effect on the FRL. Although attractive, this approach requires
      two different procedures and does not spare time as compared to PVE alone.

      To shorten and optimize the phase of liver preparation before surgery,the so-called liver
      venous deprivation (LVD) technique that combines both PVE and HVE during the same procedure
      was developed.

      The aim of this randomized phase II trial is to compare the percentage of change in FRL
      volume at 3 weeks after LVD or PVE using MRI or CT-scan.
