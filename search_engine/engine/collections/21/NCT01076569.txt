      I. To provide a detailed, molecular map of pediatric high risk acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

      II. To identify mutations, expression profile, gene copy number, loss of heterozygosity (LOH)
      status and genomic methylation patterns in order to identify novel changes associated with
      pediatric AML.

      III. To generate fibroblast cell lines in order to obtain germline nucleic acids from marrow
      specimens from AML patients with induction failure.

      IV. To identify genomic alterations contributing to induction failure in childhood AML.

      OUTLINE:

      Banked bone marrow samples from diagnosis and remission are used to develop a detailed
      molecular map of pediatric high-risk acute myeloid leukemia. Analysis includes genome single
      nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping, expression, and methylation profiling.
