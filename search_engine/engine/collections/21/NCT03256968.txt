      the CF gene known as the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator or CFTR. This
      defect prevents correct chloride absorption in and out of the cells The purpose of this study
      is to explore the combination of ataluren and ivacaftor as a treatment for patients with a
      specific cystic fibrosis mutation
