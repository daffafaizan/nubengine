    
      This study is a Phase 1 open-label, dose escalation, and cohort expansion study of
      enoblituzumab administered intravenously (IV) on a weekly schedule for up to 51 doses in
      combination with IV ipilimumab administered on an every-3-week schedule for 4 doses.

      The dose escalation phase is designed to characterize the safety and tolerability of the
      combination of enoblituzumab and ipilimumab and to define the maximum tolerated or
      administered dose (MTD/MAD) in patients with B7-H3 expressing mesothelioma, urothelial
      cancer, NSCLC, SCCHN, Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), ovarian cancer, melanoma,
      thyroid cancer, Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), pancreatic cancer, colon cancer, soft
      tissue sarcoma, or prostate cancer.

      The cohort expansion phase, 2 cohorts of 16 patients each will be enrolled to further
      evaluate the safety and potential efficacy of the combination administered at the MTD/MAD
      dose in patients with melanoma and NSCLC.

      All tumor evaluations will be carried out by both Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
      Tumors (RECIST) and immune-related response criteria (irRC).
