      Subjects will undergo a biopsy from the middle of the upper margin of the uterine incision
      measuring 4 x 2 x 2 cm. This will be performed by the managing doctor at the time of cesarean
      section after delivery of the baby. Once the tissue is obtained, the site will be closed
      using sutures similar to the usual closure of the uterus at cesarean section. This biopsy
      will be taken to the laboratory to test whether the nanovector will increase or decrease
      contractions in the uterus. Once this test is finished, the tissue will be frozen and test
      for the absence or presence of the nanovector within the tissue.
