    
      Given a significant number of patients who presented for treatment at the Center for the
      Treatment of Eating Disorders (CTED) and were enrolled in this effectiveness study met
      criteria for a diagnosis of Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID), and because
      there are currently no randomized control trials systematically evaluating
      children/adolescents with ARFID, a secondary aim was added to this study.

      The secondary aim will evaluate the preliminary effectiveness of two treatment groups
      including: Family-based Treatment (FBT) modified for ARFID and Family-based Treatment (FBT)
      combined with the Unified Protocol (UP) for Transdiagnostic Treatment of Emotional Disorders
      (FBT+UP for ARFID) for ARFID patients.
