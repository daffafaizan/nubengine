      trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV) in elderly individuals dependent on the presence and
      duration of CMV infection by analyses of vaccine-induced plasmablasts, antibodies and
      antigen-specific T cells. Healthy volunteers, > 60 years of age, will be identified by the
      Stanford Blood Center based on their history of positive or negative CMV serologies. Baseline
      blood samples will be drawn from all study participants prior to immunization. All
      participants will receive a single dose of 2012-2013 licensed TIV. Volunteers will complete 3
      study visits at Day 0, Day 7 and Day 28.
