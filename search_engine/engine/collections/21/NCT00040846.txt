    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether stable allogeneic engraftment from related and unrelated human
      leukocyte antigen (HLA)-mismatched stem cell donors can be safely established using a
      non-myeloablative conditioning regimen plus escalating doses of the anti-CD52 monoclonal
      antibody (mAb) Campath (alemtuzumab) in patients with hematologic malignancies.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the risk of occurrence of acute and chronic graft-vs-host disease (GVHD).

      II. Evaluate the risk/incidence of infections.

      III. Determine whether engraftment can be maintained with a single dose fludarabine, donor
      lymphocyte infusion (DLI) and continued MMF/CSP.

      IV. Evaluate the risk for disease progression and relapse.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of alemtuzumab.

      CONDITIONING REGIMEN: Patients receive alemtuzumab intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on days -8
      to -5 and fludarabine phosphate IV on days -4 to -2. Patients also undergo low-dose TBI on
      day 0.

      HEMATOPOIETIC STEM CELL TRANSPLANTATION (HSCT): Patients undergo allogeneic peripheral blood
      stem cell transplantation on day 0.

      IMMUNOSUPPRESSION: Patients receive CSP IV or orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days -3 to 180
      with taper to day 365 and MMF PO thrice daily (TID) on days 0-100 with taper to day 156.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.
