      group B (Protein group) received oral protein supplementation and traditional burn care,
      group C (Exercise group) received exercise program and traditional burn care, group D
      (Control group) received traditional burn care. LBM was measured using Dual-energy x-ray
      absorptiometry (DXA) while muscle strength was measured using Biodex 3 Dynamometer System
      before treatment and 12 weeks after treatment.
