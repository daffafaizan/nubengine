      schematically divided into two portions: a vertical portion which mean that an increase in
      preload secondary to volume expansion will induce an increase in stroke volume; and a flat
      portion which mean that a same increase in preload will not induce an increase in stroke
      volume. Perioperative optimization is based on stroke volume maximization using volume
      expansion. Despite national and international recommendations, stroke volume monitoring is
      clearly not widely adopted. This is mostly due to the cost and the invasiveness of the
      devices allowing stroke volume monitoring. End tidal carbon dioxide is monitored in all
      patients undergoing general anaesthesia and is totally non-invasive. Several studies
      evaluated the relationship between stroke volume and end tidal carbon dioxide and other
      studies evaluated the ability of changes in end tidal carbon dioxide to assess changes in
      stroke volume induced by volume expansion with discordant results. These studies included
      small sample size and were heterogeneous (intensive care unit and nor operating room, volume
      expansion or passive leg raising, crystalloid or colloid, 500ml and not 250 ml â€¦.). Nowadays,
      it is not clear if changes in end tidal carbon dioxide can be considered as a surrogate of
      changes in stroke volume during a volume expansion in operating room patients. Thus, the aim
      of the present study is to determine if change in End Tidal Carbon Dioxide can assess the
      stroke volume effects of a volume expansion of 250ml of crystalloid in the operating room.

      The follow up will be restricted to the duration of volume expansion. The last data will be
      collected just after the end of volume expansion.
