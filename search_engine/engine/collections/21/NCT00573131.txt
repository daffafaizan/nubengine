    
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of OncoGel given in
      combination with standard chemotherapy (cisplatin and 5-FU) and radiation therapy in patients
      with previously untreated, resectable, local or local-regional adenosarcoma or squamous cell
      carcinoma.

      All patients will receive IV cisplatin on Day 1 and Day 29 and IV 5-FU given continuously for
      96 hours starting on Day 1 and Day 29. All patients will also receive out-patient radiation
      therapy for 28 treatments once per day for 5 1/2 weeks starting on Day 1.

      Patients randomized to the OncoGel treatment group will have the OncoGel dose injected into
      their esophageal tumors during an endoscopic procedure just before starting systemic
      chemotherapy and radiation therapy.

      All patients will have CT scans for tumor measurements before starting chemotherapy and 12
      weeks later after completion of the radiation therapy and both cycles of chemotherapy.

      During the chemotherapy and radiation therapy, physical exams, vital signs, routine blood
      tests will be performed. Patients will also be asked about their quality of life and ability
      to swallow.

      In-patient surgery will be scheduled 4 to 6 weeks after completion of chemotherapy and
      radiation therapy. The resected esophagus and lymph nodes will be evaluated for the presence
      of residual tumor.

      Patients will be followed at months 4, 5, 6, and then every 3 Months thereafter for survival
      and esophageal cancer status and treatment until the last patient enrolled has completed
      their Month 12 visit.
