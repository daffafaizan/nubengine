      all oral clinical parameters from sixty systemically healthy volunteers (20 periodontally
      healthy, 20 gingivitis, and 20 periodontitis). Gingival crevicular fluid samples will be
      taken again after the nonsurgical periodontal treatment for the periodontitis group in the
      first and third months. Lipocalin-2 and Semaphorin 3A levels will be determined by an
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test (ELISA). Subsequent statistical analyses will be used
      to interpret protein levels among different groups and peridontitis group after the
      nonsurgical periodontal treatment.

      Possible significant differences may illuminate the future work with Lipocalin-2 and
      Semaphorin 3A. Also, these glycoproteins may help to develop different diagnostic methods or
      treatment strategies for future periodontal treatments.
