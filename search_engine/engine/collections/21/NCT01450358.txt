      included in the study. Blood samples for cultures and multiplex PCR will be collected
      immediately prior to initiation of antibiotic therapy. Patients will be randomly selected
      into two groups. In Group I, the PCR results will be immediately reported to the medical
      researcher (6-12 hours), which will change the antimicrobial regimen (De-escalation). In
      Group II, the Multiplex PCR results will not be informed, being focused care as a result of
      blood culture (at least after 72 hours). The initial empirical antimicrobial therapy will be
      the same in both groups, according to the standardization of the institution.
