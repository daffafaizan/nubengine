           receive doxycycline PEP or no PEP

        -  Intervention 2: Meningococcal B vaccine (Bexsero®) or no vaccine Subjects will be
           randomized 1/1 to received 2 doses of Bexsero® vaccine (at the first visit and two
           months later) or no vaccine

      Participants will be randomized in one of the following arms:

        -  Arm 1: doxycycline and Bexsero® vaccine (240 participants)

        -  Arm 2: doxycycline and no Bexsero® vaccine (240 participants)

        -  Arm 3: no doxycycline and Bexsero® vaccine (120 participants)

        -  Arm 4: no doxycycline and no Bexsero® vaccine (120 participants)

      Randomization will be stratified by whether or not the participant enters in the ancillary
      study "intestinal microbiota".
