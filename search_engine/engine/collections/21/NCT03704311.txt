      muscle, possibly related to mitochondrial impairment. They can result in pain and hypoxic
      areas within the muscle. This pilot study established a minimally invasive biopsy technique
      to obtain high-quality MTrP tissue samples to evaluate mitochondrial function via
      high-resolution respirometry. Secondary objectives included the safety of the biopsy
      procedure assessed via clinical wound healing (number of patients with signs for local
      infection and inflammation). For this purpose, twenty healthy males participated in this
      study, 10 with a diagnosis of myofascial pain in the musculus (m.) trapezius MTrP (TTP group)
      and 10 with a diagnosis of myofascial pain in the m. gluteus medius (GTP group). The affected
      muscle was biopsied followed by a biopsy from the vastus lateralis to be used as a control.
      Measurements of oxygen consumption were carried out using high-resolution respirometry.
