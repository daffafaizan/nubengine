        -  Evaluate whether oral antibiotic prophylaxis with co-trimoxazole (TMP-SMX) versus
           ciprofloxacin (CPFX) or ofloxacin versus no prophylaxis will significantly reduce rates
           of serious bacterial infections during the first 3 months of chemotherapy in patients
           with multiple myeloma.

        -  Determine whether antibiotic prophylaxis with TMP-SMX or CPFX (or ofloxacin) is
           associated with an increased incidence of nonbacterial infection or an increased rate of
           infection from organisms resistant to prophylactic antibiotics.

        -  Evaluate whether oral antibiotic prophylaxis with CPFX or ofloxacin is as effective as
           TMP-SMX without the associated toxic effects.

        -  Evaluate whether protection against early infection in multiple myeloma patients can
           improve their response to initial chemotherapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified by participating
      center. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive co-trimoxazole every 12 hours for 2 months followed by
           observation for 2 months.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin every 12 hours for 2 months
           followed by observation for 1 month.

        -  Arm III: The patient will receive no prophylaxis.

      Patients continue their randomly assigned treatment throughout any infection in addition to
      any treatment needed for infection. Patients also remain on their randomly assigned treatment
      if chemotherapy is discontinued, changed, or delayed during the 3 month study.

      Patients are followed at 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 212 patients (71 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
