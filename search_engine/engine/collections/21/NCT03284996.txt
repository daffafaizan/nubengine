      high rate of morbidity and mortality among individual patients with type 2 diabetes.

      The onset and progression of nephropathy can be delayed by interventions, provided they are
      instituted early in the course of the disease.

      Doppler sonography allows non-invasive method for investigating renal hemodynamics. Renal
      resistive index measured using Doppler ultrasonography, reflects intra-renal vascular
      resistance.

      Although Doppler sonography clearly does not substitute for renal biopsy, several studies
      have suggested that it might aid in the management of established renal disease and provide
      an easily applicable and noninvasive method for investigating renal hemodynamics.

      Doppler sonography provides an easily applicable, non-invasive, and well-established method
      for investigating renal morphologic characteristics and measuring vascular resistance in the
      renal parenchyma. Doppler are of strategic importance in providing qualitative and
      quantitative information about the renal vasculature, which can be obtained through the
      assessment of the resistive index. It is one of the most sensitive parameters in the study of
      kidney diseases and allows us to quantify the changes in renal plasma flow . A normal
      resistive index is below 0.7 in adults and children who are six years of age or older.
