      population. One of the possible causes refers to a traumatic brushing. Individuals who have
      an excessive tooth brushing can cause injuries to your gums, such as abrasions and fissures.
      These lesions have been considered subrogated outcomes of gingival recession noninfectious.
      The literature only reports and case series showing the gingival fissures, which were once
      associated with traumatic occlusion.

      This is the first clinical trial to evaluate the gingival fissures according to the type of
      brush used.
