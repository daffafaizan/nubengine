      affects the life expectancy of patients. Their incidence varies between 15 and 50% according
      to the histologic types. Surgery, stereotactic radiosurgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy
      are the main treatments currently proposed.

      For patients with multiple brain metastases, whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) remains the
      standard of care. However, the median overall survival is less than 6 months and new
      approaches need to be developed to improve treatment of these patients.

      In this context, the weak control of the disease comes from three main factors: the
      multiplicity of the brain lesions, the radioresistance of certain histologies and the poor
      distribution of cytotoxic agents in brain metastases.

      The use of radiosensitizing agents is here of great interest. The radiosensitizing agent
      chosen in this study is AGuIX®. It is a Gadolinium-chelated polysiloxane based nanoparticle
      developed by NH TherAguix company for its theranostic properties (radiosensitization and
      diagnosis by multimodal imaging). Preclinical studies have demonstrated the radiosensitizing
      effect of AGuIX® in vivo in 8 tumor models xenografted in rodents, and particularly in brain
      tumors.
