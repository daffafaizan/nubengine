    
      32 subjects will be enrolled in the investigation. Eligible subjects will receive one session
      of 4-6-hour continuous IOP monitoring with SENSIMED Triggerfish® following water drinking
      test (WDT). SENSIMED Triggerfish® will be installed randomly on right or left eyes and the
      IOP recording will be initiated as soon as the adaptation of the device on the subject's eye
      is satisfying. Sensor fitting in the eye will then be evaluated every 60 minutes, until no
      more spontaneous Sensor movement and rotation are observed. Then IOP will be measured on the
      contra lateral eye using Goldmann tonometer and the subjects will be asked to drink 1 liter
      of water within 5 minutes.

      After the water drinking, IOP will be measured on the contra lateral eye 10 minutes after the
      beginning of the test then every 5 minutes until returned to normal. The IOP will be measured
      again every 20 minutes until 2 hours after the water drinking.
