           hemoglobin in patients with compensated or decompensated liver cirrhosis who also have
           hepatogenous diabetes

        2. Secondary end outcome

             1. HbA1c distribution in patients diagnosed with hepatogenous diabetes confirmed by
                75-gram oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)

             2. Association between mean preprandial blood glucose concentration and glycated
                hemoglobin in patients with compensated or decompensated liver cirrhosis who also
                have hepatogenous diabetes

             3. Association between mean postprandial blood glucose concentration and glycated
                hemoglobin in patients with compensated or decompensated liver cirrhosis who also
                have hepatogenous diabetes

             4. Association between mean plasma glucose concentration and glycated hemoglobin
                according to Child-pugh's classification and liver stiffness severity

             5. Factors contributing to discrepancy between mean plasma glucose concentration and
                HbA1c in patients with compensated or decompensated liver cirrhosis who also have
                hepatogenous diabetes
