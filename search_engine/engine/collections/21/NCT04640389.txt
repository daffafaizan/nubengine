      one-fifth of the world's youth population, and experiences stagnant rates of undernutrition.
      These challenges point to the need for country-specific data on rural-urban health
      disparities to inform development policies. This cross-sectional study examined disparities
      in body mass index-for-age-and-sex (BAZ) and height-for-age-and-sex z-scores (HAZ) among 1125
      adolescents in Tanzania. Pearson's chi-square tested associations between rural/urban
      residence and undernutrition (BAZ <-2SD), stunting (HAZ <-2SD), anthropometric,
      socioeconomic, and health indicators. Multivariate linear regression identified predictors of
      BAZ and HAZ.
