      Primary

        -  Compare the progression-free survival of patients with stage II or III unresectable
           non-small cell lung cancer treated with paclitaxel, carboplatin, and radiotherapy with
           or without adjuvant paclitaxel and carboplatin.

      Secondary

        -  Compare the objective response rate in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the overall survival of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the toxicity of these regimens in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      radiotherapy regimen (conformational vs nonconformational).

      Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes once weekly for
      up to 6 weeks. Patients concurrently undergo radiotherapy 5 days a week for 7-7.5 weeks.
      Three weeks after completion of chemoradiotherapy, patients with stable or responding disease
      are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo routine follow-up.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes
           on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for a maximum of 3 courses.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 390 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years.
