      hematopoietic progenitor cells. As the most common form of acute leukemia, AML accounts for
      the largest number of annual deaths from leukemia. Over 95 percent (%) of AML blasts
      harvested from newly diagnosed AML participants expressed Cluster of Differentiation (CD) 70
      on the cell surface. Cusatuzumab (JNJ-74494550) is a humanized monoclonal antibody of camelid
      origin, binding with tight affinity to human CD70. Cusatuzumab has been modified to induce
      enhanced antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) for therapeutic use in
      participants with cancer. Azacitidine is a pyrimidine nucleoside analogue of cytidine with
      antineoplastic activity and is indicated for the treatment of adult participants with AML or
      intermediate 2 and high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) with greater than 20% marrow
      blasts who are not eligible for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. This study will
      evaluate 2 doses of cusatuzumab in combination with standard dose azacitidine in participants
      with AML who are not candidates for intensive chemotherapy (Part 1). Part 1 data will be
      reviewed by a Data Review Committee to select a preferred dose of cusatuzumab. The study will
      include a Screening Phase (28 days prior to randomization), a Treatment Phase, and a
      Follow-up Phase. The study includes evaluations like vital signs, electrocardiogram,
      spirometry test, serum chemistry and hematology tests. The study will be conducted for an
      approximate duration of 2 years.
