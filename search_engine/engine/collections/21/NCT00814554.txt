    
      A cluster randomised trial implemented in 24 high and technical schools including 20 000
      fifth-former aims, on a three-year period, at evaluating the effectiveness of three
      strategies, combined or not, according a 2*2*2 factorial plan, concerning the promotion of
      healthy dietary and physical activity behaviours: to develop individual skills by individual
      and collective education, to propose favourable environment, to screen and care for subjects
      at risk of weight excess. Main outcomes are improvement of knowledge, attitudes and
      behaviours, mean body mass index (BMI) change, proportion of obese children according to
      international standards after two years of follow-up, and finally psychological and
      sociological factors which are facilitators or barriers to such actions. The evidence of the
      effectiveness of one or the other of the strategies will help to define interventions
      framework for medical, educative and economic sector actors.
