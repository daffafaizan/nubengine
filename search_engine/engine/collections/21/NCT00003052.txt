        -  Determine local progression-free survival of patients with high-risk soft tissue sarcoma
           treated with neoadjuvant etoposide, ifosfamide, and doxorubicin with or without regional
           hyperthermia.

        -  Determine the tumor response rate, local disease control rate, and overall survival in
           patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified according to high-risk category
      (S1 vs S2 vs S3) and disease site (extremity vs nonextremity). Patients are randomized to one
      of two treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive etoposide IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 4, ifosfamide IV over
           60 minutes on days 1-4, and doxorubicin IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment continues
           every 21 days for a total of 4 courses. Patients also undergo regional hyperthermia.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive chemotherapy alone as in arm I. Patients in both arms undergo
           definitive surgery 4-6 weeks after chemotherapy. Patients also undergo radiotherapy
           beginning 4-6 weeks after surgery. After completion of surgery and radiotherapy,
           patients with non-resectable tumors showing no disease progression receive an additional
           4 courses of chemotherapy with or without regional hyperthermia according to above
           treatment schedule.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 4 months for 2 years, and then every 6
      months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 340 patients (170 patients per arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 3.5 years.
