      no to mild symptoms, the study team will administer a treatment of essential amino acids
      (EAA). The study team will examine if this treatment compared to placebo will reduce the
      development, length and the severity of symptoms. Participants will consume the treatment or
      placebo for 4 weeks, and will complete symptom surveys, as well as pre- and post-assessments.
      Individuals who receive a COVID vaccination will continue to complete symptom surveys for 1
      week and take the essential amino acid supplementation for 2 weeks following a vaccination.
