      serosa positive or locally-invaded-gastric cancer (LIGC). Recent researches showed that PIPAC
      and Olaparib are effective to control peritoneal metastases in different malignant diseases
      but it has not been tested for gastric cancer patients. The main purpose of this study is to
      compare the safety and efficacy of PIPAC+SOX+OLAPARIB for locally-invaded-gastric cancer
      (LIGC) patients in China. To obtain preliminary results for designing a new phase II/III
      randomized controlled trial.
