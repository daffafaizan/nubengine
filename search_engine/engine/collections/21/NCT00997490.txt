      single-centre, controlled, double-blind study in patients with a mild depressive episode
      according to ICD 10, F32.0 and F33.0.

      After a one-week, placebo run-in phase to exclude placebo responders, patients were given the
      study medication (Neurapas® balance or placebo) for 6 weeks in a dose of 3 x 2 tablets daily.
      The study was conducted in accordance with the relevant requirements of the German Medicines
      Act (AMG), the Declaration of Helsinki (48th General Assembly, Sommerset West, Rep. of South
      Africa, October 1996) and ICH GCP guidelines.

      The improvement in symptoms of depression was assessed on the basis of the internationally
      established Hamilton Depression Scale 21 (primary efficacy criterion). The Self-Rating
      Depression Scale (SDS), the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A), the Clinical Global Impressions
      (CGI), Quality of Life questionnaire (SF-36) according to Bullinger (German version) and a
      Sleep questionnaire (SQ) were used as secondary efficacy criteria.
