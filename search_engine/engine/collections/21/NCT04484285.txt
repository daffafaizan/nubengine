      physiological responses of major organs during moments of stress and learning, including
      brain areas that modulate cognitive performance. Vagal nerve stimulation (VNS) has been
      indicated to improve stress response and to enhance neuroplasticity by directly impacting
      brain structures critical for cognition. Historically, VNS methods required neurosurgery and
      were reserved for medically intractable epilepsy or other severe conditions. Today, vagal
      nerve stimulation can be performed with a minimal-risk non-invasive approach without surgery
      through a technique called transcutaneous Vagal Nerve Stimulation (tVNS). This project will
      utilize a home-operated stimulator in healthy young adult and healthy older populations to
      provide a proof of concept of practical home-use stimulation.
