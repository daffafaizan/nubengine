      CD40 ligand/CD40 interaction in the production of pathogenic autoantibodies. Anti-CD40L
      antibody treatment of mice with lupus nephritis ameliorates disease and improves survival.
      BG9588 is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to CD40 ligand
      (CD40L) expressed on the surface of activated T lymphocytes and thereby blocks the CD40L/CD40
      interaction between T and B cells that is required for the initiation for certain antibody
      responses. Available preclinical data indicates that BG9588 does not cause a global blockage
      of the immune response to pathogens and that its effects are reversible upon clearance from
      the systemic circulation. In this Phase I/II open-label, multiple-dose, multicenter study, 30
      subjects with active proliferative lupus nephritis will receive 20 mg/kg BG9588 by IV
      infusion once every 14 days for three doses, and then once every 28 days for four doses for a
      total of 7 doses. The primary objective is to determine if BG9588 can decrease proteinuria by
      greater than or equal to 50 percent from baseline without worsening renal function. The
      secondary objectives are to determine the safety and pharmacokinetics of BG9588, as well as
      the effects of BG9588 on renal flares; cellular casts; C(3) levels and anti-dsDNA titers;
      requirement for prednisone; general lupus activity; and quality of life.
