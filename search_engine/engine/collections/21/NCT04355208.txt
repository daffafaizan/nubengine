      edge translucency, halo effect, other internal colors and pigments such as craze lines, white
      patches, white horizontal striations .

      Anterior composites usually have small filler particles to increase smoothness,
      nanotechnology has enabled recent advances in dental composite restorations. As a result , a
      different category of composite resins has emerged, known as nanocomposites.

      However polychromatic layering is considered to be technique sensitive, from detection of
      details to proper reproduction of such fine details.

      The presence of discrepancies between the classic shade guides and the actual shade of
      composite makes that task more difficult.

      The use of monochromatic layering with only body shade can serve as a substitute for enamel
      and dentin, since it has an intermediate opacity between enamel and dentin , and can serve as
      an easier option with less technique sensitivity than polychromatic layering.

      Filtek universal as claimed by the company manufacturer to have A "NaturalMatch" which is a
      term that describes the combination of 3M technologies and features present within 3M™
      Filtek™ Universal restorative.

      it contains nanofillers, pigments and proprietary low-stress monomers which gives Filtek™
      Universal Restorative a combination of esthetic and universal opacity which in turn allow
      shade blending and making the restoration more invisible with surrounding dentition.
