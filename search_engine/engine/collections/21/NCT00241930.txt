      primary care HIV treatment will improve outcomes for HIV-infected heroin users vs providing
      buprenorphine services at a separate, off-site facility. As a means of engagement, we will
      offer the OASIS education group each week at each facility. For those randomized to
      integrated care, subjects will attend one education session weekly at the time of their HIV
      clinic. During these sessions, subjects will receive contemporaneous HIV clinic appointments
      (monthly), case management (monthly), drug counseling (twice monthly), and buprenorphine
      (which will be dispensed weekly.) For those randomized to separate care, subjects will attend
      HIV clinic appointments monthly, and will attend weekly education sessions at the OASIS
      facility. During these sessions, subjects will receive weekly buprenorphine, twice monthly
      drug counseling, and monthly case management.

      We will measure outcomes by reporting attendance, CD4 counts, HIV viral loads, urine
      toxicology testing on at least a quarterly basis. We will also measure patient satisfaction,
      knowledge, quality of life, and a number of other outcomes.
