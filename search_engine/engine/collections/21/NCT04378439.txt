      intervention to promote and support the use of needed HIV, STI, and HCV prevention and care
      services among GBMSM and transgender women; and developing priorities and recommendations to
      improve their health that will be disseminated to inform public health practice, research,
      and policy. By integrating peer navigation and mHealth strategies, the proposed study
      provides a unique opportunity to improve health among vulnerable, hidden, and neglected
      populations living in rural Appalachia. Findings from this research may inform strategies and
      approaches to address other health disparities in other rural populations.
