      be included. Patients with a history of previous heart disease are excluded from the study.
      Each patient is in need of norepinephrine infusion and on mechanical ventilation. Initially
      the mean arterial pressure (MAP) is randomly changed from 60 to 75 and then to 90 mmHg.
      Hemodynamic variables as blood pressure, cardiac output, pulmonary artery occlusion pressure
      (PAOP) will be registerd at each MAP-level, arterial line and pulmonary artery catheter (PAC)
      and the cardiac function will be assessed with conventional and strain echocardiography.
      Then, if the echocardiogram shows impaired LV-function will the patient be randomized to
      receive either Milrinone or Levosimendan. Hemodynamic variables as blood pressure, cardiac
      output, pulmonary artery occlusion pressure (PAOP) will be registered again, as well the
      cardiac function with conventional and strain echocardiography. Echocardiograms will be
      analysed for the determination of LV an RV strain. Potential differences between different
      levels of blood pressure as well as effects of Milrinone or Levosimendan on hemodynamic and
      echocardiographyc variables will be analysed.
