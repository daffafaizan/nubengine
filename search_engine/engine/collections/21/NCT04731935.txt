    
      This study is designed as a pilot, single-center, non-randomized, uncontrolled, clinical
      trial in which subjects will be consented, receive a baseline assessment, and receive tAN
      treatment and assessment every day during their 3 to 5-day detox treatment. Use of
      opioid-based medication assisted therapy (MAT) will not be permitted at any point during the
      study. Use of non-opioid-based MATs (i.e. comfort or rescue medications) will not be
      permitted until after the subject has completed the 60 minute COWS assessment to ensure
      changes in COWS score at 60 minutes are only the result of tAN therapy.
