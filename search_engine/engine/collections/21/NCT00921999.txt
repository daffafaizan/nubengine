      important for control of varicella as evidenced by the role of varicella immune globulin in
      limiting the severity of disease in immunocompromised persons. Limited information is
      available regarding the individual viral proteins to which antibodies are produced during
      primary infection with VZV or after vaccination. Furthermore, commercially available tests to
      determine seropositivity to VZV after vaccination have limited sensitivity, and improved
      assays are needed. We will obtain blood from persons with varicella, zoster, and those
      vaccinated with the varicella (not zoster) vaccine at the NIH Clinical Center and measure
      immune responses against specific viral proteins, look for virus in the blood, and in some
      cases measure immune responses against cellular proteins over time. Elucidation of these
      responses might help to develop more sensitive assays for VZV seropositivity after
      vaccination and determine how the varicella vaccine protects against varicella.
