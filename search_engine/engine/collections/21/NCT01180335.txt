      DLD30 score (Hess, JCO, 2006) and TOP2A expression are quantified. Patients are then either
      treated with 4FEC followed by 4 docetaxel (standard arm) or by a genomic-driven regimen
      (experiemental arm). In the experimental arm, patients with high DLD30 receive 3 months
      weekly paclitaxel followed by 4 FEC, patients with high TOP2A receive 4FEC then 4 docetaxel,
      patients with low DLD30 and low TOP2A are treated with 6 cycles of docetaxel-capecitabine.
