      and assigned to total hip arthroplasty using one the of hip approaches: anterior or
      anterolateral. Subjects will be assessed preoperative and 3 and 12 moths postoperative.

      Biomechanical gait parameters will be collected using tree-dimensional motion analysis system
      "BTS SMART".

      Evaluation of the function of the middle gluteal muscle with superficial EMG (sEMG)
      percutaneous surface electromyography. Fatigue assessment (mean frequency and amplitude) of
      the gluteus medius muscle during isometric muscle contraction.

      Balance and coordination as well as fall risk will be assessed with use of dynamometric
      Biodex Balance platform. The study will determine the values of individual indicators:
      general stability index (OWS), anterior-posterior stability index (APW), the median lateral
      stability index (MLW) and the fall risk index (RU).

      Subjective assessment will be conducted with use of Visual Analogue Scale, WOMAC Index,
      Oxford Hip Score, The Short Form-36 (SF-36) and Harris Hip Score
