      approximately $635 billion per year in medical expenses and lost productivity, and fuels the
      current epidemic of opioid addiction. Understanding alternate approaches to chronic pain
      management is an imperative given new guidelines for the treatment of pain, and preliminary
      studies indicate that meditation programs may reduce the suffering and distress that
      accompanies chronic pain. However, much of the research on meditation for pain has examined
      the effects of scheduled group interventions, delivered in-person by instructors over the
      course of several weeks. Far less research has looked at the delivery method that is most
      common and arguably most sustainable for busy adults, namely, smart phone delivered
      Contemplative Applications (Apps) for Well-being (CAWs). The proposed study will examine the
      use and impact of a meditation apps in the context of pain. Participants will be randomized
      to either app or a wait-list group, and will be assessed in terms of self-reported pain,
      distress, narcotic use. To assess efficacy, the researchers will examine the longitudinal
      changes in all measures in the mindfulness app group, compared to wait-list control groups.
