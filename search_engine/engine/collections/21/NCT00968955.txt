      of advanced osteoarthritis total hip arthroplasty is still associated with postoperative pain
      and delayed rehabilitation. We therefore decided to evaluate the effects of per-operative
      local infiltration analgesia with ropivacaine 0,2 % (150 ML) versus placebo on acute
      postoperative pain intensity in a well defined, multimodal, fast-track setup after hip
      arthroplasty. The technique is widely used as standard treatment in many European centers
      despite its limited evidence.
