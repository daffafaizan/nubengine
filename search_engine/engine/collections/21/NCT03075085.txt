      demonstrates improved implementation, fidelity, and sustainability using a Hybrid Type 3
      implementation design. Investigators expect that the effectiveness of WISE on child outcomes
      will vary by the level of implementation fidelity, and a Hybrid 3 design allows for us to
      explore this hypothesis).
