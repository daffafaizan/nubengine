      blood) have an especially poor prognosis. Provision of LTOT to hypoxemic COPD patients is
      considered to be the standard of care. The majority of hypoxemic patients that are ambulatory
      are supplied with pressurized oxygen in E-cylinders. This system weighs approximately 22
      pounds, is mounted on a wheeled cart, and is towed by the patient. These cumbersome systems
      can be seen to impose a significant burden on weak and debilitated patients, discouraging
      them from being active. E-cylinders towed on a cart are referred to as 'portable', in
      contrast to lightweight 'ambulatory' oxygen systems, which weigh less than 10 pounds and are
      designed to be carried by the patient. It is unknown whether patients provided with
      lightweight ambulatory systems comply better with oxygen prescription and increase their
      daily level of activity. This study will compare the use and benefits of a lightweight
      ambulatory oxygen device versus the standard portable E-cylinder device among hypoxemic
      individuals with COPD. Specifically, the study will examine daily duration of oxygen therapy
      and activity levels amongst both groups.
