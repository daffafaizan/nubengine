        1. Multimodal seizure detection Evaluation of data quality and seizure annotation accuracy.
           Comparison of data derived from the multimodal wearable device (Sensor dot in
           combination with Plug and Patch system) versus video EEG and seizure diary in childhood
           epilepsy syndromes with

             -  Tonic seizures

             -  Atonic seizures

             -  Myoclonic seizures During wakefulness and during sleep

        2. Sleep monitoring Assessment of sleep data quality, latency, sleep fragmentation and time
           spent in different sleep stages in different childhood epilepsy syndromes. Investigation
           of the influence of occuring seizures on sleep architecture.

      Comparison of data wearable device (Byteflies Sensor Dot in combination with Plug and Patch
      system) versus video-EEG and sleep diary in childhood epilepsy syndromes.
