    
      This study has 2 parts: Dose Escalation (part 1) and Dose Expansion (part 2) which are
      conducted in 3 phases: Screening Phase (up to 28 days prior to first dose of study drug and
      includes procedures like electrocardiogram [ECG], serum pregnancy test), Treatment phase
      (continues until the completion of the End-of-Treatment Visit [30 days after last dose of
      study drug]) and Post-treatment follow-up phase (continues until the participant has died, is
      lost to follow-up, or has withdrawn consent or the study ends). In follow-up, participants
      will continue to be monitored for survival status and subsequent cancer-related therapies
      until the end of study. Additional bio-markers will be assessed, in an optional sub-study, to
      define the impact of JNJ-64457107 on innate and adaptive immune responses in tumors. Safety
      will be monitored throughout the study by Safety Evaluation Team (SET).
