    
      in a prospective observational study the investigators will register FiO2 in 15 voluntaries
      COPD patients as following:

        -  Pharyngeal FiO2 (G5® Philips™ side stream FiO2) with O2 supply through nasal cannula at
           basal flow (flow needed by patient). In order to compare FiO2s the investigators will
           measure FiO2 with 150%, 75%, 50% and 25 % of basal Flow

        -  And FiO2 during nocturnal NIV (pressure support ventilation; Vivo 50®, Bréas™), using
           facial or nasal masque (Confort Gel® Respironics™). O2 flow will be basal flow.
