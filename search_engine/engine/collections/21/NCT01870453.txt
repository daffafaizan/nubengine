      noncardiac, nonneurologic, nonvascular surgery will be recruited at the Massachusetts General
      Hospital (MGH). The study will first be introduced to patients at their preoperative surgical
      clinic appointment by his/her surgeon. If patients are interested in participating, they will
      notify their surgeons, and subsequent recruitment will take place at the MGH Pre-Admission
      Testing Area (PATA), a clinic for preoperative evaluation and medical optimization. Patient
      contact and recruitment, however, will only proceed with permission from (1) the patient
      him/herself and (2) the patient's surgeon. Per the Partners Human Research
      Committees-approved criteria, if patients do not have capacity for clinical-decision making
      but express a willingness to participate in the study, a surrogate (i.e. healthcare proxy
      and/or family member) co-signature will be required on the consent form. On the day of the
      subject's surgery, the anesthesia team will be allowed to choose one of four anesthetic
      options (i.e. propofol anesthesia, isoflurane anesthesia, sevoflurane anesthesia, or
      desflurane anesthesia) based on clinical preference and appropriateness. The research team
      will be blinded to the anesthetic to which subjects are assigned. Finally, patients will be
      followed for one year post-operatively with a battery of cognitive tests to determine
      differences in cognitive trajectory.
