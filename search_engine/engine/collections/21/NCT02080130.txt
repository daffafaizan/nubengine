    
      Children and infants, aged 1 month to 5 years, with acute diarrhoea, will be randomised to
      receive either saccharomyces boulardii, a combination probiotic (Lactobacillus acidophilus,
      Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus plantarum, Bifidobacterium
      infantis, Streptococcus thermophillus) or placebo, to determine if one shortens the duration
      of diarrhoea.
