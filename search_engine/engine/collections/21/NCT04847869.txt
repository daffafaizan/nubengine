      shown to improve swelling of central retina (macular oedema) and vision in patients with
      retinal vein occlusions (RVO), however this treatment comes with potentially sight
      threatening risks. A less invasive treatment might have many advantages. We recently showed
      that eyes with macular oedema caused by diabetes, the other main cause of macular oedema, who
      received treatment with near-infrared (NIR) light was not only safe but was also effective in
      reducing the swelling. The US Diabetic Retinopathy Research Collaboration are currently
      recruiting for a larger study of NIR light which may or may not confirm our findings. We
      propose to test the safety and efficacy of the same NIR light in patients with macular oedema
      from retinal vein occlusions. We anticipate this may reduce the need for injections of VEGF
      inhibitors in eyes with RVO, in particular eyes with good vision. This pilot study will help
      determine whether PBM with NIR for RVO warrants further investigation in a larger study.
