      ankle-brachial index) to individuals at intermediate cardiovascular risk.With these results,
      we will classify participants in: no atherosclerosis, mild, moderate and severe
      atherosclerosis, and therapeutic targets will be set according to pre-defined algorithms. The
      end-point will be the course of atherosclerosis measured by cIMT/CAC score (2 years) and the
      incidence of CVD at 5 years of follow-up.
