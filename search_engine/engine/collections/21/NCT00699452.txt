      symptomatic aortic stenosis referred to the Helsinki University Central Hospital for
      consideration of valve replacement surgery. Patients who can be put on the hospital's normal
      waiting list for elective angiography (i.e who do not need urgent surgery) and who give their
      informed consent, will be randomized into two groups to start therapy with candesartan (8
      mg/d for 2 weeks, and then 16 mg/d until surgery) or placebo. On average, the overall
      duration of the drug intervention will be 3 months, i.e., the average time in our institution
      from referral to surgery. In addition, patients (n=50) undergoing aortic valve replacement
      surgery due to aortic regurgitation caused by dilation of the aortic root will be included.
      This population consists of both patients with early sclerotic, i.e., pre-stenotic, changes
      in their aortic valves (n=30) and of patients without any sclerotic or stenotic changes in
      their aortic valves (n=20). The group with sclerotic changes in their aortic valves (n=30)
      will be divided into two groups to receive candesartan (8 mg/d 2 wk, and then 16 mg/d until
      surgery) (n=15) or placebo (n=15). The removed aortic valves will be examined utilizing
      real-time PCR, autoradiography, fluorometry, immunohistochemistry, double immunofluorescence,
      confocal microscopy, and enzyme immunoassays. With these techniques, several markers of
      inflammation, calcification, fibrosis, and the amount of lipid accumulation and oxidation of
      LDL in the valves will be examined.
