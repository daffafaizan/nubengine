    
      Emerging infectious diseases such as the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic cause
      substantial morbidity and mortality. During the early emergent phases of such diseases, there
      is often no vaccine to prevent infection, nor specific therapeutic agent to treat the
      disease. The objective of this protocol is the collection of immune plasma from persons
      post-recovery from COVID-19 or vaccination against SARS-CoV-2. This plasma may potentially be
      used in the treatment or prophylaxis of active COVID-19 under other protocols.

      Candidates will be screened for eligibility to participate in plasma donations and their
      blood levels of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Enrolled subjects will receive a baseline physical
      and laboratory examination. Subjects with sufficient anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers who meet
      standard blood bank criteria for plasma donation will then be scheduled for plasma
      collections. Plasmapheresis is the preferred method of collection, with up to 800 mL of
      plasma collected per donation depending on the weight of the donor. Collected immune plasma
      will be tested for blood-borne pathogens, and stored according to standard blood bank
      procedures. The scope of this protocol is limited to collection of plasma from subjects with
      sufficiently high anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titer. Any administration of

      convalescent immune plasma to subjects will be performed under a separate protocol.
