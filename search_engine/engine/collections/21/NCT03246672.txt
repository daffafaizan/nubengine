      Calls will be made weekly in the first month (weeks 1, 2, 3, 4) and biweekly calls during
      months 2-4 (weeks 6, 8, 10, 12, 14). The goal of this intervention is to increase adherence
      to recommendations that patients are already receiving from their bariatric team as part of
      standard of care. Thus, each call will address maintenance skill building and anticipatory
      problem solving based on the processes outlined in the investigators' conceptual model and
      operationalized in the investigators' previous weight loss maintenance protocol. Relapse
      prevention planning will help patients identify situations in which overeating is common in
      the bariatric population (e.g., loss of control eating related to emotions, disinhibition).
