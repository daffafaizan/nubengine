      participate in a randomized, active control study to examine the impact of mindfulness-based
      stress reduction (MBSR) on blood pressure, muscle sympathetic nerve activity and arterial
      stiffness. The study will utilize established techniques for assessing blood pressure
      patterns (24-hour ambulatory monitoring), peripheral sympathetic activity (microneurography)
      and vascular stiffness (applanation tonometry) in humans. This study includes a stress
      management education class for the active control.
