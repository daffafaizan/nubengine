      Merle D'Aubigne score and UCLA Activity Level Rating at 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, 4
      years, 5 years and 10 years post-operative. Merle D'Aubigne score evaluation was removed per

      incidence and pattern of radiological signs at 10 years post surgery. Data collected outside
      of the protocol included Oxford Hip Score and SF-12 for mental and physical well-being at 10
      years post surgery and revision for any reason.
