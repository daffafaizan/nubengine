    
      1. To gather pilot data on the incidence of autonomic dysfunction in patients with Multiple
           Myeloma prior to treatment with Bortezomib.

        2. To characterize the changes in the ANS including the fluctuations in blood pressure
           (hypotension /hypertension) associated with bortezomib.

        3. To determine the duration of the ANS dysfunction if present.

      This is not a treatment study, only an evaluation of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) among
      subjects receiving antimyeloma therapy which includes bortezomib (Velcade).
