      expected to rise due to a sedentary life-style, poor dietary choices, rising prevalence of
      diabetes and longer life-expectancy.

      The most common presentation of symptomatic PAD is intermittent claudication - pain on
      activity. In some cases the reduction in blood flow is so severe that it causes pain at rest,
      ulceration or gangrene (chronic limb threatening ischemia, CLTI). Approximately 5% of
      individuals between the age of 55 and 74 in the UK have IC or CLTI. Compared to age-matched
      individuals, these patients are more likely to suffer cardiovascular events - heart attack
      and strokes and cognitive impairment (10). Of those with IC, 5% will progress to CLTI. In
      patients with CLTI the one-year risk of limb amputation is 30% and five-year all-cause
      mortality is 50%, similar to various advanced forms of cancer. Recognition and management are
      essential to reducing the limb and life loss sequela.

      Management of these high-risk individuals is shared between primary care (diagnosis,
      treatment of cardiovascular risk-factors, rehabilitation) and secondary care (vascular
      reconstruction, amputation, specialist management of cardiovascular disease).

      This mutli-centre prospective cohort study will investigate the explore the educational
      experience of UK primary care health practitioners for peripheral arterial disease (PAD),
      including identification of factors that shape their preferred learning style and assess
      health professionals opinions of PAD recognition and management.
