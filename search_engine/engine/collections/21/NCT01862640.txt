      disease and related dementias and develop in the majority of dementia participants. The
      presence of agitation in participants with Alzheimer's disease places a significant burden
      not only on participants and their caregivers but also on the healthcare system.

      This is a trial designed to assess the safety and efficacy of brexpiprazole in the treatment
      of participants with agitation associated with dementia of the Alzheimer's Type. The trial
      consists of a continuous 12-week double-blind treatment period with a 30-day follow-up. The
      trial population will include male and female participants between 55 and 90 years of age
      (inclusive) with a diagnosis of probable Alzheimer's disease, who are residing either in an
      institutionalized setting or in a non-institutionalized setting where the participant is not
      living alone.
