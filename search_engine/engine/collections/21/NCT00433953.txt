      whether the inter-patient variability in mycophenolic acid (MPA) pharmacokinetics and
      exposure, adverse events and clinical response in pediatric transplant patients (ages 2-18
      years) is associated with identifiable pharmacogenetic factors. Specific aims: 1.) To
      determine whether common polymorphic variations in the uridine
      diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) are associated with inter-individual variability
      in MPA pharmacokinetics and exposure (by affecting MPA metabolism). 2.) To determine whether
      common polymorphic variations in the uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) are
      associated with inter-patient differences in the incidence of adverse events (by affecting
      the formation of the acyl-glucuronide metabolite). Enrolled subjects will have been receiving
      mycophenolate mofetil as part of their clinical standard of care. It is anticipated that the
      clinical portion of the study will last up to 4 hours at one study visit to include one
      pharmacogenetic blood sample and 4 pharmacokinetic blood samples collected out to 3 hours
      post-dose. Safety data to be collected will include standard of care physical exam and safety
      laboratory tests as well as data on adverse events and clinical outcomes.
