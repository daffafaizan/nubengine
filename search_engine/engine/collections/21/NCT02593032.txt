      disposable trays that separate their medication by dose and time (e.g. morning, afternoon,
      evening). These pre-filled trays are inserted into a connected, weekly pillbox that detects
      when pills are removed from its wells. Using this information, TowerView Health system is
      able to send automated text messages or phone reminders to patients to take forgotten or
      ignored medication doses. Medication adherence data from deployed pillboxes populates a
      software platform, which a research coordinator can access.

      Patients who miss 3 consecutive doses or 5 doses out of 12 over a 4-day period trigger an
      alert for the study research coordinator who can contact the patient via phone call. The
      research coordinator follows a scripted motivational interview in his or her outreach to
      determine the etiology of non-adherence. Patients reporting worrisome symptoms will be
      instructed to contact their provider directly and/or go to the emergency room for immediate
      attention. The investigator acknowledges that the current study actually involves multiple
      interventions: 1. The pre-filled medication trays are provided by a pharmacist, which
      overcomes medication access issues as well as the inconvenience of manually organizing
      medications. 2. The electronic pillbox, which monitors adherence that triggers text message
      or phone reminders in instances where patients forget or ignore medication doses 3. Research
      coordinator alerts, which trigger outreach events that employ a motivational interview in
      order to improve patient adherence.
