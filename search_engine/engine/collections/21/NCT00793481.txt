      microvasculature of patients with Metabolic Syndrome and diabetic mellitus, and patients with
      Diabetic Peripheral and Autonomic Neuropathy, versus non-diseased and predisposed subjects by
      evaluating the changes in oxygen metabolism. The Diffuse Optical Spectroscopy measure the
      changes in the concentration and oxygen saturation of hemoglobin in the microvasculature
      under stress, for example, during exercise and in response to changes in breathing habits.
      The sensitivity of Diffuse Optical Spectroscopy to tissue hemodynamics provides an impressive
      arena of useful clinical applications..
