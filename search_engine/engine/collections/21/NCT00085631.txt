      Compare local control, failure-free survival, and overall survival of patients with locally
      advanced carcinoma of the cervix treated with cisplatin and radiotherapy alone, versus
      cisplatin and radiotherapy with hyperthermia .

      OUTLINE:

      This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to participating
      center, disease stage (IIB or IIIA vs IIIB or IVA) and age (< 60 years vs â‰¥ 60 years).
      Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      LIMITATIONS:

      There are integrity issues with the currently available data, involving international
      institutions, in that several pieces of information relating to patient accrual and outcomes
      cannot be verified. Therefore, it would be inappropriate to report outcome measures for this
      study. Baseline measures of age and gender are reported for the entire study cohort.
      Participant flow is reported by treatment arm assignment, which was available for a majority
      of patients in the currently available data. Adverse events are reported for the entire
      cohort, as some adverse events could not be classified within a particular treatment arm.
