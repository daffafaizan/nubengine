      While the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is spreading across the world, infecting more than one
      million people, the fact that no specific drug or vaccine exists against any of the
      coronaviruses including the SARS, MERS and the novel coronavirus is creating fear among the
      people. world's COVID-19 count rises sharply day by day (active cases count more than one
      million people . Hydroxychloroquine is the only ray of hope now-a-days, along with different
      vaccine trials and passive immunisation therapy using 'convalescent plasma', target-specific
      drug discovery is of paramount importance right now.It has been well-known that SARS-CoV-2
      appears to be optimized for binding to the human receptor ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme
      2). The spike (S) glycoprotein of 2019-nCoV binds ACE2 with higher affinity than SARS-CoV S.
      Wrapp et al., (2020) also tested several published SARS-CoV RBD (receptor binding
      domain)-specific monoclonal antibodies and found that they do not have appreciable binding to
      2019-nCoV S. ACE2 is expressed in a variety of different tissues including both the upper and
      lower respiratory tract, myocardium and the gastrointestinal mucosa.

      hrsACE2 in SARS-CoV-2 infection:-

      The researchers used blood vessel and kidney organoids to demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 can
      directly infect and multiply within these tissues, a possible cause of the multi-organ
      failures and cardiovascular damage seen in severe COVID-19 cases. The addition of hrsACE2
      also reduced the SARS-CoV-2 infection in these organoids. the paper, published in Cell, shows
      that hrsACE2 had a dose dependent effect of viral growth of SARS-CoV-2 and was able to reduce
      it by a factor of 1,000 to 5,000 in cell cultures.

      Said Ali Mirazimi, adjunct professor at the Department of Laboratory Medicine at Karolinska
      Institutet and one of the study's corresponding authors. "We believe adding this enzyme copy,
      hrsACE2, lures the virus to attach itself to the copy instead of the actual cells… It
      distracts the virus from infecting the cells to the same degree and should lead to a
      reduction in the growth of the virus in the lungs and other organs." But treating with
      according to Bacterial ACE2 receptors -like enzyme of B38-CAP could be promising COVID-19
      infection- and lung injury preventing drug better than recombinant human ACE2 as rhACE2 is a
      glycosylated protein and thus its preparation requires time- and cost-consuming protein
      expression system with mammalian or insect cells, which may not be advantageous in drug
      development and medical economy Although it had been reported that an immune response is
      associated with the chronic infusion of rhACE2 resulting in the degradation of rhACE226, this
      was not observed for B38-CAP; there were no antibodies against B38-CAP detectable in the
      serum of mice infused with B38-CAP for 2 weeks. Implantation of B38-CAP-filled osmotic
      mini-pumps significantly suppressed Ang II-induced hypertension in conscious mice without
      affecting the heart rate. These results indicate that B38-CAP antagonizes the vasopressor
      effect of Ang II. So the principle investigator expects and suggests that treating with
      Recombinant Bacterial ACE2 receptors -like enzyme of B38-CAP could be promising COVID-19
      infection- and lung injury preventing drug better than recombinant human ACE2 in addition to
      brsACE2, expected to lure the virus to attach itself to the copy instead of the actual cells…
      It distracts the virus from infecting the cells to the same degree and should lead to a
      reduction in the growth of the virus in the lungs and other organs.

      This is a small pilot study investigating whether there is any efficacy signal that warrants
      a larger Phase 2B trial, or any harm that suggests that such a trial should not be done. It
      is not expected to produce statistically significant results in the major endpoints. The
      investigator will examine all of the biologic, physiological, and clinical data to determine
      whether a Phase 2B trial is warranted.

      Primary efficacy analysis will be carried only on patients receiving at least 4 doses of
      active drug. Safety analysis will be carried out on all patients receiving at least one dose
      of active drug.

      It is planned to enroll more than or equal to 24 subjects with COVID-19. It is expected to
      have at least 12 evaluable patients in each group.

      Experimental group: 0.4 mg/kg rbACE2 IV BID and standard of care Control group: standard of
      care Intervention duration: up to 7 days of therapy No planned interim analysis.
