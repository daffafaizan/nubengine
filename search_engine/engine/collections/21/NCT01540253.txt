    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the dose-limiting toxicities and identify the recommended phase II dose of
      the combination of docetaxel and BKM 120 (P13K inhibitor BKM120) in patients with advanced
      solid tumors.

      II. To determine the safety and tolerability of this combination. III. To determine any
      pharmacokinetic (PK) interaction between BKM12O and docetaxel.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess any preliminary evidence of efficacy with this combination in patients with
      advanced cancers.

      II. To evaluate phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase, catalytic subunit alpha
      (PIK3CA) mutations as predictive biomarkers of efficacy for the combination.

      III. To evaluate PIK3CA polymorphisms and polymorphisms in BKM120 transport and metabolism as
      predictors of toxicity and/or efficacy.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of PI3K inhibitor BKM120.

      Patients receive PI3K inhibitor BKM120 orally (PO) once daily (QD) and docetaxel
      intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.
