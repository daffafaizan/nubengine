      effect of 18 µg tiotropium vs placebo on FEV 1 (L)(forced expiratory capacity in one second),
      inspiratory capacity and functional residual volume. In addition, we will study the effect of
      18 µg tiotropium vs placebo on metronome paced hyperventilation induced dynamic
      hyperinflation. We will also evaluate the effect of tiotropium induced increase in IC
      (inspiratory capacity) vs extent of emphysema as evaluated on high resolution thin section CT
      lung
