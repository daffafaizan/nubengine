    
      This study is retrospective in design in that the MR images and other patient data, such as
      demographic data, will be collected from existing data for the selected patients meeting the
      inclusion criteria defined in this protocol. The study will be a multicenter study comparing
      interindividually two groups, one group of patients having received MULTIHANCE at a standard
      dose of 0.10 mmol/kg and the other group a dose of 0.05 mmol/kg for their clinically
      indicated MRI examination.

      In order to minimize selection bias, recruitment will start with the "Final Date" of this
      protocol and, working backward chronologically from all the MR examinations stored in the
      local site Picture Archiving and Communication Systems (PACS), every patient meeting the
      inclusion criteria will be recruited for the study until the total number of patients (160)
      in each group will be reached.

      The images of all included patients will be prospectively reviewed in a blinded read.
