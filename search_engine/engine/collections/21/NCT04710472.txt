    
      The primary aim is to assess the feasibility and usability of a mobile app (MHapp) to remote
      register and monitor treatment side effects, lifestyle habits and clinical data in cancer
      patients.

      This is a phase II randomized controlled trial with two study arms:

      Arm MH - mobile Mentora app to monitor and track treatment side-effects, vital signs,
      therapeutics and daily habits; Arm C - SOC

      No sham intervention is thought to be viable as we want to test the MHapp as a whole complex
      intervention with all different components and compare it with current SOC. Patients will be
      screened at oncology visits for inclusion criteria. It is not viable also to blind clinicians
      once the app provides a detailed progress report of which we want to assess the impact on
      oncology care and clinical team satisfaction. We will blind statisticians and people
      performing the final analysis.

      Once agreeing to enrol, patients will be randomly allocated to one of the study arms through
      a computer generated sequence of numbers, concealed from the clinical staff and patients.

      8.1 Study design and Population

      Randomized controlled clinical trial with two arms - arm MH (intervention with the MH app)
      and arm C (controls - standard of care). We will recruit 50 cancer patients in systemic
      treatments in Portuguese hospitals with oncology service.

      Inclusion criteria:

      adults (18 years old or older) with a cancer diagnosis at any stage Receiving systemic
      chemotherapy not in the context of a clinical trial, with treatment expected to continue for
      at least three months counting from time of enrollment fluent in written Portuguese with a
      personal mobile smartphone (android or iphone any version) willing to give informed consent
      for study participation

      Exclusion criteria:

      Cognitive impairment or disability that limits capacity to comply with study interventions
      and assessments Having a life expectancy < 3 months as determined by the attending oncologist
      ECOG performance status greater than 2 Unable to read and comprehend portuguese language text
      Participants will remain on study until discontinuation of cancer treatment, voluntary
      withdrawal, or death.
