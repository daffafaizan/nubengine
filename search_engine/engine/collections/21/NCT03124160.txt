      months: including screening and enrollment (up to 30 days to meet enrollment criteria), 37
      months of participation, and a post-removal follow up telephone call 17 days post-removal.
      After enrollment, subject visits occur at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 24 months,
      with telephone calls at 9, 18, and 30 months and seen again at 37 months for their final
      visit. Subjects will use a home pregnancy test 17 days post-removal of the IUD or Exit Visit
      procedures, whichever occurs first, and called by the site for the result and for safety
      follow-up.

      Subject recruitment is expected to begin Q2 (in the second quarter of) 2017 and is planned to
      continue through Q2 2018. However, if the enrollment rate declines, the enrollment period may
      be extended beyond this date. If this enrollment timeline is met, all subjects should finish
      active treatment by approximately the end of Q2 2021. The total duration of the study will be
      approximately 48 months for each study site including pre- and post- trial activities. The
      end of the study will occur when the last subject to be enrolled has completed her
      post-removal pregnancy test telephone call.

      Total duration of the project is expected to be five years. Preliminary results of the study
      are expected to be available Q4 of 2019 based on the current study plan.
