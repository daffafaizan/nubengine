      I. Determine the uptake of motexafin lutetium in tumors and normal tissue of patients with
      intra-abdominal malignancies or non-small cell lung cancer.

      II. Determine the ratio of tumor to normal tissue by measuring the level of motexafin
      lutetium uptake in tumor and normal tissue removed from these patients.

      III. Determine the pattern, presence, and level of EF5 binding (as a surrogate marker for
      hypoxia) in tumors of these patients.

      IV. Determine the feasibility of measuring optical properties, tissue oxygenation, motexafin
      lutetium concentration, fluorescence, and blood flow by non-invasive means in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, diagnostic study. Patients are stratified according to
      diagnosis (intra-abdominal malignancy vs non-small cell lung cancer).

      Patients receive EF5 IV over 1-2.5 hours on day 1 and motexafin lutetium IV over 10-15
      minutes on day 2. Patients undergo definitive surgical resection approximately 3 hours after
      motexafin lutetium administration. Hypoxia and motexafin lutetium levels in the resected
      tumors are evaluated. Tumor to normal tissue ratios are also determined.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at approximately 1-8 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients (20 with intra-abdominal malignancies and 10 with
      non-small cell lung cancer) will be accrued for this study within 10-15 months.
