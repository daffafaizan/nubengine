      at Clear Passage (CP) with a diagnosis of endometriosis. These patients have completed
      multiple questionnaires as a standard of care for outcome monitoring in the clinic setting,
      no new data will be collected. The second segment is a prospective observational, online
      questionnaire based study of female subjects with a diagnosis of endometriosis not treated at
      CP. Data on the impact of quality of life (QOL) over time of subjects not treated at CP will
      be assessed using the same questionnaire used as standard of care in the clinic twice, 30
      days apart. This will be accomplished using online forms with subjects able to complete the
      questionnaires with ease via the internet. The data obtained from the untreated subjects will
      allow for reporting of overall impact on QOL in this population, as well as provide a control
      group for assessment of improvement for manual therapy interventions for patients with
      endometriosis.
