      to be highly bioavailable and likely to cause few sensory problems when added to food. It is
      therefore a potentially effective iron additive for the food industry and is particularly
      formulated for adding to liquids. A randomized cross-over trial will be undertaken to compare
      the absorption of iron added to a commercial apple juice drink as MDFP with iron added as
      ferrous sulphate. The null hypothesis is that absorption of iron added as MDFP is not
      different to absorption from iron added as ferrous sulphate.

      The study population will consist of 16 women (age 18-65) with iron stores at the lower end
      of the normal range. This group will efficiently absorb bioavailable iron and will be
      sensitive to differences in bioavailability between different forms of iron. Test drinks
      containing added iron, labelled with stable isotopes of iron (Fe-57 or Fe-58), will be
      consumed on two consecutive days. Iron absorption from the drinks will be determined using
      the erythrocyte incorporation technique. A baseline blood sample will be taken prior to
      consuming the test drinks and then a second blood sample will be taken 14 days after the last
      test drink. Iron absorption will be calculated from the isotopic enrichment of the final
      blood sample, assuming that 80% of absorbed iron is incorporated into red blood cells. The
      order in which the volunteers will be given the MDFP or ferrous sulphate will be randomised.
