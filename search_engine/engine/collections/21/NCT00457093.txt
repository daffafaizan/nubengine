      Depending of their design, these studies have shown both insulins lower the fasting glucose,
      A1c, the incidence of hypoglycemia and are associated with less weight gain than NPH. In the
      only direct comparison study of these two basal insulins, insulin detemir demonstrated
      significantly less day to day variation than glargine as measured by glucose infusion rated
      during an euglycemic clamp study. Given the same incidence of hypoglycemia, this last study
      would suggest that insulin detemir treatment could achieve target glucose control more than
      glargine. We have used continuous glucose monitoring (CGMS) extensively in our practice. CGMS
      is arguably the most sensitive method for detecting differences in glycemic control in the
      outpatient setting and there by allowing fine adjustments in insulin treatment. When
      comparing insulin glargine to preprogrammable basal insulin as delivered by continuous
      subcutaneous infusion and using CGMS, we have shown significantly better glucose control with
      continuous subcutaneous infusion, We have also developed a method of daily insulin dosage
      adjustments during a continuous CGMS study from daily glucose tracings downloaded. This
      allows for an even more accurate basal insulin replacement per set glycemic goal. This
      protocol addresses a comparison of insulin glargine and insulin detemir for patients
      evaluated by CGMS.
