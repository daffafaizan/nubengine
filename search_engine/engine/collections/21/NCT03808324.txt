      complications that are likely to affect quality of life and survival. The most common cause
      of death during the later stages after heart transplantation is cardiac allograft
      vasculopathy, followed by unexplained graft dysfunction. In this study, advanced imaging
      techniques will be used to describe the frequency of these two complications, examine
      possible risk factors and study consequences on functional capacity and quality of life.
      Further, the investigators will investigate whether it is feasible to screen for these
      conditions with non-invasive imaging methods. By studying patients that have performed
      cardiac transplantation between 10 and 20 years ago, the investigators expect to have a
      significant proportion of patients with these pathological conditions. Methods that will be
      used include cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, coronary flow velocity reserve assessment,
      right heart catheterization and coronary imaging with angiography and optical coherence
      tomography.
