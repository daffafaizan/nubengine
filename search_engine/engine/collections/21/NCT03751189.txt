      23% to 35%, respectively . 50% of school children have sustained traumatic injuries prior to
      graduation . A contributing factors make children susceptible to injuries have been widely
      investigated. These factors included Class-II, div.1 malocclusion, increased overjet . 71% to
      92% of all injuries sustained in a lifetime occur before the age of 19 years, which occur at
