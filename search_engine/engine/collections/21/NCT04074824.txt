      that predominantly affects preterm neonates. The incidence is estimated to be 7-10% in ver
      low birth weight (VLBW) neonates (Lin and Stoll, 2006; Neu and Walker, 2011). However, a
      significant proportion of affected neonates (20-30%) develops severe progressive disease with
      intestinal necrosis and complications resulting in gut perforation and peritonitis which
      require urgent surgical intervention (surgical cases) (Sharma et al., 2006). The mortality
      rate of surgical cases is high (25-50%), and may increase to 100% in patients with
      pan-necrosis of the bowel. Those neonates who survived often suffer severe morbidity,
      including short bowel syndrome, parenteral nutrition-associated cholestasis, poor physical
      growth and neurodevelopmental impairment (Neu and Walker, 2011; Salhab et al., 2004).
      However, the etiology and pathophysiology of NEC remain incompletely understood. The current
      knowledge has directed towards multiple predisposing factors which include prematurity,
      immature gut mucosa and host defense immunity, formula milk feeding and altered microbial
      colonization in the gut resulting in excessive inflammatory response, leading to irreversible
      intestinal cell death and gut necrosis (Neu and Walker, 2011; Chan et al., 2013). To date, no
      genetic risk markers or biomarkers are available for reliable prediction of neonates who are
      at high risk of developing NEC. Besides host genetic factors, gut bacteria have been reported
      to predispose neonates to disease risk (Mai et. al., 2011; Neu and Pammi, 2018).

      In this study, we shall conduct a GWAS on Chinese preterm neonates for identification of
      genetic risks for NEC and determine gut microbiome structure (enterotype) of NEC.
