      including recurrent hereditary periodic fever syndromes. Although end-stage renal disease
      related to AA amyloidosis is well characterized, there is limited data concerning patient and
      graft outcomes after renal transplantation, with most of the findings reported from small
      series. Recurrence of amyloidosis in the renal allograft might be underdiagnosed, assessing
      graft and patient outcomes in larger study groups will bring better understanding and new
      strategies in daily practice.
