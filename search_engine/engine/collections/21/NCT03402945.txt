      chest wound remain a common life threatening complication of heart surgery that is
      preventable. Antibiotic prophylaxis is well accepted to be the cornerstone of prevention for
      these infections. The best choice of antibiotic prophylaxis in patients undergoing open heart
      surgery is, however, unclear. A large number of relevant pathogens are not covered by the
      primarily recommended antibiotic for prophylaxis, and there is a large variability in the
      antibiotics physicians use in practice and a lack of evidence supporting these choices.
      Appropriate management of the wound is probably also highly relevant in terms of infection
      prevention; however, there is a lack of strong evidence guiding the choice of wound
      management strategies as a means to reduce surgical site infection. The proposed study will
      test whether dual antibiotic prophylaxis is superior to single-agent prophylaxis with
      cefazolin, and shed light on whether or not modern negative-pressure wound management
      technology lower the risk of sternal surgical site infections.
