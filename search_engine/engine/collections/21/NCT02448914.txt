      comparable levodopa bioavailability and significantly reduced intra-patient variability in
      levodopa concentrations relative to oral administration. TRIGEL also contains a third
      ingredient, entacapone. In tablet form, entacapone is shown to improve the bioavailability of
      levodopa and might extend the half-life of levodopa, avoiding deep troughs in levodopa plasma
      levels, and providing more continuous delivery of levodopa to the brain.

      The intention with the study is to confirm that TRIGEL administration increases the area
      under the curve (AUC) for levodopa by combining levodopa, carbidopa, and entacapone and
      thereby lower the daily levodopa dose needed. It is expected that TRIGEL administration will
      result in a similar intra-patient variability in plasma levodopa concentrations as Duodopa
      during continuous administration.
