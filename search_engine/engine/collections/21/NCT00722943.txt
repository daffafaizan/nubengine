      of infants born premature, however, growth and developmental delays are common. Many factors
      contribute to poor postnatal growth and development including immature organ systems, stress
      due to illness and even routine care in the neonatal intensive care unit environment. Massage
      therapy is associated with decreased cortisol levels during stress in a variety of
      populations including premature infants. Massage has also been reported to improve postnatal
      weight gain in premature infants. Concerns about methodological quality, however, weaken the
      credibility of previous studies and prevent the integration of massage therapy into
      conventional medical practice. Therefore, we plan to study the interrelationship of the ANS
      and HPA axis in preterm infants to assess how developmental massage therapy (DMT) modulates
      physiologic stability and promotes postnatal growth by the following specific aims:

      SPECIFIC AIM 1: We will determine ANS balance, measured by heart period variability, before,
      during, and after DMT.

      SPECIFIC AIM 2: We will compare the relationships between ANS balance and HPA response before
      and after DMT.

      SPECIFIC AIM 3: We will evaluate somatotrophic response in premature infants who receive DMT.

      Infants will be stratified by gender and randomized to receive developmental massage therapy
      or SHAM control.

      This study will also allow for post-discharge assessment of development. Infants will return
      to the hospital at term, 3months and 6 months for multiple measurements and developmental
      testing.
