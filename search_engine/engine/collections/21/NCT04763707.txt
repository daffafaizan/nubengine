      high incidence of recurrence. Early diagnosis can significantly improve the overall survival
      of HCC patients. However, currently available diagnostic markers are still inadequate and
      limited by their low sensitivity and specificity. For instance, the gold standard marker
      alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) has a false negative rate up to 40% for early stage of HCC. It is
      worthy to mention that the level of AFP was reported in a normal range of 25% of patients
      with advanced HCC.

      As such, AFP has been excluded from being a marker for the diagnosis of HCC by Practice
      Guidelines of the American Association for the study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and confirmed
      by other studies.

      These discrepancies suggest the need of discovering new reliable diagnostic markers for
      patients with HCC. An improved understanding of the pathogenesis of HCC development would
      facilitate the development of more effective outcomes for the diagnosis and treatment of HCC
      at earlier stages.
