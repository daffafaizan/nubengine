    
      The study is composed of an initial screening phase (up to 3 weeks), a 4-week baseline phase,
      a 12-week double-blind treatment phase (DBTP), an open-label treatment phase (OLTP) for up to
      256 weeks, and an 8-week safety follow-up (12 weeks after the last dose of investigational
      product [IP]).

      In the DBTP participants were to be randomized in a 3:2:2:2 ratio to placebo, erenumab 7 mg,
      erenumab 21 mg, or erenumab 70 mg.

      During the open-label treatment phase, participants were to receive erenumab 70 mg QM from
      week 12 to week 264. After implementation of Protocol Amendment 3 (07 April 2016),
      participants remaining in the OLTP increased their dose to erenumab 140 mg QM up to week 264.
      The safety follow-up increased from an 8-week safety follow-up to a 12-week safety follow-up
      (16 weeks after the last dose of investigational product).

      During the OLTP participants enrolled at sites in the United States could enroll in an
      optional clinical home use (CHU) substudy, per a country-specific protocol amendment dated 20
      June 2016. Participants in the CHU substudy were to be randomized 1:1 into 1 of 2 treatment
      groups: erenumab 140 mg using a prefilled syringe or erenumab 140 mg using an
      autoinjector/pen. Day 1 of the CHU substudy corresponded with any OLTP study visit up through
      Week 256, as long as the participant had received at least 2 doses of erenumab 140 mg. During
      the CHU substudy, participants initially self-administered IP under site supervision on
      substudy day 1, and then self-administered IP at home on substudy days 29 and 57.
