      diabetes mellitus (DM)-associated complications. A major concern in DM-patients is renal
      impairment due to nephropathy leading to a reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR). It has
      been established that chronic (sub)clinical inflammation is crucial for the onset and
      progression of DM.

      CCL2, also known as Monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP 1) is a chemokine from the
      cysteine-cysteine family, secreted by leukocytes or tissue cells. CCL2 promotes monocyte
      emigration from the bone marrow, activates monocytes and macrophages and directs their
      migration to sites of inflammation. Recent animal studies and clinical trials indicate a
      critical involvement of CCL2 in DM and diabetic nephropathy, suggesting that CCL2 may be a
      potential target for therapeutic intervention in DM. Finally, protein overload and oxidative
      challenge of the diseased kidney was suggested to stimulate CCL2 expression in renal tubuli,
      thereby accelerating the progression of diabetic nephropathy.

      As NOX E36 is designed to specifically target human MCP-1/CCL2. This study is performed to
      evaluate the role of renal impairment for adequate dosing recommendations in the planned
      target population.
