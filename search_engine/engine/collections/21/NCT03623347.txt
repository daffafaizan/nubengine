      with severe neurological impairment that cannot benefit from first line temozolomide
      (TMZ)-based chemoradiotherapy. Bevacizumab (BEV), an antiangiogenic anti-VEGF-R monoclonal
      antibody, has a rapid impact on tumor-related brain edema in recurrent GB. The present study
      reports the feasibility and efficacy of an induction treatment with TMZ and BEV to alleviate
      the initial neurological impairment and/or to reduce the tumor volume before a delayed
      chemoradiotherapy.

      The investigators retrospectively analyzed tumor and target volumes and clinical neurological
      status in 39 patients with bulky GB and/or with severe neurological impairment after an
      induction treatment combining TMZ and BEV. Neurological and radiological responses were
      assessed according to RANO criteria.

      Calculating gross tumor and clinical target volumes (GTV and CTV) was done at diagnosis and
      before radiotherapy. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were
      determined by Kaplan Meier methods. Safety was reported according to NCTCAE.
