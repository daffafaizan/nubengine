      sensitization, central sensitization or both and determine effect size since there is no data
      regarding the presumed effect. These issues cannot be easily sorted out in patients
      experiencing postoperative pain and hypersensitivity, since surgery affects both components.
      In order to address this purpose the investigators will examine, in healthy volunteers, the
      effect of RIPC on a manipulation which generates hypersensitivity by an exclusive peripheral
      mechanism (ultraviolet B (UV-B) burn) and a manipulation which generates hypersensitivity by
      an exclusive central mechanism (topical capsaicin). Understanding the sites at which RIPC
      reduces the amplification of pain after injury will be useful in determining where it would
      be most logically applied clinically and in guiding preclinical mechanistic studies.
