      Changes in the individual's nutritional status and body composition may adversely affect the
      patient's postoperative level of activity.

      Aim. Thus, the purpose of the present study is to report changes in postoperative weight, FFM
      and functions vital to daily living in a group of elder orthopaedic patients that were
      actively involved in their nutritional care during the hospital stay.

      Method. The study comprises 253 patients aged 65+ and admitted either for hip- or knee
      replacement or with a fractured hip. Following a quasi-experimental design, 142 patients were
      allocated to the control group and 109 patients to the intervention group. The intervention
      programme focused on patients' involvement in their nutritional care. Body composition by bio
      impedance and functional status by a standard chart were assessed at admission and four
      months postoperatively.
