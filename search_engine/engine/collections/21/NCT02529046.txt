      supplementation associated with aerobic exercise on body fat and lipid profile in obese
      women. The investigators performed a randomized, double-blinded and placebo-controlled trial
      with 28 obese women who received 3.2 g/d of CLA or 4 g/d of olive oil (placebo group) while
      performing an 8-week protocol of aerobic exercise. Dietary intake (food record), body fat
      (DXA) and biochemical analysis (blood sample) were assessed before and after the intervention
      period.
