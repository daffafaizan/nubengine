      dosing of ASP3325 in hemodialysis patients. After washout period of therapeutic medication
      for hyperphosphatemia, six subjects will receive single oral administration of ASP3325
      (Tablet A) on a non-dialysis day (Day 1).

      [Part 2] This part is a 2-arm, open-label, uncontrolled study to evaluate PD, PK and safety
      with dosing ASP3325 Tablet B t.i.d. before or just after each meal.

      Eligible subjects at screening will be entered into the washout period for stopping their
      phosphate-binding treatment. 20 subjects with serum inorganic phosphorus (Pi) level between
      â‰¥6.0 and <10.0 mg/dL during the washout period (washout period week 1 or washout period week
      2) will be randomized to each treatment group and ASP3325 will be administered for 2 weeks
