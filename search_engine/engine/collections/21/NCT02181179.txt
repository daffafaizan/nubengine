      disease/mortality worldwide, smoking represents a major public health issue in need of
      effective interventions to reduce its burden. The development of such strategies is best
      directed by basic research on the biobehavioral processes underlying smoking maintenance and
      relapse. A major predictor of cessation failure is nicotine withdrawal, especially among
      individuals low in distress tolerance (DT).

      Reducing nicotine withdrawal-related distress and relapse in low DT smokers may require the
      regulation of certain hormones involved in the hypothalamic pituitary axis (HPA-axis) (i.e.,
      the human stress response). Regular practice of yoga, a mindfulness-based form of physical
      activity, emerges as a promising strategy for regulating the HPA-axis, decreasing withdrawal
      symptoms, and increasing DT, thus promoting smoking cessation success.

      We will randomly assign 50 smokers (â‰¥10 cigarettes daily) low in DT to either an 8-week yoga
      intervention [YOGA] or a waitlist control [WL] prior to undergoing a self-guided quit
      attempt. We hypothesize participants assigned to the yoga condition (relative to waitlist)
      will differ on various outcomes assessed throughout the intervention (e.g., quit status,
      negative affective states, stress, hormonal changes, withdrawal) and, quit day, and
      throughout the 2-week quit follow-up period.

      More specifically, we hypothesize that certain typical maladaptive, during-withdrawal changes
      may be attenuated through YOGA. We also hope to obtain initial effect sizes of the advantage
      of yoga compared to waitlist for point-prevalent abstinence at two weeks following an unaided
      quit attempt.
