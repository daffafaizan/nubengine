        -  Determine the overall survival of patients with primary or recurrent retroperitoneal
           sarcomas treated with neoadjuvant doxorubicin and ifosfamide, radiotherapy, and surgical
           resection.

        -  Assess local-regional control in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the disease-free survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the pathologic response in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the complications in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive doxorubicin IV continuously on days 1-3 and ifosfamide IV over 3
      hours on days 1-4. Patients also receive filgrastim (G-CSF) beginning on day 5 and continuing
      until blood counts recover. Treatment repeats every 21 days for a maximum of 4 courses in the
      absence of unacceptable toxicity. Beginning 2-4 weeks after chemotherapy, patients undergo
      radiotherapy daily, 5 days a week, for 5-6 weeks. Beginning 4-7 weeks after radiotherapy,
      patients undergo complete surgical resection with intraoperative or postoperative
      radiotherapy or brachytherapy.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 48 patients will be accrued for this study within 24 months.
