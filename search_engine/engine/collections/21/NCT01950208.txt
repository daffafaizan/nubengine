      instruments regarding follow-up examinations in the field of knee surgery. PubMed.gov was
      searched for knee-specific terms (knee, surgery, joint, lower extremity) combined with
      psychometric (follow-up, validity, reliability, responsiveness) and instrument-specific terms
      (self-reported, patient-based, measurement tool, outcome measure, questionnaire). Hence, the
      KOOS, IKDC, Lysholm, WOMET and Tegner Score were identified as frequent used and valid
      measurement tools in the evaluation of knee joint function. After analysing each single
      question of these questionnaires for coincidences regarding measurement of specific knee
      function, the identified items were condensed to one single question for each specific item.
      Typical functional abilities (flexion/extension) were depicted as photographs. Thus, one
      single questionnaire with a total of 33 questions divided in five subscales (Symptoms, Pain,
      Work and Activities of daily life, Sports and Recreational activities, Physical function and
      knee related Quality of Life), was created.
