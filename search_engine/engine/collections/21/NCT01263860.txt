      Southern China. Recent study implied chronic hepatitis C genotype 6 responds better to the
      48-week treatment with pegylated interferon and ribavirin than genotype 1. Approximately
      75.7% obtain sustained virological response (HCV RNA undetectable 24 weeks after treatment)
      to this approach. However, the treatment is associated with many and sometimes serious side
      effects. In addition, the treatment is costly also in economical terms. Shorter treatment for
      chronic hepatitis C genotype 6 is necessary to be assessed.

      In this randomised,open label,multicenter phase 3 trial with active controls patients are
      treated with pegylated interferon alfa 2a (180ug/week)and ribavirin(800-1200mg based on
      weight)for 4 weeks. Those who are HCV RNA negative at week 4 (<50 IU; Cobas Amplicor Monitor
      Test, Roche Diagnostic) are defined as rapid virological responders and randomised to either
      an additional 20 or 44 weeks combination treatment. Patients who are HCV RNA positive are all
      treated for 44 more weeks. The endpoint is sustained virological response defined as
      undetectable HCV RNA 24 weeks after end of treatment.

      Our hypothesis is that there is no important difference in the effect in the two groups.

      This is a non-inferiority trial. The smallest difference considered to be clinically
      important is 15%. Thus to state "non-inferiority" the 95% confidence interval of the observed
      difference between the groups shall not overlap 10%. Both intention to treat and and per
      protocol analyses will be published. Conclusion will be conservative and based on the
      analysis who detect the biggest difference.
