      steroid withdrawal starting at three months after transplantation. The entry criteria include
      1) no episode of clinically treated nor biopsy confirmed acute rejection up to entry; 2)
      serum creatinine level equal to or less than 2 mg/mL on three separate measurements; 3) no
      proteinuria (urine protein less than 1000 mg/24 hours; 4) tacrolimus trough level > 5 ng/ml
      without signs of nephrotoxicity; 5) agreement to follow the study protocol.

      For the patients who enter into the protocol, prednisolone would be slowly withdrawn by 2.5
      mg in every two weeks until 8 weeks after entering the protocol (5 months
      post-transplantation). The patients visit every week, and they are closely monitored with
      symptoms and signs, blood cell count, chemistry, and urinalysis.
