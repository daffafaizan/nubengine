      effect of a proton pump inhibitor and strong metabolic inducer on the PK of a single 50 mg
      dose of alisertib administered as enteric-coated tablets (ECTs).

      The study enrolled 55 patients. Participants received either:

        -  Esomeprazole 40 mg and Alisertib 50 mg

        -  Rifampin 600 mg and Alisertib 50 mg

      All participants were asked to take one tablet of alisertib either once or twice daily in all
      cycles. In Cycle 2, participants were asked to take alisertib plus either esomeprazole or
      rifampin.

      This trial was conducted the United States. The overall time to participate in this study was
      10 months. Participants made multiple visits to the clinic plus a final visit, 30 days after
      receiving their last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.
