    
      Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a common and debilitating chronic degenerative disease of the
      articular cartilage. Despite recent progress in the field of cartilage imaging, no routinely
      used clinical imaging modality has the ability to evaluate and monitor changes in cartilage
      degeneration. This observationnal, pilot, prospective, non randomized, uncontrolled,
      monocentric study aim to compare three of the most innovative imaging systems, namely the 9,4
      Tesla MRI, the FFOCT (Full-Field Optical Coherence Tomography) and the ultrasound-based
      navigation system in order to image healthly to severely degraded human cartilage samples.
      All methods will be cross-correlated and compared with histological data considered as the
      gold standard.
