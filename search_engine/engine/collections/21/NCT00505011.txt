      extensively investigated regarding the susceptibility to thyroid cancer, their influence in
      thyroid autoimmune diseases risk is still largely unknown. Hence, this study was designed to
      assess the influence of GSTT1, GSTM1, GSTP1, CYP1A1 and 72TP53 polymorphic inheritance on the
      susceptibility to Graves' disease and to its response to the treatment.
