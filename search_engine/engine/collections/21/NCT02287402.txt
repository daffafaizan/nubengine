      one of the most commonly used oral antidiabetic agents in Japan. Voglibose is used as
      first-line treatment for improvement of postprandial hyperglycemia in diabetic patients with
      inadequate response to diet and exercise therapy and as add-on treatment to other oral
      antidiabetic drugs and insulin. In 2009, voglibose was approved in Japan for the management
      of prediabetes (IGT).

      This study was a single-group, multi-center, open-label study. The study period consisted of
      a screening period of 1 week or less, a treatment period of 96 weeks or more, and a follow-up
      period of 48 weeks. However, if a patient was assessed as having type 2 diabetes mellitus or
      normoglycemia, the treatment period was to be ended, and only those assessed as normoglycemic
      were to proceed to follow-up. Follow-up was also to be terminated if patients were assessed
      as having IGT or type 2 diabetes mellitus during follow-up.
