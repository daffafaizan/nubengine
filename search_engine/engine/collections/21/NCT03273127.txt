    
      This is a randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess PK and safety of
      abediterol 5 μg DPI given QD for 9 days, compared to placebo, in patients with asthma on
      ICSs. It is planned that 12 patients with asthma will be randomized into the study, of which
      9 will receive abediterol 5 μg and 3 will receive placebo. The entire study period is
      scheduled to take a maximum of 41 days (follow-up included) for each individual patient.
      During the screening period, all patients will take their own baseline inhaled
      corticosteroids. Patients on long-acting β2-agonist/inhaled corticosteroids will be switched
      over to the respective inhaled corticosteroid mono-component at Visit 1. Patients will be
      provided salbutamol as rescue medication for use throughout the study. Each patient will
      receive a single inhaled dose of abediterol or placebo in the morning of Days 1 to 9 (Visits
      3 to 8) under supervision of the Investigator or designee.
