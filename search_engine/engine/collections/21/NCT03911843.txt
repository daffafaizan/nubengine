      weight, HbA1c% and device for insulin therapy.

      The preparation of omega-3 administered was a highly purified fish oil to avoid pollutants,
      containing a mixture of omega-3 long chain fatty acids standardized for contents of
      eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in a 2: 1 ratio, in capsules or in
      liquid form. The liquid preparation was used in the case of difficulties in swallowing
      capsules or concomitant celiac disease because it was certified as gluten-free (Ener Zone
      Omega 3 RXÂ® Equipe Enervit). The preparations contained antioxidants to preserve omega-3
      LCFA, tocopherol (1 mg in 1 g of omega-3 LCFA), palmitate, and rosemary extract. EPA and DHA
      were administered at 50-60 mg/kg/day for 12 months. The investigation of Arachidonic Acid
      (AA)/EPA ratios was performed in cases on recruitment (T0), and repeated after 3 (T3), 6
      (T6), and 12 months (T12).

      Cholecalciferol supplementation was fixed at 1000 IU/day (25 mcg/day), both in cases and
      controls. Vitamin D level was determined as 25(OH)D level at the clinical onset of T1D, at
      T0, T3, T6, and T12 in cases, and at clinical onset of controls.
