    
      -  To obtain skin biopsy samples from normal healthy volunteers and patients with a benign,
           inherited hematologic disease, such as sickle cell anemia, to create induced pluripotent
           stem cells. Pluripotency will be confirmed by injecting potential iPS cell lines into
           immunodeficient mice, assessing the ability of each line to cause cystic teratomas in
           recipient mice.

        -  To define the efficiency of homologous recombination in induced pluripotent stem cells
           derived from skin biopsy samples.

        -  To define the efficiency of homologous recombination in human embryonic stem cells using
           NIH-approved cell lines.

        -  To establish the genetic consequences of the derivation of human induced pluripotent
           cells in normal controls or patients with benign, inherited, hematologic diseases, by
           genomic analysis, including whole genome sequencing.

        -  To establish the genetic consequences of homologous recombination in human induced
           pluripotent stem cells and embryonic stem cells by genomic analysis, including whole
           genome sequencing.

        -  To obtain blood samples to confirm genetic mutations in patients with an inherited
           hematologic disease (and to confirm no mutations in healthy volunteers).
