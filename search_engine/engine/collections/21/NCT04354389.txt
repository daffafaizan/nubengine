      Twenty-two (n=22) subjects with COVID-19 and clinically significant impairment of respiratory
      function will be enrolled to evaluate the two dosing regimens (4.5mg-q.d or 4.5mg-b.i.d) of
      DAS181. At the end of Stage 1, the Sponsor will evaluate the dose regimen based on the safety
      and efficacy assessments of the data. An optimal dose will be selected to proceed to Stage 2.

      The second stage is a randomized, placebo-controlled and double-blind study to expand
      enrollment with an additional eighty-two (n=82) subjects to provide adequate power to
      potentially demonstrate statistically significant therapeutic efficacy.
