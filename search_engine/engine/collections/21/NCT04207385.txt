      medication is mainly based on experience. The study mainly optimizes the treatment path from
      two perspectives: to help clinicians select drugs accurately through the detection of PGx; to
      help clinicians monitor the whole process of drug use through TDM and adjust the dosage in
      time to achieve better treatment.

      PGx tests take the information of metabolic, transporting and target genetic factors into
      account comprehensively. Furthermore, clinical effects depend on blood concentration rather
      than dose concentration. TDM aims to monitor blood concentration, which is related to drug
      efficacy and toxicity.
