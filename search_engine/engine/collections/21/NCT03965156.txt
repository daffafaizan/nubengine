    
      Sample size: Assuming that Mean±SD of reduced pain scores in erector spinae plane block is
      4.7±3.7 versus 2.5±1 in transversus abdominis plane block.So, the total sample size is 48
      cases (24 in each group) using Open Source Statistics for Public Health (open Epi) with
      confidence interval 95% and power of test is 80%.

      d) Method of sample collection:

      Forty eight female patients will be divided into two groups by a computer-generated
      randomization table:

      Group (ES) (n=24): will receive bilateral ultrasound guided erector spinae plane block with
      each block 20 ml of bupivacaine 0.375% plus 5ug/ml adrenaline (1:200000) at the level of T9.

      Group (TA) (n=24): will receive bilateral ultrasound guided transversus abdominis plane block
      with each block 20 ml of bupivacaine 0.375% plus 5ug/ml adrenaline (1:200000).
