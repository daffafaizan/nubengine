      widespread in its application for patients that are high risk for hypoxemia, both in critical
      care and emergency settings. Therefore, high flow nasal oxygenation continues to be studied
      in airway management for preoxygenation, as well as maintenance of oxygenation in airway
      procedures. Optiflow™, a humidified high flow nasal cannula, has already been shown to be
      useful in preventing desaturation during intubation in ICU patients versus the
      non-rebreathing mask, in addition to, prolonging safe apnea time in patients with potential
      difficult airways. Additionally, preoxygenation with HFNC prior to intubation of patients in
      hypoxemic respiratory failure has also been shown to decrease desaturation during apnea
      compared to preoxygenation with traditional bag valve mask. The morbidly obese patient
      presents a separate group of challenges to the anesthesiologist in regards to mask
      ventilation and intubation. Obesity (along with other factors) has been shown to contribute
      to difficulty with mask ventilation. Obese patients have altered respiratory physiology,
      including decreased functional residual capacity, increased oxygen consumption and lower
      tidal volumes, as compared to the non-obese patient. These factors contribute to obese
      patients potentially having a shorter apnea time before desaturating during induction of
      general anesthesia, as compared to the non-obese patient. Weight is inversely correlated with
      safe apnea time. Optiflow™ may provide an opportunity to prolong apnea time in the morbidly
      obese patient population. If demonstrated to be efficacious as a method for preoxygenation
      and prolongation of apneic time, this could provide a safer environment for intubation in
      this particular patient population.
