      (GA) in early childhood may be at increased risk of subsequent learning disabilities and
      behavioural problems. Animal studies have shown that exposure to GA agents during critical
      neuro-developmental windows induces neuronal apoptosis. All commonly used anaesthetic agents
      induce neurotoxicity with the exception of dexmedetomidine, a highly specific alpha-2 agonist
      which has been shown to be neuroprotective.

      GA is the current standard of care for inguinal hernia repair in infants at KKH. The
      investigators recently demonstrated that dexmedetomidine sedation with caudal block is a
      feasible alternative for inguinal hernia repair in infants below 3 months of age. This
      prospective randomized controlled trial will compare the early and long-term outcomes of
      infants following inguinal hernia surgery using dexmedetomidine sedation with caudal block
      versus GA with caudal block.

      This study aims:

        1. To compare the neurodevelopment at 6 months and 2years, of infants randomized to
           dexmedetomidine sedation with caudal block with those randomized to GA with caudal block
           for inguinal hernia surgery before 3 months of age.

        2. To compare the efficacy of dexmedetomidine sedation with caudal block versus GA with
           caudal block for inguinal hernia surgery, in terms of duration of anaesthesia, duration
           of surgery and surgeon's satisfaction with intraoperative conditions.
