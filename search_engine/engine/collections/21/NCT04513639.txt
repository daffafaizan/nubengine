      autologous stem cell support will be included in the phase II part of the study and receive
      standard of care first line treatment according to Norwegian national guidelines; bortezomib-
      lenalidomide - dexamethasone for 4 pre-transplant induction and 4 post-transplant
      consolidation cycles (all 21-d cycles). After induction patients will undergo tandem or
      single ASCT, depending on toxicity and response to first ASCT. The primary endpoint of the
      phase 2 part of the study is the number of patients who achieve MRD negative (Euroflow NGF 10
      -5 ) complete response 30-45 days post consolidation. Patients (176) achieving MRD negative
      complete response will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive second line treatment
      at MRD reappearance (arm A) or at progressive disease as defined by the IMWG criteria (arm
      B). Randomization will be stratified by R-ISS stage at diagnosis and single vs tandem ASCT.
      Patients in arm A will be followed with MRD assessment every 4 month and start second line
      treatment at loss of MRD negative CR. Patients in arm B will be followed up by standard
      criteria and start second line treatment at progressive disease. Both arms will receive the
      same 2.L treatment; carfilzomib - dexamethasone - daratumumab. (all 28-d cycles) Second line
      treatment will continue until disease progression, unacceptable AEs or patient withdrawal. In
      arm A MRD Euroflow will be assessed after 6 and 18 months of 2L therapy. In arm B MRD
      Euroflow will be assessed if >CR is achieved but not before 6 months of 2 L therapy, and
      again after 12 consecutive months.
