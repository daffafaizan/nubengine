      I. To optimize and technically validate specially-tailored acquisition and reconstruction
      (STAR) DCE-MRI based on the accuracy and reproducibility of whole-brain tracer-kinetic (TK)
      parameter maps.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To develop a robust clinical implementation of STAR DCE-MRI. II. To clinically evaluate
      STAR DCE-MRI in patients with brain tumors.

      OUTLINE: Participants are assigned to 1 of 2 cohorts.

      COHORT I: Participants with recurrent high-grade glioma undergo STAR DCE-MRI every 2 months,
      and just prior to and 4-6 weeks after starting bevacizumab treatment. If there is concern for
      tumor progression (i.e. increased contrast enhancement), more frequent MRI scans will be
      scheduled.

      COHORT II: Participants with melanoma brain metastases undergo STAR DCE-MRI at baseline and
      4-6 weeks after therapy. Participants may undergo more frequent MRI if there is concern for
      tumor progression.
