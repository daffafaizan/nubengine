      cancer survivors are an underserved and vulnerable subgroup of survivors that experience
      increased risk over time for obesity and chronic diseases such as diabetes and cardiovascular
      disease. Increasing physical activity is a promising behavioral intervention that has
      positive effects on physical function, body composition, cardiovascular fitness,
      health-related quality of life, and depression, and may prevent cancer recurrence, new
      cancers and improve survival. To date, few interventions have been designed specifically to
      promote physical activity in young adult cancer survivors, nor used novel technologies for
      delivery; none have been successful in promoting long-term adherence to physical activity.
      This is a randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy of a theory-based, mobile physical
      activity intervention with adaptive goal-setting and tailored feedback that is aimed at
      increasing PA among young adult cancer survivors. Young adult cancer survivors (n=280),
      diagnosed between ages 18-39, will be recruited and randomized into one of two conditions: 1)
      activity tracker + Facebook group (Self-help) or 2) activity tracker + Facebook group +
      adaptive goal-setting and tailored feedback (Intervention). Young adult cancer survivors will
      receive a 6-month intervention followed by an additional 6 months of tapered contacts.
      Assessments of objectively-measured physical activity and other outcomes will be conducted at
      baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months.
