      including vascular endothelial growth factor. Tivozanib is an oral medication that inhibits
      vascular endothelial growth factor preventing tumor from developing new blood vessels.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of tivozanib on hepatocellular (liver)
      cancer. Participants in the study take tivozanib daily at a dose of 1 mg for 1month. if doing
      well the dose would be increased to 1.5 mg per day. Patients are monitored for response using
      CT or MRI scans every 2months. In addition, patients will have blood draws to evaluate the
      effects of tivozanib on blood vessels.
