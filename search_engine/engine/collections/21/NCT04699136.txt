      disorders (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) in order to evaluate their tolerance to
      exercise. It is well tolerated and reproducible in these patients, with the advantage that it
      can be performed without spatial constraints.

      However, this test is not yet used in cardiology. This study proposes to validate the ST6, to
      evaluate the exercise tolerance of patients suffering from cardiovascular pathologies.
