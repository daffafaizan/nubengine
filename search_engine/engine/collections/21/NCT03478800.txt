      shown that it reduces perceived pain arising from exercise induced muscle soreness and
      reduces muscle spasm. Acupuncture has also been shown to serve as an adjunct to improve
      muscle strength training and to accelerate recovery from workouts and injury.

      The investigators' goal is to study approximately 50 high school football players in their
      true pre-season warm weather training environment. The investigators will measure the effects
      of acupuncture treatment on muscle soreness and overall sense of well-being by administering
      pre- and post-treatment surveys. Athletes will undergo five treatment sessions over the
      course of 2.5 weeks. The treatments will be performed by licensed acupuncturists employed at
      Mayo Clinic. The study has been approved by the Institutional Review Board at the Mayo
      Clinic.
