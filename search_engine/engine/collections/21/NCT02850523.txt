      postpartum) and are a serious mental health concern. Anxiety disorders often coexist with
      depression and result in high distress and an impaired ability for new mothers to take care
      of themselves and their babies. In spite of the high prevalence of anxiety disorders during
      pregnancy and postpartum, research and clinical attention in this area is lacking and no
      empirically supported psychological treatments exist. Further, since many pregnant or
      postpartum women are unable or choose not to take medication for their mental health
      symptoms, establishing an effective non-pharmacological alternative is imperative.
      Cognitive-behavioural therapy is a well established psychological treatment for anxiety and
      mood disorders, with moderate to large effect sizes (Cohen's d = 0.5-1.3). The investigators
      developed a novel group-based cognitive-behavioural treatment program (CBGT) for perinatal
      women with anxiety disorders. In an initial, single-sample pilot study (Green et al., 2015),
      a significant reduction in symptoms of anxiety and depression was found from pre to
      post-treatment, along with reported high levels of treatment satisfaction. The purpose of the
      current study is to evaluate the effectiveness of this treatment using a larger sample and a
      randomized controlled trial (RCT).
