      monitored for 12 weeks. Data will include self-report surveys, in-person assessments,
      physiological features derived by wearable devices and socialization and activity data
      derived by mobile applications. The study will utilize advanced statistical methods to
      integrate different sources of passive sensor-based behavioral and physiological data to
      develop models able to detect depression and predict treatment response.
