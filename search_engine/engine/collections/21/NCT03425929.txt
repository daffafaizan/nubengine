      1 and 4 of the study. After the first experimental trauma and after the first functional
      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measurement, the participants will receive intranasal OXT
      or placebo in three different groups (1. OXT for six days, 2. OXT for three days and then
      placebo for three days, 3. placebo for six days). The same fMRI tasks will be used after the
      first and second trauma exposure (i.e. one measurement before the treatment and one
      measurement after three days of treatment).
