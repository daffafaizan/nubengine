      use after brachytherapy placement in patients with localized prostate cancer. Patients will
      be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receiveQ-Urol/Placebo twice daily for 6 weeks after
      brachytherapy placement. Questionnaires will be administered pre- and post-treatment to
      assess the change in prostatitis symptoms and quality of life measures. The mean values
      between groups will be compared.
