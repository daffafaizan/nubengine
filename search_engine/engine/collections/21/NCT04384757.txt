      cancers in Vietnam . Despite recent advances in multimodality treatment and targeted therapy,
      surgery remains the first option of treament for this disease. For resectable gastric cancer,
      complete removal of macroscopic and microscopic lesions and/or combined resections and also
      regional or extended lymphadenectomy should represent in the world now. Since laparoscopic
      gastrectomy for early gastric cancer (EGC) was firstly reported in 1994 , this technique has
      become standard for treatment of EGC due to the many advantages of mininally invasive surgery
      and also in oncologic outcomes.

      Laparoscopic gastrectomy for advanced gastric cancer AGC was first applied by Uyama in 2000,
      and then, many surgeons have used it for treatment of AGC, especially in Japan, Korea and
      China. However, the real role of laparoscop for treament of (AGC) is still controversial in
      term of technical feasibility, safety and oncologic aspect.

      Paragastric inflammatory strands may occur in T4a tumor so that laparoscopic technique is
      difficult to radically perform. Peritoneal seeding of malignant cells, intra- and
      postoperative complications, trocarts metastasis may risk during procedures. Despite, some
      studies have demonstrated the safety and the short-term benefits of LG for T4a gastric
      cancer, the number of these studies and sample sizes have been still inadequate to give good
      evidence for applying it. and long-term oncologic outcomes

      There are more than 75% of patients with gastric cancer who are diagnosed in advanced stage
      in Vietnam, most of cases in T4a. The purpose of this study is to compare the technical
      feasibility, early and long term outcomes of open and laparoscopic distal gastrectomy for
      gastric adenocarcinoma in T4A stage.
