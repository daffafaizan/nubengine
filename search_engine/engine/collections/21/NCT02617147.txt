      a better visualization and evaluation of retinal structures and the choroidea became
      possible. 23G Vitrectomy and membrane peeling seem to have an influence on posterior segment
      structures of the eye but data show no clear evidence evaluating those changes after surgery.
      Only little information is currently available on the influence or the changes resulting from
      vitreous surgery on the central choroidea. Hence, the aim of this study is to evaluate those
      influences resulting on choroidea using two different OCT devices.

      To assess the influence of vitrectomy on changes in central choroidea and comparing the
      results in imaging of the choroidea with two different OCT devices.

      This is a prospective, open, non-randomized, observational, MPG study This study will be
      performed at the Department of Ophthalmology, Medical University of Vienna.

      40 Patients who undergo vitrectomy will be included into this study. The investigation will
      help to gain new information about the effects of vitrectomy on the choroid.

      The measuring procedures used in this study are well tolerated and used in routine clinical
      practice and are non-invasive.
