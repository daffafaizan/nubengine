      surgery. The concept of multimodal analgesia for the postoperative pain therapy is a routine
      in many hospitals but the question is still under debate about the ideal combination between
      techniques and drugs regarding early mobilization and low risk of complications.

      After obtaining Ethical Committee approval and informed consent, 110 patients American
      Society of Anesthesiologists score (ASA ) I-II undergoing knee replacement under spinal
      anesthesia were randomized to receive postoperative either lornoxicam (8 mg per os (PO) /12
      hours (h) for 48 h) or etoricoxib (120mg PO/24 h for 48 h) both administered in the
      postoperative care unit, at the end of surgery.

      The groups received postoperative analgesia when Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) over 3 with IV
      Perfalgan in fixed dose 1g every 8 h and morphine (loading dose 0,1mg/kg and titration until
      NRS under 3, followed by subcutaneous (SC) administration of Â½ of the total loading dose on
      demand for the following 48 h).The lornoxicam group received gastric protection with IV
      pantoprazole.

      The effectiveness was evaluated by the time from the initiation of spinal anesthesia until
      the first analgesic dose at NRS over 3, the total amount of morphine in the first 24 and 48 h
      postoperative, the side effects and necessary amount of adjuvant medication.
