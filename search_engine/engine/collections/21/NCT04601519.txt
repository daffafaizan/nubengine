      type 1 diabetes has been shown in several previous studies, including by the investigators of
      this study.

      Following these publications, patients have expressed the opinion via social networks that
      type 1 diabetes disease is itself a factor that alters the quality of sleep. Indeed, it
      appears that the cross-sectional studies published to date have focused on the association
      between the subjects' sleep habits and the balance of their diabetes, without having
      questioned the role of the pathology on sleep quality.

      The main objective of this study is the objective evaluation of disease related sleep
      fragmentation in subjects with type 1 diabetes.
