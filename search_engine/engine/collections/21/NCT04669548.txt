      physiologic data streams using the Accuryn Monitoring System and correlate these changes to
      the occurrence of acute kidney injury (AKI) following cardiovascular surgery intervention(s).

      The secondary objective is to determine the incidence of intraoperative and postoperative
      hypertension in the cardiovascular surgery population, and analyze observed correlation of
      these data with diagnoses of kidney injury and other clinical outcomes.
