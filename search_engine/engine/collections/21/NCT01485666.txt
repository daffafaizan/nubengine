      that are packaged together in a kit to be used for HeartMate II driveline exit site cleaning,
      dressing and stabilization. The RESIST study is a prospective, non-randomized study to
      evaluate the wearability and usability of the Percutaneous Lead Management Kit. Evaluation of
      the Percutaneous Lead Management Kit for wearability and usability will be performed for 30
      days from enrollment. Study patients will also be followed for up to 6 months for any
      evidence of driveline infection.
