    
      This is an observational study that consists of two Aims:

      Aim 1 is a survey sent to 3000 prior living kidney donors and 3000 matched controls. The
      survey contains questions about history of bone fractures and general bone health. Prior
      living kidney donors will be identified and surveyed from three Minnesota centers: Mayo
      Clinic, Rochester; Hennepin County Medical Center (HCMC); and the University of Minnesota
      (UMN).

      Aim 2 of this study includes an assessment of bone structure and bone turnover markers in a
      subset of donors and matched controls. 200 prior living kidney donors and 200 matched
      controls will be invited to Mayo Clinic Rochester's CRTU for an assessment of bone health.
      Each subject will undergo lateral DXA with VFA assessment, bone density assessment of each
      hip, radius and spine by DXA scan, bone structure assessment by HRpQCT of the distal radius
      and tibia, finite element assessment(ÂµFEA), skin AGEs measurement, and blood collection to
      measure markers of bone formation and resorption.
