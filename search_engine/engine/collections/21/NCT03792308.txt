      pharmacokinetics of single and multiple intravenous doses of SPR206 when administered to
      healthy adult volunteers. This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, ascending
      dose, multi-cohort trial. A total of 104 healthy volunteers will be enrolled in 13 cohorts.
      The study will be conducted in two phases: A single ascending dose (SAD) phase, followed by a
      multiple ascending dose (MAD) phase. In SAD, participants in Cohorts 1 - 8 will receive one
      dose of SPR206 or placebo. In MAD, participants in Cohorts 9 - 12 will receive multiple doses
      of SPR206 or placebo for 7 consecutive days, and a final cohort, Cohort 13, will receive
      multiple doses of SPR206 or placebo for 14 consecutive days at a dose deemed safe and
      tolerable and not to exceed the maximum dose administered to participants in Cohorts 9 - 12.
      In both parts sequential cohorts will be exposed to increasing doses of SPR206.
