      spectrum disorder (ASD) and/or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and to
      validate the model. Method: A user centred design was applied to develop a model for
      internet-based support and coaching, where individuals received eight-week support via
      internet (chat). The model was validated by ten individuals, 15 to 26 years of age, with ASD
      and/or ADHD. Self-report questionnaires (Sense of Coherence (SOC), the Rosenberg Self Esteem
      Scale, the Manchester Short Assessment of Quality of Life (MANSA), Montgomery Ã…sberg
      Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HAD)) were
      distributed before and after intervention. A structured interview regarding the quality of
      the model, the Patient perspective of Care and Rehabilitation process (POCR), was used after
      the intervention. Results: The validation showed significant improvement of SOC, self-esteem
      and subjective Quality of Life at follow-up and the majority perceived high
      fulfilment/importance on the POCR. Conclusions: The model can be an important complement to
      other interventions for young people with ASD and/or ADHD.
