      consent/assent, participants will complete an one hour-long baseline study visit in-person at
      the MSCCC, or through a video visit. During this visit, participants will complete a
      neuropsychological evaluation and baseline study surveys and get trained on the use of the
      Endeavor™ video game. Participants will then be instructed to target a completion of at-home
      game play 5 days a week, for a total period of 8 weeks, using their own iOS mobile device, or
      a study-provided device if needed, approximately 25-30 minutes each day. Subjects will be
      instructed to complete the User Experience Feedback Form weekly via REDCap to assess
      feasibility and acceptability of Endeavor™. At the conclusion of participation, participants
      will complete an hour long neuropsychological evaluation and end of study User Experience
      Feedback Form via REDCap (in-person at the MSCCC, or through a telehealth video visit).
