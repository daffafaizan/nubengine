    
      Positron Emission Tomography (PET) studies have demonstrated that a therapeutic window of
      dopamine D2/3 receptor occupancy (60-80%) is associated with clinical response in younger
      patients with schizophrenia. This observation has been used to predict the therapeutic dose
      range and contributed to current recommended antipsychotic doses. To date, there is no
      published report to examine D2/3 receptor occupancy associated with clinical response in
      older individuals with primary psychotic disorders. This has has impeded the implementation
      of treatment guidelines.

      The investigators therefore propose a prospective study to assess dopamine D2 and D3 receptor
      occupancy following acute antipsychotic treatment in patients aged 50 and older with
      schizophrenia who do not currently receive antipsychotic treatment, using both [11C]-(+)-PHNO
      and [11C]-raclopride PET scans. Dopamine D2/3 receptor occupancy of risperidone that are
      associated with clinical effects will be measured, using PET, in older patients with
      schizophrenia. The investigators will also try to contrast the contribution of D2 and D3 in
      mediating antipsychotic response, using 2 radiotracers.

      Our primary goal is to relate changes in clinical outcome, including subjective and objective
      clinical ratings, to dopamine D2 and D3 receptor occupancy in older patients with
      schizophrenia, and compare these results with the data for younger patients in the
      literature.
