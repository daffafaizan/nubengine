      with early stage breast cancer and is commonly associated with taxane-associated pain
      syndrome (TAPS). TAPS is characterized by disabling pain which usually starts a few days
      after taxane administration and lasting 2-5 days, often returning following subsequent
      chemotherapy treatments. TAPS can significantly reduce a patients quality of life, lead to
      requirements for potent analgesics, as well as dose reductions/delays or discontinuation of
      chemotherapy. There is currently no clinical guidelines for the optimal standard of care for
      the management and prevention of TAPS. This REaCT clinical trial investigates the optimal
      management of TAPS with a tapering dose of dexamethasone (standard premedication comprising
      8mg twice daily for 3 days followed by 4mg once a day for 2 days followed by 2mg once a day
      for 2 days) compared to other standard of care management (i.e. standard premedication with
      8mg dexamethasone twice daily for 3 days) as directed by the treating physician. This study
      will use an "integrated consent model" that involves "oral consent" rather than a written
      informed consent writing process.
