      performance assessment from 1,000 MURDOCK Registry participants. Blood sample aliquots will
      also be obtained. These physical and cognitive performance data, paired with -omics data from
      plasma and serum sample analyses, offer promise in the discovery of biomarkers for functional
      decline. This research will provide an important basis for our understanding of the physical,
      lifestyle, and genetic factors which, over the lifespan, contribute to changes in physical
      and cognitive capabilities as we age.
