      lumbar ESI for radiculopathy with HNP. We assess functional outcomes at baseline and after
      treatment with the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36 instrument (SF-36). Our hypothesis
      was that the complex is present in patients with clinically significant functional
      improvement after ESI.
