    
      Prospective, 1:1 randomized multicentre, open label, phase III clinical trial to evaluate
      efficacy and safety of pevonedistat in combination with azacytidine versus azacytidine in the
      treatment of na√Øve adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia who are not eligible for
      standard induction therapy due to age, co-morbidities or risk-factors.

      Subjects will be randomized to one of the two treatment arms in a 1:1 ratio, both of which
      will have treatment cycles of 28 days:

        -  Arm A: Pevonedistat (PEVO) 20 mg/m2 IV on days 1, 3, and 5 plus Azacitidine (AZA) 75
           mg/m2 subcutaneous (SC) administered on a 5-on/2-off [weekend]/2-on schedule in 28-day
           cycles (IV AZA can be administered for any patients who have non-tolerated local
           reactions)

        -  Arm B: AZA 75 mg/m2 SC on a 5-on/2-off [weekend]/2-on schedule in 28-day cycle (IV AZA
           can be administered for any patients who have non-tolerated local reactions)

           466 subjects will be randomized in the study. Subjects will continue their study
           treatment until documented disease progression per Investigator assessment, unacceptable
           toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or the subject meets other protocol criteria for
           discontinuation
