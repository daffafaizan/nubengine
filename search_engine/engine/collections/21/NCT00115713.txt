      stratified by site (Edmonton, Ottawa, and Vancouver) and planned chemotherapy protocol
      (taxane-based versus nontaxane-based) and randomly assigned to AET, RET, or usual care (UC)
      in a 1:1:1 ratio using a random-numbers table. Participants assigned to the AET group were
      asked to perform aerobic exercise three times per week on a recumbent or upright cycle
      ergometer, treadmill, or elliptical. Exercise duration began at 15 minutes for weeks 0
      through 2, and then systematically increased by 5 minutes every three weeks thereafter to 45
      minutes for weeks 18 and beyond. Exercise intensity began at 60% of VO2max for weeks 0
      through 2 and then systematically increased by 10% every 6 weeks thereafter to 80% of VO2max
      for weeks 12 and beyond. Warm-up and cool-down periods consisted of 5 minutes of aerobic
      activity at the power output of the ventilatory equivalent for oxygen (approximately 50% of
      peak oxygen consumption). Participants assigned to the RET group were asked to perform
      resistance exercise three times per week, which consisted of two sets of 10 repetitions of 9
      different exercises performed at 60-70% of 1-repetition maximum. The specific exercises were:
      leg extension, leg curl, calf raises, chest press, latissimus pulldown, overhead press,
      triceps extension, biceps curls, and modified curl-ups. Resistance was increased by
      approximately 10% or the next weight level when the participant was able to complete 12
      repetitions per set without difficulty.
