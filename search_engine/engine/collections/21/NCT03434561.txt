      after allogeneic HCT.

      However, comorbidity assessment might be a burden on the medical team at the clinic or the
      research staff. This research study aims to explore and validate new methods as alternatives
      to the standard chart-based method in order to facilitate comorbidity coding. The study aims
      to save time and effort of medical personnel and to ensure the inclusion of comorbidity
      information in all clinical trials and outcome research studies in order to improve the
      accuracy of treatment decision-making, patient assignment to appropriate HCT strategy and
      hence HCT outcomes.

      This study will investigate two parallel approaches aimed at simplifying comorbidity
      assessment and thereby facilitating wide-spread use of the HCT-CI. Patient
      questionnaire-based and Claims-based methods will be tested as possible alternative to the
      Chart-based method. primary outcome is prediction of non-relapse mortality. It is expected
      that once this method of comorbidity coding is validated, it will benefit physicians in
      non-academic institutions and community clinics.
