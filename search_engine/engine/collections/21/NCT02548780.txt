    
      This is a multicentre, prospective dose escalation/PK study, designed to assess the clinical
      performance of LifePearl™ beads loaded with Doxorubicin in the primary treatment of
      unresectable HCC by chemoembolization. Data from this study will be used as supportive data
      post CE-mark approval.

      The main objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetic profile of
      LifePearl™ beads loaded with Doxorubicin in the treatment of patients with unresectable liver
      cancer (HCC) by chemoembolization. This will be measured as treatment-related complications
      and plasma levels of Doxorubicin in peripheral blood.

      In addition, objective tumour response will be assessed by computed tomography or MRI.

      Two cohorts of patients will be evaluated:

      Cohort I to assess safety (dose escalation) and pharmacokinetic profile; Cohort II will
      assess pharmacokinetic profile, safety and efficacy with the doxorubicin dose determined with
      Cohort I.
