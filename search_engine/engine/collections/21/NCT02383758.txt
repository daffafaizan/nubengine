      achieving continence with bowel movements or never achieve it at all (i.e., they meet
      criteria for encopresis). This problem has tremendous ramifications for these individuals and
      their families because encopresis restricts them from integration with peers, limits access
      to educational opportunities, and carries significant social stigma. Previous interventions
      for encopresis in this population have either been unsuccessful or required implementation
      over very long periods.
