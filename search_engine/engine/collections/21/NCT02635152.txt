      disorder delivered via the Internet. To evaluate the efficacy of the IBM protocol we have
      developed in reducing negative appearance and evaluative related interpretations, we will
      conduct a two-arm randomized controlled trial over the internet. Individuals with a diagnosis
      of body dysmorphic disorder (N = 40) will be randomized to one of two conditions: 1) IBM or
      2) progressive muscle relaxation. Each condition will consist of eight 10-25 minute treatment
      sessions. Participants will complete two sessions per week for four weeks and will be
      administered assessments at pre-treatment, one week post-treatment and at 3-month follow-up.
      We hypothesize that: 1) IBM will lead to greater reductions in BDD symptoms than the PMR
      condition; 2) IBM will lead to greater reductions in depression, anxiety and suicidal
      ideation than the PMR condition; 3) IBM will lead to greater reductions in threat
      interpretations and greater increases in benign interpretations than the PMR condition; 4)
      The effects of condition on BDD symptoms will be mediated by changes in BDD-related
      interpretation bias; and 5) The effects of training in the IBM condition will be maintained
      at the 3-month follow-up assessments.
