      during the second and third visits the participant will be subjected to several non-invasive
      procedures specific to the study in order to assess contrast sensitivity and visual acuity
      using the fitted and uniquely fabricated investigational medical devices. The tests will be
      performed after eye drops are supplied to dilate the pupil of the subjects (eye drops:
      tropicamide and phenylephrine). Besides the clinical experiments, the participant will be
      given a specific questionnaire in order to assess comfort, light sensitivity, horizontal
      visual angle and overall experience of the investigational medical device and in combination
      with a pair of sunglasses category 3-4. The investigators will document the occurrence of any
      adverse events and specific side effects during Day 2 and 3 (testing sessions with the
      investigational devices) in order to effectively assess their safety.
