      DepoCyt through that reservoir every 2 weeks for 5 doses, then every 4 weeks for an
      additional 5 doses (a total of 10 DepoCyt treatments). Patients will also receive oral
      sorafenib at 400 mg twice a day throughout the treatment course until disease progression or
      death. Patients will receive brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRIs) with contrast (and whole
      spine, if necessary) and spinal fluid studies will be obtained every 8 weeks through the
      Ommaya reservoir until disease progression, death, or unacceptable toxicity. In addition,
      patients will have spinal fluid obtained to test for sorafenib levels at each study visit
      after the start of sorafenib as well as prior to sorafenib treatment for controls.
