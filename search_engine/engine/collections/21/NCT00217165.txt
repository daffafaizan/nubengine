      sold as a component of over-the-counter mood enhancing agents. However, controlled studies
      examining the mood effects of taurine are limited. An initial study in this laboratory looked
      at taurine's mood effects in individuals with bipolar disorder. This follow-up study is
      designed to further examine taurine's effects on manic symptoms. Subjects in the current
      follow-up study will add taurine or placebo to their current treatment regimen. Both
      depressive and manic symptoms will be tracked for three months to determine whether the
      addition of taurine affects mood symptoms.
