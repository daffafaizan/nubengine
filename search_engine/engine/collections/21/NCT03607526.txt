      vegetables (FV) to achieve health benefits. Despite the recommendations, adherence is low;
      only 12% of the population meets the recommendation for fruits and even less of the
      population (9%) meets the recommendation for vegetables. Recently, it was found that
      vegetable consumption increased when individuals were provided the recommended daily amounts
      while participating in a clinical study, but returned to pre-study low levels when vegetables
      were no longer supplied. This result suggests that habitual consumption of FV is strongly
      regulated by behaviors influenced by social, environmental, and/or individual factors.
      Therefore, identifying regulatory factors of vegetable consumption will greatly assist in
      developing successful strategies to increase vegetable intake to achieve health benefits. The
      overall objective of this study is to examine both barriers and facilitators to adherence to
      consuming DGA-recommended amounts of vegetables in participants who completed a randomized
      controlled trial with provided vegetables or who were in a control group, using the Nominal
      Group Technique (NGT).
