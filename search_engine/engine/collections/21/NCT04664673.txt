      function, motor learning and everyday life activities of adults with chronic stroke (> 6
      months) after participating of the intensive treatment programme "Hand-arm Bimanual Intensive
      Therapy Including Lower Extremities" (HABIT-ILE) will be studied. Changes, scored by
      participants in case of questionnaires and by experts in the case of tests, will be observed
      comparing participants after their regular care/treatment and after receiving HABIT-ILE.
      Motor function, learning and daily life activities will be correlated with neuroplastic
      changes.
