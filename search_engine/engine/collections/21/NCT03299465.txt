      Primary Objective: To assess the feasibility of an organized yoga intervention for HCT
      survivors with CRF.

      Hypothesis: A trial of yoga in the HCT survivor population will be deemed feasible if at
      least 75% of study subjects demonstrated protocol adherence rate of at least 80%.

      Secondary Objectives:

      - Explore participants' perceptions regarding yoga and physical activity

      Hypothesis: HCT survivors will be positive about yoga and will express satisfaction with the
      yoga program, as will be shown during focus groups that will be held at the end of the yoga
      program.

      - Evaluate the association between yoga practice and self-efficacy and self-regulation

      Hypothesis: Adherence to yoga will be associated with higher self-efficacy and selfregulation
      scores.

      - Evaluate the changes in CRF scores from baseline to the end of the yoga program.

      Hypothesis: CRF scores at the end of the yoga program will be lower than CRF scores at
      baseline.

      - Evaluate whether changes in CRF are associated with changes in depression, sleep
      disturbances, physical activity, and pain.

      Hypothesis 5: Improvement in CRF will be associated with increased physical activity and
      decreased depression, sleep disturbances, and pain.

      - Evaluate the safety of yoga practice in HCT survivors.

      Hypothesis: Yoga will be considered as a safe intervention for CRF in HCT survivors as
      demonstrated by the absence of adverse events or serious adverse events related to or
      associated with yoga practice.
