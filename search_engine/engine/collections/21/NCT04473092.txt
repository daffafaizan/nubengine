      in patients on high surgical risk. Interventional mitral valve repair can be applied is
      routinely applied in primary and secondary mitral regurgitation. While the edge-to-edge
      technique has been the solely available technlology in the marked for the last years, the
      recently introduced PascalTM technology represents a novel concept and is characterized by a
      central spacer, wider paddles, and larger dimensions. Implications of implantation of the
      PascalTM device on the mitral valve morphology and functionality concerning potential changes
      on mitral regurgitation as well as changes on mitral valve orifice area are to date not fully
      understood. The current study will identify anatomical changes to optimize ideal patient
      selection and optimal treatment approaches of the PASCALTM device.
