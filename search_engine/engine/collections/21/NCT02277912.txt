      promising tool in treating difficult pain conditions. The best sites for stimulation are
      still not known and navigation has been used only in few studies.

      The aim is to evaluate the analgesic effects of Navigated Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic
      Stimulation ( nrTMS ) on pain in a three armed crossover study. The navigation is done by
      using magnetic resonance imaging and stereotactic camera system. The three arms include
      stimulation to M1, S2 and sham stimulation to M1. 10 Hz repetitive stimulation is given to a
      specified location once a day 5 days a week for two weeks in each of the three arms. A months
      washout period is kept between each arm of the study.

      Pain and other variables are followed before, during and after the study for 6 months.
