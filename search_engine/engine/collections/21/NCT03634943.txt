      administered according to the usual practice of the medical and nursing staff and to the
      protocols established in each unit. The rate of initiation, the dose of macronutrients and
      the increase in contributions will be made according to the criteria of each participating
      ICU and the responsible physician (including the use of prokinetics or parenteral nutrition).

      All the complications described associated with the artificial Nutritional support and others
      related to the critical patient will be evaluated daily by the research team and reflected in
      the electronic data collection form (eCRF).

      The eCRF has been carried out through the REDCAP ™ platform and designed by the Department of
      Information Technology of Lleida of the Universitari Arnau de Vilanova Hospital, under the
      supervision of Dr. Lluís Servià, principal investigator of the present project. The
      responsible of the computer centre is Joan Escobar-Ortiz. The data will be stored in a server
      of the center and will be coded to comply with the confidentiality of the same and for a
      correct anonymization of patients based on Regulatory Laws.

      The study has the approval of each ethics committee of each participating centre.

      Statistical analyses will be performed by the department of statistics of University of
      Lleida under close supervision of Javier Trujillano-Cabello and the principal investigators
      of the present study.
