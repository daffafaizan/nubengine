      delivered through a fiber. This unique quality allows the physician to thread the fiber
      through an endoscope and deliver energy. KTP is uniquely effective because the laser uses
      green light, which has an affinity with blood vessels. This means that the energy from the
      laser is absorbed more easily by blood vessels than other tissue. Targeting the blood supply
      of a lesion causes the lesion to slough off, leaving the surrounding tissue undamaged.
      However, the properties of the KTP are not necessarily ideal, in that it penetrates deep into
      the vocal fold, risking scar formation. On the other hand, the CO2 laser is absorbed by water
      found in soft tissues and is independent of tissue color. It is very precise and causes less
      damage of the deep tissues, which results in less swelling and faster recovery. The absence
      of a long healing process means that most patients can resume their normal activities even on
      the same day The CO2 laser is the preferred laser for use in the operating room. The purpose
      of the study is to evaluate the fiber-based version of the CO2 laser in the office setting.
