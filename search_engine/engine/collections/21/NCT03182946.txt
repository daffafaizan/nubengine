      falls. This patient population is also often receiving anticoagulants and platelet inhibitors
      increasing their risk of post-injury hemorrhage. Following Traumatic Brain Injury, even
      without platelet inhibitor medications, platelets become dysfunctional and are no longer able
      to assist with clot formation. Therefore risk of hemorrhage is increased, both in the brain,
      and other hemorrhagic sites. Clinical practice at Carolinas Medical Center is to transfuse
      platelets in patients with platelet dysfunction following brain injury. The current study is
      investigating the impact of transfusion on correction of platelet dysfunction and patient
      outcome.

      Furthermore, stored platelet dysfunction can be corrected by supplementation with cytochrome
      c, which supports mitochondrial function. Therefore, the ability of cytochrome c to correct
      dysfunction in ex vivo platelets from patients with Traumatic Brain Injury will be assessed.
