      complete response during a minimum of 6 cycles of treatment without causing WHO grade 3
      leukopenia (WBC < 2x10^9/L). The patients suffered from uncontrolled lupus nephritis (LN) and
      took OCS (<= 1.0 mf/kf/day, a maximum dose of 80 mg/day) in addition to NKT-01. Therefore the
      aim of the open multi-center study is to determine an efficient and safe dose and dosing
      schedule of NKT-01 in induction of response in treatment of lupus nephritis.
