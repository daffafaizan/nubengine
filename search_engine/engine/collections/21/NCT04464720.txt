      children and their households to receive an intensive home kitchen ventilation intervention
      after one week of baseline data collection and the other 30 to receive the intervention after
      two weeks of baseline data collection. This design will allow for analysis as both a
      randomized controlled trial, and as a before/after trial, allowing for the benefits of both
      designs. The intervention includes education regarding improving ventilation in their homes
      during cooking and replacement of their range hood if it has inadequate flow or an
      intolerable noise level. During baseline data collection periods the households will be
      encouraged to continue their regular cooking patterns. The investigators will measure home
      particulate matter <2.5 microns (PM2.5) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels for one week at
      baseline, one week after 30 families have received the intervention and a final week after
      all remaining families receive the cooking ventilation intervention, to assess for changes
      within each household as well as between groups. The investigators will also examine changes
      in airways inflammation (as measured by the exhaled fraction of nitric oxide, FeNO), lung
      function (as measured by spirometry), reported symptoms, and asthma quality of life after the
      baseline and each intervention period. Members of the research team have successfully
      conducted youth participatory action research in the low-income, high asthma prevalence
      community of Richmond, California (CA) as well as extensive youth participatory action
      research on other environmental health concerns in the low income city of Salinas, CA; using
      a similar model, the investigators aim to teach research methods to a new group of Richmond
      youth.
