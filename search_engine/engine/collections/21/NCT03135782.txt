      I. To determine if training providers on tobacco cessation resources increases the frequency
      of counseling and referrals at initial and follow-up consultations for cancer patients who
      use tobacco and are scheduled to receive radiation at Oregon Health and Science University
      (OHSU).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Increase provider frequency of tobacco use quantification and type. II. Increase frequency
      of provider assessment of tobacco cessation readiness in current users.

      III. Increase frequency and types of tobacco cessation resources and medicines offered and
      utilized.

      IV. Increase frequency and type of follow-up planned if referred to cessation resource.

      OUTLINE:

      MEDICAL CHART REVIEW: Medical charts from patients with diagnoses of head and neck cancer,
      lung cancer, prostate cancer, or breast cancer are reviewed at months 1-12 to determine the
      frequency of tobacco assessments and documentation of discussions with patients regarding
      tobacco use and utilization of cessation resources as before and after the proposed training.

      PROVIDER TRAINING: Providers undergo training to use patient coaching such as the 5A's (Ask,
      Advise, Assess, Assist, and Arrange), to conduct regular tobacco intake assessment using
      motivational interviewing techniques. Providers also undergo training to use public/community
      tobacco cessation resources for patients ready to quit within six weeks, and have access to
      pharmacy residents for ad-hoc prescribing questions.

      PATIENT COACHING: Patients attend 4 phone or in-person motivational interviewing coaching
      sessions over 30-45 minutes for 6-8 weeks or longer as needed.
