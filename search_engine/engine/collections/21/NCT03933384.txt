      fumarate (TDF) have been recommended as the first-line antiviral therapy for chronic
      hepatitis B (CHB). However, risk of renal dysfunction remains an issue in TDF long-term
      therapy. Tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) is a novel prodrug of tenofovir and is formulated to
      deliver the active metabolite to target cells more efficiently than TDF at lower doses,
      thereby reducing systemic exposure to tenofovir. Importantly, TAF had improved renal safety
      as compared to TDF. TAF has been approved for treating CHB since 2017; however, it is still
      unknown whether the efficacy and renal safety of TAF is compatible to those of ETV. The
      investigators aim to conduct an open label, randomized controlled trial comparing TAF with
      ETV for assessing their efficacy and renal safety in CHB patients. The eligible CHB patients
      are randomly assigned (1:1) to receive TAF or ETV. After allocation to TAF group or ETV
      group, study subjects will receive therapy for 3 years (144 weeks).
