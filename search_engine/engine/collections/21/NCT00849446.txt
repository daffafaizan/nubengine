      chronic stroke

      Background:

      Accelerometry has only recently been introduced in clinical stroke research. However, whether
      accelerometry is a valid and reliable tool in stroke needs to be established. From literature
      becomes clear that existing accelerometers show shortages at patients with stroke because of
      the specific deficits that these patients have.

      Purpose:

      The aim of this study is to investigate the validity and test-retest reliability of the
      SenseWear Pro armband as an objective measurement of physical activity in chronic stroke
      patients.

      Patients and Methods Subjects Fifteen patients and fifteen healthy subjects will be included
      in the study following written informed consent. The following demographic and clinical data
      were recorded: age, gender, height, length, medication use, self-reported handedness,
      Edinburgh Handedness Inventory, Rivermead Gross Function, Functional Ambulation Categories,
      medical and surgical history.

      Methods During one test session the subjects had to carry out an amount of activities
      according to a standardised protocol existing of lying down, sitting, standing, walking, step
      exercise and cycling. These activities are presenting activities of daily living.

      Measures:

      Subjects wear on both arms a SenseWear Pro Armband. De data from these measuring devices will
      be compared with the data retrieved from 2 Yamax pedometers and the ergospirometry device.
      The outcome measures are: counts, heartbeat, oxygen used, energy expenditure, METabolic
      equivalent, time lying down.
