      disorders (ASD) treated at the Léo Kanner Center (CLK), psychopathology department of the
      Saint-Étienne University Hospital. The aim is to describe through the trajectories of
      children with ASD and their families, their living conditions, and through interviews with
      professionals who support them, how the specificities related to precarious situations are
      identified and taken into account.

      A qualitative survey, carried out by sociological interviews with families whose children are
      followed at the Léo Kanner Center (CLK) and the professionals who care for them, would make
      it possible to collect data on the development of a young child with autism in his home and
      more generally in his habitat.

      The purpose of this study is to study the specificities of families in a precarious situation
      with a child with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) in terms of housing, in order to better
      support them in different social spaces and improve collaboration between professionals and
      parents. The project aims to bring children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) into a
      dynamic of access to human rights. He suggests three levers to achieve this: rely on a
      precise inventory of needs; work towards a transformation of representations; streamline
      access to healthcare and common law services.
