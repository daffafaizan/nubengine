      dapagliflozin in comparison with the administration of empagliflozin on endothelial
      disfunction in individuals with T2DM; we will conduct a double-blind, randomized,
      placebo-controlled, trial with 3 groups, each group of 24 male and female patients, between
      40-65 years of age with T2DM, without hypertension, treated with insulins or thiazide
      diuretics. Randomization will determine who will receive the intervention during 7-days trial
      (Empagliflozin 25 mg 1 time daily 5 minutes or Dapagliflozin 10 mg before the first bite of
      each meal or approved placebo capsules), the patients will also continue with their usual
      treatment. The clinical findings and laboratory test and laboratory test include a metabolic
      profile and biosafety, baseline and at 7 days. Body weight, body fat, body mass index (BMI)
      and blood pressure will be determined during the initial and final visit, likewise,
      hemodynamics parameters of endothelial disfunction by flow mediate dilation with a
      high-resolution UNEX EF38GÂ® ultrasound. Adverse events to treatment will be documented.
      Statistical analysis: Mann-Whitney U Test and Wilcoxon exact test. A p <0.05 will be
      considered statistically significant.
