      I. To evaluate the response rate of the chemotherapy regimen in patients with mixed phenotype
      acute leukemia.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate the durability of response, the overall and event-free survival rates, and the
      safety profile of the regimen.

      OUTLINE:

      INDUCTION THERAPY: Patients receive clofarabine intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on days
      1-4 or 1-3; idarubicin IV over 30-60 minutes on days 1-3 or 1-2; cytarabine IV over 2 hours
      on days 1-4; vincristine sulfate IV over 15-30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15; and
      dexamethasone IV over 10-30 minutes on days 1-4 and 15-18. Patients with a certain type of
      leukemia may receive rituximab IV over 4-6 hours on days 1 and 8 or sorafenib tosylate orally
      (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-14. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 2 cycles in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      CONSOLIDATION THERAPY: Patients receive clofarabine IV over 60 minutes on days 1-3 or 1-2;
      idarubicin IV over 30-60 minutes on days 1-2; cytarabine IV over 2 hours on days 1-3 or 1-2;
      vincristine sulfate IV over 15-30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15; and dexamethasone IV over
      10-30 minutes on days 1-4 and 15-18. Patients with a certain type of leukemia may receive
      rituximab IV over 4-6 hours on days 1 and 8 of cycles 1-3 or sorafenib tosylate PO BID on
      days 1-28 of cycle 1-6 and beyond. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 cycles in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 6
      months thereafter.
