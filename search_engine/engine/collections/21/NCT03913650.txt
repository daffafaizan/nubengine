      surgery. In this study, we hypothesized that peripheral nerve blocks may alleviate
      inflammatory response and reduce the analgesics requirement. Sixty patients undergoing limb
      orthopedic surgery will be enrolled. Peripheral nerve block was injected with 0.25%
      bupivacaine under ultrasound guidance. 30 patients (Study group) underwent surgery with nerve
      blocks and another 30 patients (Control group) underwent surgery with morphine. The
      anesthetic protocol was standardized for both groups by experienced anesthesiologists.
      Surgical stress was assessed by blood pressure fluctuation and proinflammatory cytokine. Pain
      intensity was measured by numeric rating scale (NRS) score for 24 hours
