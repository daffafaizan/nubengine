      significant side-effects. Previous clinical studies in other inflammatory skin diseases have
      shown that a dosage of curcumin at 6,000 mg daily was effective while lower doses were not.
      In a human phase I clinical trial examining the effects of high dose curcumin in preventing
      premalignant lesions, even curcumin doses as high as 8,000 mg/day resulted in no toxic
      effects after 3 months. This study will involve participant ingestion of 6,000 mg/day of
      turmeric or curcumin to assess how this affects their sebum production.

      The investigators will also be collecting stool from the study subjects, and examining how
      the curcumin and turmeric may modulate their gut microbiome. The investigators will
      specifically be looking to see if curcumin or turmeric have any changes on the gut flora
      towards bacteria that produce more short chain fatty acids. Certain bacteria that make up the
      microbiome produce short chain fatty acids, such as butyrate and propionate, which have
      demonstrated anti-inflammatory properties. Thus, it would be interesting to see if turmeric
      or curcumin exert any of its anti-inflammatory effects via modulation of the microbiome.
