      (opioids and cannabinoids) prior to admission in each period. Only subjects with negative
      results in these tests were preceded for further activities.

      Following an overnight fast of at least 10 hour, a single oral dose of felodipine extended
      release tablet (containing felodipine 10 mg) of either test or reference formulation was
      administered during each period of the study, along with 240 mL of drinking water at ambient
      temperature under low light condition .

      During the course of the study, safety parameters assessed were vital signs, clinical
      examination, medical history and clinical laboratory safety tests (hematology, biochemical
      parameters, serology and urine analysis) at baseline. Adverse event monitoring was done
      throughout the study. Laboratory parameters of hematology and biochemistry (except blood
      glucose and cholesterol) were repeated at the end of the study.
