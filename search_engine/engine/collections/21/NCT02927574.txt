      femoropopliteal segment is affected in most patients. Endovascular revascularisation is one
      possible treatment option, but high rates of restenosis, especially in complex lesions, are a
      limiting factor. Bare-metal stents failed to show a long-term superiority in a Cochrane
      systematic review. Another approach to prevent restenosis is local delivery of an
      antiproliferative drug (e.g. Paclitaxel) via Drug-Coated Balloon Angioplasty. New studies did
      report their results since the publication of earlier meta-analyses. It's time for an
      up-to-date systematic review. Prior systematic reviews did not address risk of bias nor did
      they take differences in treatment strategy despite the used balloon catheter into
      consideration.Some previous reviews did compare results from different points in time, e.g.
      analysis of 6 months' results together with 24 months' results.
