      the corneal stroma with a resultant increase in corneal biomechanical strength of up to 300%.
      The method was introduced in the mid-nineties and has been approved for use in the EU
      countries since 2007. Standard treatment protocol, involving the removal of the corneal
      epithelium before the Riboflavin application, has been used. In order to avoid potential
      complications following removal of the epithelium (infection, delayed healing, scar
      formation, as well as discomfort and pain), a modified procedure where the epithelium is kept
      intact, so called transepithelial CXL, has been suggested. According to the preliminary
      results of the published retrospective studies, no significant difference in the clinical
      effect between the standard CXL with epithelial removal and the transepithelial CXL was
      found.
