      Placebo vs Aquamin F + Glucosamine sulfate while controlling for pain with acetaminophen.
      Subjects were then followed for blood chemistry measurements only over an additional 12-week
      period specifically to assess blood calcium levels post treatment. All participants were
      subjected to the same diet and exercise regimen and measurements included: WOMAC scores
      (pain, stiffness, mobility, total score), 6 Minute Walking Distances, active and passive
      range of motion measurements, DXA scans, blood chemistry, hematology, CRP levels and lipid
      profiles as well as rescue medication diary measurements and adverse event assessments. An
      independent statistician analyzed the data using independent t-tests and ANCOVA for
      between-group comparisons and matched-pair t-tests for within-group comparisons of patients
      included in ITT-LOCF and completer analyses.
