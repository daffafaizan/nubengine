      clinical examination,anthropometric measurement and a questionnaire will be administered to
      each participant at baseline and patients will be followed up every six months. Our tests and
      examinations include: blood/urine sample and biochemical measurements, office blood pressure
      recording, carotid ultrasonograph, echocardiograph, pulse wave velocity, pulse wave analysis,
      4-limb blood pressure recording, body mass index, etc. Baseline measurement will also include
      the assessments on target organ damages(TODs) and the conventional CV risk factors. In the
      follow-up, the incidence of CV events and mortality will be recorded. The Northern Shanghai
      Risk Score will be calculated, with considerations on CV risk factors and TODs.
