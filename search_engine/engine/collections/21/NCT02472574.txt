      one of the best choices in the treatment of a large-scale deep supratentorial intracerebral
      hematoma. It uses hardware access technology, in a relatively short time to enter the
      hematoma center with favourable accuracy and safety.

      The dose of rt-PA range from 0.3 mg to 4.0 mg in different researchã€‚We propose to determine
      the optimal dose of rt-PA with three dose control groups.
