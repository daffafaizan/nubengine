      a single-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over design, where subjects will be randomized in a
      1:1 ratio to 2 treatment sequences determined by the order in which they receive
      buprenorphine or matching placebo. Period 3 is an open-label design where the same subjects
      will receive buprenorphine only. This period is optional, and will include approximately 6
      subjects.

      Part B is an open-label study in opioid tolerant patients. All will receive placebo plus
      fentanyl in Period 1 to permit dose escalation to full respiratory effects of fentanyl before
      assessing the interaction with buprenorphine. Subjects will receive buprenorphine plus
      fentanyl during Period 2 to assess the interaction with buprenorphine.

      To study ventilation, the dynamic end-tidal forcing technique will be used. This technique
      enables the Investigator to force end-tidal partial pressure of carbon dioxide and end-tidal
      partial pressure of oxygen to follow a specific pattern in time. Subjects with a
      procedure-related adverse event (AE) will be treated according to established ventilatory
      support and opioid reversal protocols.
