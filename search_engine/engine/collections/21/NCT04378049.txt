      system. Over 60,000 knee replacement surgeries are performed in Canada every year, making it
      the second most common surgery. Our institution (St. Joseph's Healthcare Hamilton) is the
      first hospital in Canada to purchase a Mako RIO orthopaedic robot to assist with performing
      knee replacements. The knee is divided into three compartments, and one, two, or all three
      compartments can become arthritic. Over 90% of patients with end-stage knee OA receive a
      total knee replacement (also known as total knee arthroplasty or TKA) even if they have one
      or two healthy knee compartments. Partial knee replacements are an option for these patients
      but these procedures are very technically demanding and associated with a higher risk of
      implant failure. For this reason, few surgeons are experts at partial knee replacements. We
      believe that we can use robotic technology to make it easier for surgeons to perform partial
      replacements more accurately, thereby increasing the quality and survivorship of partial knee
      replacements. This may lead to better patient-important outcomes like return to activity,
      pain, and satisfaction, and eventually better access to high-quality partial knee
      replacements for Canadians. This will be the first study to evaluate total knee replacements
      (standard care) versus robot-assisted partial knee replacements, and could lead to greater
      uptake of robotic technology in orthopaedics and a shift toward anatomy-sparing partial knee
      replacements.
