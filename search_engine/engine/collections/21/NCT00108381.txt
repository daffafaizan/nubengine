      tailored self-management treatment approach, Tailored Cognitive-Behavior Therapy (TCBT), for
      persons with chronic musculoskeletal pain. TCBT will be compared with a Standard Cognitive-
      Behavior Therapy (SCBT) condition. The hypothesis is that TCBT will be associated with
      improved outcomes following treatment. Outcome will be assessed by multiple standardized
      measures of key domains of the chronic pain experience. Secondary objectives are to examine
      the process of successful self-management treatment.
