      collaboration with countries around the world through the World Health Organization.

      Subjects will be randomized to receive either standard-of-care products or the study
      medication plus standard of care, while being hospitalized for COVID-19.

      Participants will be randomized to one of the following groups:

        1. Remdesivir 200mg IV on day 1, followed by 100 mg IV daily infusion for 9 days plus
           optimized supportive care, OR

        2. Interferon-beta-1a, 22 or 44 micrograms subcutaneously on days 1, 3 and 6, plus
           optimized supportive care OR

        3. Optimized support care, all or until discharge from hospital, whichever occurs first

      Subjects will be assessed daily while hospitalized, including Oropharyngeal (OP) /
      Nasopharyngeal (NP) swabbing at baseline and on days post enrolment 3, 5, 8, 11, 15 and 29
      (if still hospitalized, exploratory outcome). Hospitalized subjects will require blood
      sampling on days 1 and 5. Discharged subjects will be telephoned at Days 15, 29, and 60.
