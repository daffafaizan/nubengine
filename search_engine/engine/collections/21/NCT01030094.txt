    
      This is a cross-sectional (observations or measurements made at a single point in time,
      usually at participant enrollment), multi-center (conducted in more than one center), and
      comparative study of topiramate monotherapy in female participants with epilepsy. Female
      participants must have received either topiramate, carbamazepine, or valproic acid
      monotherapy for more than one year for the treatment of epilepsy. Blood samples will be
      obtained from fasting participants to investigate the effect of study drug on the bone and
      mineral metabolism markers, and bone density compared to healthy participants and comparative
      group (carbamazepine and valproic acid monotherapy). Bone mineral density will be measured
      from the participants' lumbar spine or femur. A survey of food intake and physical activity
      for the participants will be performed using a standardized validated detailed questionnaire.
      The post-study visit (or follow up phone contact) will be performed for the occurrence of
      serious adverse events (SAE) for safety evaluation. Participants' safety will be monitored
      throughout the study.
