      Primary

        -  To evaluate the effect of aprepitant on cyclophosphamide and 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide
           pharmacokinetics as measured by plasma AUC in patients with breast cancer.

      Secondary

        -  To evaluate total control of nausea and vomiting, as defined by no vomiting episodes and
           no use of rescue medication, 72 hours after courses 1 and 2 of chemotherapy.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive aprepitant 125 mg orally once daily on day 1 and 80 mg orally
           once daily on days 2 and 3. Beginning 1 hour after receiving aprepitant, patients
           receive an infusion of cyclophosphamide on day 1. During course 2, patients crossover
           and receive treatment (placebo) as in arm II.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive a placebo 125 mg orally once daily on day 1 and 80 mg orally
           once daily on days 2 and 3. Beginning 1 hour after receiving the placebo, patients will
           receive an infusion of cyclophosphamide infusion on day 1. During course 2, patients
           crossover and receive treatment (aprepitant) as in arm I.

      Patients complete a diary documenting nausea and vomiting on days 1, 2, and 3 of both
      courses. Patients also complete The Functional Living Index-Emesis (FLIE) questionnaire
      documenting compliance, rescue antiemetic therapy, and any adverse effects and record them in
      the diary for each course. Information in the patient's diary is obtained by the coordinator
      via telephone on day 4 of each course.

      Patients undergo blood sample collection periodically for pharmacokinetic studies via high
      performance liquid chromatography.
