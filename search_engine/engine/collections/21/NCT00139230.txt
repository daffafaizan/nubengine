    
      -  Patients will be admitted to hospital and receive a one hour infusion of taxotere.
           Approximately 2 hours after taxotere is finished they will receive cisplatin,
           5-fluorouracil, and leucovorin continuously over a 4 day period.

        -  Approximately 6-12 hours after the chemotherapy ends patients will be given growth
           factor support and ciprofloxacin until the patient's ANC level is greater than 10,000.

        -  Infusion of chemotherapy will be repeated every 28 days (1 cycle is 28 days).

        -  During each cycle patients will have blood tests performed weekly and may be asked to
           return to the Head and Neck Clinic for examination around the middle of each cycle.

        -  At the end of each cycle the impact of the chemotherapy will be assessed. If after 2
           cycles, the cancer has not responded sufficiently the patient will not receive any more
           chemotherapy. However, if significant reduction in the size of the patients tumor is
           observed, a third and final cycle will be performed.

        -  During the fourth or fifth week of cycle 3, patients will undergo re-staging evaluation
           under anesthesia with primary-site biopsies and planning of radiotherapy.

        -  Within 2 weeks of completion of chemotherapy cycle 3 all patients will receive twice
           daily radiotherapy.
