    
      This investigation will be conducted as a Phase II, open-label, single-center, non-randomized
      study. The study is planned to be conducted at one Investigative site in the United States.
      The information collected under this exploratory, Phase II study will not be used for
      diagnostic purposes, to assess the participant's response to therapy, or for clinical
      management of the participant. This will be a pilot prospective cohort study where the
      increased expression of integrin may be seen on the F-18 RGD-K5 PET imaging scans looking at
      carotid plaque in participants with carotid artery stenosis.

      Each completed study participant will undergo one to three visits, including one eligibility
      study visit, the Computed Tomography (CT) angiogram of the carotid visit (if necessary), the
      [F-18] RGD-K5 PET imaging visit, and a 24 hour follow up phone call or visit.

      Procedures: Informed consent (ICF), eligibility blood labs, collection of demographic
      information and medical history, physical examination, vital signs, 12-lead
      Electrocardiograms (ECGs), dosing with [F-18]RGD-K5, PET imaging scan, 24 hour follow up to
      collect adverse events, and plaque immunohistochemical characterization after Carotid
      Endarterectomy (CEA).
