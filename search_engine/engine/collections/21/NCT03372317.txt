      varying amounts of neurofibrillary tangles (tau) and beta-amyloid plaque deposits, which are
      the hallmark brain pathologies known to be associated with Alzheimer's disease and various
      other dementias. While some with these pathologies may not clinically express cognitive
      decline or dementia in their lifetime, human post-mortem studies suggest that increasing
      neurofibrillary tangle density correlates with neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment.

      Imaging tauopathy in-vivo provides an opportunity to examine neurocognitive correlates of
      differential levels of tauopathy in the brain, allowing to further qualify pre-clinical
      states of cognitive impairment. The investigators aim to investigate possible protective
      mechanisms, such as cognitive reserve, that may modulate the relationship between tauopathy
      and cognitive decline.
