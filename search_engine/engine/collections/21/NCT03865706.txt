      colonic anaerobes and that these bacteria are protective against multi-drug resistant
      organism (MDRO) colonization and subsequent MDR infection. Inulin, a vegetable-derived
      non-digestible polysaccharide is well established as the key nutrient source for
      SCFA-producing bacteria. Previous human studies have shown that (1) inulin increases levels
      of SCFA producers and SCFAs and (2) that this increase correlates with improved colonic
      mucosal integrity and resistance to MDR pathogens. In animal studies, inulin improves
      survival after pathogen challenge or injection with lipopolysaccharide. The overall aim of
      this clinical trial is to determine whether inulin improves gut colonization resistance
      against antibiotic-resistant pathogens and therefore prevents antibiotic-resistant infections
      in the setting of critical illness. To accomplish this, 90 critically ill adults who are
      receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics will be blindly randomized 1:1:1 to receive placebo,
      inulin 8 g twice daily, or inulin 16 g twice daily for a minimum of 7 days, with bedside
      follow-up extending to 30 days or hospital discharge.
