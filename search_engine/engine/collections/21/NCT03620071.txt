      children with medical complexity (CMC). Specific aims of the pilot clinical trail are as
      follows: (1) To assess the efficacy of GoalKeeper on goal-setting in the health care
      encounter. (2) To examine the roles of parent health literacy and parent activation in
      moderating the effect of the intervention.

      Study Population: Stanford's Primary and Subspecialty Care Clinics at Stanford Children's
      Health will serve as the setting for study recruitment.

      The pilot randomized controlled trial will enroll 60 parents of children with medical
      complexity and their health-care providers. Eligibility criteria for participants will be age
      18 years or older, English-speaking, and (for parents) child<12 years old. Exclusion criteria
      are parent with known mental illness or neurocognitive impairment. A stepped wedge approach
      by provider will introduce families to GoalKeeper at different time points in the study. A
      pre-intervention period will occur at least 1 month before the trial start where clinical
      observations and baseline survey information will be obtained of each providers' practice.

      Each family will be given training and 4-month access to the GoalKeeper application and
      participate in an exit interview at the end of study.
