      treatment (laxatives, biofeedback), a surgical solution may be considered (subtotal
      colectomy). But results are variable and it puts them at risk of functional sequelae.

      Sacral nerve modulation is a minimally invasive procedure compared with the standard surgical
      support (colectomy) and reversible, which consists in two stages. First, a 3-week temporary
      stimulation test allows verifying the efficacy of neuromodulation. If the test is positive,
      the stimulating electrode is definitely implanted. Risks related to the procedure (infection,
      pain) are much smaller than those associated with a conventional surgical support.

      Non comparative studies conducted with 19 and 62 patients showed that 40-73% of implanted
      patients have an improvement of their constipation and could benefit of permanent
      implantation with good results in medium term.

      The primary objective of the investigators study is to evaluate the short-term efficacy
      (percentage of responders at 2 months) of sacral nerve modulation in the treatment of severe
      chronic constipation.

      This is a cross-over designed, double-blinded, French multicenter clinical trial, including
      two periods: 2 months of stimulation ON and 2 months of stimulation OFF. Between these two
      periods, a 15-days period of "wash-out" will be respected during which all patients will be
      in OFF mode (4.5 months in total). This period of 4.5 months will be extended by a follow-up
      period of 7 months during which all patients will be treated (stimulation ON).

      If this trial showed efficiency of this procedure, patients with severe refractory
      constipation could benefit of a sacral nerve modulation test before considering a surgical
      treatment.
