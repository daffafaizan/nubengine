    
      The present study is the first evaluation of the efficacy of a selective chest wall
      restriction belt.

      The efficacy will be estimate on forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) at D3 by
      comparing 2 groups: a control group of patients with conventional follow-up and an
      experimental group of patients with conventional follow-up and a daily wear of the selective
      chest wall restriction belt after surgery.
