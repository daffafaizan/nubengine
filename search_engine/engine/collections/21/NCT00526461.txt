      Primary

        -  To determine the maximally tolerated light dose (MTID) in patients with bronchogenic
           carcinoma in situ (CIS) or bronchogenic microinvasive carcinoma.

        -  To identify the systemic and normal tissue toxicity resulting from photodynamic therapy
           using HPPH in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  To study tumor response in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive HPPH IV over 1 hour on day 1. Approximately 2 days later, patients
      undergo photodynamic therapy (PDT) using laser light passed through the biopsy channel of an
      endoscope. Patients undergo endoscopic debridement on day 5. If viable tumor is found outside
      of the initial treatment area, patients may receive another dose of laser light without
      additional HPPH at that time.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 4-6 weeks, 6 months, and
      periodically thereafter.
