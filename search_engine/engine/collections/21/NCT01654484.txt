    
      This is a two stage study.

      Stage One will explore the dose response of three concentrations of DE-117 as monotherapy
      compared with 0.0015% tafluprost and placebo. The safety and efficacy of DE-117 as adjunctive
      therapy (with 0.0015% tafluprost) compared with 0.0015% tafluprost and placebo will also be
      evaluated. In addition, the additive effect of adjunctive therapy of each concentration will
      be compared with the corresponding monotherapy concentration.

      Stage Two will assess the safety and efficacy of the optimal DE-117 concentration as
      monotherapy compared with 0.0015% tafluprost. The safety and efficacy of the optimal DE-117
      concentration as adjunctive therapy (with 0.0015% tafluprost) compared with DE-117
      monotherapy and 0.0015% tafluprost will also be evaluated.
