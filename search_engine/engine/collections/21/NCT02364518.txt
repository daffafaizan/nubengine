      Subject Recruitment. Twenty subjects will be recruited from the MUSC Snoring Clinics as well
      as public information seminars held in the greater Charleston area. Attempts will be made to
      recruit both a gender and racially diverse study population.

      Subject Screening. Subjects who are potentially eligible for the trial include patients who
      seek treatment chronic snoring disruptive to their bed-partner. Patients will require a
      pre-treatment assessment with a Watch-PAT home sleep study device to rule-out moderate and
      severe sleep apnea. Patients must have a regular bed-partner to participate in order to
      capture study outcomes.

      Inclusion Criteria. Potential subjects must meet the following inclusion criteria:

        -  Age ≥ 22 years (no upper limit)

        -  Regular bed-partner

        -  Chronic, disruptive snoring according to bed-partner

        -  Snoring, upper airway resistance syndrome, or mild obstructive sleep apnea (AHI ≤ 15;
