      Although therapies have been proposed, none has been particularly effective. A preceding
      viral infection is believed to cause mitochondrial dysfunction in genetically susceptible
      individuals, resulting in overwhelming fatigue, myalgia and brain fuzziness. The purpose of
      this study was to determine whether therapy that has been shown to be beneficial for
      mitochondrial diseases is also beneficial for CFS.

      Patients received daily conditioning exercise, a high protein diet and nutraceutical therapy
      (ENT). Prescribed nutraceutical supplements incldued alpha-lipoic acid, acetyl-L-carnitine,
      omega-3fatty acids (maxDHA), coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), plus a multivitamin, which were selected
      to enhance mitochondrial function and antioxidant action. Following the institution of ENT,
      patients had received this therapy for varying lengths of time, ranging from 12 to 40 months.
