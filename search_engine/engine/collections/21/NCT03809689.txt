    
      Several animal studies have demonstrated the expression of αvβ3 integrins on the surface of
      the endothelium present in neovessels in formation, especially during neoangiogenesis after
      myocardial ischemic injury.

      68Ga-NODAGA-RGD is a positron-emission-tomography (PET) ligand targeted towards αvβ3
      integrins. αvβ3 integrins could potentially act as a biomarker for the follow-up of heart
      infarction.

      In the present study, 68Ga-NODAGA-RGD PET/CT imaging is a tool to understand and evaluate
      tissue repair after heart lesion and its evolution allowing a better management of patients
      with occluded artery.

      Three groups of patients are included : patients with acute infarction, patients with acute
      infarction requiring reperfusion treatment and patients with chronic ischemic occlusion.

      Each patient would benefit from a 82Rb (82rubidium) PET/CT as part of standard management and
      from a 68Ga-NODAGA-RGD PET/CT as part of the present study.

      Patients from groups 1 and 2 will have 3 sets of both exams : one after the ischemic event,
      one at one month and another at 3 months post event.

      Patients form group 3 will have a set of both exams before reperfusion treatment and one at 2
      months after reperfusion.
