      acute myocardial infarction. Measured with high-sensitivity (HS) assays, HS-cTnT has proven
      predictive value for coronary heart disease, heart failure, and mortality in the general
      population at apparent low-risk for cardiovascular events. In a previous study, our group
      showed that HS-cTnT concentration was associated with subclinical atherosclerosis in systemic
      lupus erythematosus patients. The aim of this study was to determine whether HS-cTnT was
      associated with incident cardiovascular events in systemic lupus erythematosus
