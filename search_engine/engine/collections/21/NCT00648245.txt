      accompanied by airway hyperactivity. The most common form of COPD is a combination of chronic
      bronchitis and emphysema. Many of the signs and symptoms associated with chronic bronchitis
      are a result of airway mucus hypersecretion induced by chronic inflammation of the airways.
      Clinically, mucus hypersecretion results in impaired gas exchange and compromised mucociliary
      clearance, encouraging bacterial colonization and associated exacerbations. A treatment that
      inhibits mucus hypersecretion or blocks inflammation could benefit COPD patients with chronic
      bronchitis. The drug under evaluation in this study, BIO 11006, is a new therapeutic agent
      that may inhibit mucus secretion and may have important anti inflammatory properties. In this
      study, BIO-11006 will be administered to COPD patients with chronic bronchitis, and the
      effects lung function will be assessed.
