      assessments (independent and patient-reported) of chemotherapy-related toxicity (adverse
      events and symptoms) and patient-reported measures of function and quality of life. The
      research team has determined that p16 increases dramatically during chemotherapy and that p16
      levels among persons of similar age are lower among those who exercise as compared to those
      who are sedentary. The research team hypothesizes that engagement in physical activity during
      chemotherapy will have a moderating effect on increases in p16 levels during chemotherapy. To
      test this hypothesis, the study proposes to build on a completed trial, LCCC1334, and enroll
      100 evaluable patients age 21-64 with a Stage I-III breast cancer diagnosis who are about to
      start adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy in an intervention that entails both aerobic and
      resistance exercises.

      Results from both LCCC1334 and the proposed study, LCCC1749, will be used to provide evidence
      for a future grant application to conduct a randomized controlled trial in a larger study
      population to (1) establish the effect of physical activity on p16 levels during chemotherapy
      and (2) further evaluate how baseline and post-chemotherapy p16 levels correlate with
      measures of treatment-related toxicity and patient-reported outcomes over time. Findings from
      this study will also provide preliminary evidence for further investigations of the potential
      benefits of exercise during early breast cancer chemotherapy for (1) reducing the incidence
      and severity of peripheral neuropathy and (2) managing the interface of fatigue and perceived
      cognition deficits.
