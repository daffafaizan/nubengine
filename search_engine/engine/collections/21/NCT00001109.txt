      Currently there is insufficient information on the cell maturation and activation of these
      peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) subsets in normal children. The critical need for
      this information has been brought about by the pediatric HIV/AIDS epidemic, which requires
      the measurement of peripheral blood CD4+ T cells and other cells types for interpretation of
      HIV disease progression. The immunopathogenesis of pediatric HIV infection differs from that
      in adults but is not well understood. In order to better understand HIV disease progression
      in HIV-infected children, these PBMC subsets must be studied in normal children so that
      control values can be established.

      Healthy infants, children, and adolescents presenting for routine care or elective surgery
      have a single blood sample obtained. Blood is used for complete blood count, peripheral blood
      mononuclear cell flow analysis for surface markers, and plasma and cell storage. Demographic
      information including age, sex, race, and ethnicity is obtained at the time of the blood
      draw. The reason for the patient's visit is also documented. No study drugs are administered
      or supplied as part of this study. Statistical analysis is used to estimate the median
      distribution of each CD4 and CD8 subset.
