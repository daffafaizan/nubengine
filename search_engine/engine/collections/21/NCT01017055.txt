    
      Anterior Cervical Decompression and fusion is one of the most common spinal surgical
      procedures performed in the United States. Common complications of this type of surgery are
      difficulty swallowing and nerve dysfunction that can effect voice. The chance of having voice
      and swallowing disturbances increases if this type of surgery has to be repeated. The purpose
      of this study is to document the voice and swallowing function of patients undergoing this
      type of surgery in an effort to find better ways to identify and treat these common
      complications.
