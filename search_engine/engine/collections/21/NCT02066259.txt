      additional information during colon cancer diagnosis -

        1. Highly specific (OctavaGold) - provides additional information to doctors during
           evaluation of normal population.

        2. Highly sensitive (OctavaSilver) - provides additional information to doctors during
           evaluation of high risk population.

      The study will be considered successful it can achieve at least one of the following sets of
      performances -

        1. For the OctavaGold - 95% specificity with at least 50% sensitivity.

        2. For the OctavaSilver - 95% sensitivity with at least 50% specificity. The biological
           objective of this study is to find the best set of antigens, that when combined with the
           appropriate algorithm will support each of the above clinical objectives
