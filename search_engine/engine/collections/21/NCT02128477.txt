    
      Periodic repolarization dynamics (PRD) reflect periodic changes of repolarization instability
      located in the low-frequency spectral range. Level of PRD can be assessed using a high
      resolution surface ECG recorded in the 12-leads of Frank leads configuration during resting
      conditions.

      Increased levels of PRD have been associated with sympathetic overactivity and increased risk
      of mortality in survivors of acute myocardial infarction and patients undergoing a clinically
      indicated exercise test.
