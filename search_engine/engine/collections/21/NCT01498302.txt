        -  To promote harmonization between Cooperative Group Reference Laboratories conducting
           minimal-residual disease (MRD) evaluation of acute myeloid leukemia by flow cytometry.

      OUTLINE: Archived bone marrow and blood samples, distributed to the Eastern Cooperative
      Oncology Group, Southwest Oncology Group, and Cancer and Leukemia Group B laboratories, are
      analyzed for leukemia-associated immunophenotype (LAIP) assays and minimal residual disease
      studies by flow cytometry. Results are then provided to the National Cancer Institute for
      assessment and comparability of test results.
