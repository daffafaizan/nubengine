      gynecologic diseases. One of most important advantages of laparoscopy is a reduced
      postoperative pain compared with open surgery. Moreover, postoperative pain plays an
      important part in the enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) pathway. Although the length of
      hospitalization and recovery period after laparoscopy tends to be shorter, postoperative pain
      can still be an important issue.

      Recently, continuous wound infusion (CWI) providing a constant flow of local anesthetic
      directly a surgical wound postoperatively has been widely used to reduce pain after cesarean
      section and open surgery. Studies evaluating the effectiveness of CWI to manage postoperative
      pain following laparoscopy are markedly lacking. Especially, there was no study comparing CWI
      and placebo in treating gynecologic laparoscopy. Therefore, the investigators conducted this
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to investigate whether CWI of local
      anesthetics was an effective strategy for ERAS, compared with placebo in patients undergoing
      benign gynecologic laparoscopy.
