    
      This is a randomized controlled trial in women at risk following combined prenatal screening
      for Down Syndrome. Women will be asked about their preferences between NIPT and routine
      prenatal diagnosis based on a dedicated questionnaire. Women will then be randomized between
      NIPT and standard invasive prenatal diagnosis.

      The general objectives are :

        -  Promote the rapid and large implementation of Non Invasive Prenatal Testing (NIPT) for
           Down syndrome.

        -  Improve the management of women at risk after combined first trimester screening and
           reduce the number of invasive procedures and induced miscarriages .

        -  Evaluate NIPT medically (in reducing the rate of invasive sampling and related
           complications, diagnostic performance and feasibility and acceptability in routine
           practice) and based on cost-analysis in comparison with standard invasive prenatal
           diagnosis currently proposed .

        -  Clarify the conditions of implementation and dissemination of NIPT in the overall
           organization of prenatal screening for trisomy 21 (and provide data to later adjust or
           not the combination of tests and thresholds).

      Promote the organization as networks of professionals involved in prenatal screening for
      trisomy 21 in order to allow the emergence of a national system of collection of outcomes to
      improve the quality of practices

      The main judgement criteria are:

        -  Main:

           - Percentage of fetal loss in each group

        -  Secondary:

             -  Percentage of invasive tests in each group (amniocentesis or chorionic villus
                sampling )

             -  Diagnostic performance of NIPT , in particular false positive and negative

             -  Percentage of results within 3 weeks and average time interval for results of NIPT

             -  Percentage of inconclusive results of DPANI

             -  Percentage of other anomalies discovered at invasive sampling

             -  Percentage of invasive samples taken despite normal NIPT (either because of later
                ultrasound anomaly or for maternal reinsurance)

             -  Association between maternal characteristics ( weight, height, parity , previous
                history , serum markers ... ) and the results of NIPT

             -  Cost analysis of NIPT in routine clinical practice

      The study will include 2450 high risk women in order to be powered enough to detect a 1%
      reduction of miscarriages in the group undergoing NIPT instead of routine invasive prenatal
      diagnosis.
