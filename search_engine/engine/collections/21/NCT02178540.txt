      representative of potential TOBI Podhaler users, can understand and follow the approved IFU
      and the extent to which the approved IFU supports safe and effective use of the Podhaler
      device.

      This study is an 'actual use' study, in that patients will inhale the contents of placebo
      capsules through the Podhaler device.

      Due to the use of placebo capsules, the study is considered a clinical study and will be
      conducted accordingly. The study is therefore a human factors observational use study
      conducted within a clinical study. It is an open label, unblinded, non-randomized study and
      consists of two visits. At visit 2 patients who are eligible will participate in a human
      factor assessment to determine whether or not a patient understands the IFU content and can
      demonstrate safe and effective use of the Podhaler device.
