        -  Confirm the antitumor efficacy of intracavitary interleukin-2 plus autologous
           lymphokine-activated killer cells in patients with primary, recurrent or refractory
           malignant gliomas.

        -  Determine whether the induction of a regional, intracavitary, eosinophilia is a
           prognosticator of response to immunotherapy and long term survival in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive cytoreductive tumor surgery and/or biopsy and implantation of
      intracavitary Ommaya reservoir prior to therapy induction.

      Patients undergo outpatient leukapheresis on day -4 or -5, and cells are incubated ex vivo
      with interleukin-2 (IL-2). Lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells and IL-2 are infused on
      day 1. Bolus infusions of low-dose IL-2 are administered on days 3, 5, 8, 10, and 12,
      followed by a rest period on days 13-24. The course is repeated on day 25 starting with
      leukapheresis. Therapy courses are repeated for up to 1 year for stable disease or response
      to therapy. Maintenance doses repeat every 4-6 months thereafter.

      Disease restaging is done every 8-12 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients per year will be enrolled.
