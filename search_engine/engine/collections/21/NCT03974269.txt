      remifentanil group. Patients of the hypnosis group will have one preoperative and one
      perioperative hypnosis session with a qualified anesthesiologist. Patients of the
      remifentanil group will receive sedation with remifentanil, administered using a pre
      specified target controlled-infusion protocol.

      Incidence of delirium will be recorded in the cardiac intensive care unit (CICU) during the
      first 72 postoperative hours, using the Confusion Assessment Method in the ICU (CAM-ICU).
      Incidence of other complications such as episodes of oxygen desaturation, vascular wound,
      stroke, general anesthesia requirement and inhospital death will be recorded, as well as
      procedure duration, hospital length of stay, patient satisfaction and operator comfort.

      Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) procedures are frequently complicated with
      postoperative delirium.
