      of thromboembolism. It is also frequently used off-label as a perioperative bridge for
      patients that are chronically anticoagulated prior to surgery, such as those taking Warfarin.
      It is an attractive option for perioperative use secondary to its predictable pharmacologic
      profile and the lack of recommended routine blood monitoring. Therefore, it is common to
      encounter a patient who has recently received a treatment dose of Enoxaparin prior to
      presenting for surgery. For these patients, and those on other anticoagulant medications,
      published guidelines have been developed to help guide clinical decision-making when the
      anesthetic/analgesic plan includes regional anesthesia.1 Currently, these guidelines
      recommend that a minimum of 24-hours should elapse following the last treatment dose of
      Enoxaparin before a neuraxial procedure is performed. However, a recently completed quality
      improvement project conducted at Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center found that almost 60% of
      patients presenting for surgery while on treatment dose enoxaparin still had significant
      anticoagulant activity 24-hours following their last dose, as demonstrated by anti-Xa level
      assay testing. Given that the risk of epidural hematoma formation is increased in the setting
      of abnormal coagulation parameters2, the significance of this finding is that the risk of
      bleeding complications following a neuraxial procedure may still be increased 24-hours after
      the last treatment dose of enoxaparin.

      While the routine use of anti-Xa level testing may be a viable option to determine when
      residual enoxaparin activity is present before proceeding with a neuraxial procedure on a
      patient-by-patient basis, it is not universally available at all hospitals. Therefore, it is
      important to determine the time interval following the last enoxaparin dose at which the
      likelihood that a clinically relevant amount of residual anti-Xa level activity no longer
      persists, so that providers can confidently proceed with a neuraxial procedure when anti-Xa
      level testing is not available.
