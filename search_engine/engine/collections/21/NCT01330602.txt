    
      Individuals at intermediate risk account for a large proportion of patients presenting with
      atherosclerotic events. The barriers to reducing this problem relate to the expense of an
      unselective primary prevention strategy among a group where the majority will not have
      events, as well as the difficulty of getting apparently well subjects to adhere to lifestyle
      and pharmacologic management.

      An outcome-based study would require large numbers and would be unlikely to be funded without
      proof of concept. CIMT will be used as a validated surrogate of atherosclerotic status and
      future cardiovascular events in this study.

      As such, this study will use CIMT (as both a delineator of risk and in the primary endpoint),
      a marker of atherosclerotic burden (the disease process rather than a surrogate), to address
      the unresolved issue about how to most efficiently manage intermediate risk subjects with a
      family history of premature atherosclerosis by combining better selection of such individuals
      for active treatment and recommended lifestyle changes with a DMP strategy to optimise their
      successful application in the longer-term.

      The Intima-Media thickness guidance of Primary prevention in Relatives of individuals with
      Early onSet atherosclerosiS (IMPRESS) Study will test the following null hypothesis:

      In intermediate risk, first-degree relatives (i.e. mother, father, brother or sister) of
      individuals with premature atherosclerosis, a CIMT-targeted DMP for primary prevention (the
      IMPRESS intervention) incorporating more intensive non-pharmacological and pharmacological
      management, provides no better reduction of atherosclerotic burden (as determined by the
      change in CIMT from baseline to follow-up completion) than usual health care management
      during three years follow-up.

      Study Design The study hypotheses will be examined via a randomised controlled primary
      prevention/intervention trial comparing an individualised DMP with usual clinical care of
      middle-aged (40-65 years old) subjects who have a family history of premature cardiovascular
      disease and are determined to be at intermediate risk for a cardiovascular event within the
      next 5 years7, 22.

      Study Centres

      As a multicentre study, participants will be recruited from three centres:

        -  Princess Alexandra Hospital (Brisbane, Australia): responsible site investigator
           Associate Professor Karam Kostner

        -  Baker IDI Heart and Diabetes Institute/ The Alfred Hospital (Melbourne, Australia):
           responsible site investigator Dr Melinda Carrington

        -  National University Health System and Novena Heart Centre (Singapore): responsible site
           investigator Professor Desley Hegney

      Participants This study will be conducted in a group of 40-65 year old adults.

      IMPRESS Study will test the following null hypothesis:

      In intermediate risk, first-degree relatives (i.e. mother, father, brother or sister) of
      individuals with premature atherosclerosis, a CIMT-targeted DMP for primary prevention (the
      IMPRESS intervention) incorporating more intensive non-pharmacological and pharmacological
      management, provides no better reduction of atherosclerotic burden (as determined by the
      change in CIMT from baseline to follow-up completion) than usual health care management
      during three years follow-up.

      Primary End-Point Consistent with the study hypothesis, the primary study end-point is change
      in CIMT from baseline to three years, as determined by a blinded core laboratory and analysed
      on an intention-to-treat basis according to random study group allocation.

      Secondary End-Points

      The secondary endpoints are change from baseline to three years in the following variables:

      i) Plaque length (carotid artery) ii) Internal CIMT iii) General health and well being (as
      measured by the SF-12 18 and EQ-5D 19) iv) Mental health (as determined by the Arrol 20 +/-
      CESD 21) v) Health care costs vi) Modifiable risk factors for atherosclerotic disease other
      than diabetes ( i.e. smoking, dyslipidaemia, obesity and hypertension) vii) Absolute
      cardiovascular risk profile 22 and risk of diabetes (as determined by the Type 2 Diabetes
      Risk Assessment Tool [AUSDRISK]) Score 23) viii) Diabetic status (as determined by fasting
      glucose) ix) All-cause mortality/ cardiovascular hospitalisation
