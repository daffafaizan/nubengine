      I. To assess the 4-month progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with recurrent,
      unresectable malignant pleural mesothelioma (MAM) treated with nintedanib.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess response rate (confirmed and unconfirmed, complete and partial responses) and
      disease control rate (response or stable disease) in the subset of patients with measurable
      disease by both RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) 1.1 criteria and
      Modified RECIST criteria for pleural tumors.

      II. To assess overall survival.

      III. To evaluate the frequency and severity of toxicities associated with this treatment
      regimen.

      IV. To collect tissue samples for future correlative studies related to overall study
      objectives.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive nintedanib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every
      28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.
