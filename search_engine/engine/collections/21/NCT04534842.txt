    
      This is an open-label, single-arm Phase 2 study; all participating PKU patients will receive
      active study drug, SYNB1618. This study is evaluating a dose-ramp regimen consisting of 4
      dose levels of SYNB1618 over 15 days of treatment.

      This study has been designed with the flexibility of being able to be conducted either at the
      clinical site or by a home healthcare professional at an alternative location (e.g.,
      patient's home, hotel).

      Patients will be screened for eligibility and complete a customized diet run-in period prior
      to starting the 15-day dose ramp ('treatment period'). During the treatment period patients
      will be required to adhere to the same customized diet menus as in the diet run-in period.

      The efficacy of SYNB1618 will be assessed in this study by measuring the reduction of the
      area under the curve (AUC) for plasma D5-phenylalanine (D5-Phe) as well as the reduction of
      plasma Phe levels.

      Safety will be monitored by documentation of adverse events (AEs), clinical laboratory
      measurements, vital signs, and physical examinations.
