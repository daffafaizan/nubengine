      hormone therapy (HT) can spare menopausal women from bone loss and other menopausal symptoms,
      Women's Health Initiative (WHI) findings indicate significant potential health risks
      associated with HT. This has prompted women to switch from HT to naturally occurring
      compounds similar to estrogen, such as those derived from soy, in the hope that estrogens
      from plant sources can provide benefits while sparing adverse effects caused by prescribed
      estrogens. However, the long-term efficacy and safety of plant estrogens are unknown. This
      study will evaluate the effectiveness of treatment using purified soy isoflavones, a dietary
      source of phytoestrogens, in preventing bone loss, menopausal symptoms, and other changes
      associated with estrogen deficiency in young menopausal women. The "Soy Phytoestrogens As
      Replacement Estrogen (SPARE)" study will provide a foundation of knowledge from which
      menopausal women and their doctors can begin to make more informed decisions regarding HT and
      other treatment options.

      Enrollment into the study will occur over 3 years, with each participant taking part in the
      study for a total of 2 years. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups;
      the first group will receive a 200 mg dose of soy isoflavones daily and the second group will
      receive placebo daily. There will be 10 study visits: screening, study entry, randomization
      at Month 1, six follow-up visits at Months 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and a final visit at the end
      of active participation at Month 24. At each study visit, participants will have blood drawn,
      provide urine samples, answer questionnaires, and have mammograms and bone density tests.
