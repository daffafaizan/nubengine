      Primary

        -  Determine the efficacy of electroacupuncture, in terms of reducing acute and delayed
           chemotherapy-induced nausea, in patients with newly diagnosed pediatric sarcoma,
           neuroblastoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, or germ cell tumors.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the efficacy of this therapy, in terms of reducing delayed
           chemotherapy-induced emesis, in these patients.

        -  Determine the efficacy of this therapy, in terms of altering salivary cortisol levels
           and fasting serum glucose and insulin levels as stress parameters, in these patients.

        -  Determine the efficacy of this therapy, in terms of improving the quality of life, in
           these patients.

        -  Determine the efficacy of this therapy, in terms of reducing acute nausea and emesis, in
           these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind study. Patients are stratified
      according to planned treatment with cisplatin-based chemotherapy (yes vs no) and gender.
      Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo electroacupuncture to specific acupuncture points on the arms
           and legs over 25 minutes twice daily on days 1 and 2 and then once daily on days 3-7
           during week 1 of chemotherapy course 1 (9 acupuncture treatments total).

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo electroacupuncture to sham points on the arms and legs as in
           arm I.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, on days 1 and 8 of each treatment course, and then
      after completion of the study.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 65 patients (approximately 32 per arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 2.5-3 years.
