      endpoints. A total of 10 KD children or young adults with indication of revascularization are
      enrolled, and BVS will be implanted for stenotic or occluded lesions. QCA and optical
      coherence tomography (OCT) are used to evaluate the baseline lumen area, plaque
      characteristics, and BVS expansion or eccentricity after deployment. At 12 months, scaffold
      restenosis is evaluated by multislice computed tomography. At 30 months, patients will
      receive follow-up by angiography and OCT to evaluate lumen area, neoplaque characteristics,
      and side branch conditions. Otherwise, the composite endpoint including cardiac death,
      myocardial infarction, and ischaemia-driven target lesion revascularisation are assessed at
      30 days, 6 and 9 months, and 1, 2, 3 years.
