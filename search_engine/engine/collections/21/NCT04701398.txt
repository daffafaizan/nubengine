      waiting list for deceased donor kidney transplantation (KT), and outcomes are worsened in
      those frail recipients after KT. Frailty and poor fitness powerfully predict mortality,
      kidney graft survival, and healthcareutilization after KT. Frailty in CKD patients displays a
      unique constellation of features such as muscle wasting, anorexia, protein energy wasting,
      inflammation, oxidative stress, catabolic/anabolic hormone imbalance, metabolic acidosis, and
      other cellularalterations that characterize a special population. Intervention is essential
      to improve quality of life for frail CKD patients, regardless of their age. Efforts to
      intervene with post- transplant physical therapy have been met with limited success, in large
      part due to high study dropout. A pre-transplant clinical framework for multimodal
      prehabilitation interventions including physicaltherapy, nutritional measures and
      psychological support scheduled for before the transplant may improve patient retention
      andcompliance, better mitigate the effects of frailty and poor fitness after KT, and improve
      main outcomes in frail CKD patients.

      The main objective of this study is to assess effectiveness, feasibility and safety of
      multimodal prehabilitation (exercise, nutritional plans, psychological advice) in frail and
      non-frail KT candidates in the context of a randomized controlled clinical trial. The primary
      endpoint will be a composite achievement of clinical and functional outcomes in frail and
      non-frail KT candidates after KT.
