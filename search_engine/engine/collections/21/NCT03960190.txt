      effect of a build-up of pressure within the breast due to the accumulation of milk, combined
      with the external negative pressure introduced by the breast pump, results in the expression
      of milk. However, in order to express sufficient amounts of milk it is important to stimulate
      the Milk Ejection Reflex (MER). The MER, also called letdown, draught ejection, expulsion or
      pumping reflex, is described as a response of the mammary gland to oxytocin. When the nipple
      is stimulated, the mother's posterior pituitary gland releases oxytocin into the bloodstream.
      Upon reaching the breast tissue, oxytocin provokes contraction of cells within the structure
      of the breast causing milk flow. Without the MER successful breastfeeding or breast milk
      expression cannot happen. In order to stimulate the MER, Philips has developed 2 new
      expression kits to better mimic the suckling pattern of an infant.
