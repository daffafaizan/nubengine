      three groups to receive pretreatment of 0.005, 0.01, and 0.02 mg/kg cisatracurium,
      respectively. General anesthesia was induced 3.5 min later, train of four stimulation was
      monitored 4.5 min later, succinylcholine 1.5 mg/kg was injected 5 min later, and endotracheal
      intubation was implemented 6.5 min later. The side effects of cisatracurium, intensity of
      fasciculations, intubating conditions, time and extent to maximal depression of twitch and
      time for its recovery to 20% of control value, severity of myalgia at 24 h postoperatively,
      serum potassium before cisatracurium pretreatments, at intubating time, and 5 min after
      intubation were recorded.
