    
      This will be a single-dose, randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalating
      study.

      The study will include four escalating dose groups, with eight subjects in each dose group.
      Subjects will be randomized in 3:1 ratio to receive a single SC injection of MOD-5014 (n=6)
      or a placebo (n=2), and will be followed up for 30 days. The initial MOD-5014 dose group will
      receive 100 µg/kg followed by single doses of 200, 400 and 600 µg/kg administered to
      subsequent subject cohorts.

      The decision to proceed to the higher dose level will be made by a Data Safety Monitoring
      Board (DSMB) after review of relevant safety data (including adverse events, clinical
      laboratory and vital signs), collected up to and including 7 days after the last subject of
      the previous dose group has been dosed.

      Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) guidelines will be used to determine
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose limiting toxicity (DLT). Dose escalation will be
      permitted if the prior dose is well tolerated, and there are no safety or tolerability
      concerns raised by the investigator, sponsor, medical monitor or DSMB over 7 days
      post-dosing.
