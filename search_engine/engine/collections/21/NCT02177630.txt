      performed for definite diagnosis. In addition, patients undergo magnetic resonance imaging at
      1.5 Tesla and 3.0 Tesla within 24 hours. The imaging protocol of both scan include assessment
      of myocardial edema respectively edema ratio; myocardial hyperemia respectively global
      relative enhancement (gRE); myocardial fibrosis/necrosis respectively myocardial LE and T1
      and T2 mapping sentences. Diagnostic performance of different imaging protocols as compared
      to the findings of endomyocardial biopsies is calculated.

      The protocol also includes a follow-up MR can at 3 months.
