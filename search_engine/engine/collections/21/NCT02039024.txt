      amyloid deposition of brain by florbetapir F-18 PET imaging and monoaminergic function by18F-
      DTBZ PET in 10 age-matched healthy subjects (NC group), 30 PD patients without dementia/ICD
      (PD group), 30 PD patients with dementia (PDD group), and 20 patients with dementia (AD
      group). We will also analyze monoaminergic function by18F- DTBZ PET in 30 PD patients with
      ICD (PDI group).

      Each evaluable subject involved in this study must fulfill all the inclusion and exclusion
      criteria according the subject grouping, healthy subjects, PD, PDD, and AD patients will have
      4 visits in this study ,as one screening visit, one florbetapir F-18 imaging visit, one
      18F-DTBZ imaging visit, and one safety evaluation.PDI patients will have 3 visits in this
      study, as one screening visit, one 18F-DTBZ imaging visit, and one safety evaluation. Safety
      measurement will be evaluated by medical history, vital signs, physical examinations,
      laboratory examinations and collecting of adverse events.
