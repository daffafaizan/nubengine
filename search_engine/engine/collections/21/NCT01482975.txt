      Israel), and substances (tobacco, alcohol and other drugs) has consistently identified four
      clusters of non-users who vary in their risks for substance use: (1) Most Protected from
      substance use; (2) High Risk to use substances; (3) Ambivalent about staying substance free;
      and (4) Risk Denial about substance use. These profiles have demonstrated both internal and
      external validity as well as good ability to predict future substance use and, therefore,
      provide an opportunity to develop a new approach to prevention. These profiles will be
      employed as the basis for designing two innovative computer-based interventions to prevent
      substance abuse by adolescents. The two new tailored interventions (smoking prevention and
      alcohol prevention) will be developed and tested in a school-based clinical trial. The
      comparison group will receive two previously developed and tested tailored health behavior
      interventions (diet and physical activity).
