    
      This is a randomized double-blinded placebo controlled trial to assess the efficacy of
      treatment with montelukast 10 mg PO QD x 5 days versus placebo for the treatment of
      viral-induced upper respiratory infection in healthy adults aged 18-50 years. All subjects
      complete daily assessments of cold symptoms, nasal clearance rates and secretion rates during
      each day of the study. Phlebotomy is performed once for the determination of cytokine
      genotyping and allergy skin testing is performed once for the assessment of atopy.
