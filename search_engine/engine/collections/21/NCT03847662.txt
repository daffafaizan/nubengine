      subsistence farmers grow crops, but face barriers sending produce to markets. The present
      intervention purchases local crops from local women subsistence farmers which are processed
      in local small-scale food processing facilities to produce instant fortified complementary
      foods for weaning.

      Methods: A repeated measures survey was conducted from October to November 2016, with
      Caregiver-Child(<2y) pairs (n=800) in the provinces of Lai Chau, Lao Cai and Ha Giang.
      Anthropometric data of mother/child dyads was assessed and logistic regression analysis of
      stunted and underweight children explored associated factors. These included: core infant and
      young child feeding practices indicators, food insecurity, antenatal care check-ups, core
      water/sanitation, anemia and hygiene indicators.

      This project leveraged the experience of the National Institute of Nutrition of Vietnam to
      ensure HACCP standards during manufacture. Locally grown rice was combined with a Zn/Fe
      premix before extrusion and hammer-milling. Local vegetables such as: "Sweet leaf" (Sauropus
      androgynous), pumpkin, Shiitake mushrooms (Lentinula edodes) and carrots were made into
      complimentary foods and sold locally.
