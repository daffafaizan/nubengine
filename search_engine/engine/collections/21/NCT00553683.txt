        -  To study the safety and effectiveness of a strategy to establish robust anticancer
           immunologic body defenses by using low-dose radiation therapy to the liver cancer in
           order to increase tumor targetability; inject a body defense activator,
           polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid polylysine carboxymethylcellulose (poly ICLC, hiltonol,
           oncovir), into and around the cancer to activate sentinel dendritic cells to alarm body
           defenses; and shut down local production of factors that suppress the body's natural
           anticancer defenses by starving the cancer of its blood supply within the liver.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive low-dose oral cyclophosphamide once daily on days 1-21 and undergo
      3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy on days 21-23. On day 24, patients undergo an intra- or
      peri-tumoral polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid polylysine carboxymethylcellulose (poly ICLC)
      injection directly into the tumor followed by trans-hepatic artery embolization to the
      designated tumor. Patients receive poly ICLC subcutaneously on days 26, 35, 37, 42, 44, 49,
      and 51. Treatment repeats every 57 days for up to 3 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then
      every 6 months thereafter.
