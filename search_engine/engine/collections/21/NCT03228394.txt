      PPD. In addition, ganaxolone's efficacy in treating depressive symptoms will be assessed
      through a set of exploratory analyses. Plasma levels of ganaxolone will be determined through
      pharmacokinetic analysis. The study results will be used to select a ganaxolone dose and
      dosing regimen for further development in PPD.
