      satisfactory relief for all or most patients with LGS and a combination of treatments is
      often required. Even with combination therapy, many LGS patients show resistance to
      treatment. Adjunctive therapy with newer anticonvulsant medications has demonstrated efficacy
      for some patients, although polytherapy and high medication doses are often associated with
      unfavorable adverse event profiles.

      More effective and better-tolerated treatment options are needed for this population of
      medically intractable epilepsy patients. Clobazam may provide an improved safety profile
      compared to other AEDs currently approved for the treatment of LGS and may have less
      hypotonia and drooling effects than other benzodiazepines.
