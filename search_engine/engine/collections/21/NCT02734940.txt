      will develop chronic pain.

      Opioids are the main stay of analgesia in cardiac surgery because of the safer hemodynamic
      profile and sedation. However high dose narcotic use is associated with a variety of unwanted
      side effects prolonging postoperative recovery. There is growing evidence for the
      effectiveness of multimodal approach utilizing opiate sparing techniques for enhancing
      patient recovery following surgery. Early extubation has been associated with improved
      patient outcome and cost effectiveness in cardiac surgery. The investigators objective is to
      assess the effectiveness of an opioid sparing multimodal approach for enhancing the recovery
      in Cardiac Surgical patients. This model would use a combination of intravenous
      (Dexmedetomidine, Ketamine, Lidocaine) and Spinal (Morphine) drugs. All of the above
      anesthetic drugs have opioid sparing effect in surgical Patients.

      Dexmedetomidine use has been associated with decreased cardiac arrhythmias and improved
      neurological outcome in cardiac surgical patients. Ketamine has been linked with attenuation
      of postoperative cognitive dysfunction after cardiac surgery. Both intravenous lidocaine and
      spinal morphine have been shown to reduce opioid consumption in the perioperative period.
