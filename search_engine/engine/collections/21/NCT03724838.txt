      immunologic adaptation and genetic incompatibility seem to be involved in deficient
      trophoblastic implantation. Placental hypoxia and endothelial dysfunction may lead to
      preeclampsia through an exacerbated systemic inflammatory reaction. Increased placental
      expression and secretion of soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 appear to play a central role
      in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia. The soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 antagonizes the
      proangiogenic biologic activity of circulating vascular endothelial growth factor and
      placental growth factor, leading to a failure of nitric oxide signaling to smooth muscle The
      investigators will conduct a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial designed to
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of Esomeprazole alone or with Sildenafil Citrate in preterm
      pregnancies complicated by preeclampsia.
