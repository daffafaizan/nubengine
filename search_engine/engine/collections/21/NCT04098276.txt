      immigrant women remain an understudied and underserved population in need for evidence-based
      rigorously evaluated culturally competent interventions that address the health and safety
      needs of immigrant women. This study uses a sequential, multiple assignment, randomized trial
      (SMART) design to rigorously evaluate an adaptive culturally informed intervention tailored
      to needs of immigrant women with IPV experiences. For the first stage randomization,
      participants will be randomly assigned to an online intervention or the usual care control
      arm and safety, mental health and empowerment outcomes will be assessed at 3, 6 and 12 months
      follow up. For the second stage randomization, women who do not report significant
      improvement in safety (i.e., reduction in IPV) and in empowerment from baseline to follow up
      points (i.e., non-responders) will be re- randomized to the augmented intervention components
      (text only or a combination of text and phone) developed in the formative phase. Data on
      outcomes (safety and empowerment) will be assessed at 6 and 12 months of re- randomization.
      By re-randomizing participants, the study will assess the relative effectiveness of two
      strategies for augmentation (text only or a combination of text and phone) on safety and
      empowerment outcomes among the non-responders of the online intervention. In addition, the
      study will compare the non-responder group of women to the responder group of the online
      intervention to determine if the strategies of augmentation brought the non-responders to the
      level of responders on safety and empowerment. Finally, the study will identify facilitators
      and barriers to the adoption, implementation and maintenance of use of the original and
      augmented intervention by programs serving immigrant women and design strategies to decrease
      barriers and build on strengths.
