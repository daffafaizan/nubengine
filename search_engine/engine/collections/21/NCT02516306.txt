      were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to use of either EV06 Ophthalmic Solution or Placebo
      Ophthalmic Solution. For the first 7 days of study product administration (Period 1: Days
      1-7), subjects applied 1 drop of their assigned study product to one eye twice per day. For
      the next 84 days (Period 2: Days 8 - 91), if there were no unanticipated and no significant
      adverse events observed in the treated eye, subjects applied 1 drop of their assigned study
      product to both eyes twice per day.
