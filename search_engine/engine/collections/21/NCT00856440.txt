      for those at increased genetic risk. Despite the large number of individuals requiring such
      screening, there has been little randomized, controlled research to determine the relative
      renal safety of oral colon preparation solutions that are used to evacuate the bowel in
      patients with "normal" kidney function, the best frequency of laxative dosing (e.g. 1 day vs.
      2 day), and the quality of the colon cleansing that results from these different approaches.
      Reports of acute renal failure, secondary to nephrocalcinosis, following the commonly used
      oral phosphosoda preparation are increasingly recognized. It is our belief that this project
      will yield clinically relevant information that would have immediate clinical application for
      all persons receiving a colonoscopy. Since preparation for screening colonoscopy involves
      vigorous purging of stool from individuals without GI complaints, it also represents an
      opportunity to study the prevalence of clostridium difficile (C. diff) in this population.
      This may reveal important information regarding the epidemiology of this increasingly
      virulent and common enteric pathogen. A pilot screening program for asymptomatic C. diff, a
      common nosocomial pathogen, may reveal findings of clinical importance for preventing spread
      of this infection, and allow use of presumptive treatment during periods of increased risk.
