    
      This is a randomized, open-label, active-controlled, parallel-group, multi-center study of
      vicriviroc maleate in treatment-na√Øve subjects infected with CCR5-tropic HIV. The study will
      compare the virologic benefit of vicriviroc combined with ritonavir-boosted Reyataz to a
      control group receiving Truvada plus ritonavir-boosted Reyataz. Interim analyses will be
      performed when the first cohort of 80 subjects have completed 24 weeks and 48 weeks of
      treatment. The second cohort of 120 subjects will be enrolled after the first interim
      analysis; a third interim analysis will be performed when subjects in this second cohort have
      completed 24 weeks of treatment. The primary efficacy analysis will be conducted when all 200
      subjects from both stages have completed 48 weeks of treatment or discontinued. The final
      analysis will be performed at Week 96, when all 200 subjects have completed 96 weeks of
      treatment or discontinued. If vicriviroc is shown to provide benefit at the studied dose,
      study participants in the vicriviroc arm who complete 96 weeks of treatment may continue in a
      protocol extension, where they will be offered vicriviroc free of charge until the drug is
      commercially available in their location or until the sponsor terminates the clinical
      development of vicriviroc.
