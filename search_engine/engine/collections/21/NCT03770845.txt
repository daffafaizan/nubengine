      status has an impact on clinical outcomes, as already demonstrated in COPD. However, few data
      regarding this subject are available for patients with IPF.

      Primary aim of this study is to assess the nutritional status of patients diagnosed with mild
      to moderate IPF at the time of disease diagnosis. To do so, the investigators assess the
      prevalence of nutritional disorders at baseline through nutritional scores evaluated with
      specific questionnaires and through the identification of the following metabolic phenotypes
      (based on those previously applied in COPD): cachexia, sarcopenia, normal nutritional status,
      obesity, sarcopenic obesity.

      Secondary aims of this study are:

        -  the evaluation of the impact of the introduction of an anti-fibrotic pharmacological
           agent (pirfenidone or nintedanib) on the nutritional status of patients (modification of
           metabolic phenotypes and nutritional scores) evaluated at 6 months from the initiation
           of antifibrotic therapy.

        -  the assessment of calcium and vitamin D metabolism, by blood sampling, in patients
           diagnosed with mild to moderate IPF at the time of disease diagnosis and at 6 months
           from the initiation of antifibrotic therapy.
