      I. To determine if continuous infusion of local anesthesia (CILA) decreases post-operative
      pain after radical cystectomy (RC).

      II. To determine if CILA reduces narcotic requirements after RC.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if CILA decreases length-of-stay after RC. II. To determine if CILA improves
      patients satisfaction with post-operative pain control after RC.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive ropivacaine hydrochloride intravenously (IV) continuously over 72
      hours after radical cystectomy.

      ARM II: Patients receive normal saline (placebo) IV continuously over 72 hours after radical
      cystectomy.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up within 30 days.
