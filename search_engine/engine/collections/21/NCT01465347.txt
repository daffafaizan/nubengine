      to evaluate the safety and tolerability, efficacy, PK profile, PFS/time to disease
      progression, QoL, and overall survival in adults when TSC is added to the standard of care
      regimen of radiation therapy and temozolomide. All patients received TSC in this study. The
      primary objective of the Phase 1 portion of the study was to evaluate the safety (DLT rate)
      and to define the dosing regimen of TSC for the larger Phase 2 study. The primary clinical
      endpoint was overall survival at 24 months and patients will be followed for up to 3 years.
