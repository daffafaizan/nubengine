    
      IQUARE is a multicentric individually-tailored controlled trial comparing two types of audit
      and feedback interventions:

        -  audit and feedback associated to cooperative work meetings between hospital
           geriatricians and nursing home (NH) staff in a 6-month intervention (strong
           intervention)

        -  audit and feedback only (light intervention) Power statistics and sample size
           calculations indicated that each group should be composed of at least 2 500 individuals.
           The strong intervention will last 6 months and is composed of two face-to-face
           cooperative meetings (hospital geriatricians and NH staff). Data will be collected at
           baseline and in a 18-month follow-up.
