      subjects was planned to be enrolled. This was performed according to a double blind,
      randomized, placebo controlled design and included two sequential dose groups of repeat
      doses. Each group enrolled 12 subjects on salvianolic acid A or placebo (ratio 9
      experimental: 3 placebo) and received salvianolic acid A or placebo twice daily (90mg) or
      daily (180mg) for 7 days, and follow-up to 3 or 4 days.
