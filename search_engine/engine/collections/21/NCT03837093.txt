      and effector T cells (Teffs) which is deregulated in autoimmune diseases (AID).

      The existence of an AID indicates a lack of Tregs. Our team has discovered that low-dose
      interleukin-2 (ld-IL2) activates and specifically increases Tregs in humans and thus may
      improve AID. Exploiting this potential requires i) to better target the dose with the best
      benefit / risk ratio and also ii) to better understand the mechanism of action of this
      molecule through clinical trials of ld-IL2 in progress, including in type 1 diabetes,
      multiple sclerosis and systemic lupus erythematosus. During these clinical trials, a very
      thorough immunological follow-up is carried out in order to discover biomarkers of treatment
      efficacy. Exploitation of these results will benefit both the cross-analysis of the effects
      of IL-2 in these 3 diseases with distinct pathophysiologies, but also very importantly a
      comparison with the effects of ld-IL2 at the healthy volunteer. These analyzes should make it
      possible to define the most effective dose of IL-2.
