      occlusion. Case reports have shown some benefit of intravitreal steroid injections in
      improving vision and reducing macular edema in eyes with retinal vein occlusions.

      Recently, a sustained drug release steroid implant has been investigated and FDA approved to
      treat macular edema in patients with non-infectious uveitis, eye inflammation. This implant
      is placed through an incision in the eye wall and is designed to deliver a steroid,
      fluocinolone acetonide, for upto three years. In animal studies there was no detectable
      steroid seen in the blood stream.

      This pilot trial will recruit individuals who have had a retinal vein occlusion in at least
      one eye. If the macular edema and vision improves with an initial intravitreal injection, the
      eye will be considered to receive the sustained drug release device. The dosage of
      fluocinolone acetonide used is 0.59 mg.
