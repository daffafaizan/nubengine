      to which, following a baseline assessment session, subjects were tested under two acute
      treatment conditions on two separate days. Following the baseline assessment day, 16 subjects
      were randomized, using a computer-generated random number sequence, to receive during test
      day 1 DSR and 19 to receive placebo. During test day 2, these two groups of subjects were
      crossed over to receive the alternative experimental treatment. The time intervals between
      the baseline assessment day, test day 1 and test day 2 were two to three weeks and 1 month
      respectively, in order to avoid the possibility of any carry-over effects.
