      volume of patients with severe polycystic liver disease who are not candidates or decline
      surgical treatments such as liver cyst fenestration, liver resection or liver transplantation
      compared with placebo. The secondary aims of the study are: (1)Assess the effect of
      Octreotide LAR速 Depot on the total kidney volume and iothalamate clearance in patients with
      polycystic kidney disease associated with severe polycystic liver disease who are not
      candidates or decline surgical treatments such as liver cyst fenestration, liver resection or
      liver transplantation. (2)Evaluate quality of life changes associated with the administration
      of Octreotide LAR速 Depot in these patients. (3)Assess toxicity of Octreotide LAR速 Depot in
      patients with polycystic liver disease (PLD).

      Note: Subjects who completed this 1 year randomized trial were offered enrollment into an
      open-label (all subjects received Octreotide) extension trial for an additional two years of
      treatment.
