      community. Physiotherapy is often the first line of management for this condition. However,
      the effectiveness of physiotherapy for CRCP has not been well studied. Thus this project
      primarily aims to investigate the effect of a multimodality physiotherapy program to treat
      CRCP where effect is measured in terms of pain, disability and health-related quality of
      life. The secondary aim is to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of physiotherapy as a treatment
      for CRCP.
