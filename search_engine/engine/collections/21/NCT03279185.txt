    
      This is a prospective cohort study designed to define the impact of HIV infection and
      antiretroviral therapy (ART) on young adults with perinatal HIV infection as they transition
      to adulthood.

      The primary objectives of this study are:

        1. To identify infectious and non-infectious complications of HIV disease and toxicities
           resulting from long-term ART, including disease progression, immune suppression, viral
           resistance, end-organ disease, and mortality.

        2. To define the impact of HIV infection and ART on the long-term clinical outcomes of
           young adults with perinatal HIV.

        3. To define the impact of perinatal HIV infection and ART on long-term mental and
           behavioral health outcomes.
