      and resistance to chemotherapy and radiation. It has also been shown (6) that the presence of
      hypoxia may reduce long-term survival post surgery. Hypoxia renders tumor cells up to three
      times more resistant to ionizing radiation than aerobic cells. The presence of hypoxic
      regions within tumors may be one factor leading to local failure after treatment with
      standard pre-operative radiotherapy doses. If these regions could be identified and verified
      using a non-invasive imaging technique prior to surgery, they could be specifically targeted
      using sophisticated planning techniques such as intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT)
      to deliver higher doses ionizing radiation with preoperative radiotherapy. Future studies
      using IMRT to "dose paint" areas of hypoxia within tumors will build upon the results of this
      feasibility study. Ultimately, by the delivery of differential dose of radiation to the
      tumor, in combination with surgery, the local control rates of rectal cancer patients may
      further be improved.
