      complication following pediatric cataract surgery. Any drug that prevents or decreases this
      inflammation would be beneficial.

      Heparin has anti-inflammatory and antiproliferative effects as well as anticoagulant
      properties. Several studies on animal and adult human eyes show that adding heparin to the
      irrigating solution during cataract surgery results in less disturbance of the blood-aqueous
      barrier and helps prevent posterior capsule opacification (PCO).

      A prospective, randomized, controlled and masked study is mandatory to evaluate the
      anti-inflammatory effect of Low-molecular weight Heparin for pediatric cataract surgery
