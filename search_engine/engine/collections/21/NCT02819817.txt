      patients worldwide every day. Aloe Vera is a natural product that has been linked to better
      healing both anecdotally and in animal studies. A recent Cochrane review failed to find any
      human studies on acute wounds such as those seen in the ED. The aim of this study is to see
      whether Aloe Vera gel improves the wound healing time in these patients. We plan to enrol 270
      participants presenting to the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh ED with simple traumatic wounds
      into a randomised controlled trial. Participants will be assessed at baseline using the
      Bates-Jensen wound assessment tool. They will be then be randomized to one of three groups,
      and allocated to receive either Aloe Vera gel, control (Ultrasound gel) or standard care. The
      participants in the two gel groups will have identical packaging and the treating clinician
      will be unaware as to which group they are allocated. They will be asked to place the
      allocated substance onto the wound twice daily and cover with a supplied dressing on each
      occasion for 1 week. All groups will be asked to return to the ED for a repeat Bates-Jensen
      wound assessment, and will also be asked to record the number of days that their wound took
      to heal. The gel groups will have assessment of product usage. Participants will also be
      telephoned at 3 weeks. Primary outcome will be number of days for wound to heal. Secondary
      outcome will be change in Bates-Jensen wound assessment score between baseline and day 10,
      change in wound size between baseline and day 10 and baseline and day 21, changes in wound
      characteristics at day 21 as reported by participants, wound infection rate, participant
      satisfaction and participant compliance with treatment.
