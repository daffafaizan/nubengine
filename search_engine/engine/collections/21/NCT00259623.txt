    
      Principal objective:

      To evaluate the efficacy at 3 months of combined ablation technique in the treatment of
      chronic atrial fibrillation during cardiac surgery in order to obtain a sinusal heart rate.

      A sequential statistical analysis of the results will be performed every 10 patients.

      In case of validation of the principal objective by a sequential method i.e. proving the
      superiority of the treatment by ablation, ,the study would then be opened and pursued by
      using the ablation technique for all subsequent patients in order to validate the secondary
      study objectives

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To evaluate the quality of life of the patients at one year and the absence of atrial
           fibrillation relapse.

        -  6 and 12 months clinical follow-up

        -  To evaluate the left atrial function at 6 months by trans-oesophagus echocardiography
