      The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of an Online Learning Platform used by
      nurses to improve the results of a blood culture technique. The online learning tool is
      studied in two of four internal medicine units of a tertiary hospital in Madrid. These two
      units have similar characteristics of personnel, materials and structure. Both units are at a
      great distance, preventing a professional talk to each other.
