      or non-binary (NB) individuals to evaluate the relationships between self-reported exogenous
      hormone use, endogenous hormone values (serum estradiol, estrone, free/total testosterone),
      renal biomarkers, drug levels (measured by tenofovir diphosphate, TFV-DP, and emtricitabine
      triphosphate, FTC-TP, on dried blood spot cards and urine) and directly measured renal
      function (iohexol clearance).
