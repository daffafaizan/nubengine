      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is the only one of the top four or five leading causes
      of death in the U.S. with worsening epidemiological trends. Cigarette smoking accounts for
      approximately 85 percent-90 percent of cases, but the other 10 percent-15 percent of the
      attributable risk still represents a substantial fraction of this disease that remains
      unexplained. Recently, several studies, in various countries, have addressed whether certain
      occupational exposures (primarily those relating to dusts, vapors, gases, and/or fumes) are
      potential risk factors for COPD. Most of these studies have shown elevated odds ratios or
      relative risks, although not always to a statistically significant level.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      A population sample of the continental United States of those aged 55-75, supplemented by an
      enriched sample in geographic "hot spots" identified by the National Institute for
      Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) through respiratory diseases mapping. Structured
      telephone interviews assessed demographics, health status, smoking exposures, and
      occupational histories. High risk jobs were coded using a job matrix system independent of
      subject report of specific exposures. Two hundred thirty-four of those with COPD, with
      over-sampling of those with greater severity, were followed at 12-14 months to assess health
      status and health services utilization, as well as decrements in quality of life.

      The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the "End Date" entered in
      the Protocol Registration and Results System (PRS) record.
