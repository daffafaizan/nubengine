      massage and HRV biofeedback in women with primary dysmenorrhea compared to a control group.
      The main focus is on pain intensity during menstruation. Moreover, analgesics intake, SF-12
      mental and physical scores and parameters of a 24h-HRV measurement are assessed before and
      after the three-month intervention.
