    
      BACKGROUND: There is an ongoing controversy over the efficacy and safety of different
      bifurcation stenting techniques. Critical considerations are the rate of restenosis at the
      side branch ostium, and completeness of healing at sites of overlap of stent struts, which
      may affect the risk of stent thrombosis.

      AIMS: To compare vessel healing at 9 months using OCT imaging for two different treatment
      techniques for treating bifurcation lesions. Quantitative assessment of OCT images will be
      used to assess re-endothelialisation and quality of strut apposition to the vessel wall.

      METHODS: Patients with true bifurcation lesions with involvement of a significant side branch
      requiring a stent will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment strategies. Group A will
      comprise 20 patients which will be treated with the Axxess™ Drug Eluting Coronary Bifurcation
      Stent System (Biosensors Europe SA) where additional Biomatrix™ Drug Eluting Coronary Stent
      Systems (Biosensors Europe SA) are implanted into the distal main branch (MB) and the side
      branch (SB) as required. Group B will consist of 20 patients which will be treated with the
      culotte technique using Xience Prime everolimus-eluting stents (Abbott-Vascular, US). Kissing
      balloon dilatation using non-compliant balloons will complete the index procedure in all
      cases. At 9 months, control angiography for all patients (with QCA using dedicated software)
      and OCT (of both main vessel and side branch) will be performed.

      ENROLMENT PLAN:

      Start: Third quarter of 2011 Enrolment period: ± 12 months Clinical follow-up: 5 years
      Angiographic and OCT results expected third quarter of 2013
