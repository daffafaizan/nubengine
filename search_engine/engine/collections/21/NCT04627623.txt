    
      Project is designed as a comprehensive population-based epidemiological study in
      Upper-Silesian Conurbation (Poland) aiming at:

        1. analysis of available data on incidence and mortality due to COVID-19 and

        2. estimation of the occurrence of viral infection SARS-CoV-2 as revealed by the results of
           serological test (ELISA: IgM, IgG), with assessment of risk factors.

      The project's objectives are: to assess incidence and mortality due COVID-19 according to
      sex, age and coexisting diseases; to determine the level of potential "underdiagnosis" of the
      magnitude of COVID-19 mortality using vital statistics data for Upper-Silesian Conurbation;
      to assess the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 based on the level of seropositivity in Upper-Silesian
      Conurbation; to identify host-related and environmental risk factors if the infection.
      Analysis of existing data will include monthly records on incidence and mortality over the
      period 01.01.2020-31.12.2020 and comparison of the findings with the monthly records of 2018
      and 2019, for the same population. Cross-sectional epidemiological study will be located in
      three towne (Katowice, Sosnowiec, Gliwice). In each town a representative age-stratified
      sample of 2000 subjects will undergo questionnaire assessment and serological examination
      performed by serological test. The project corresponds with analogous population-based
      studies on COVID-19 in a number of countries and responds to the WHO recommendation in that
      field.
