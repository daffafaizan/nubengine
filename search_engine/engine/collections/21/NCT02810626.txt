      the cerebellum. Treatment involves a complete resection of the tumour. Although surgical
      resection may eliminate most of the malignancy, signs of post-neurologic deficit may present
      as a consequence to the treatment.

      One such example is cerebellar mutism syndrome (CMS), a postoperative syndrome typically
      arising 1 to 2 days after resection of a midline posterior fossa tumor; it consists of
      diminished speech progressing to mutism, emotional lability, hypotonia, and ataxia. While
      some of the symptoms recover after a few months, neuropsychological testing shows long term
      deficits in language (agramatism), executive function and verbal memory.

      This study aims to investigate whether the use of Synaptive Medical's BrightMatterâ„¢
      technology can help neurosurgeons better visualize and plan surgeries by avoiding eloquent
      fiber tracts in the brain and cerebellum; thus minimizing damage pertaining to neurologic and
      motor functionality. The use of these products will also be assessed for improved clinical
      outcomes in pediatric tumor surgery.
