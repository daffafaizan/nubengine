      with Vitamin D3 supplementation on resolution or prevention of Taxanes or Platinum induced
      peripheral neuropathy compared with placebo. Patients will be allocated to receive the Omega
      3 FA & Vitamin D3 supplements or placebo for 6 months. Approximately 600 patients in total
      will be enrolled in the 2 study arms. The evaluation of neuropathy will be accomplished by
      electromyography (EMG), Total neuropathy score(TNS), Brief pain inventory (BFI) and the
      11-item FACT/GOG-Ntx, version 4 questionnaire (a subscale validated to assess neuropathy due
      to chemotherapy). In addition, other validated functional measures such as "Time to button a
      six hole shirt" and "50 ft walk speed test" will be used to test patients physical
      limitations imposed by peripheral neuropathy. All our patients will undergo an EMG at their
      first visit, in 3 months and after 6months. Previously mentioned functional measures will
      also be completed at the patients' first visit, in 3 months and after 6 months.
