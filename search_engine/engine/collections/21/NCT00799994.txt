      to lower IOP. In eye that have bilateral treatment, one eye will be assigned randomly to the
      study. The mean multifocal objective perimetry amplitude will be compared before and after
      IOP reduction. Also, the mean amplitudes of five circumferential zones will be compared
      before and after IOP lowering. Visual field testing and HRT testing will be performed before
      and after treatment as well if possible. Paired t-tests will be performed no pre-and
      post-treatment mean MOP amplitude values and circumferential zones to determine statistical
      significance. A second group of patients whose pressures will not be lowered will also be
      tested with Accumap at baseline and two hours afterwards, in order to examine reproducibility
      of mean MOP amplitude and mean circumferential amplitude. HVF and HRT testing will also be
      obtained on thes patients when possible.
