      nilotinib will be administered at fixed dose of 400 mg/12h orally during 6 consecutive days
      (1-6) and endovenous adriamycin (20 minutes) on day 5 at three levels (in phase I, dosage of
      60 mg/m2, 65 mg/m2, and 75 mg/m2 will be tested to determine the recommended dose for phase
      II).

      Phase I includes patients with retroperitoneal liposarcoma, retroperitoneal leiomyosarcoma
      and chondrosarcoma. Phase II is focused on retroperitoneal liposarcoma and leiomyosarcoma
      only.
