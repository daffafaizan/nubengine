      limitation due to OA is progressing faster than expected while prevalence is projected to
      increase as a result of the obesity epidemic and population aging, making it a major public
      health problem. Exercise is an evidence-based treatment option that improves pain and
      disability outcomes in adults with osteoarthritis, but previous research has shown that
      adherence to prescribed exercise is low. Referral to physical therapy is common for people
      with OA with the standard of care including exercise prescription through paper handouts with
      brief instruction and static pictures. Such approaches do not incorporate known determinants
      of behavior change related to exercise adherence.

      Recent technology products such as mobile applications (apps) for phones and tablets offer
      the potential to enhance communication between physical therapists and patients. The
      investigators aim to test a pragmatic intervention focused on supporting people with
      osteoarthritis to remain engaged with an exercise program. The specific aims of the project
      are to:

        1. Compare the effectiveness of mobile app supported exercise prescription to usual care
           (paper exercise prescription) on exercise adherence among mid-life and older adults
           receiving similarly dosed physical therapy for lower extremity OA. The investigators
           will also examine secondary outcomes of exercise self-efficacy, physical function,
           stiffness, and pain.

        2. Examine the feasibility and acceptability of mobile app supported exercise prescription
           through recruitment and retention rates, satisfaction with care ratings, and qualitative
           feedback.
