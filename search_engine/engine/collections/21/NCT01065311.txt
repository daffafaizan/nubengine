    
      Cognitive Behavioral Analysis System of Psychotherapy (CBASP) is a treatment approach
      specifically developed for the treatment of chronic depression. CBASP aims to change
      dysfunctional interpersonal patterns. Mindfulness-based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) has recently
      been proposed as a further treatment option for chronic depression. MBCT trains patients to
      step out of negative ruminative states of mind. There are no direct comparisons of the
      psychological treatment options for chronic depression.
