      prognosis, especially in preterm infants with moderate and severe BPD. However, there is lack
      of effective therapies for this disease.

      hUC-MSCs are widely used in clinic due to their low immunogenicity and convenient to get.Many
      animal study had shown that hUC-MSCs had therapeutic effects on a variety of animal models of
      lung disease.Furthermore,there are a large number of clinical trials of MSCs applied to
      various system diseases and the safety was verified.So,the main purpose of this study is to
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of hUC-MSCs in participants with moderate and severe
      bronchopulmonary dysplasia.
