      increased perinatal mortality and neonatal morbidity. No therapy has proven effective in
      preventing preterm birth in twins. When cervical dilation is identified before 24 weeks in
      singleton pregnancies, the risk of preterm birth is 90%-100%; based on a small series of
      cases, approximately 50% of twin gestations with cervical dilation will be delivered prior to
      viability (24 weeks) and the risk of preterm birth prior to 34 and 37 weeks was 85% and 100%.
      Cervical dilation is the worst prognostic factor for preterm birth. There are a small number
      of case reports of cervical cerclage in twin pregnancies with a dilated cervix that suggest
      similar outcomes to those in singleton pregnancies. The investigators' objective is to
      determine if physical exam indicated cerclage reduces the incidence of spontaneous preterm
      birth <34 weeks and improve perinatal outcome in asymptomatic women with twin gestations and
      dilated cervix (1 to 5 cm) between 16 to 23 6/7 weeks of gestation.
