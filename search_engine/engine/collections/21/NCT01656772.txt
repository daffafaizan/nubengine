      and pace the heart. Electrophysiology mapping catheters are available in a variety of shapes
      and electrode configurations. The majority of these catheters are manipulated manually by the
      physician. The Vdrive simplifies these manipulations by allowing an operator to mechanically
      advance, retract, rotate, deflect and maneuver a circular mapping catheter. The circular
      mapping catheter is not altered in structure, function or indication in the same manner as
      the predicate device (Cardiodrive Catheter Advancement System).

      This is a prospective, randomized, non-blinded, controlled study comparing manual navigation
      of a circular mapping catheter with mechanical navigation by the Vdrive. A total of 120
      patients are expected to complete the study: 80 patients in the Vdrive navigation arm and 40
      patients in the manual navigation arm. Patients will be enrolled at a minimum of one site in
      the European Union where the product is currently marketed and the United States, where the
      Vdrive is considered to be investigational.
