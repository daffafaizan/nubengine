      People with osteoporosis are at higher risk for fractures due to falling, because of
      decreased bone strength. The 'Nijmegen Falls Prevention Program" (NFPP) (Weerdesteyn et al,
      2006) has been shown to reduce fall incidence rates by 46% in healthy community-dwelling
      elderly. This program was adapted in order to meet the specific demands and constraints of
      people with osteoporosis.

      The contents of the program are an obstacle course, walking exercises, the practice of fall
      techniques, adjustment of gait abnormalities, weight bearing exercises and educational
      sessions.

      The effectiveness of the program will be evaluated in a randomized clinical trial. Primary
      outcome measure is fall incidence. Additionally, laboratory assessments of gait and obstacle
      avoidance will be conducted in conjunction with questionnaires about balance confidence and
      activity level.
