      payoffs in the Iowa Gambling task, replicating previous findings; (H2) greater discounting of
      future rewards in financial choices; and (H3) these effects would dissipate when OSA is
      successfully treated.

      In order to test these hypotheses, the investigators will perform cognitive tests (Iowa
      gambling; intertemporal choice; other measures) in 100 patients about to undergo sleep
      testing. It is expected that of these 100 patients, some will have no sleep apnea; some will
      have sleep apnea and will be successfully treated; and that some will have sleep apnea but
      will not be successfully treated by the time of repeat testing. The investigators will repeat
      testing using the same instruments 2 months later.

      Thus the investigators will be able to compare whether OSA patients differ from control at
      baseline (t1), and whether OSA patients' performance will improve after treatment at t2,
      compared to the control at t2.
