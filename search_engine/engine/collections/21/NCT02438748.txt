    
      250 patients who have been prescribed repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS)
      therapy for the treatment of major depressive disorder will be recruited for this study.
      Prior to undergoing rTMS, patients will give a small blood sample. An additional blood sample
      will be given upon completion of rTMS treatment. 60 healthy control individuals will also be
      recruited to provide a one-time blood sample for comparison. Control individuals will not
      receive rTMS treatment.

      Blood samples will be analysed for levels of Oxidized Phosphatidylcholines and Oxylipins. The
      investigators wish to determine whether there is a difference in the pre-treatment levels of
      stress markers between individuals who ultimately respond to rTMS and those who do not.
      Additionally, the investigators wish to determine whether there is a change in stress markers
      as a result of rTMS treatment.
