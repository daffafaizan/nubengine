      influenza A (H5N1) viruses, there is now a world-wide effort to develop and test potential
      candidate vaccines for this and other avian viruses with pandemic potential. The study will
      be conducted as a laboratory blinded assessment of the humoral and cellular immune response
      to A/Indonesia/5/05 vaccine in three populations: healthy adults who have previously received
      a clade 1 H5 vaccine in a Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID)-sponsored
      study; healthy adult recipients of prime-boost regimens representing two clades; and healthy
      adults with no previous H5 vaccination and who are not at risk for H5 exposures. Primed
      subjects are randomized to receive a single dose of either 15 mcg or 90 mcg of
      A/Indonesia/5/05 vaccine. Multiply boosted subjects are those who participated in study
      05-0043, and have previously received both A/HK/97 (Clade 3) and A/VN/04 (Clade 1) vaccines.
      Because only a small number of such subjects are available, they will not be randomized but
      will all receive the same dose of vaccine. Unprimed subjects are randomized to receive 2
      doses of 15 mcg or 90 mcg of A/Indonesia/5/05 vaccine separated by 28 days. In all groups,
      sera and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) are obtained prior to and on days 3, 7,
      14, and 28 after each dose. Primed and multiply boosted subjects also have sera and PBMC
      obtained on day 56. All groups will make a final study visit at 6 months following the last
      dose of vaccine (day 180 for primed and boosted subjects and day 208 for unprimed subjects).
      Approximately 115 subjects between the ages of 18 and 64 will participate in this study. The
      primary objective is to determine the safety of administration of the A/Indonesia/05
      subvirion vaccine when administered to healthy, primed or unprimed adults. The secondary
      objective is to: determine the effects of priming with a clade 1 vaccine on antibody
      responses to revaccination with a clade 2 vaccine. The tertiary objectives are to determine
      the effects of priming on the repertoire and phenotypes of B and T cells generated in
      response to vaccination; to evaluate whether pre-existing immunity to seasonal influenza
      viruses impacts the specificity and magnitude of the cluster of differentiation marker (CD)4
      T cell response to H5 vaccination and to describe the kinetics of the cellualr immune
      response to subvirion H5N1 vaccinatin in primed and unprimed individuals. The primary
      endpoint is reactogenicity, adverse event (AE) and serious adverse event (SAE) information,
      solicited in-clinic and via memory aids. The secondary endpoints are: levels of HAI antibody
      recognizing A/Indonesia/05 (Clade 2), A/Vietnam/04 (Clade 1) and representative Clade 2
      subclade viruses, and levels of neutralizing antibody assessed by neutralization tests using
      the rgA/Indonesia/5/05 virus prior to and Days 3, 7, 14, and 28 after each vaccination. This
      study is linked to DMID protocols 04-063, 05-0090, 05-0043 and 05-0127.
