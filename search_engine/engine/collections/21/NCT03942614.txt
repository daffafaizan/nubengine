      quality of life. An individualized, community-based Nordic pole walking (NPW) program may
      help. The primary objective of this study was to assess feasibility using the Thabane
      Framework of a randomized controlled trial (RCT). The secondary objective was to determine
      the effects of NPW on physical function (six-minute walk test, 30-second [30-s] chair stand
      test, Unsupported Upper Limb Exercise Test, handgrip strength, physical activity [PA]), and
      health-related quality of life (HRQoL, 36-Item Short Form Health [SF-36]). The study design
      was an eight-week multi-centred block randomized controlled feasibility study (no blinding)
      comparing a NPW program (versus usual daily routine) for adults with non-small cell lung,
      prostate, colorectal, and endometrial cancer, from hospitals and cancer support groups.
