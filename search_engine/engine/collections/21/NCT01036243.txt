      flatulence. These symptoms are often perceived by the parents as being related to the diet
      (formula) the baby is consuming. In another hand, infantile colic or fussing/crying is one of
      the most commonly encountered problems within the first three months of life. The etiology of
      the disorder remains unknown however, three main theories have been proposed to explain its
      origin: (i) psychological: due to inadequate mother-infant interaction (ii) gastrointestinal:
      such as hypertonicity and immaturity of the GI tract and Dietary factors that may influence
      the stool pattern in formula fed infants are (iii) allergic: due to a reaction against cow's
      milk protein or other food constituents. e.g. the protein source, the iron content,
      hydrolyzation of the protein, or the fat source.

      It has been reported that infants receiving a casein predominant formula had less unformed
      stools than those receiving a whey predominant formula. Hydrolysation of protein resulted in
      reduced gastro-intestinal transit time and some studies using extensively hydrolyzed protein
      formula have shown more liquid stools.

      A reduction of crying hours was also described in infant receiving an hydrolyzed formula.
      Some probiotics were reported with potential benefit on the gut comfort.
