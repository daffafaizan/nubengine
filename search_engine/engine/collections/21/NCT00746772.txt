      epithelia. The majority problem of OLP is development of oral squamous cell carcinoma ,
      irrespective of the clinical type of OLP and therapy. Previous study demonstrated a decreased
      antioxidant defence and increased oxidative damage to lipids, DNA and proteins in lichen
      planus .This oxidative modifications point to pathophysiological alterations mainly within
      the basal cell layers of epidermis and at the dermoepidermal junction. So oxidative stress
      could be effective in pathogenesis of OLP. Purslane is an excellent source of vitamin A,C and
      E and essential amino acids, has been described as a power food of the future because of its
      high nutritive and antioxidant properties. Purslane also decreased the level of TNF-Î± and
      IL6, that are responsible for up-regulated adhesion molecules (in OLP lymphocyte T (T cell)
      recruited and retained in sub mucosa through receptors to endothelial adhesion molecule. and
      basal keratinocytes undergo apoptosis). The purpose of the study was to determined the
      efficacy of Purslane in the treatment of oral lichen planus.
