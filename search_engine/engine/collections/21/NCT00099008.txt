        -  Compare the effects of genistein vs placebo on DNA damage and apoptosis by conducting
           COMET, TUNEL, Caspase-3, and AP site assays in healthy postmenopausal women.

        -  Compare the effects of these drugs on gene expression in an estrogen-sensitive tissue by
           oligoarray profiling in these participants.

        -  Determine the effect of genistein on estrogenic effects by self-reported side effects,
           measurement of sex hormone-binding globulin, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing
           hormone, and estrogen levels, and expression of known estrogen-sensitive genes in these
           participants.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Participants are
      stratified according to their study ID numbers. Participants are randomized to 1 of 2
      treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Participants receive oral genistein twice daily on days 1-84.

        -  Arm II: Participants receive oral placebo twice daily on days 1-84. In both arms,
           treatment continues in the absence of dysplasia, malignancy, unacceptable toxicity, or
           gross noncompliance.

      Participants are followed at days 7, 14, 28, 56, and 84 during study treatment and at day 28
      after completion of study treatment.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 participants (20 for arm I and 10 for arm II) will be
      accrued for this study.
