      on proximal robotic treatment approach, to test whether starting with the distal
      robot-assisted sensorimotor therapy the effective in improving motor functions of sub-acute
      stroke patients.

      The use of robotic platforms to administer the rehabilitation therapy is crucial for two main
      reasons:

        1. the physical therapies based on robotic platforms assure that each patient in the same
           testing group is treated in the same repeatable way, eliminating the intrinsic
           subject-dependent variability that affects traditional therapies;

        2. the robotic platforms, in conjunction with EEG and EMG recordings, can be used to assess
           the effects of the rehabilitative treatments in a quantitative, measurable way, by
           providing reliable and objective methods for measuring functional recovery after stroke.
