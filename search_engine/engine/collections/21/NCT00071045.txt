    
      The purpose of this protocol is to collect blood, bone marrow, urine, stool, oral samples,
      nasopharyngeal samples and/or both malignant and non-malignant tissue from patients who are
      either being evaluated for enrollment, are consented to NIH Clinical Center treatment
      protocols, or are receiving therapy for their disease through home health care providers.
      Since a substantial proportion of the clinical and translational research in the NHLBI
      involves patients undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplantation, this protocol will also be
      open to people identified as suitable HLA-compatible donors for patients undergoing
      evaluation for or already enrolled in an allogeneic stem cell transplant protocol or
      receiving a stem cell transplant through their home health care providers. These
      HLA-compatible donors will serve as a source of peripheral blood mononuclear cells
      (peripheral blood draws or leukapheresis) for use in evaluating allogeneic graft versus host
      and graft-versus-tumor effects.

      The primary objective is to provide a mechanism for collection, tracking, storing,
      dispensing, analyzing and disposing of these laboratory research samples from patients and
      HLA matched donors.

      There is no primary endpoint.
