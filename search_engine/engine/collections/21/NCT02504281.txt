    
      Recurrent spontaneous abortion (RSA), defined as 2 or more consecutive pregnancy losses
      before 20-22 weeks of gestation, is a multifactorial disorder that affects about 5% of all
      couples.In up to 50% of women who have experienced RSA, the cause still remains unexplained,
      with genetic problem proposed as a main cause. X chromosome inactivation (XCI) is a
      physiological phenomenon in female mammals for 'dosage compensation' of X-linked genes with
      males. A normal female is mosaic, with about one-half of her somatic cells expressing the
      paternal derived X and the remainder of her cells using maternal X. In some situations,
      however, the inactivation is not random, resulting in a female having most or even all her
      somatic cells inactivating the same X chromosome from either paternal or maternal resource,
      which is known as skewed X-chromosome inactivation (SXCI).Evidence of an association between
      skewed X chromosome inactivation (SXCI) and idiopathic recurrent spontaneous abortion (RSA)
      is conflicting. This is a single-center observational case-control trial to determine whether
      there is higher incidence of skewed X chromosome inactivation(SXCI) in the recurrent
      miscarriage(RM) population compared with normal population, and screen the possible genetic
      sites that may lead to SXCI and RM by genome microarray analysis of the RM patients with SXCI
      and normal females with SXCI.
