      to facilitate endotracheal intubation and to optimize surgical conditions. Increasing data
      suggest superiority of a deep neuromuscular block (defined by a post-tetanic count of 1-2
      twitches) in creating optimal working conditions for the surgical team. However, it is
      unknown whether other aspects of the anaesthetic technique, most notably the choice of
      anaesthetic (for example, total intravenous versus inhalational anaesthesia), influence the
      relationship between the depth of the neuromuscular block and surgical conditions,
      particularly in laparoscopic surgery. Volatile anaesthetics are known for their ability to
      potentiate neuromuscular blocking agents an effect that is less existent with propofol. We
      previously showed that surgical working conditions in laparoscopic surgery during propofol
      anaesthesia are highly reliant on the depth of the neuromuscular block. Whether such a
      relationship also exists for inhalational anaesthetics, is unknown. To investigate this, we
      conducted a prospective, randomized, double blind study in which patients scheduled for
      laparoscopic renal surgery were randomized to receive either a moderate or a deep
      neuromuscular block during sevoflurane anaesthesia. The primary outcome was the
      intraoperative surgical condition assessed by a surgeon using the validated Leiden-Surgical
      Rating Scale. We hypothesized that the use of an inhalational anaesthetic would obviate the
      need for a deep NMB due to its intrinsic muscle relaxant potentiating properties to produce
      optimal working conditions.
