      or suspected Stage Ta, T1 or Tis bladder cancer of any histological grade requiring TURBT and
      who are believed to be candidates for IPOP intravesical chemotherapy regardless of the need
      for further intravesical therapy. Within 6 hours after completion of TURBT, patients will be
      administered a single IPOP intravesical instillation of Chemophase with a one-hour dwell
      time. At the end of the one-hour dwell time, the patient will be asked to fully void or, if
      an intravesical catheter has been left in place, the bladder will be fully drained via the
      catheter. Patients will return at 1 and 2 weeks post instillation for follow up visits for
      safety and for a cystoscopy at day 85 (per standard of care). Safety and tolerability will be
      assessed through physical examinations, vital signs, cystoscopy, hematology (CBC), adverse
      event reporting, and measurements of plasma levels of MMC.
