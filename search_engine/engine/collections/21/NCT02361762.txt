      collect some preliminary information, five visits to Boston Children's Hospital (3 before
      training and 2 about 6-8 weeks later), caregiver questionnaires, and an optional teacher
      questionnaire packet. The visits will include activities designed to assess verbal and
      nonverbal thinking ability; social skills and general interests; and specific tasks related
      to cognitive and social problem solving. In addition, EEG measurement of brain function will
      be made. EEG is a non-invasive recording of brain activity. Children will be randomly
      assigned (i.e., like flipping a coin) to receive training or to a non-training group. The
      training group will complete tasks designed to improve executive control presented over the
      course of 5-10 1-hour sessions. All tasks are game-like and are presented on a computer with
      child friendly graphics. A staff member will work with each child as he/she completes the
      training activities. Children assigned to the non-training group will be invited to
      participate in training at the end of the study if it is shown to improve executive control.
