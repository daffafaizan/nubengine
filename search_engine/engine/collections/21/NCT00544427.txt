      light shine onto laryngeal, esophageal, tracheal, oral, nasal and ear tissue and does not
      involve input of significant amounts of energy and no temperature rise occurs.

      The gradual development and acceptance of Optical Coherence Tomography as an imaging modality
      serves as an alternative to invasive tissue biopsy as a diagnostic measure. Imaging
      diagnosis, can implement and more convenient than tissue biopsy and can reduce procedural
      complications.
