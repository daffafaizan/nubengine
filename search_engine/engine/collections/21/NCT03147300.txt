      benign dysfunction and context that affects the patient's perception of pain and limits their
      activity and participation. At present there are no national clinical guidelines or best
      practice models of care in Sweden focused on the primary care of low back pain.
      Implementation of a model of LBP primary care based on international evidence-based
      guidelines is needed to improve care and patient outcomes in Sweden. This project aims to
      investigate the effectiveness of a best practice model of care (BetterBack) for the primary
      care management of LBP. A cluster randomised trial with dog leg design will be conducted in
      the Östergötland Health care region. The hypothesis is that the BetterBack model of care will
      result in significantly better patient and therapist reported outcomes as well as
      cost-effectiveness compared to current routine care. This by improved patient outcomes in
      terms of physical function, low back pain intensity, activity level, work and quality of
      life. Furthermore, improved care processes and knowledge support for physiotherapists can
      lead to a smaller proportion of patients requiring specialist care.
