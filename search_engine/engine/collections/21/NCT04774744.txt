      I. To evaluate the effect of digital health coaching on self-efficacy among two cohorts of
      individuals with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL),
      respectively, as measured by the Cancer Behavior Inventory (CBI version [v.] 3).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the relationship between self-efficacy and patient reported outcomes among
      individuals with and without digital health coaching, specifically:

      Ia. The physiologic and psychosocial outcomes of individuals with AML and CLL as measured by
      the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Leukemia Questionnaire (FACT-Leu).

      Ib. The symptom experience of individuals with AML and CLL as measured by the MD Anderson
      Symptom Inventory (MDASI).

      Ic. The financial toxicity of individuals with AML and CLL as measured by the Comprehensive
      Score for Financial Toxicity (COST).

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I: Patients receive the PACK Health digital health coaching program over 3 months
      consisting of communication initiated by either the PACK Health coach or the patient through
      either text, e-mail, or phone call, to provide education and support related to a specific
      topic such as fatigue, nutrition, or exercise.

      GROUP II: Patients receive standard of care support services consisting of a telephone triage
      line that patients may call when experiencing physical or psychological concerns, or with any
      other questions related to their disease or treatment.
