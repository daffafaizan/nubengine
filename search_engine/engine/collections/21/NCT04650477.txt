      disability. Tenodesis is preferable surgical choice for especially young patients to to
      eliminate anterior shoulder pain. The optimal position of the elbow and forearm during
      tenodesis is a debated topic. The investigators aimed to evaluate pain and strength loss
      after biceps tenodesis fixed at extension-pronation (EP) and neutral positions. The
      investigators aimed to find the most appropriate and anatomical arm position that gives
