      eating behaviours.

      The research question will be approached using a combination of methods. The first is the
      experience sampling method, where data is gathered from participants as they are going about
      their day-to-day lives. This method comprises two sub-sections - a correlational study, and
      an experimental study. This registration describes the correlational experience sampling
      method.

      The study will measure participants' regular phone use and eating behaviours. Participants
      will be recruited via online platforms and participate in the study for one week. At the
      beginning of the week, they will be required to fill in some online questionnaires (e.g.
      demographic information). For the rest of the week, they will be prompted at specific time
      points in the day via smartphone to answer some questions about their phone use and eating
      behaviours.

      The expected outcome of the project is to collectively evaluate the data from the various
      methods to conclude how social media use, and in particular the act of food photography,
      influences the various aspects of eating behaviours.
