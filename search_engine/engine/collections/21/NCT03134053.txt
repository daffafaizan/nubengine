      functional and cosmetic deformities. A wide variety of treatments have been advocated for
      pathologic scars regression. Unfortunately, the reported efficacy has been variable.Unfocused
      extracorporeal shock wave therapy is a feasible and non-intensive treatment. And it is an
      emerging option for the treatment of painful and retracting scars.

      Administration of ESWT appears to result in significant improvements in scar clinical
      appearance, mobility and subjective pain. Clinical data were mirrored by histologic changes
      in connective tissue appearance and scar vascularization. Extracorporeal shock wave therapy
      is also an effective and conservative treatment for patients with aesthetic and functional
      sequela from burn scars. It is a feasible, cost-effective, well-tolerated treatment that can
      be used in the management of post-burn pathologic scars after the patients are briefed on the
      practical aspects of the treatment procedure.
