      patients, such as improvements in function and quality of life, and ameliorates symptoms such
      as cancer-related fatigue. Furthermore, given the risk of obesity, both exercise and diet
      play a key role in recovery from cancer. In fact, current guidelines support the use of
      exercise with therapeutic purposes as a complement to cancer treatment.

      As a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, oncology patients present more difficulties to
      attend programs, as the vast majority are immunosuppressed, and they are considered risk
      population. Therefore, new online (TEEP) must be developed to facilitate the benefits of
      these programs in the post-COVID Era. This study analyses the feasibility (in terms of
      suitability and verification of exercise prescription, absence and attendance type, and total
      days of attendance) and the effect (in weight, physical function, and symptoms) in cancer
      patients and survivors.
