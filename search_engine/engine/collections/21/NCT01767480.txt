      were randomly assigned to 1 of the 3 groups: RT with higher-intensity group, RT with
      lower-intensity group, and conventional intervention group. Assessments on sensorimotor
      impairments (Fugl Mayer Assessment, Motor Status Scale, Modified Ashworth Scale, Myoton,
      Muscle Metabolism, Box and Block Test, and Revised Nottingham Sensory assessment) and
      functional performance (Functional Independence Measure, Motor Activity Log, ABILHAND
      Questionnaire, Adelaide Activities Profile, EQ-5D-5L, and accelerometer) take about 40
      minutes to complete. Evaluation of brain reorganization using functional magnetic resonance
      image and movement patterns by kinematic analysis take about 1 hour for each examination.
      Blood samples of the patients (12 ml.) will be collected to examine the physiological markers
      (ie, inflammation-related markers, oxidative stress markers, and erythrocyte deformability)
      before and after intervention. Total 24 ml blood will be collected in this study. Except for
      the blood taking, all the examinations are non-invasive.
