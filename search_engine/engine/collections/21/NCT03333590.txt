    
      This is an open-label, dose escalation trial where the vector will be delivered via the
      femoral artery to the muscles of both legs of DMD subjects.

      The primary objective of this study is the assessment of the safety of intravascular
      administration of rAAVrh74.MCK.GALGT2 to DMD patients. Safety endpoints will be assessed by
      changes in hematology, serum chemistry, urinalysis, immunologic response to rAAVrh74 and
      GALGT2, and reported history and observations of symptoms. Efficacy measures will be used as
      secondary outcome for this disorder including a combination of functional 6 minute walk test
      (6MWT) and direct muscle testing for strength (MVICT) of lower limb muscles.

      Subjects will be evaluated at baseline, infusion visit (days 0-2), and return for follow up
      visits on days 7, 14, 30, 60, 90, and 180 and months 12, 18 and 24
