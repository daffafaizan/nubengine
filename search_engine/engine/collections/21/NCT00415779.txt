      treatment of hormone refractory metastatic prostate cancer. Zoledronic acid has been used in
      the treatment of bone metastasis from prostate cancer. This is a study of the combination of
      these two agents. The Zante study will test a dose escalation of docetaxel in association
      with a predetermined dose of zoledronic acid (2 mg), given every 14 days for a minimum of 6
      and maximum of 12 cycles.

      Sequence A: Docetaxel on day 1 and zoledronic acid on day 2

      Sequence B: Zoledronic acid on day 1 and docetaxel on day 2

      Patients are enrolled sequentially in cohorts of 3 for each dose level, and a maximum of 36
      patients will be enrolled.
