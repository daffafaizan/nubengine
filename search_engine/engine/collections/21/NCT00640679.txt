      patients on chronic clopidogrel therapy. However, a systematic evaluation of the role of
      rapid thienopyridine withdrawal on ischemic complications in patients with treated coronary
      artery disease has not been addressed by specifically designed studies. The objective of this
      study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of abrupt or tapered interruption of chronic
      clopidogrel therapy after intracoronary drug-eluting stent implantation.
