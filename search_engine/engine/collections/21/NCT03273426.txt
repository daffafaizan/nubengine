      achieved pathologic complete response (pCR) on MRI will enrolled. The enrolled patients will
      undergo either US-guided multiple core needle biopsy or US-guided vacuum-assisted biopsy of
      the tumor bed where it had been marked with an indicator (clip). The patient will undergo
      subsequent wide excision of the tumor bed. Histopathologic findings of the biopsy and the
      surgical specimen will be compared for pCR, and the ability of preoperative biopsies to
      predict pCR will be evaluated.
