      focused on a Research-Action-Participation method in order for empowering and to people
      having more control over their lives. This approach was used taking into account the many
      changes caused by leaving working life to begin the stage of retirement. In reference to
      participatory methods, techniques such as brainstorming, and consensus-building and visual
      techniques have been included.

      The quantitative approach is a complementary method to the qualitative approach based on a
      quasi-experimental study, as no control group has been introduced. From this approach, a
      descriptive and comparative study has been carried out on quality of life and the behavior
      adopted in the adaptation to retirement, both measured before and after the intervention.

      The intervention program developed consists of a brief-intervention about 5 sessions lasting
      between 45-60 minutes. It was intended to address the concerns and needs that emerge from the
      participants' interviews. The intervention is based on the principles of the process of
      adaptation to retirement defined by Atchley and the Prochaska and Diclemente Model on the
      phases of preparation for retirement. The material to be used will be based on existing
      resources for retired people, awareness through multimedia material and knowledge of possible
      contributions of different technological devices to healthy-lifestyle.
