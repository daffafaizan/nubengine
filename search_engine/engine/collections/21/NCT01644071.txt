      violent video game with functional magnetic resonance imaging under three experimental
      conditions in randomized, double-blind fashion:

        1. Increase of synaptic 5-HT with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI, Cipralex
           Â®);

        2. reduction of synaptic 5-HT with the Rapid Tryptophan Depletion Test (RTD); and 3)
           Placebo.

      A blood sample genotyping will assess the allelic expression of the MAOA gene. We hypothesize

        1. a modification of the ACC-amygdala system by the serotonergic intervention and

        2. an interaction with the genotype concerning the MAOA gene. The results of this study
           will give valuable insights into the neurogenetic biology underlying aggression which
           will open new perspectives for therapeutical and pharmacological intervention.
