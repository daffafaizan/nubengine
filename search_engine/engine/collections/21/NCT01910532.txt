      Clevidipine to rapidly control elevated blood pressure in patients who have an Intracranial
      Pressure Monitoring device.

      All patients in which ICP monitoring is carried out need to maintain Cerebral Perfusion
      Pressure (CPP) within a tight range (typically, 70-90 mmHg) in order to avoid secondary brain
      injuries related to either too high or too low CPP. In this context there are clear benefits
      associated with a medication that is able to control hypertensive situations quickly and that
      lends itself to easy and reliable modulation.

      Clinical studies have demonstrated that Clevidipine is an effective antihypertensive agent
      with a rapid onset and offset of action, and a favorable safety profile. Clevidipine has a
      predictable dose-response profile and is readily titrated to achieve individualized
      pharmacodynamic effects.

      The investigators reasoned that Clevidipine could be an effective anti-hypertensive agent in
      this cohort of patients in which there is a need for rapid and precise blood pressure
      control. It is further hypothesized that improved blood pressure control in this patient
      population may result in the reduction in the severity of their neurological impairment.

      The question to be answered is as follows: Is Clevidipine highly effective in achieving and
      maintaining Blood Pressure control in patients with hypertension (Systolic Blood Pressure >
      160 mm Hg) and who require an Intracranial Pressure Monitoring Device?

      Clevidipine will be highly effective in achieving and maintaining Blood Pressure control in
      patients with hypertension and who require an Intracranial Pressure Monitoring Device.
