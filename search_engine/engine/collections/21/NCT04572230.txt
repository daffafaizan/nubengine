    
      IMPACT is an international, prospective, observational, multicenter, non-randomized, post
      market study designed to provide ongoing safety and performance evaluation on implantable
      devices used for the treatment of intracranial aneurysms with an endovascular approach. Data
      collection will also include details on adjunctive and ancillary devices used.

      In addition to gaining safety and performance data, this study will provide clinical evidence
      that may assist physicians in selecting an appropriate device(s) while describing treatment
      options used to treat patients with intracranial aneurysms.
