      represents the gold standard of antiplatelet treatment.

      The CABG substudy of the PLATO-trial (http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa0904327)
      comprising more than 1200 patients has convincingly shown a high significant reduction of
      cardiovascular and all-cause mortality for patients recieving Aspirin and Ticagrelor as
      compared to those subjects randomized to Aspirin plus Clopidogrel. Moreover the results of
      the PLATO CABG substudy showed that benefits of Ticagrelor increase with decreasing Aspirin
      doses. Therefore Ticagrelor monotherapy (2x 90mg/day) appears to offer the best balance of
      safety with anticipated improved efficacy over Aspirin (1x 100mg/day) alone, but until now
      there are no further data available to support this hypothesis.

      Hence this study (TiCAB) is assigned as a pivotal efficacy and safety study of Ticagrelor in
      patients undergoing coronary artery bypass operation and to test the hypothesis that
      ticagrelor is superior to Aspirin for the prevention of major cardio- and cerebrovascular
      events (MACCE) in this patient population.

      The TiCAB trial is designed as a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel group,
      phase III, multicenter study, comparing the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor 90mg
      administered twice daily with Aspirin 100mg once daily, for the prevention of MACCE within
      the first year after CABG operation.
