      chemotherapy combined with hepatic arterial infusion (HAI) with floxuridine and dexamethasone
      in patients with initially unresectable colorectal liver metastasis. Hepatic arterial
      infusion oxaliplatin trials have been done with oxaliplatin alone and in combination with
      irinotecan, 5-FU/LV, and mitomycin-C and have showed that Hepatic arterial infusion
      oxaliplatin could increase response rate and resection rate for colorectal liver metastasis.
      Therefore, we designed this study to determine whether systemic chemotherapy With irinotecan
      plus hepatic arterial infusion With floxuridine and oxaliplatin can increase the complete
      resection rate (R0) and improve the overall survival in patients with initially unresectable
      colorectal liver metastasis.
