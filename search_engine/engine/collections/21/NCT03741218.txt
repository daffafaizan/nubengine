      criteria are provided below.

      The subjects will receive, after overnight fasting, either a monodose of freeze-dried grapes
      (equivalent to 300 g of fresh grapes) or isocaloric placebo solved in water, together with a
      high-fat breakfast. Blood samples will be collected before the intake, up to 5 h after
      breakfast, then a medium-fat lunch will be provided and blood samples will be collected for
      three additional hours. Both interventions will be separated by two weeks. The following
      determinations will be performed in blood samples collected at different periods: glucose,
      insulin, triglycerides, uric acid, viscosity, antioxidant capacity. Additionally, a satiety
      test will be provided. It is expected that grape supplementation, as compared with an
      isocaloric placebo, causes significant modifications in all the parameters indicated.
      Nevertheless, the primary outcome of this study is the area under the curve for glucose after
      the second meal (300-420 min from basal time).
