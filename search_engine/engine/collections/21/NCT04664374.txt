    
      Mental Health Telemetry (MHT) is a software platform developed at Sunnybrook for collecting
      real-time self-report symptom-rating questionnaire data using patients' cell phones or other
      portable, Internet-enabled devices. MHT has previously been used in several funded clinical
      research studies. The mood-disorders-specific version of MHT, which we have named MyMood,
      collects information on a variety of items including symptom severity, medication adherence,
      ER visits / hospital admissions, sleep, relationships, and life events. In our previous
      project, we made MyMood available to the general population of SHSC by integrating it into
      Sunnybrook's MyChart personal health record system and collected feedback from users, using
      the feedback to refine MyMood. In the current project, we aim to characterize long-term
      patterns of MyMood usage, examining how duration and frequency of use are affected by
      demographic and clinical characteristics of users (age, sex, present / reported diagnosis of
      a mood disorder, and/or prior treatment).

      Please note that the _only_ route for entry into this study is self-referral: interested
      individuals who have signed themselves up for MyChart can choose to begin using MyMood on
      their own. There is no reason to contact the study team regarding recruitment.
