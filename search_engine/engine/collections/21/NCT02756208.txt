      study in 60 healthy adult volunteers who are Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1 (HIV-1)
      uninfected. Participants in the study will receive 4 injections at 0, 4, 8 and 24 weeks and
      will be followed for an additional 24 weeks. The total study duration will be 48 weeks. As
      this is a Phase 1 trial, the primary objective is to document safety of the Full Length
      Single Chain (FLSC) gp120-CD4 complex vaccine with a secondary objective to evaluate immune
      responses induced by the vaccine. This vaccine is being evaluated as it is constructed so
      that the gp120 and CD4 moieties form a stable intra-chain binding interaction that forms a
      transition state structure that presents conserved, conformational domains involved in the
      early HIV replication process. It is hypothesized that antibodies directed to these epitopes
      would be highly cross-reactive and potentially useful for HIV vaccine development.
