      to antidepressant drug activity. For this, 40 healthy volunteers will be recruited to the
      study and randomized to receive a single session of 250mg DCS or placebo. 3 hours and 24
      hours after active drug/placebo administration, the effects of emotional processing via the
      use of cognitive tasks will be assessed. Also, given the important role of DCS in memory and
      stress, we also include tasks to explore changes in autobiographical memory and in
      psychological and physiological measures of stress and arousal.
