      around 23% per transfer (annual report of the Agency of Biomedicine). Some estimates that
      half of infertile patients treated are partially or totally concerned by problem of
      inadequate uterine receptivity.

      The investigators' hypothesis is that a pre-conceptional immune endometrial evaluation may
      increase significantly birth rates since successful implantation results from both the
      matching of a competent embryo within a competent endometrium.

      The identification of endometrial biomarkers documenting the immune uterine environment
      during the implantation window would be able to improve the efficacy of ART through a
      personalization of treatment accordingly to the ability of the patients to receive their
      embryos. All patients with all inclusion criteria and no exclusion criteria will be included.
      Only patients with a deregulation (immune analysis) will be randomized.
