      (called Hugo) for real-world surveillance of outcomes in 60 total patients after medical
      device use. Research associates will be recruiting patients before they undergo a bariatric
      surgical procedure (either sleeve gastrectomy or gastric bypass) and catheter-based atrial
      fibrillation ablation. Patients will then be queried about specific symptoms related to their
      procedure. Patients will also be given syncable devices to use that will provide additional
      insights into their health and health outcomes. This pilot project will engage patients to
      report outcomes while also synchronizing data from their electronic health records and
      pharmacy accounts to ascertain the ability of emerging mobile health technologies to aid in
      post-marketing surveillance.
