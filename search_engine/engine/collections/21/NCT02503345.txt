    
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study to evaluate the
      efficacy of ALLN 177 compared with placebo in reducing the urinary excretion of oxalate in
      subjects with secondary hyperoxaluria and kidney stones. ALLN-177 is an orally administered
      form of oxalate decarboxylase. The goal of therapy with ALLN-177 is to reduce urinary oxalate
      excretion by decreasing the absorption of oxalate from the gastrointestinal tract.

      Eligible subjects will be randomized to 7 days of treatment with a dose ALLN-177 or placebo
      and following a washout period, crossed over to an alternate treatment. Urinary oxalate
      excretion will be assessed by 24-hr urine collections throughout the study.

      The study allows for up to 60 subjects.
