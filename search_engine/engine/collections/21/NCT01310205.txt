    
      In this extension study, subjects will be asked to give permission to share their HCV RNA
      viral load test results, obtained from local laboratories, at the different time points and
      will also be asked to give permission to share their SOC dosing information (peg-IFN and
      RBV). As no SCV-07 treatment, procedures, or assessments will be required during this
      extension study, no related safety information will be collected.

      The study will last up to 72 weeks after subjects complete treatment on study
      SCI-SCV-HCV-P2-001 and begin retreatment with peg-IFN and RBV.
