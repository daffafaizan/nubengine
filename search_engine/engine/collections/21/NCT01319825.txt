      with 100 or 200 mg of milnacipran for a total of 4 months including a one month titration
      phase and a 3 month maintenance phase. Baseline (pre-treatment) and end-of-maintenance phase
      headache frequencies will be recorded. There is no placebo treatment in this study. In
      addition to headache frequencies, other parameters being measured include safety and
      tolerability.
