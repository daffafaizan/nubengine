      suture techniques compared were both 2-layered and either continuous sutures or interrupted,
      inverted stitches to perineal muscles and the subcuticular layer. A polyglactin 910
      multifilament thread on an atraumatic needle was used and the perineal skin was left
      unsutured. Healthy primiparas >36+0 weeks gestation could participate if they had a either a
      2nd degree perineal laceration or an episiotomy.

      The trial was a double-blind and analysis was done on an intention-to-treat basis. Main
      outcomes were pain, wound healing and patient satisfaction.
