      prevalence in middle-aged adults of 2-4% of the population, untreated OSA has been implicated
      in increased risk for cardiovascular disease, including hypertension and heart failure.

      The first and most common treatment for OSA is continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)
      treatment, utilized by an estimated 3 million Americans. CPAP is effective in reducing
      apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) is used properly. However, the nasal mask required for CPAP during
      sleep leads to poor acceptance and compliance rates. Published studies on CPAP have shown
      that only 58-8-% of patient accept CPAP therapy and further 65-90% of these patients exhibit
      long-term compliance with CPAP.

      It is widely accepted that the region behind the tongue is a major site of collapse during
      obstructive sleep apnea. In fact there are many surgical procedures performed currently to
      address tongue based collapse. These include RF ablation of the tongue base, genioglossus
      advancement, hyoid suspension, maxillomandibular advancement, and tongue base suspension.

      The current study is designed to evaluate the feasibility of tongue stabilization, and assess
      safety and treatment of the tongue stabilization.
