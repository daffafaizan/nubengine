    
      National, multicenter cross-sectional study.

      The current study will be performed as part of Italian Cardiology Network implemented by the
      Italian Ministry of Health.

      This study will be carried out with the collaboration with Study Center for Primary Care.

      A random sample of subjects identified by the list of patients in charge of the participating
      GPs aged 40-70 years will be invited to a screening for the evaluation of their CV risk.

      All patients who agree to participate in the study and sign the consent will complete a
      health self-assessment questionnaire which includes questions covering anthropometric,
      sociodemographics, personal and family health history, life style habits and aspects of the
      behavioral domain.

      This will be followed by biometric measurements including height, weight and waist
      circumference conducted at the consulting room of the GP by certified staff. Informative
      predictors, selected among all variables selected, will be identified by a stepwise
      multivariable logistic regression. The low risk CV score will be calculated as the sum of the
      coefficients of the retained variables.
