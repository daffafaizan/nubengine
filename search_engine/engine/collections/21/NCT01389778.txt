      traditionally been classified as a reproductive and dermatologic syndrome because of its high
      rate of infertility and the cosmetic complications of hyperandrogenism. However, it has
      become increasingly clear that insulin resistance is important in the pathogenesis of the
      disorder.

      There are a number of variants that have been determined to be associated with PCOS risk. The
      investigators will determine the effect of these variants on the phenotype and response to
      treatment in PCOS. Subjects with PCOS will undergo extensive phenotyping including adipose
      tissue biopsy, dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA, bone density) scan to examine adipose
      stores, an intravenous glucose tolerance test to study insulin sensitivity and beta cell
      function, androgen stimulation and inflammatory markers. The phenotyping will be repeated
      after 3 months of treatment with metformin. The studies will determine whether the genotype
      at PCOS risk variants dictates phenotype and response to treatment with metformin.
      Discovering genes involved in the etiology of PCOS will help pull us out of the endless
      circle that has characterized our understanding of PCOS pathophysiology for many years. The
      proposal also has the potential to illuminate one etiology of insulin resistance, which is
      present even in lean women with PCOS, and the impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes found
      in over 40% of PCOS patients.
