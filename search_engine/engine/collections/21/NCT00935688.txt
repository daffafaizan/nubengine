      microscopy or rapid diagnostic tests. The study will take place in 22 clinics in Eastern and
      Northern Afghanistan, both areas with low transmission of predominantly vivax malaria. They
      differ in their locations and their current standard diagnostic methods.

      The study will examine the result of the diagnostic test in the clinic against the result of
      reference slides and PCR to estimate the number of cases correctly treated in each arm. This
      will be a measure of the effectiveness of diagnosis (and the physicians response to the
      diagnosis) and be influential in considering modalities for diagnostic delivery
