    
      Fifteen children and adolescents with diabetes will be tested for their glucose measurements
      comparing interstitial fluid collected via a microneedle patch (made from biocompatible
      polymers or metal), versus the standard of care blood sample (lancet), and lab grade blood
      draw (intravenous catheter). Samples will be taken hourly from all three devices for four
      hours. All four measurements will be compared against each other to see how close they are
      with measuring the glucose values. Each participant will be asked to rate their apprehension
      prior to receiving each method for blood or interstitial fluid collection as well as the pain
      associated with each method immediately after collection.
