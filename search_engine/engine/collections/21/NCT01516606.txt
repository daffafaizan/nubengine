      relapsed/refractory marginal zone B-cell lymphoma. Responses were more common among patients
      with conjunctival lymphoma. This could be explained at least in part by the elimination of
      clarithromycin by tears, suggesting that a higher tumor bioavailability of this antibiotic
      could result in a higher activity. Thus, a higher dose of clarithromycin could be associated
      with a higher tumor bioavailability in tissues other than the conjunctiva.
