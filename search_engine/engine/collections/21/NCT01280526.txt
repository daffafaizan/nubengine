    
      The primary objective of the study is to determine the feasibility of the combination and the
      recommended dose (RD) of Romidepsin when administered in association with CHOP in a
      population of patients with newly diagnosed Peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) as measured by
      the toxicities during treatment.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To assess the safety of the association Romidepsin and CHOP,

        -  To assess the efficacy of the association of Romidepsin and CHOP: response rate and
           complete response rate, progression-free survival, response duration and overall
           survival.
