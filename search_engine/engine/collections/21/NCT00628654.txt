      Primary

        -  Evaluate the accuracy of glycan analysis to distinguish between normal healthy control
           female subjects and those with ovarian epithelial cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Compare the new assay to the standard CA 125 for diagnostic accuracy.

      OUTLINE:

        -  Ovarian cancer patients: Blood samples are obtained periodically for up to 2 years.
           Patients undergoing surgery have blood samples drawn before and after surgery. Medical
           charts are reviewed periodically for up to 3 years.

        -  Healthy volunteers: One blood sample is obtained. Volunteers also complete a 1-page
           questionnaire.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 300 healthy female participants and 400 patients will be
      accrued for this study.
