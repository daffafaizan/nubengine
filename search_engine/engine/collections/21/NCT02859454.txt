    
      Background

        -  Recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP) is a rare papillomatous disease of the
           aerodigestive tract that is caused by the Human Papilloma Virus (HPV).

        -  RRP can progress to cause airway compromise, fatal pulmonary lesions, and invasive
           cancers.

        -  There is no effective systemic therapy for RRP. Patients require repeated interventional
           procedures for disease control.

        -  Study of a small number of RRP samples has shown programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1)
           expression by inflammatory mononuclear cells and by papilloma epithelial cells.

        -  This clinical trial will evaluate the activity of a PD-L1-targeted drug, avelumab, in
           the treatment of RRP. This drug was selected for its demonstrated activity in a variety
           of cancers and for its acceptable safety profile.

      Objective

      -Determine the complete response rate for avelumab in the treatment of patients with RRP.

      Eligibility

        -  Histologically confirmed diagnosis of RRP.

        -  One of the following:

             -  A Derkay anatomic score of 10 or greater and a history of two or more endoscopic
                interventions in the last 12 months for control of RRP.

             -  Pulmonary RRP with pulmonary disease that is measurable by computed tomography
                scan.

             -  Tracheal involvement with RRP that has required either two or more endoscopic
                interventions in the last 12 months or a tracheostomy.

        -  Age 18 years or greater.

        -  Eastern Oncology Cooperative Group Performance Score of 0 or 1.

      Design

        -  Phase II clinical trial

        -  Simon optimal two-stage design with initial enrollment of 12 patients and expansion to
           37 patients if one or more complete response(s) is/are observed in the initial patients.
