      grafting (CABG) are at an increased perioperative risk and often need prolonged postoperative
      treatment on intensive care units. A significant portion of these patients require
      postoperative pacing. Right ventricular pacing has been shown to be hemodynamically
      deleterious whereas biventricular pacing improves cardiac output in patients with severely
      reduced left ventricular function and bundle branch block. The purpose of this study is to
      compare DDD-right ventricular, DDD-biventricular and AAI pacing in CABG patients with an
      ejection fraction less than 40% in a prospective randomized setting.
