    
      This is a single arm study in metastatic hormone naïve prostate cancer. Standard of care in
      these men is either to offer Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) + abiraterone
      acetate/low-dose prednisone or, in men with higher tumor burden, to offer ADT +
      Docetaxel/prednisone. The investigator's experience is that even men with increased tumor
      burden often opt for abiraterone because of the improved side effect protocol as compared to
      chemotherapy.

      Approximately 130 PSA response evaluable subjects will be enrolled, of which the
      investigators expect 50% to be African American based on clinic population and previous
      experience with clinical trial enrollment.

      The study will enroll men with newly diagnosed hormone naïve prostate cancer within 42 days
      of receiving the first dose of ADT (LHRH agonist) or undergoing orchiectomy. Patients will
      continue ADT throughout the study. Abiraterone acetate and low dose prednisone will continue
      until progression as defined by standard PCWG2 criteria.
