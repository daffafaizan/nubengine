      markers in adolescent and adult patients with phenylketonuria (PKU), in correlation to
      phenylalanine values und phenylalanine-restricted diet. 25-50 patients with PKU aged â‰¥16
      years of age and a control group of 25 age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers will be
      included in the study.

      Endothelial dysfunction will be measured by venous occlusion plethysmography on the lower
      legs in the PKU patients and in the control group. Wave velocity, aortic stiffness, and
      intima media thickness of the common carotid artery will be measured by vicorder and duplex
      ultrasound scanner in the PKU patients and in the control group. Analyses of phenylalanine
      metabolites and renal function will be performed only in the PKU patients, analyses of
      oxidative stress markers in the PKU patients and in the control group. Dietary protocols of
      the patients with PKU will be calculated for their daily phenylalanine, total protein, and
      calorie intake. Results of the study will be kept in the medical records and paper case
      report forms. Data will be analyzed only in pseudonymized form.
