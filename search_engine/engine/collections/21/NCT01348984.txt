      patient. The best standard analgesia regimen is patient-control analgesia (PCA) which
      requires a PCA pump that is expensive.

      Transdermal fentanyl patch (TFP)(50 mcg/hr) can release fentanyl into blood circulation at
      rate 50 mcg/hr for three days. It has slow onset of about 12-14 hours, so it's used to treat
      chronic pain, not popular for a cure of pain. If the investigators apply TFP at appropriate
      times, i.e. 12-14 hours before surgery, it may be used to treat acute postoperative pain.

      If it can give good analgesia for TKA, it can replace PCA. The benefit is that it is much
      cheaper and more convenient.
