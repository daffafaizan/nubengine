      daily on background antiplatelet therapy, prescribed for 6 months to patients with
      established PAD and IC treated with standard medical therapy (SMT) would lead to an
      improvement in the peak walking time (PWT)

      Study endpoints Primary endpoint: Change from baseline to 6 months in the PWT on a graded
      treadmill test (GTT per Gardner protocol) between participants enrolled in the test and
      control arms of the study

      Secondary endpoints

        -  Change from baseline to 6 months in the claudication onset time (COT) on GTT between
           participants enrolled in the test and control arms of the study.

        -  Change from baseline to 6 months in the walking impairment questionnaire distance scores
           (WIQ) between participants enrolled in the test and control arms of the study.

        -  Change from baseline to 6 months in self-reported quality of life score using the
           Medical Outcomes Study 12-Item Short form survey (SF-12) between participants enrolled
           in the test and control arms of the study

      Tertiary endpoints

        -  The first occurrence of clinically indicated lower extremity endovascular or surgical
           revascularization procedure during the entire study duration post-randomization in
           participants enrolled in the test or control arms of the study.

        -  The first occurrence of all-cause death, MI, ischemic stroke during the entire study
           duration post-randomization in participants enrolled in the test or control arms of the
           study.

        -  The first occurrence of severe bleeding defined according to the Global Utilization of
           Streptokinase and Tissue plasminogen activator for Occluded coronary arteries (GUSTO)
           classification during the entire study duration post-randomization in participants
           enrolled in the test or control arms of the study.
