      in the acute setting, to more closely tailor testing to disease risk. The investigators will
      compare the use of risk stratification tools with usual clinical approaches to treatment
      selection or administration through the following aim:

      Test if the decision aid, Head CT Choice, improves validated patient-centered outcome
      measures and safely decreases healthcare utilization. The investigators will randomize at the
      clinician level. Through the use of the intervention, Head CT Choice, the investigators aim
      to significantly increase parents' knowledge, engagement, and satisfaction, decrease the rate
      of head CT use, and decrease 7-day total healthcare utilization, with no significant increase
      in adverse events.
