      liver, which correlate with insulin resistance. Lipid metabolites accumulating in skeletal
      muscle and the liver are thought to impair insulin signalling and thereby reduce glucose
      uptake and glycogen storage. Insulin resistant humans frequently present with decreased
      mitochondrial function in skeletal muscle which might contribute to lipid accumulation and
      the development of insulin resistance. Non-alcoholic liver disease (NAFLD) comprise fatty
      liver, steatohepatitis and cirrhosis. NAFLD correlate with insulin resistance increased risk
      for cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes and hepatocellular. The mechanisms leading from
      fatty liver to steatohepatitis and insulin resistance in the liver are yet unclear. Bariatric
      surgery relates to surgery for the reduction of body weight. Bariatric surgery frequently
      leads to normalization of glucose tolerance in previously diabetic humans even before the
      onset of body weight reduction. The underlying mechanisms are yet unclear. In this study we
      aim to explore the mechanisms underlying the onset of insulin resistance and steatohepatitis
      in patients with fatty liver and to identify the mechanisms leading to improved glucose
      tolerance in humans after bariatric surgery. We test the following hypotheses: increased
      lipid availability leads to (i) increased lipid oxidation and oxidative stress (ii)
      accumulation of lipid metabolites that impair insulin signalling (iii) bariatric surgery
      improves insulin sensitivity by increasing lipid oxidation.

      This study will contribute to the understanding of NAFLD and will help to identify new
      targets for the therapy of diabetes.
