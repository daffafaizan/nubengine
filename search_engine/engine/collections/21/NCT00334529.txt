      mortality in the United States and elsewhere. Oseltamivir (Tamiflu[R]) is a selective
      inhibitor of influenza virus neuraminidase and is U.S. FDA approved for both treatment and
      prophylaxis against influenza A and B viruses. However, at a time of national emergency, the
      supply of oseltamivir may be limited and alternative dosing strategies may be needed in order
      to provide as wide protection as possible from influenza or to treat as many infected
      patients as possible. Agents such as Probenecid that may extend the half-life of oseltamivir
      while maintaining effective oseltamivir plasma levels may potentially be useful in this
      regard. In this multi-center, three-arm, open-label, 48 patient trial, we propose to explore
      the relative safety and pharmacokinetics of oseltamivir plus Probenecid for 14 days in normal
      volunteers above and below the age of 65, according to the following dosing strategies: 16
      subjects will be assigned to Group I Control Arm (Tamiflu[R] 75 mg given orally once daily),
      16 subjects will be assigned to Group II Treatment Arm (Tamiflu [R] 75 mg orally once every
      other day plus Probenecid 500 mg orally four times daily), and 16 subjects will be assigned
      to Group III Treatment Arm (Tamiflu[R] 75 mg orally every other day and Probenecid 500 mg
      orally twice daily).
