      MALT lymphomas. And the prevalence of H. pylori remains high in developing
      countries,including China.

      Clarithromycin-containing bismuth quadruple therapy has been recommended as the first-line
      therapy for H pylori infection in China. However, its expensive cost and high
      antibiotic-related adverse reactions are always haunting us. In 2018,a research from NanFang
      hospital(China）revealed that 250mg clarithromycin is as effective as 500mg clarithromycin，at
      the same time，causes less adverse reactions. On the othe hand,previous studies reported a new
      regimen called large dose dual therapy（generally contains a PPI and amoxicillin),while some
      of them have achieved very good results,especially in Taiwan.

      However, specific data on anti-H.pylori treatments in elderly people are very lacking.So,we
      aim to assess and compare the effectiveness and tolerability of high-dose dual therapy and
      half-dose clarithromycin-containing bismuth quadruple therapy in elderly patients.Considering
      the difference of drug metabolism between eldery and young people，a satisfactory result may
      be obtained.
