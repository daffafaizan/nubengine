      mobility limitation and oxidative stress is tightly linked to both of these characteristics,
      a series of skeletal muscle/vascular studies are proposed. Specifically, in a series of
      recent studies the investigators' group has documented positive vascular consequences of
      antioxidant supplementation during exercise in older subjects that negatively impacted young
      people. Further provocative findings revealed that following exercise training the older
      subjects were now also negatively impacted by the antioxidant supplementation. These findings
      have implications for the understanding of the complex balance between the positive effects
      of exercise-based rehabilitation, exercise induced oxidative stress, aging, frailty, and
      subsequent mobility limitation. Therefore four specific aims are proposed that will answer
      the questions of where (I) oxidative stress is most prevalent in the elderly, why (II)
      oxidative stress occurs in the elderly, what (III) are the acute consequences of oxidative
      stress in the elderly, and finally how (IV) can exercise-induced oxidative stress as the
      result of exercise training in elderly be appropriately managed with exogenous antioxidant
      therapy to promote compliance and the positive outcome of increased mobility.
