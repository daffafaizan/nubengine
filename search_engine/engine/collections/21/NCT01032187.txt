      for treating visceral leishmaniasis (VL). Few studies showing conflictive data about their
      efficacy and adverse events in pediatric population are available. This study aimed to
      evaluate efficacy and safety of amphotericin B deoxycholate vs. that of N-methylglucamine
      antimoniate in treating pediatric VL in Brazil. This was a randomized, open-label, 2-arm and
      controlled pilot clinical trial. Treatment na√Øve children and adolescents with VL without
      signs of severe illness were treated with N-methylglucamine antimoniate or amphotericin B
      deoxycholate. All patients were diagnosed with positive direct examination and/or positive
      PCR for Leishmania spp. performed in bone marrow samples. The primary efficacy end-point was
      VL cure determined after 180 days of completion of treatment. The analysis was performed
      using intention-to-treat (ITT) and per protocol (PP) analyses.
