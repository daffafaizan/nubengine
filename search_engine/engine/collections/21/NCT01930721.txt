      during the second stage of labor. Although seven types of episiotomy have been described in
      the literature , the most frequently performed types are the mediolateral and median
      episiotomies, with the former being the most common one. Despite being a common obstetric
      practice, the exact definition of a "mediolateral" episiotomy is often unclear. Several
      studies and reports, however, stated that a significant proportion of the so-claimed
      mediolateral episiotomy were not actually mediolateral. The current trial compares two angles
      of mediolateral episiotomy , regarding the risk of third- and fourth-degree perineal tearing,
      episiotomy-related pain and dyspareunia in primiparous women at a large tertiary maternity
      center, namely Ain Shams University Maternity Hospital, Cairo, Egypt.
