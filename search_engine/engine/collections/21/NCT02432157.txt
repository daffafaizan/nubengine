    
      This is a prospective, single-center, interventional, randomized, parallel, two-arm (1:1)
      phase II clinical trial with blinded end-point ascertainment designed to determine the safety
      and feasibility of a protocol of 3% hypertonic saline (HTS) as a "volume expander"
      administered within 72-hours of admission and up to 7-days in SAH patients compared to
      standard fluid management, in individuals with aneurysmal SAH. A common sequela of aneurysmal
      SAH is vasospasm, which causes significant morbidity and mortality. In addition, 30% of
      patients with SAH develop hypovolemic hyponatremia (serum sodium [Na] <130mEq/L),
      predisposing them to develop cerebral ischemia. Current guidelines for the management of
      aneurysmal SAH recommend: (1) maintaining euvolemia in order to prevent delayed cerebral
      ischemia (DCI) and (2) using HTS as a treatment option for the prevention and treatment of
      hypovolemic hyponatremia. Treatment for vasospasm includes induction of hypertension, along
      with systemic and/or intra-arterial administration of calcium channel blockers, or
      angioplasty. The investigators will (1) measure the incidence of severe adverse events from
      our protocol of HTS, (2) measure the incidence of cerebral vasospasm in patients treated with
      our protocol of HTS as compared to patients treated with standard fluid therapy; and (3)
      assess the burden of hypovolemic hyponatremia.
