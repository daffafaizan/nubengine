    
      A prospective pilot trial to examine the feasibility for a new CVAD securement device
      prototype (see appendix for computer-aided design drawings). Eligible patients will be
      identified by either mid-level providers, consulting services, or attending surgeons.
      Researchers will obtain consent from the patient or their parent/legal guardian. Caregivers
      will be educated on how to apply the securement device and will be given a number to call
      should they have any questions or concerns. Once the patient is enrolled and provided with
      the device, the investigators will perform follow up telephone interviews at one and three
      weeks to evaluate their experience and ensure they did not experience any adverse events.

      The investigators will prospectively record the primary and secondary outcomes regarding use
      of the securement device, including: comfort, quality of materials, adhesive, ease of use,
      skin problems, infections, dislodgement episodes, catheter breakage, types and numbers of
      interactions with healthcare providers (phone calls, emergency department and clinic visits),
      perceived safety, and overall impressions.
