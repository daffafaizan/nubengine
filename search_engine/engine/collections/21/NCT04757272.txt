      renin angiotensin system (RAS) via angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2), the receptor used
      by the SARS-CoV-2 to gain access to cells could provide an explanation for the several
      unusual clinical findings observed in COVID-19 Although chronic hepatitis is one of the risk
      factors listed by WHO for severe COVID-19, low incidence of COVID-19 was observed among HCV
      patients admitted to Egyptian hospitals.

      Modulation of the RAS by the chronic hepatitis C virus treatment either by (ACEI or ARBS),
      (Daclatasvir and Sofosbuvir), (Daclatasvir and Sofosbuvir plus Ribavirin), or (Ribavirin and
      Interferon) protocols could give an explanation for the low incidence of COVID-19 among
      Egyptian population. Adding it may play a role in COVID 19 prophylaxis.
