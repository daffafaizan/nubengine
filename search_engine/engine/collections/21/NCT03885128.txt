      high frequency chest wall oscillation vest (HFCWO) versus the intra thoracic oscillations via
      oscillatory positive expiratory pressure (OPEP) Quake device in COPD Group A: consists of 30
      patients will be treated by high frequency chest wall oscillation vest along with their
      prescribed medical treatment. This program will be performed 4 times per week for 6
      successive weeks.

      Group B: consists of 30 patients will be treated by vibratory PEP (The Quake) along with
      their prescribed medical treatment. This program will be performed 4 times per week for 6
      successive weeks.
