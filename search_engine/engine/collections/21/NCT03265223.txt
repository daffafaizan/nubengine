    
      Aims & Objectives: To conduct a randomized, triple-blind, placebo-controlled study by
      standardizing dose of local anesthetic, to compare the effectiveness of intraperitoneal
      against intraincisional use of ropivacaine 0.2% for post-laparoscopic cholecystectomy pain
      relief.

      Materials & Methods: American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I or II
      patients underwent elective 4 port laparoscopic cholecystectomy by a single surgeon.
      Anesthetic and surgical techniques were standardized. Patients were randomized using envelope
      method into 3 groups according to location of drug use. Triple blinding was ensured and
      envelopes were opened only at the completion of study. All patients received ~23 ml of
      solution, of which 20 ml was given intraperitoneally [1 ml/cm; 16 ml along right hemi-dome,
      approximately equal to length of right hemi-dome of diaphragm in an average adult and 4 ml in
      gall bladder fossa) and ~3 ml intraincisionally (1 ml/cm of length of incision). Controls
      (n=86) received ~23 ml normal saline (20 ml intraperitoneally and 1 ml/cm intraincisionally)
      while the intraperitoneal group (n=100) received 20 ml of intraperitoneal instillation of
      injection ropivacaine 0.2% and 1 ml/cm of normal saline intraincisionally at the end of
      procedure. Intraincisional group (n=108) received 20 ml normal saline intraperitoneally and 1
      ml/cm of injection ropivacaine 0.2% infiltration at incisional site at the end of procedure.
      All patients received injection diclofenac sodium 75mg/1ml (aqueous) intravenously 12 hourly
      postoperatively. 5 different pain scales were used for assessment of overall pain. Pain
      scores were assessed at 5 points of time, that is, at 0.5, 4, 8, 12 and 24 hours
      postoperatively. Shoulder pain and extra dose of analgesic required (rescue analgesia) were
      also recorded.
