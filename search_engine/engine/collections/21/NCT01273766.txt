      changes in: neutrophil function; macrophage function; lymphocyte function.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the effect of chelation on the incidence of bacterial,
      viral and fungal infections documented by clinical, microbiologically-proven versus
      radiologically-proven criteria. II. To determine the effect of iron chelation on mortality
      and morbidity with incidence of the following parameters: Need for hospitalization; Duration
      of hospitalization; Need for ventilatory support; Need for exchange transfusion/apheresis;
      Need for treatment with antifungals or antibiotics for documented infections.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral deferasirox once daily for up to 6 months or until blood
      counts recover in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
