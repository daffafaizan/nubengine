      dose arm or a concentration based arm based on prior Ctrough measurements. In the
      concentration based arm, dosing frequency will be lowered to once every 3 weeks. If patients
      still have supratherapeutic Ctroughs of adalimumab, these patients will continue adalimumab
      self-administration every 4 weeks. In the standard based arm, patients will continue on
      standard dosing schedule. During each study visit blood will be taken in order to quantify
      Ctroughs. In addition, Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) and Investigator's Global
      Assessment (IGA) score will be evaluated by a physician. Patients complete the Dermatology
      Life Quality Index (DLQI) and European quality of life EQ-5D instrument at each visit. In
      addition, in a subset of patients in each treatment arm, additional sampling will be
      collected by dried blood spot sampling in order to build a PK(PD) model for adalimumab.
