    
      The purpose of this study is to compare the demographic, metabolic, and genomic
      characteristics of patients who develop severe hyperbilirubinemia (serum bilirubin level in
      the "high risk zone of greater than the 95th percentile based on the Bhutani nomogram) to
      patients who never developed significant hyperbilirubinemia (bilirubin level in "low risk
      zone of less than the 40th percentile" on Bhutani nomogram and who did not require any
      treatment for hyperbilirubinemia). Our primary goal is to determine if common gene mutations
      occur at a greater frequency in patients with severe hyperbilirubinemia than in neonates
      without significant hyperbilirubinemia.

      The gene mutations we will test for are:

        -  Glucose-6-phosphate Dehydrogenase Deficiency [G6PD] gene mutations

        -  African A- mutation (G202A;A376G)

        -  The common Mediterranean mutation (C563T)

        -  Two common Chinese mutations (G1376T and G1388A)

        -  UGT1A1 polymorphism. The UGT1A1 gene polymorphisms refer to those genetic defects found
           to be associated with Gilbert's Syndrome, including a promoter defect (T-3263G) that
           disrupts a transcription regulatory site, the TA repeats promoter polymorphism, and four
           mutations within the coding region (G211A, C686A, C1091T, and T1456G).

        -  Gene polymorphism for the organic anion transporting protein (OATP-2)
