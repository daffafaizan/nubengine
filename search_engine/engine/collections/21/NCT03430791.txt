    
      Phase I/II trial in which participants with recurrent glioblastoma will receive a combination
      of tumor treating fields(portable device), nivolumab with or without ipilimumab.

      The NovoTTF200A (OptuneTM) device is worn continuously for a goal of 75% or more of the time,
      ranging from at least 18 hours daily uninterrupted or 22 hours daily with 2-3 days off
      monthly. Therapy is planned for approximately 24 months.

      Infusions with nivolumab will start within 1 week of study start. Ipilimumab will either
      start with the second nivolumab infusion or at after tumor progression. Nivolumab is infused
      intravenously at 240 mg once every 2 weeks with or without ipilimumab for a maximum of 24
      months. Ipilimumab is dosed at 1 mg/kg once every 6 weeks for a maximum of 4 doses (24
      weeks). Infusions will continue until maximum doses are completed or there is confirmed tumor
      progression, intolerable adverse effects or withdrawal of consent.
