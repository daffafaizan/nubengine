      Estimate the overall response rate (ORR) of sonidegib (erismodegib) in combination with
      buparlisib (hereby referred to as "LB therapy") for patients with locally advanced or
      metastatic basal cell carcinoma (BCC) in Smoothened inhibitor-naive patients (Cohort 1) and
      those whose disease is refractory or relapsed on Smoothened inhibitor monotherapy (Cohort 2).

      NOTE: This study does not compare the treatment effect between these 2 dissimilar participant
      groups.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

        -  Estimate the median duration of response, on or after LB therapy.

        -  Assess the safety and tolerability of LB therapy.

        -  Assess the histopathologic effect of LB therapy in tumor biopsies obtained at baseline
           and following 12 weeks of treatment.

        -  Assess the effect of LB therapy on gene expression including Hedgehog pathway and
           phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways.

        -  Assess correlation between gene mutations in Smoothened, suppressor of fused homolog
           (Sufu), patched (PTCH), glioma-associated oncogene homolog (Gli)1, 2 and gene expression
           profiles and response to LB therapy.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive sonidegib orally (PO) once daily (QD) and buparlisib PO QD on days 1 to 28.
      Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 3
      months.
