      several factors cause nurses to adopt a negative attitude toward providing oncofertility
      care.

      Objective: This study examined the effects of an oncofertility education program on
      decisional conflict in nurses caring for breast cancer patients and patients with breast
      cancer. Other predictors of decisional conflict were also examined.

      Design: Randomized, controlled experimental research. Settings and Participants: Patients
      (61) with breast cancer and nurses (79) were recruited from a hospital in Taipei, Taiwan.

      Methods: The nursing participants were randomly assigned to receive oncofertility education
      (experimental group) or usual education (control group). Data from female patients in the
      control and experimental groups were collected before and after the nurses' educational
      training, respectively. The oncofertility education consisted of one face-to-face educational
      session and reading one educational booklet based on the Naturalistic Decision-Making (NDM)
      Model. The decisional conﬂict was measured using the Chinese version of the decisional
      conﬂict scale.
