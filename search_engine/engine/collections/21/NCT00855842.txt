      abortion in second trimester undergo several procedures the day before the medication to
      cause contractions occurs. On the day before admission, they take mifepristone orally, and
      have a feticidal injection. to this would be added the insertion of cervical osmotic dilators
      (the intervention). On the day of induction, the dilators would be removed and misoprostol
      started to cause contractions. We are hoping the median abortion time will drop from the
      present 9-10 hours to 4-6 hours. women who do not abort in 6 hours will have option of
      surgical completion of the abortion (dilation and evacuation) if medically appropriate.
