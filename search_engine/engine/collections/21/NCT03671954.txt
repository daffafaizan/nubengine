      effectively relieves pain and improves function after surgery. Nevertheless, as many as 1 in
      5 patients are dissatisfied with the postoperative outcome, and knee instability remains one
      of the top indications for revision surgery. Implant design, soft tissue balance,
      neuromuscular capabilities, and rehabilitation strategies can all influence postoperative
      outcomes. However, the relationship between these factors and the most effective therapeutic
      approach for total knee arthroplasty has yet to be identified. The investigators will study
      preoperative and postoperative functional measures and patient satisfaction along with
      implant design and specific intraoperative data, which may help inform a targeted approach
      for optimal outcomes after total knee arthroplasty and improve future care of patients.
