      primary care practices with EMRs. These practices will be randomly assigned to be
      intervention or control sites to test this 4 Pillars Toolkit intervention package of
      evidence-based techniques tailored to their practice structure and culture; one set of
      practices randomized to intervention in year 1 and the other to control. In year 2, the other
      set of practices will receive the intervention and community controls may be sought.

      These diverse practices consist of: 18 diverse practices from UPMC in western Pennsylvania
      and 6 diverse practices from large community health centers in a PBRN in Texas.
