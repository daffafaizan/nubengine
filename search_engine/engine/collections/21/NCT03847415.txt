      amenorrhoea, in a woman of the age where the menopause can be expected. Hence it does not
      apply to a young woman, who has had amenorrhoea from anorexia nervosa, or a pregnancy
      followed by lactation. However, it can apply to younger women following premature ovarian
      failure or premature menopause, Postmenopausal bleeding is a common problem representing 5%
      of all gynaecology outpatient attendances. postmenopausal bleeding is usually the first
      symptom of endometrial cancer and active intervention can lead to its early detection. So,
      there is need of a diagnostic tool with high accuracy for detection of endometrial pathology
      in most efficient and least invasive method possible.

      Endometrial sampling is the gold standard for diagnosing abnormalities in the endometrial
      tissues ,however . There is a growing trend to use noninvasive procedures such as TVS, to
      measure the endometrial thickness, diagnose adenomyosis, endometrial polyps .Another
      important ability of 3D TVS is volume calculation using the Virtual Organ Computer-aided
      AnaLysis (VOCAL) even in irregularly shaped structures. This method has been demonstrated to
      be more accurate than 2D-volume estimation .

      â€¢ Hysteroscopy has the advantage of directly visualizing the uterine cavity and the
      endometrium, allowing biopsy to be taken immediately from the suspected abnormality.
