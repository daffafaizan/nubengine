      spectrum disorder (ASD). These difficulties are intensified by social anxiety - commonly
      experienced in autistic adolescents. A promising psychological treatment is cognitive
      behavioural therapy (CBT), but there are constraints in its use for the autistic population.
      For example, CBT requires patients to imagine being in a social situation that would cause
      anxiety, but autistic people often experience difficulties with imagination. The use of
      virtual reality (VR) in CBT may help to lessen such constraints. VR uses 3D
      computer-generated visual environments displayed through a head-mounted display. The images
      are synchronised to the movements of the user such that they experience feeling immersed in
      the virtual scene. The virtual scene can involve social scenarios, making it an ideal tool
      for eliciting social anxiety in the treatment setting. The investigators can see if these
      virtual scenarios are indeed eliciting social anxiety by recording physiological responses
      (e.g. heart rate) in parallel with patients' anxiety ratings during exposure. This is
      important for CBT to be effective.

      This study will test the feasibility and acceptability of VR-assisted CBT, combined with the
      use of physiological measurements, in autistic adolescents experiencing social anxiety. The
      therapy will typically consist of 8-20 weekly sessions and will be delivered by clinical
      psychologists in local mental health services. Conventional outcome measures will be used and
      feedback from youth and their parents/caregivers will be requested. The results of this study
      may lead to modification of the treatment and research methods. They will inform a later
      pilot randomised controlled trial.
