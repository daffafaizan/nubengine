    
      Inclusion of MDS with IPSS low or int-1 and hemoglobin < 10/dL.

      Study drug: Darbepoetin alfa (Aranesp) 500 microg every two weeks subcutaneously during 12
      weeks, combined to filgrastim 300 microg twice weekly for an additional 12 weeks in non
      responders.

      Response will be evaluated at 12 weeks. Patients with major or minor erythroid response (HI-E
      major or minor according to IWG 2000 criteria) will be continued on Aranesp. In
      non-responders, an additional 12 weeks of Aranesp at the same dosing, combined to Filgrastim
      (300 ug twice weekly, then adjusted to maintain WBC between 5000 and 10000/mm3) will be
      proposed. In case of response, the treatment will be continued for a total duration of 24
      months. If Hb level reaches levels > 13 g/dl at any time, Aranesp should be discontinued
      until Hb levels are less than 12 g/dl. Aranesp should then be resumed at 500 Âµg/injection
      every 3 weeks. Intervals between injections should be further increased by one week every
      time they lead to Hb levels > 13 g/dl. The purpose of this dose adjustment is to reach the
      Aranesp schedule allowing a maintenance Hb level between 11 and 12 g/dl.
