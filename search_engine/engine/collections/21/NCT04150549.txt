      (or matched placebo) for 5 days followed by a bowel cleanse with PEGLYTE. Patients will
      undergo allogeneic or autologous fecal transplants. Patients will be dosed with FMT oral
      capsules approximately 48 hours after antibiotic treatment has stopped. Following the FMT
      capsule treatment on day 1, patients will be administered a repeat oral capsule or placebo
      dose at 3 weeks. Oral omeprazole or omeprazole placebo will be given 1 hour prior to the
      baseline and 3 week dose. This will be done to ensure full engraftment of the transplant.

      Participants will be seen at baseline, 3 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months. A
      series of neurological tests will be performed for safety measures. In addition to this, MRIs
      will be completed at baseline, 6 weeks and 12 months. Blood, urine and stool samples will
      also be collected for data analysis and safety measures.
