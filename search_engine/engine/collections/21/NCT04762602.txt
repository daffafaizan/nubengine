      This is a phase 1, open-label, multicenter study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of
      HMPL-306 administered orally in the treatment of subjects with advanced or metastatic solid
      tumors with IDH mutation. The study consists of 2 parts: Part 1 (dose escalation) and Part 2
      (dose expansion). The dose escalation part will determine the MTD/RP2D. The dose expansion
      part will administer the MTD/RP2D to mIDH-positive solid tumor malignancies including, but
      not limited to, cholangiocarcinoma, skeletal chondrosarcoma, low-grade glioma, perioperative
      low-grade glioma
