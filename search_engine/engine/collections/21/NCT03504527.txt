      of chronic airway disease. Guideline or preferring therapy for ACO is still evolving. Current
      clinical solution is when ACO presents like asthma, initial treatment will accord to the
      guideline for asthma , while it presents like COPD, COPD recommendation treatment (not alone
      ICS,but ICS in addition of LABA with or without LAMA) will be chosen, which are subjective.
      Although present guidelines has recommended that ACO should be treated with at last two
      inhalant, but limited date have proven it.

      A random controlled trial will be conducted to evaluate the efficiency of ICS(budesonide)
      combined with LABA (formoterol) and LAMA(tiotropium bromide) in the treatment of acute
      exacerbation of ACO,compared with the control group receiving tiotropium bromide with
      formoterol only.
