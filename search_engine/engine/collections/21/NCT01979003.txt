      intravenous line during their operative procedure for endometrial cancer staging. This will
      consist of one ampule (5 cc) injected intravenously prior to ligation of the uterine
      arteries. After the uterus is removed it will be sent to surgical pathology for evaluation as
      per routine care. The pathologist will open the uterus and evaluate the endometrium. He or
      she will then cut into the myometrium in an area most suspicious for invasion. The cross
      section of the myometrium and endometrium will be photographed while exposed to a Woods lamp.
      The normal myometrium will have a yellow fluorescent appearance under the Woods lamp. The
      cancerous tissue will have minimal fluorescence. The measurement will be taken estimating the
      depth of invasion of the cancer into the myometrium on the basis of its physical appearance
      under the Woods lamp. Cross-sectioning of the uterus is routine procedure by pathology for
      the intra-operative evaluation of endometrial cancer. This information routinely is provided
      in order to determine if lymph node staging is necessary.

      The area that was measured and photographed will then be prepared for a frozen section to
      document depth of invasion. This is the standard procedure performed during an endometrial
      staging. The depth of invasion on the frozen section will be recorded. This same area will
      undergo histologic confirmation by permanent pathology to determine depth of invasion. The
      frozen section is part of routine standard of care in evaluation of endometrial cancer.
