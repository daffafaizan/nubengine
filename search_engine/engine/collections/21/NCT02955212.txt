      randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled period designed to compare the
      safety and efficacy of upadacitinib versus placebo for the treatment of signs and symptoms of
      participants with moderately to severely active RA who are on a stable dose of csDMARDs and
      have an inadequate response to csDMARDs. Period 2 is an open label 52 week extension period
      to evaluate the long-term safety, tolerability, and efficacy of upadacitinib in participants
      with RA who have completed Period 1.
