      several trials showing response rates in the range of 59-78%. This combination is
      characterized by good tolerability and can be applied for a prolonged period without the risk
      of major cumulative toxicity The availability of oral vinorelbine promises a further
      simplification of therapy. The present trial therefore investigates the safety and efficacy
      of a combined treatment with trastuzumab and oral vinorelbine.
