      who call tobacco quitlines for help quitting tobacco. The investigators plan to recruit adult
      co-users of tobacco and MJ from four state quitlines that have legalized non-medicinal MJ
      user. Quitline registration staff will screen participants for current use of Marijuana and
      interest in learning about marijuana. Interested co-users will then talk to a specially
      trained quit coach who will ask additional eligibility questions, obtain informed consent
      from eligible participants, conduct a baseline assessment, randomize individuals to one of
      two groups and deliver the first counseling session according to the assigned intervention.
      Randomization will be automated using the pre-programmed random number table (stratified by
      state and gender) built into the Quitline coaching application. Individuals will be randomly
      assigned to receive the standard Quitline or the integrated MJ and quitline intervention. All
      participants will receive the standard quitline treatment which includes counseling sessions
      delivered over the phone, as well as cessation medications (nicotine replacement therapy;
      NRT) and unlimited calls into the quitline for help between calls. Quit coaches will deliver
      the marijuana intervention during the tobacco quitline calls for the intervention group.
      Study participants will complete surveys at baseline and 3-months. The investigators will
      compare groups on treatment engagement (calls completed) and outcomes at 3 months (tobacco
      abstinence and change in days used MJ). Our proposed sample size of 100 (50 per group) is
      sufficient to achieve our study aims of assessing the feasibility, acceptability and
      preliminary effectiveness of the new integrated intervention compared with standard quitline
      treatment.
