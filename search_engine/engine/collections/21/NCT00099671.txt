      immune system function, especially in the development of T cells, including CD4 cells. IL-7
      may improve HIV-specific immune responses by increasing the number of CD4 cells and boosting
      immune response. This study will evaluate the safety of a single IL-7 dose given under the
      skin in HIV infected patients who are currently on potent antiretroviral therapy (ART).

      This study will last 13 weeks. Participants will be stratified into two groups by viral load:
      Stratum 1 participants will have viral loads of less than 50 copies/ml, and Stratum 2
      participants will have viral loads between 50 and 50,000 copies/ml. Participants will receive
      one dose of either IL-7 or placebo at study entry. Five different dosing levels of IL-7 will
      be tested sequentially in both strata. Dose escalation will occur independently in each
      stratum and enrollment in a stratum will end when the maximum-tolerated dose is reached. As
      of 10/23/06, due to adverse events associated with the 60 mcg/kg dose level, all participants
      will receive up to the 30 mcg/kg dose level, with no further dose escalation. New
      participants will enroll in Stratum 2 only.

      There will be 9 study visits; medical and medication history, a physical exam, lymph node and
      spleen assessment, and blood collection will occur at most visits. Participants will undergo
      an electrocardiogram at study entry and on Day 1, and a spleen ultrasound at Week 3. Urine
      collection will occur on Day 4 and at Weeks 2 and 3.
