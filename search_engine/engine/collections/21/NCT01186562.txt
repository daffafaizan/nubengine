      insulin) after autotransplant, but the other two-thirds still need some insulin. Sitagliptin
      works by increasing the amount of a hormone called glucagon-like peptide 1, or GLP-1, in the
      body which then increases the amount of insulin that is made by the beta cells(the insulin
      producing cell of the islets). GLP-1 might also help protect beta cells from dying under
      stressful conditions and increase the production of new beta cells.

      The primary goal of this study is to see if taking sitagliptin for one year after islet
      autotransplant increases the number of patients who achieve and maintain insulin
      independence. Other goals of this study are to see if sitagliptin reduces the amount of
      insulin injections needed or helps the islets make more insulin.
