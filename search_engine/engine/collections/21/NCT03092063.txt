      health status, self-management behaviors and self-efficacy among Mexican-Americans with Type
      2 diabetes using a Sequential, Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial in a public health
      setting. In the first phase of the study, subjects will be randomly assigned to six 2.5 hour
      sessions (three months) of either: 1) Tomando Control de su Diabetes (TC), a culturally
      tailored, community-based, Diabetes Self-Management program delivered in a group format by
      community health workers (promotoras) working with individual patients and families; or 2) TC
      delivered by health professionals (licensed nurses). Evaluations will be made at baseline,
      three months, six months and 12 months. After six weeks of treatment (at the midway point of
      the intervention), subjects will be assessed for improvement in diabetes self-management
      behaviors (the primary outcome). In the second phase of the study, those subjects who have
      improved their diabetes self-management behaviors by 50% over baseline will be continued in
      their assigned treatment for the duration of three months. Those subjects who do not meet
      this target will be re-randomized to receive either: 1) an augmented version of TC that has a
      specific focus on engaging family members; or 2) a multifamily group treatment led by nurses
      specially trained in teaching diabetes self-management skills for an additional three months.
