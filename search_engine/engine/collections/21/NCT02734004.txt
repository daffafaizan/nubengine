    
      This is a phase I/II open-label, multicenter study to evaluate the safety, tolerability,
      pharmacokinetics (PK) and antitumor activity of MEDI4736 in combination with olaparib in
      patients with advanced solid tumors, selected based on a rationale for response to olaparib.

      Patients will be poly (adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase (PARP)-inhibitor and
      immunotherapy (IMT)-na√Øve (defined as no prior exposure to PARP inhibitors or IMT, including,
      but not limited to, other anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 [CTLA-4],
      anti-programmed cell death 1 [PD-1], anti-programmed death-ligand 1 [PD-L1] monoclonal
      antibodies, or any other antibody or drug specifically targeting T-cell co-stimulation or
      checkpoint pathways).

      The 4 initial stage cohorts (Modules 1 to 4) include patients with relapsed small cell lung
      cancer (SCLC), germline BRCA mutated (gBRCAm) metastatic human epidermal growth factor
      receptor 2 (HER2)-negative breast cancer, gBRCAm platinum-sensitive relapsed ovarian cancer,
      and gastric cancer. Enrollment for these cohorts has been completed.

      Second stage cohorts (Modules 5 to 7) will include patients with relapsed BRCAm
      platinum-sensitive relapsed ovarian cancer and non BRCAm platinum-sensitive relapsed ovarian
      cancer.

      Third stage cohorts (Modules 8 to 10) will include patients with HER2-negative, BRCAm breast
      cancer (Module 8), HER2 negative, non BRCAm, Homologous Recombination Repair gene mutated
      (HRRm) breast cancer (Module 9) and non BRCAm, non HRRm triple negative breast cancer (TNBC)
      breast cancer (Module 10).
