      autologous dendritic cells transduced with adenoviruses encoding the MART-1 and gp100
      melanoma antigens with or without interleukin-2 in patients with stage III or IV melanoma.
      II. Evaluate the cellular response and efficacy of these regimens in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients are sequentially assigned to one of three
      dose levels. Patients receive modified autologous dendritic cells subcutaneously on day 1
      with or without interleukin-2 IV on days 4-19. Treatment continues every 21 days for a total
      of 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6
      patients receive escalating doses of modified dendritic cells with or without interleukin-2
      until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for each regimen is reached. The MTD is defined as the
      dose below that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 24-36 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.
