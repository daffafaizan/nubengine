    
      Individual patient Standard of Care (steroid therapy with or without additional therapies)
      will be administered in a stable fashion during the first weeks of the study in addition to
      increasing doses of Cannabidiol or placebo ( in a double blind manner. Dosage of Cannabidiol
      will start at 25 mg twice a day and will be increased every two days, if no side effects are
      observed, to 50 mg twice a day, 100 mg twice a day and finally to 150 mg twice a day
      Cannabidiol respectively. Treatment will be given with food. Identical placebo will be
      administered in the placebo arm. In stage 1,both patient and investigator will be blinded to
      treatment modalities.

      At the conclusion of the dose escalation segment of the study, if the 300 mg Cannabidiol dose
      level/placebo is deemed safe for two weeks with Standard of care dose of steroids, patients
      will continue receiving this 300 mg dose/placebo for an additional period of 3 months. Weekly
      tapering off of steroids will then commence and will be carried out .

      Three months after starting treatment with Cannabidiol an interim analysis to evaluate
      Cannabidiol's safety and efficacy will be carried out by an independent assessor not
      associated with the study .At the conclusion of this interim analysis, Cannabidiol
      Non-responders will be removed from the trial, and Placebo Non-responders will be switched
      over to Cannabidiol.

      If a patient flares, then his/her code will be opened by the unblinded observer. If the
      subject has been administered placebo, then he/she will be crossed over to the Cannabidiol
      arm. If the subject has been administered Cannabidiol, then he/she will be restarted on
      Standard of care prednisone in addition to Cannabidiol or removed from study, depending on
      the severity of the flare-up.
