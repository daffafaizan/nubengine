      challenging. This study aims to collect clinical, radiological, pathological, molecular and
      genetic data including detailed clinical parameters, MR and histopathology images, molecular
      pathology (1p/19q co-deletion, MGMT methylation, IDH and TERTp mutations, etc) and genetic
      data (Whole exome sequencing, RNA sequencing, proteomics, etc). This study seeks to find the
      prognostic and clinical significance based on molecular and genetic biomarkers/subgroups of
      gliomas.
