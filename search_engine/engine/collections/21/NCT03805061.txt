      groups were formed, namely 'aerobic exercise' and 'isokinetic exercise' groups. Using
      modified Bruce protocol, effort capacities were measured with Humac Norm Cybex dynamometer, 6
      min. walking distance and MSQOL-54 scale were used to assess the quality of life. The aerobic
      exercise group by using treadmill their walking speeds were adjusted according to the maximum
      speed at which the person could walk was performed for a period of ; 8 weeks, 3 days a week,
      30-45 minutes each patient according to the progressive exercise method. 5-10 minutes warm-up
      exercise was performed before starting to work, 5-10 minutes stretching exercise at the end
      of the exercise. Patients in the isokinetic exercise group pedaled a bicycle ergometer for
      warming with low resistance for 5 minutes before starting to exercise, and exercise was
      applied for 5-10 minutes to cool down at the end of the study. The exercise program was
      applied for 8 weeks with 3 repetitions per week.

      Assessment of exercise capacity (effort capacity) was performed by applying the Norav
      Trackmaster TMX 425 Treadmill Exercise Device by applying Modified Bruce protocol. Patients'
      total exercise times were expressed in seconds. Indirect maximum amount of oxygen volume (VO2
      max) values were calculated using heart rate obtained with submaximal treadmill exercise.All
      the cases participating in the study were compared in terms of the pre-treatment MSQoL-54
      scale and the MSQoL-54 scale subscale.
