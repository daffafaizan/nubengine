      the use of electrodermal activity (EDA) as an index of sensory processing. EDA will be
      measured using skin conductance response (SCR). The purpose of this study is to investigate
      if using EDA is a reliable measure over time within the context of response to sensation.
      Scores from test one and test two of each subject will be correlated to determine reliability
      of EDA measure. Reliability in this context will establish the utility of EDA as an index of
      sensory processing. Testing will occur two times within a six week period.
