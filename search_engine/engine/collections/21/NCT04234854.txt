      multicenter, multispecialty trial of CGuardâ„¢ use in all-comer population of consecutive
      patients with carotid stenosis related cerebral symptoms (TIA, stroke, retinal TIA, retinal
      stroke) or signs of ipsilateral brain injury on MRI or CT imaging.

      The main objective of this observational study is to evaluate an incidence of residual plaque
      prolapse after carotid stenting using the study device.

      Study Rationale In conventional carotid stents, plaque prolapse (PP) on intravascular imaging
      had been determined to be strongly associated with new post-procedural diffusion-weighted
      magnetic resonance lesions on cerebral imaging and with increased ischaemic stroke incidence.
      A significant increase in PP susceptibility was observed with unstable carotid plaque,
      pointing to the limitations of conventional CAS in unstable carotid plaques, such as
      symptomatic and increased-spontaneous-symptoms-risk lesions.

      This is reflected in current guidelines that provide a higher recommendation class to
      surgical management (CEA) rather than CAS for symptomatic lesions.

      Circumstantial evidence indicates that the novel carotid stent covered with MicroNET (CGuard
      EPS) may be an optimal device for effective carotid plaque sequestration (that may be
      particularly relevant in high-risk plaques) - but no systematic study has been performed thus
      far.

      Because of the increasing evidence that not only clinical symptoms (that may be related to
      for instance the affection of dominant vs. non-dominant haemisphere) but also signs of
      ipisilateral cerebral infarct/s are a hallmark of high-risk plaque and are associated with
      adverse prognosis, and because that neurology increasingly uses the term "symptomatic" to
      refer to carotid stenosis associated with clinically silent ipisilateral cerebral infarct/s,
      the present study will enroll both patients with clinical symptoms of cerebral ischaemia in
      relation to carotid stenosis and those with (clinically silent) signs of ipsilateral injury
      such as ischemic focus/foci on CT or MRI/DW-MRI).

      As previously demonstrated, clinically significant/relevant PP is that depicted by IVUS (with
      angiography, on the one hand, being not sensitive enough and OCT, on the other, being
      possibly too sensitive).
