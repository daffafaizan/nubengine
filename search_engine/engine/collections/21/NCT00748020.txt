      their written informed consent. After determining the minimal erythema dose (MED) patients
      were randomised in either group 1, erythematogenic scheme, or group 2, suberythematogenic
      scheme. Group 1 started with 70% of MED and every following irradiation with an increase of
      40%. Group 2 started with 30% of MED and every next visit an increase of 20%. The study
      protocol was adjusted in case of erythema (sunburn) according to a standard
      erythema-phototherapy protocol, varying from skip one irradiation to lowering the percentage
      of increase. In case of clearance the study stopped. Clearance was defined as less than 10%
      of baseline body area of psoriasis.
