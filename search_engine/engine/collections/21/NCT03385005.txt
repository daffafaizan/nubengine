      can evoke functional movement in the hand, participants will receive transcutaneous
      electrical stimulation via an investigational (not FDA approved) neuromuscular stimulator.

      Participants will be asked to attend up to 4 study sessions a week for up to 8 weeks, with
      each session lasting up to 4 hours. At these sessions, electrical pulses will be sent to the
      forearm muscles through electrodes placed on the skin. These electrodes may also be
      accompanied with a gel or lotion to allow for a better connection of the electrodes to the
      skin. The precision, specificity, and extent of hand and finger movements will be visually
      assessed in real time and later reassessed on video recordings of the session. The study will
      also involve the placement of sensors on the hand and finger to measure the amount of grip
      strength and evoked forces. In order to monitor the health of participants, the study will
      assess blood pressure and heart rate before, during, and after the electrical stimulation.
      Upon completion of these study sessions, the individual's participation in the study is
      considered complete.
