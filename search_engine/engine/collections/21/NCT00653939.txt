      Europe, accounting for 29% of all cancer deaths. Non-Small Cell Lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts
      for approximately 80% of all lung cancer cases. Currently, no curative treatment is available
      for advanced stages of the disease (stages III and IV), which comprise the majority of cases.
      Treatment with the combination of carboplatin and paclitaxel has been shown to be effective
      and well tolerated in advanced stage NSCLC. Targeted therapies, such as bevacizumab, often
      act synergistically with chemotherapy. Bevacizumab inhibits vascular endothelial growth
      factor (VEGF), necessary for endothelial cell proliferation and new blood vessel formation.
      CA4P targets existing abnormal vasculature of tumors, impeding tumor blood flow and leading
      to extensive tumor cell death as a consequence of oxygen and nutrient deprivation.

      This study will compare the effect of CA4P when combined with chemotherapy and bevacizumab on
      progression free survival (PFS) to PFS after chemotherapy and bevacizumab alone.
