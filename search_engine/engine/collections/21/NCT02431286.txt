      approximately 30% of the surgical population and can reach up to 70% in high risk patients
      for PONV. Advances have been made to prevent PONV, but the incidence is still high in certain
      groups of patients. In high risk patients, pharmacologic intervention should consist of
      multimodal therapy, targeting different mechanisms of action. The objective of this study is
      to investigate if aprepitant in association with palonosetron and dexamethasone could reduce
      the incidence of PONV in high-risk patients for this symptom, undergoing cancer surgery
      mastectomies. METHODS: this is a randomized and double blind clinical trial. Female high-risk
      patients for PONV(Apfel score 3 or 4) scheduled for mastectomy that agree with the study and
      signed the informed consent, are randomly distributed into one of two groups: Group A,
      aprepitant 80 mg per os one hour before the surgery and Group B will receive placebo by the
      same route one hour before surgery, in a blinded way. After induction of anesthesia,
      dexamethasone 4 mg and palonosetron 0,075mg are intravenously administered to all patients.
      After the end of the surgery, a patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) device will be
      intravenously inserted in all patients. In the postoperative period, patients will be
      evaluated for nausea, vomiting and pain intensity in the recovery room and after 24 hours
