        -  Compare the efficacy and tolerability of adjuvant exemestane versus adjuvant tamoxifen
           in postmenopausal women with early breast cancer.

        -  Compare the relapse-free survival and overall survival of patients treated with these
           drugs.

        -  Compare the incidence of contralateral breast cancer in patients treated with these
           drugs.

        -  Compare the safety and long-term tolerability of these drugs in these patients.

        -  Compare the quality of life of patients treated with these drugs.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified
      according to estrogen receptor (ER)/progesterone receptor (PgR) status (ER positive vs ER
      negative/PgR positive vs ER positive/PgR unknown), prior chemotherapy (none vs taxane-based
      vs anthracycline-based vs other), and nodal status (negative vs 1-3 nodes positive vs 4 or
      more nodes positive). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral tamoxifen once daily

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral exemestane once daily. Treatment in both arms continues
           for a minimum of 5 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline and at months 3 and 12 during study.

      Patients are followed at least annually.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 4,400 patients (2,200 per treatment arm) will be accrued for
      this study.
