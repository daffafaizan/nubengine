    
      In consecutive patients scheduled for laparoscopic sigmoidectomy, all hemodynamic and
      respiratory variables are recorded electronically for subsequent offline analysis.

      All patients are ventilated in volume control mode with a tidal volume of 8 ml/kg ideal body
      weight.

      During steady-state Target Controlled Infusion (TCI) propofol/remifentanil anesthesia, when
      the Mean Arterial Blood Pressure (MAP) dropped below 80% of the awake state for at least 5
      minutes, a phenylephrine bolus of 2 μg/kg is administered. If necessary this is repeated, or
      a continuous administration of phenylephrine is started at a rate of 10-30 μg/kg/u.

      All patient manipulations during the procedure are electronically recorded and time stamped
      for subsequent off-line data analysis.

      The first episode in each patient where phenylephrine is administered and in a period of at
      least 10 minutes when minimal or absent patient manipulation occurred, the hemodynamic
      variables are analysed to describe the effects of phenylephrine administration on the dynamic
      preload parameters and macro-hemodynamics.
