      dying tissue around the wound, daily wound care, good nutrition, and adequate relief of
      pressure. Pressure reduction, commonly known as "off-loading," is most often achieved by
      having the patient wear an "off-loading boot". However, using a cast similar to the cast used
      to treat broken bones will result in less activity and better wound healing. The cast is
      considered the best method for off-loading the foot but is not used as often as other methods
      because the cast covers the foot ulcer and it does not allow you to perform daily cleaning
      and examination.

      This study will apply a Total Contact Cast (TCC)System and leave an opening where the ulcer
      can be treated on a daily basis by the investigators. Patients will be asked to apply an
      ointment called Santyl ® to their ulcer on a daily basis. Santyl ® ointment is an FDA
      approved drug that is routinely used on foot ulcers. The Santyl ® ointment cleans wounds to
      promote a better environment for wounds to heal. It helps remove nonliving tissue without
      harming the new healing tissue.

      Trial will last 14 days and it will consist of 4 visits. In the first visits, patients'
      wounds will be cleaned from dead and dying tissue (debridement) and the first modified
      contact cast will be applied. Patients will be provided Santyl to apply daily with
      reapplication of foam dressing. Patients will return at day 3, and then weekly for 2 weeks
      for standard evaluation and debridement and wound measurements and at day 3, and week 1 visit
      for reapplication of the modified contact cast.
