      transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Using simultaneous TMS and functional magnetic
      resonance imaging (fMRI), we will evaluate TMS induced changes in brain activity, including
      regional brain activation and inter-regional functional connectivity. Repetitive TMS will be
      applied over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) with different frequencies and
      interleaved with fMRI acquisition to provide online monitoring of brain activity.
      Furthermore, we will assess the relationship between the TMS induced brain activity and the
      anatomical connection obtained from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), using individual
      variations in these imaging measures. Results from this study will help to understand the
      underling mechanism of TMS and will provide insights for interpretation of TMS and fMRI data.

      Study population: Up to 70 healthy, adults will be tested. Subjects must fit
      exclusion/inclusion criteria for both TMS and MRI. We expect to enroll 70 subjects to arrive
      at 50 who complete the protocol.

      Design: The study is a within-subject design with each subject completing up to 4 TMS-fMRI
      sessions in two days (2 sessions per day)

      Outcome measures: The outcome measures will be the effects of TMS on fMRI blood oxygen
      level-dependent (BOLD) responses, TMS induced changes on resting state functional
      connectivity, and their associations with relevant structural connectivity revealed by DTI.
