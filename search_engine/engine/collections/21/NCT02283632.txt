      procedure often used to address a mix of pathological conditions. The safety of the Jejunal
      Diversion procedure is not in question, but rather understanding the gastrointestinal
      signalling effects. Up to 25 eligible subjects will be enrolled into the trial. Enrollment
      will stop once 15 subjects have undergone the Jejunal Diversion procedure
