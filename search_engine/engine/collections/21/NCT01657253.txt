      of discomfort, visual disturbance, and tear film instability with potential damage to the
      ocular surface. Current treatment is heavily weighted toward supplementation, stimulation, or
      preservation of aqueous tears. Artificial tears are one of the primary treatments for dry
      eye; it is mainly palliative and focuses on reducing the symptoms of discomfort to improve
      quality of life for a patient.

      A phase III randomized double-blind clinical trial will be conducted to evaluate efficacy and
      safety of the ophthalmic solution PRO-148 in the ocular surface of patients with mild to
      moderate dry eye compared with ophthalmic solution SystaneÂ®. Patients will be randomized to
      receive one of the treatments for 60 days. Efficacy and safety measures will be performed at
      baseline and at 60 days after treatment
