        -  Determine the feasibility of conducting a large phase III randomized study in the
           future, comparing radiotherapy vs endoscopic excision in patients with stage 0-II
           laryngeal cancer of the glottis.

        -  Determine patient acceptability of the proposed trial design.

        -  Compare the effect of using dedicated head and neck research nurses vs general nurses on
           patient recruitment.

        -  Refine outcome measures, including voice analysis and quality of life.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, controlled, multicenter, pilot study. Patients are stratified
      according to participating center and T stage (Tis or T1 vs T2a). Patients are randomized to
      1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo endoscopic excision via CO_2 laser or cold steel.

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo radiotherapy once daily, 5 days a week, for 3-4 weeks. Patients
           undergo vocal analysis at baseline and at 6 months and 1 and 2 years after
           randomization.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, at 1 year, and then annually for 5 years.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 5 years.
