      risk of cardiovascular and metabolic cardiometabolic disease, including insulin diabetes,
      resistance, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. Obesity and obesity-associated cardiometabolic
      dysfunction are significant contributors to morbidity and mortality in Veterans. This
      indicates that obesity and cardiometabolic dysfunction are complex and multifactorial, and
      suggests that there are additional factors that contribute to the pathogenesis of obesity and
      its associated cardiometabolic risk that have been discovered. Moreover, some of the
      pharmacologic therapies for obesity can have adverse cardiovascular effects. Thus, it is
      crucial to improve the understanding of the multiple pathways contributing to the
      pathogenesis of obesity and obesity-associated cardiometabolic risk, including the
      identification of novel relevant pathways, in order to develop more effective treatments for
      these diseases. The proposed work will form a foundation for future high-impact studies of
      mechanisms for adiposity and cardiometabolic disease.
