      patient are changing. Consequently, ventilation settings have to be modified very often. The
      modifications can be conducted either according to a weaning protocol or automatically by an
      expert system (SmartCare/PS). This trial compares protocol-guided weaning with automatic
      weaning in post-surgical patients and examines the effect on total ventilation time, numbers
      of manipulations and alarms of the ventilator, length of stay in the ICU and in the hospital,
      28- and 90-day mortality.
