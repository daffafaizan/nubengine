    
      1. To assess the quality and quantity of the maxillary sinus bone prior to the placement of
           dental implants and subsequent restorations, approximately 20 patients will be randomly
           assigned to receive an augmentation of the maxillary sinus region using either Shefabone
           (synthetic bone) or Bio-Oss (xenograft).

        2. With the use of pre-operative and post-operative limited view CBCT radiography, the
           maxillary sinus bone density will be assessed and compared between the individuals
           receiving Shefabone and the individuals receiving xenograft material.

        3. Histomorphometric analysis will be used to assess, compare and contrast the quality and
           the quantity of the new vital bone cells generated when using these different graft
           materials.
