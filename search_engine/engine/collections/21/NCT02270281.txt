      hypovolemia. Fluids and exogenous catecholamines are mainstay. However, even after initial
      resuscitation, microcirculatory dysfunctions still exist, and represent a direct physiologic
      link to organ failure and death. Therefore, therapeutic strategies aiming at improving
      microcirculation are performed.

      Dexmedetomidine was found might be beneficial to sepsis. Dexmedetomidine were found to
      improve microcirculation in sepsis animal studies and non-sepsis patients. However, the
      effect of dexmedetomidine on microcirculation in septic shock patients is unknown.

      Based on the hypothesis that dexmedetomidine might improve microcirculation in initial
      resuscitated septic shock patients, the study was to investigate the effects of
      dexmedetomidine on microcirculation in early septic shock patients despite initial
      resuscitation. Meanwhile, to observe the possible mechanism of the effect, the correlation
      between dexmedetomidine dose and microcirculatory parameters as well as catecholamine level
      were performed.
