    
      This study is a prospective, longitudinal, nested case-control study designed to identify
      changes in gene transcription predictive of and associated with asthma exacerbations in
      children ages 6 to 17 years with difficult-to-control, exacerbation-prone asthma.

      Participants will be followed prospectively for the onset of a cold and a subsequent asthma
      exacerbation. An internet-based asthma and cold symptom diary will be accessed by
      participants using a hand-held device. When the participant reports development of a cold, a
      clinic visit will be scheduled as soon as possible (within 48 hours of cold symptom onset) to
      collect blood and nasal samples. A second clinic visit will occur 4-6 days from the onset of
      cold symptoms to obtain samples after the initial cold, but prior to the use of systemic
      corticosteroids. Participants will be followed for up to two colds or approximately 6 months
      after Visit 0, whichever comes first.
