      drink and food with few or no additional calories. Sweeteners are widely used in
      commercialized beverages. Despite some debate, no significant toxicity was demonstrated at a
      reasonable level of consumption (less than 20 cans per day). However little data is available
      on the metabolic effects of a regular consumption of beverages containing sweeteners. The
      objective of the study is to evaluate the effect of a regular consumption (twice a day for 12
      weeks) of a carbonated drink with sweeteners, in a normal diet, compared with unsweetened
      sparkling water on insulin sensitivity in healthy normoweight and overweight subjects.
