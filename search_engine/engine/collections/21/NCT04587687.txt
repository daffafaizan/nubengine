    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Obtain a preliminary estimate of the anti-tumor activity of brentuximab vedotin plus
      bendamustine hydrochloride (bendamustine) in patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) CD30+
      follicular lymphoma as determined by the complete response rate (CR) and best overall
      response rate (ORR) as defined per Lugano criteria.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      To obtain the duration of response (DOR). To obtain the time to response (TTR). To obtain the
      progression-free survival (PFS) among subjects with relapsed or refractory CD30-positive
      follicular lymphoma (FL) receiving brentuximab vedotin and bendamustine. To obtain data on
      overall survival (OS). To evaluate the safety and tolerability.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive brentuximab vedotin intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1 and
      bendamustine IV over 60 minutes on days 1 and 2 of each cycle. Treatment repeats every 21
      days for 6 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients
      who respond to combination treatment and do not experience excessive toxicity may continue to
      receive additional single-agent brentuximab vedotin IV over 30 minutes on day 1 (once every
      21 days) for up to 10 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days, and then every 3
      months for 2 years.
