      about twenty renal transplant patients with chronic active antibody rejection. Some patients
      are diagnosed at a very advanced stage and will not be treated because the expected benefit
      is tenuous (exclusion criteria).

      For both groups, patients will have one session per day, 4 consecutive days then three days
      without, then one session per day for 4 consecutive days. That's 11 days of treatment in all.
      The fourth and eighth sessions will be followed by an infusion of Rituximab 375 mg / m2.

      At the beginning and at the end of each session, patients will have a blood test to measure
      the parameters and collection of study biological samples.

      DFPP sessions are performed by double filtration technique. A DFPP session lasts about 2
      hours for 3.5 L of processed plasma. During the session it is necessary to compensate for 20
      grams of albumin.

      The plasmapheresis sessions are performed by centrifugation technique. It takes about 20
      minutes to prepare the apheresis monitor and circuit. A plasmapheresis session lasts
      approximately 1h30 for 3.5 L of plasma exchange (replacement with albumin), 2 h for an
      exchange where the removed plasma is replaced by fresh frozen plasma.

      The blood flow rate for plasmapheresis is 80 ml / min, or 50 ml / min a plasma flow rate.

      The study includes five follow-up visits following the treatment sessions. A visit 45 days
      after the start of apheresis sessions, a visit at 3 months and a visit every 3 months for one
      year.
