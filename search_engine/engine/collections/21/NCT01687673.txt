      sorafenib will achieve a clinically-meaningful median time to progression (TTP) of at least 6
      months, with null hypothesis of less than or equal to 3 months, in first-line systemic
      therapy for patients with advanced Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A randomized trial would
      be required to formally compare the efficacy of this combination to sorafenib alone and will
      be indicated if this phase II study achieves a median TTP of at least 6 months. An interim
      safety analysis will employ stopping rules after 30% of planned patients have been treated
      with at least one dose of protocol therapy to ensure the combination does not confer
      excessive toxicity.

      A key aspect of this study will be the requirement of histologic confirmation along with
      adequate archival tissue for correlative tissue analyses to explore new biomarkers of
      response to mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibition. Circulating biomarker data
      including enumeration of circulating tumor cells (CTC) and measurement of the tumor marker
      Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) will be performed at specific time points to evaluate for predictive
      value. Specimen banking of tissue, serum, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells will be
      undertaken to enable future novel biomarker studies. Modified RECIST will be performed in
      addition to standard RECIST 1.1 to explore for improved imaging predictors of response.
