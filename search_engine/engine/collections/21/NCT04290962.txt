      I. To conduct a pilot implementation research study to determine the viability, safety, and
      effectiveness of the use of a 12-month, commercially available, web-based lifestyle
      behavioral medicine intervention program by individuals who are or have been a Witness Role
      Model (WRM) in the National Witness Project (NWP).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To examine the feasibility of this research to subsequently investigate the effects of
      optimal health and/or lifestyle related behavioral medicine interventions used to promote
      optimal health on mitigating cancer-related and overall mortality disparities in African
      Americans (AA), and comorbidity/ chronic disease(s) management over time. (EXPLORATORY)
