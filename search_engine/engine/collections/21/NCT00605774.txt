      epinephrine are blunted in Type 1 DM. These studies have obvious clinical relevance because
      strategies aimed at increasing circulating levels of epinephrine will not be effective if the
      metabolic counterregulatory mechanisms (increased endogenous glucose production (EGP),
      increased lipolysis and reduced glucose uptake) of the hormone are also blunted. Epinephrine
      was infused to reach circulating levels of ~ 1000 pg/ml (This level of epinephrine is
      equivalent to values of the hormone observed during hypoglycemia of 50 mg/dl in healthy males
      and T1DM men with average glucose control) in groups of either intensively treated (HBA1C <
      7.0%), conventionally treated (HBA1C > 9.0%) type 1 DM and age, weight matched healthy
      controls. In the intensively treated DM group, epinephrine's actions to increase EGP,
      lipolysis and to restrain glucose uptake were significantly reduced (<60%). The mechanism for
      our finding needs to be determined. Our hypothesis is that antecedent exercise can cause
      repetitive activations of Autonomic-adrenomedullary responses that lead to downregulation of
      Î²-adrenoreceptor mechanisms. Therefore, the combination of blunted epinephrine effects,
      increased insulin action and reduced levels of the catecholamine might fully explain the
      vexing clinical question of post exercise hypoglycemia in Type 1 DM. In this application, we
      will test the hypothesis that antecedent exercise will blunt the metabolic, neuroendocrine
      and cardiovascular effects of subsequent epinephrine infusion in Type 1 DM.
