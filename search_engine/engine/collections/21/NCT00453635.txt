    
      Herceptin, a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against the extracellular domain of the
      transmembrane glycoprotein HER2/neu (c-erbB-2), is a valuable option in the treatment of
      women with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. The combination of Herceptin and
      chemotherapy yielded significantly better results than chemotherapy alone in response, time
      to progression, and survival time. Whether the combination of Docetaxel, Carboplatin and
      Herceptin versus the administration of Vinorelbine and Herceptin combination in HER-2
      positive patients with metastatic breast cancer is preferable is not yet known.
