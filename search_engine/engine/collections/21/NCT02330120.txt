      mechanics. Sixty patients mechanically ventilated in intensive care unit are included in this
      study. Patients are divided into two random groups, Group P (propofol) and Group D
      (dexmedetomidine). Propofol infusion 0.5-2 mg/kg/h is given to Group P patients and
      dexmedetomidine infusion 0.2-0.7 mcg/kg/h is given to Group D patients for sedation. Initial
      blood gas analysis, airway resistance (cmH2O/L/sec), positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP,
      cmH20), frequency (breath/min), tidal volume (mL/min), minute volume (mL), peak airway
      pressure (cmH20), compliance (mL/cmH20), endtidal CO2 (mmHg), SvO2 (%) values are recorded.
      This parameters are evaluated with Drager Evita 4 ventilator and recorded on
      5th,15th,30th,45th ve 60th minutes . Sedation is observed using Riker and Ramsey
      Sedation-Agitation Scale. Compliance of patients to mechanical ventilation is observed and
      recorded.

      The primary outcome measures are airway resistance and peak airway pressure. Secondary
      outcome measure is sedation score.
