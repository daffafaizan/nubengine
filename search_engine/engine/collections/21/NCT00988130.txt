      Primary

        -  To evaluate the side effects of high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) ablation in men
           with non-metastatic progressive prostate cancer.

        -  To evaluate the quality of life of patients treated with this regimen.

      Secondary

        -  To determine the success of index lesion ablation with HIFU at 6 months after treatment
           by demonstrating the absence of cancer in the treated or ablated area by transrectal
           ultrasound biopsy.

        -  To evaluate the prostate-specific antigen kinetics after index lesion ablation in
           patients treated with this regimen.

        -  To evaluate the proportion of men who require androgen blockade at 12 months of
           follow-up.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo focal ablation with high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU)
      ablation on day 1. Treatment may repeat at 6 months in patients with progressive disease.

      Blood samples and prostate biopsies are collected periodically for further analysis.

      Patients complete questionnaires (IPSS, IPSS-QoL, ICS, IIEF-5, and FACT-P) at baseline and
      periodically during study.
