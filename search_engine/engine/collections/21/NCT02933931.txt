      available beyond horizontal infection control measures. After the Canadian government donated
      800 vials of the vaccine candidate VSV-EBOV to World Health Organization (WHO), the
      University Hospitals of Geneva agreed to perform a WHO-coordinated phase I/II double-blind,
      placebo-controlled randomized trial to assess the candidate's safety and immunogenicity
      healthy adult volunteers. The doses of 10 E7 pfu and 5 x 10 E7 pfu were tested in 35 and 16
      volunteers, respectively, before a safety-driven study hold in late 2014. At trial resumption
      in early 2015, the remaining volunteers (n=51) received 3 x 10 E5 pfu. Thirteen volunteers
      received placebo. Among vaccinees, early immune responses were impressive, even at the lowest
      dose of 3 x 10 E5 pfu, and persisted well up to 6 months (last time point assessed). The
      trial successfully ended 12 months after injection. This prospective observational study will
      assess immune durability in this group of vaccinees at yearly time points up to five years
      post-vaccination.
