      I. Demonstrate ability to monitor cancer-specific deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), ribonucleic
      acid (RNA), and proteomic alterations from plasma.

      II. Improve detection of recurrences post completion of curative therapies through monitoring
      of plasma cancer-specific DNA, RNA and proteomic alterations.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Qualitative and quantitative changes in cancer-specific plasma alterations during
      neoadjuvant, adjuvant therapies and surveillance.

      II. Disease free survival (DFS) of patients with detectable cancer-specific plasma
      alterations.

      III. Overall survival (OS) of patients with detectable cancer-specific plasma alterations.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Optimal combination of cancer-specific plasma DNA, RNA and / or proteomic alterations for
      early detection of recurrences.

      II. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive and negative predictive values of
      cancer-specific plasma alterations in detecting recurrences.

      III. Correlation between cancer-specific alterations in plasma and tissue and either with
      outcomes including DFS & OS.

      IV. Nature and frequency of detection of incidental non-colorectal cancer related DNA, RNA
      and / or proteomic alterations.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo collection of blood samples at baseline, during each neoadjuvant therapy
      treatment, prior to surgical resection, and up to 4 times per year for up to 5 years.
      Patients also undergo collection of tissue sample at time of surgical resection. Patients'
      medical records may also be reviewed.
