      using electrodes placed in the relevant lower limb muscles that take part during the stair
      climbing activity.

      The study included 10 children with DMD levels were 1 and 10 children with DMD levels were
      2-3 according to the Brooke Lower Limb Functional Classification scale and 10 healthy
      children.

      Muscle activation of vastus lateralis, biceps femoris, tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius
      medialis muscles will be measured by superficial electromyographic measurement. Muscle
      activation according to SENIAM (surface EMG for a non-invasive assessment of muscles) for
      will be evaluated.

      Stair climbing activity will be performed 3 times and at 1 minute intervals.
