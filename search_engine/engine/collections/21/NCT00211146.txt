      risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in adult spine surgery using a perisurgical regimen of
      epoetin alfa (PROCRIT®) versus the standard of care for blood conservation. Spine surgery was
      selected as the population to study because anti-coagulant therapy is not always administered
      in association with this surgery type. In addition, the efficacy of epoetin alfa (PROCRIT®)
      in protecting patients from receiving allogeneic red cell transfusion across adult spinal
      procedures will be studied. Patients scheduled for elective spinal surgery, who agree to
      participate in the study, and meet eligibility criteria will be randomly assigned to epoetin
      alfa (PROCRIT®) or standard of care. No perioperative anti-coagulation therapy is to be
      administered during the study. The study hypothesis is that there is no increased risk of DVT
      in patients receiving perisurgical epoetin alfa (PROCRIT®) treatment. Epoetin alfa (PROCRIT®)
      600U/kg administered once per week for 3 weeks prior to surgery and on the day of surgery.
