    
      CMV infection is a common virus infection of HSCT, and which is highly related with the
      failure of transplantation and survival time of transplant patients. To evaluate the safety
      and efficacy of allogenic CMV-TCR-T cell therapy in subjects with CMV infection, patients
      with CMV emias or deseases will be enrolled, and donor derived
      CMV-TCR-T(HLA-A*1101\0201\2402) cells will be intravenously infused with a escalated dose of
      0.1-1Ã—106 CMV-TCR-T cells. The CMV DNA copies and CMV-TCR-T cell proliferation will be
      monitored in the scheduled time (day 0, day 4, day 7, day 10, day 14, day 28).
