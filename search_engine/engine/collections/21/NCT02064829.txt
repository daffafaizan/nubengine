    
      This study is designed to compare the pharmacokinetics (PK) of IG-001 and nab-paclitaxel in
      patients with metastatic or locally recurrent breast cancer. Patients meeting the eligibility
      criteria will be randomized to determine which drug is administered first.

        -  Patients randomized to Group 1 will receive a single dose of IG-001 (Period 1) followed
           3 weeks later by a single dose of nab-paclitaxel (Period 2).

        -  Patients randomized to Group 2 will receive a single dose of nab-paclitaxel (Period 1)
           followed 3 weeks later by a single dose of IG-001 (Period 2).

      Blood samples for PK analysis will be taken at specified times before, during, and after the
      infusion of each drug in Periods 1 and 2. Following successful completion of Period 1 and
      Period 2, patients may be eligible for up to 4 additional cycles of treatment with IG-001 in
      the extension study.

      Safety will be monitored throughout the study.
