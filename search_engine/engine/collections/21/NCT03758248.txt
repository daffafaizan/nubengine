      P2Y12 inhibitors in standard dosage were enrolled. Investigators examined plasma biomarkers
      for platelet activation and DNA in those patients, and then analyzed the CYP2C19 genetic
      polymorphism to examine the influence of this genetic variation on the several biomarkers for
      platelet activation and bleeding event.
