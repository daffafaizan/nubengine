      I. To determine the clinical activity of tivozanib in patients with platinum-resistant,
      recurrent ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determining the potential survival advantage and characterizing the safety of single agent

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive tivozanib hydrochloride orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21. Courses
      repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for 3 years.
