    
      The present multicenter parallel session randomized placebo controlled study (4 French
      centers) aims to evaluate the long term efficacy over 25 weeks of repeated sessions of
      magnetic transcranial stimulation of the motor cortex or prefrontal cortex on average pain
      intensity (primary outcome) and several secondary outcome measures (e.g. quality of life,
      sleep, neuropathic symptoms, return to work), in patients with peripheral neuropathic pain.

      The patients will be randomized to receive one of 3 treatment arms : rTMS of the motor
      cortex, rTMS of the prefrontal cortex, or placebo (sham stimulation) of the motor or
      prefrontal cortex. The study will be double blind, eg the patient and the investigator will
      not know the nature of treatment. the stimulation protocol will consist of an induction
      phasse of 5 daily sessions then a maintenance phase of several sessions : 3 sessions a week
      apart, 3 sessions a fortnight apart, and 3 sessions 3 weeks apart. The statistical analysis
      will be conducted in the intent to treat population and using a modified ITT analysis
      excluding all the patients with protocol violation (primary outcome). The per protocol
      population will also be assessed.
