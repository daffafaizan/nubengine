      options remain limited. There has been increasing interest around the sodium-glucose
      co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and their use in patients with HF. This is following
      publication of EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial that reported a 14% reduction in the primary composite
      outcome of cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke and >30%
      reductions in cardiovascular mortality, overall mortality and HF hospitalisations in patients
      randomised to the SGLT2 inhibitor, empagliflozin, when compared to placebo. Data on the
      effect of SGLT2 inhibitor use with diuretics is limited. We hypothesize that, in the diabetic
      CHF population, SGLT2 inhibition may augment the effects of loop diuretics.

      Renal Physiology Test (RPT) days will be performed at week 1 and week 6 on each arm of this
      crossover trial. On these RPT days participants will undergo oral water loading (15mls/kg)
      and frequent urination at 30 minute intervals to gain a steady state diuresis. The
      investigational medicinal product will be administered, followed by an intravenous bolus of
      furosemide at a dose of half the participant's usual loop diuretic dose.

      This proof of concept trial will aim to shed light on the mechanism of the cardiovascular and
      renal outcomes demonstrated in the recent EMPA-REG study by documenting the influence of the
      SGLT2 inhibitors when used in combination with a loop diuretic on diuresis and natriuresis
      when compared to placebo.
