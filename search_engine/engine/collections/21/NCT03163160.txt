      pelvic floor muscles disorders (tenderness, trigger points, scars). There is evidence that
      manual therapy and intratissue percutaneous electrolysis can be effective for musculoskeletal
      pain disorders affecting muscles, tendons and fascias of the extremities but they have not
      been evaluated in pelvic floor muscle pain syndrome. The aim of this study is to compare
      manual therapy and EPI in the treatment of pelvic pain in women with dyspareunia.

      Pelvic floor manual therapy is a clinical approach utilizing specifics hands-on mobilizing
      techniques to treat soft tissues. Pelvic floor mobilization is a slow controlled process of
      soft-tissue (myofascial) stretching intended to improve bio-mechanical elasticity.

      EPI technique consists in an ultrasound-guided application of a galvanic electrolytic current
      that causes a controlled local inflammatory process in the target tissue. This allows for
      phagocytosis and the subsequent regeneration of the affected tissue.
