    
      This study was an open-label, randomised, single dose, two-period, crossover study in 25
      healthy male subjects.

      The study comprised of a pre-study screen, followed by 2 treatment periods (1 and 2) and a
      post-study followup.

      Screening (Day -28 to Day -1): Screening assessments were carried out within 28 days before
      first administration of IMP. Eligible subjects were asked to return for the treatment
      periods. Continued eligibility was confirmed pre-dose during each treatment period.

      Treatment Periods (Day -1 to Day 1): Eligible subjects received a single-dose of each IMP
      over 2 treatment periods (1/period as determined by the randomisation schedule), each
      separated by 7 days washout. Each study period was approximately 2 days in duration, from the
      afternoon of Day -1 to the morning of Day 1 at 24 hours (h) post-dose. During each treatment
      period, Subjects arrived at the Clinical Unit on Day -1, IMP was administered on the morning
      of Day 0 fasted (following an overnight fast of at least 10 h) and subjects were discharged
      following the 24 h post-dose blood samples and completion of the scheduled measurements.

      Pharmacokinetic (PK) samples were collected pre-dose at ~ -2min and up to 23 h post-dose (Day
      1) (24 samples) for the measurement of cortisol. A further 3 baseline samples were taken for
      the measurement of cortisol. Safety was also evaluated throughout the study.

      Post Study: After completion of both study periods, the subjects returned 4-22 days later for
      the final followup visit.
