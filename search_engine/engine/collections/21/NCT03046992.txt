      tolerability, and efficacy of YH25448 in in patients with EGFR mutation positive (EGFRm+)
      advanced NSCLC with or without asymptomatic brain metastasis who progressed following prior
      therapy with an EGFR TKIs agent. This study is composed of 3 parts; part A is a dose
      escalation phase, part B is a dose expansion phase and part C is a dose extension phase.

      In dose escalation phase, YH25448 will be escalated to reach either a maximum tolerated or
      absorbable dose in patients as defined by dose-limiting toxicity in NSCLC patients who
      progressed following prior EGFR TKIs treatment to evaluate the safety and tolerability. In
      dose expansion phase, further safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic(PK) and efficacy will be
      evaluated at each dose level(s) of dose escalation phase in NSCLC patients who progressed
      following prior EGFR TKIs treatment and harbouring confirmed T790M mutation. In dose
      extension phase, additional 2 cohorts (2nd line therapy cohort, 1st line therapy cohort) will
      be enrolled to further assess the efficacy, safety, tolerability, and PK of YH25448 at the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended dose (RD) defined through dose escalation phase
      and dose expansion phase. Results of these studies will serve as the evidence for further
      clinical development.

      This study will also characterize the metabolite(s) profile of YH25448 and determine PK of
      its metabolite(s) in biological samples if necessary. Also, exploratory correlation between
      biomarker profiles and pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics will be analyzed.
