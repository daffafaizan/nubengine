      effective HR control (average nighttime HR < 70 bpm) during WCD use in a cohort of female
      patients with cardiomyopathy in an outpatient setting using continuous heart rate (HR) trends
      data from the WCD to optimize BB/ivabradine dosage, as compared to a prior historical
      control.

      Adult female patients (18 years or older) who are prescribed the wearable cardioverter
      defibrillator (WCD) for 3 months for ischemic or non-ischemic cardiomyopathy with a low
      ejection fraction.

      Subjects will wear an FDA-approved WCD with a 3 month follow-up period. Heart rate (HR) will
      be continuously monitored by the WCD. Every two weeks a report showing daily HR trends will
      be emailed to the healthcare provider. The healthcare provider will also receive a HR control
      alert if the HR exceeds a predetermined threshold for 3 days in a row.

      Based on this information, clinicians should follow guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT)
      to add or titrate medication accordingly. The goal of these changes will be to achieve the
      average nighttime HR to recommended guidelines (<70 bpm) by the end of WCD use.
