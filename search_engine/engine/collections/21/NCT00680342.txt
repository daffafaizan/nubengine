      the treatment of subjects with chronic hepatitis C who did not respond to conventional
      antiviral therapy. The primary objectives of this study are to assess the safety and adverse
      event profile of silymarin over a range of doses compared to placebo and to assess efficacy
      of silymarin in normalizing serum aminotransferase activity in patients with chronic
      hepatitis C. Secondary objectives are to characterize the effect of silymarin on serum levels
      of HCV RNA and to explore relationships between silymarin therapy and serum biomarkers of HCV
      hepatic disease activity (oxidative stress, apoptosis, and fibrogenesis).
