      CAM 200 mg bid or esomeprazole 20 mg bid, AMPC 750 mg bid and CAM 200 mg bid. Eradication
      rates are compared. Patients who have ever failed in eradication by CAM-based regimen are
      treated with rabeprazole 10 mg bid, AMPC 750 mg bid and MNZ 250 mg bid or esomeprazole 20 mg
      bid, AMPC 750 mg bid and MNZ 250 mg bid. CYP2C19 genotypes and susceptibility to CAM are
      genetically measured. Other factors are also analyzed with reference to eradication rates.
