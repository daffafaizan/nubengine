      transferase 1A1(UGT1A1) gene polymorphisms and its correlation with irinotecan-associated
      side effects have been confirmed.Data from several studies indicated an improved clinical
      outcome of patients who had received an irinotecan-based regimen.In order to find out the
      correlation between UGT1A1 gene polymorphisms and the side effect and efficacy of irinotecan
      in patients with small cell lung cancer,we designed this study.
