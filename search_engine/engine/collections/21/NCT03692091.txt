      diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. It is not known which method allows the most accurate
      access into the subacromial space and is more effective.

      The investigators have been using a novel approach from the anterior aspect of the shoulder
      for years with good clinical effect and propose comparing this approach to the described
      approach. This study will indicate which method is best and will be of practical clinical
      importance. The investigators feel the technique is easier to perform than other described
      methods and could be taught to clinicians throughout the country and adopted as the standard
      approach.
