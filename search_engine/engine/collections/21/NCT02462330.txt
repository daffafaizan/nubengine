      decade, treatments for heart failure have evolved, but their purpose is to improve symptoms
      and prevent aggravation of the disease. Current research is focusing on the development of
      cell-based therapies using different sources of stem cells which can provide trophic and
      paracrine support or even replace dying cells with new ones. A specific form of stem cells,
      called adult mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), has shown promise for heart repair. These cells
      are known for their ability to secrete paracrine factors and their immunosuppressive
      properties. The MESAMI 2 study will evaluate the efficacy of MSCs injection directly into the
      heart to repair and restore heart function in people with chronic ischemic heart failure
      using NOGA-XP system.

      This phase 2 study is a prospective, multicenter, double-blind, randomized,
      placebo-controlled trial. A total of 90 patients will be randomized in 2 arms to receive
      intramyocardial injection of MSCs or placebo. Patients will be followed up for 13 months.
      Bone marrow will be collected and immediately transported to the French Blood Establishment
      for MSC isolation and expansion. Patients will receive intramyocardial injection of MSCs or
      placebo during a left heart catheterization.
