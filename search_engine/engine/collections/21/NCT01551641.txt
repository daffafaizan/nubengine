    
      Radiotherapy:Patients will be conducted CT simulation, and three-dimensional conformal
      radiation therapy (3DCRT) was performed. 1.8-2.0 Gy/fraction, 5 fractions a week, with a
      total dose of 60-72Gy will be delivered for all patients by 6-MV-X-ray of linear accelerator.

      Chemotherapy: Patients will be concurrently administered with irradiation every 4 weeks with
      PT regimen (cis-platinum of 25 mg/m2/d, d1-4; PTX(paclitaxel)of 135mg/m2/d, d1) for 4 cycles.
      For the first 2-cycles of chemotherapy they will be concurrently given with irradiation and
      the remained 2 cycles, after irradiation.

      Administration of thalidomide: Determine serum VEGF level of the esophageal cancer patients
      3-4 weeks after the beginning of radiotherapy, those whose VEGF level, compared with that
      before radiotherapy, increased or unchanged will be divided into two groups: one is given
      thalidomide concurrent with the following chemoradiotherapy, 100mg/d at bedtime for the
      initial week, and if no moderate above side effect occurred 200mg/d from the next week till
      the end of chemoradiotherapy; the other received concurrent chemoradiotherapy only.

      VEGF determination: Peripheral venous blood samples will be taken in one week before, 3-4
      weeks during, and in one week after radiotherapy respectively. The serum VEGF will be
      determined by the double antibody sandwich ELISA.
