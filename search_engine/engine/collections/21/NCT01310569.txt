      index (BMI) and age (p=0.430, p=0.112, respectively) were enrolled in the study. Biceps,
      triceps, subscapular and suprailiac skinfold thicknesses (SFT) of all cases were measured via
      caliper device; mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) via a tape; and body fat distributions via
      a bioelectrical impedance device. Insulin resistance was calculated via HOMA-IR while ELISA
      was used to measure plasma adiponectin.
