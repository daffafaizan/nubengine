      practices of surgeons. In urology, the development of laparoscopy and then robot-assisted
      surgery has considerably improved the management of pathologies. In France, as in all the
      countries concerned, the spread of robotic surgery has taken place without prior studies
      validating this new technology, nor organizational rules in terms of quality and access to
      care. The report of the Haute Autorité de Santé dated November 2016 underlines the weakness
      of the methodological quality of studies and meta-analyzes evaluating robot-assisted total
      prostatectomy compared to other surgical techniques by laparotomy or conventional
      laparoscopy. It therefore appears important to evaluate in a large study the interest of this
      technique in order to help the authorities to decide on the real benefit of this technology
      and to provide reliable answers to the patients.
