      academic medical centers that provide PrEP care. Despite underserved populations in the South
      having alarmingly high rates of HIV, a large percentage of at-risk individuals are not
      engaged in PrEP care due to limited access to academic medical centers. Mississippi (MS), the
      site of this proposed project, has the seventh highest incidence of HIV of any state and CBOs
      that provide HIV/STI testing outside of urban areas report that very few of their at-risk
      individuals use PrEP. Unfortunately, physicians outside of academic centers are often
      reluctant to prescribe PrEP because they lack the expertise, training, and the support
      necessary to provide comprehensive HIV prevention care. Those are at-risk do not seek PrEP
      from academic centers because of stigma, travel burdens, and financial concerns. To overcome
      these barriers, this project will develop and pilot test a program to deliver PrEP care in
      underserved remote communities in MS through telemedicine clinical care delivered in local
      CBOs. Telemedicine will allow specialists to provide care at a distance and while
      simultaneously enhancing the capacity of local CBOs to provide quality HIV testing and
      counseling, PrEP treatment, and linkage to HIV care if needed. It will allow patients to
      receive the highest level of medical care from trusted CBOs within their local communities.
      It will also enhance the CBO's mission by allowing it to provide a new, high-quality medical
      service.
