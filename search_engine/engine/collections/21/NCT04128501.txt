      I. To determine relapse-free survival after the use of venetoclax in combination with
      azacitidine given as maintenance therapy or for eradication of minimal residual disease in
      patients with high risk acute myeloid leukemia (AML) after hematopoietic stem cell
      transplantation (HSCT).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety and toxicity of venetoclax in combination with azacitidine (type,
      frequency, severity of adverse events [AEs] and relationship of adverse events [AEs] to
      venetoclax).

      II. To determine response duration, overall survival. III. To determine incidence of acute
      and chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD).

      IV. To perform matched pairs analysis to obtain bias corrected treatment comparisons of
      venetoclax + azacitidine (vidaza) (V+V) to standard therapy in the acute myeloid leukemia
      (AML) patients with no evidence of disease (AML D-) subgroup.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To investigate possible relationships between baseline protein and gene expression
      signatures/mutation profile and BH3 profiling in predicting relapse-free survival time to the
      combination.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receiving venetoclax and azacitidine for maintenance after allogeneic stem cell
      transplantation, receive azacitidine subcutaneously (SC) on days 1-5 and venetoclax orally
      (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-7. Patients receiving venetoclax and azacitidine for minimal
      residual disease after allogeneic stem cell transplant, receive azacitidine SC on days 1-7
      and venetoclax PO QD on days 1-14. Treatment repeats every 4-8 weeks for up to 12 cycles in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
