      1980, dissociation had once been considered as a rare psychiatric disturbance. With
      standardized structured interview, however, recent empirical studies showed that in average 9
      percent of participants in general population, 10 percent in psychiatric outpatients, and 15
      percent in psychiatric inpatients receive the diagnosis of a dissociative disorder. In Taiwan
      few attempts have been made for systematic investigation of dissociative disorders. Little
      has been known about the characteristics, prevalence, and associated features of Taiwanese
      patients with a dissociative disorder. The goal of the project is to investigate the
      prevalence of dissociative disorders in psychiatric inpatients in Taiwan. Relevant clinical
      issues, including common psychiatric comorbidity (e.g., positive psychotic symptoms),
      associated psychosocial factors (e.g., negative life events, perceived parenting style), and
      neuro-cognitive underpinning (e.g., executive functions) were also targeted. Standardized
      interview schedules, self-report scales, and cognitive tasks will be applied and the
      assessment will be held by the licensed clinical psychologist who receive training on the
      assessment and treatment of dissociative disorders. The results may enhance the understanding
      about the clinical features of dissociative disorders in Taiwan.
