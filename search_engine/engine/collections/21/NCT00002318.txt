      on day 1 and every 2 weeks for a total of six cycles. Kaposi's sarcoma lesions are evaluated
      prior to every cycle, at the end of the last treatment cycle, and 4 weeks following the end
      of the last treatment. Patients must agree to have one or more representative KS lesions
      biopsied.
