    
      our objective is evaluation of a connection between PH,PCO2,HCO3,PO2,Na,K,Glu and Lactate
      patterns in vacum drains of different plastic operational wounds and its relation to
      infections and seroma formation.

      it is possible that early changes in this values might point out an infection or seroma
      formation of a wound before clinical signs appear.
