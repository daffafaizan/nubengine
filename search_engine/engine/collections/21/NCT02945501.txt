      stimulation sequence consisting of a SO frequency stimulation (TES SO) using the NeuroConn DC
      Stimulator PLUS or a sham stimulation will be administered during the second hour of a two
      hour nocturnal sleep period. During wake period subjects will be tested using various
      cognitive, subjective and objective sleepiness and mood measures. Vital signs measurements
      will be taken to monitor general health issues. Up to 4 subjects will be enrolled per study
      session. Due to logistical reasons, no more then 2 subjects per session can be assigned to
      the TES SO group.

      Screening visit = approx. 2 hours At-home component = 7 days In-laboratory study period = 138
      hours Total in-laboratory period = approx. 138 hours per subject Total participation time (at
      home + in-laboratory components) = 15 days
