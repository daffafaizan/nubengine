      I. To evaluate the rate of increase in robotic segmentectomies performed at our institution
      per year.

      II. To evaluate the rate of typical and atypical segmentectomies performed at our institution
      per year.

      III. To characterize the differences in robotic versus other types of resections such as open
      and VATS (video-assisted thoracic surgery).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients' medical records are reviewed retrospectively.
