      (chemoradiation+immunotherapy group, observation group) after operation. Patients in
      chemoradiation+immunotherapy group will receive camrelizumab 200mg intravenously every 3
      weeks until clinical or radiographic disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, death,
      termination of the study or withdrawal. After 1 or 2 courses of camrelizumab, patients went
      on to receive capecitabine (1,330 mg/m2 per day, in divided doses twice daily, 7 days per
      week) concurrent with radiotherapy (45 Gy to regional lymph nodes and 54 to 59.4 Gy to
      preoperative tumor bed). Patients in observation group will not receive any anti-cancer
      therapy.
