    
      This study will sample urine provided by bladder cancer patients as part of their normal
      routine surveillance screening. No additional effort will be required from the patients and
      only modest additional effort from the study staff. Some de-identified patient medical
      information may also be requested, including concominant medications, relevant current or
      previous diseases, prior bladder cancer interventions and other relevant information to
      ensure there are no interfering substances or other confounders that could affect study
      results. There is no risk to patients as the normal diagnostics for bladder cancer will be
      followed.
