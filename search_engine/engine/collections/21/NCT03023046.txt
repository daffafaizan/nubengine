      I. To examine the potential efficacy of DA-EPOCH as front-line therapy for adults with acute
      lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (ALL).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety and feasibility of this regimen. II. To evaluate the
      progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of patients after receiving DA-EPOCH for
      newly-diagnosed ALL.

      III. To explore for novel genetic/genomic biomarkers of prognosis and response to treatment
      in adults with ALL.

      IV. To compare outcomes predicted by the presence or absence of minimal residual disease
      (MRD) as determined by either multiparameter flow cytometry (MFC) or high-throughput
      sequencing (HTS).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive etoposide intravenously (IV) over 96 hours, doxorubicin IV over 96 hours,
      and vincristine sulfate IV over 96 hours on days 1-4. Patients also receive cyclophosphamide
      IV over 1 hour on day 5 and prednisone orally (PO) twice a day (BID) on days 1-5. Patients
      with disease features that predict sensitivity to ABL kinase inhibitors (e.g., Philadelphia
      Chromosome positive (Ph+) [i.e., t(9;22)]; rearrangements involving PDGFRA, PDGFRB, ABL2, or
      other genetic lesions that activate kinase receptor signaling): imatinib mesylate or
      dasatinib PO once per day (QD) on days 1-14. The decision to add imatinib or dasatinib will
      be left to the treating physician and will be based on the available scientific literature to
      support the sensitivity of genomic alterations to these TKIs. Patients who are CD20+ also
      receive rituximab IV on day 1 or day 5. Cycles repeat every 21 days for up to 8 cycles in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and
      every 6 months for 3 years.
