      for treatment of HIV infection in children, either as an alternative to currently employed
      agents, or in combination therapy regimens. A liquid formulation of the drug is available;
      thus concurrent development of 1592U89 for children and adults is possible.

      In part 1, patients will receive 1592U89 monotherapy for 12 weeks. Patients will be assigned
      initially to a low dose of 1592U89 (Dose A). Those patients who tolerate the drug for at
      least six weeks without a toxicity of grade 3 or above attributable to study drug will have
      their 1592U89 dose increased (Dose B). If none of those patients experience a life
      threatening event attributable to study drug, subsequent enrollees will be assigned initially
      to Dose B. In part 2, each participant will be assigned randomly (1:1:1:1) within their age
      and Part 1 regimen stratum to one of the four agents: Zidovudine (ZDV), Stavudine (d4T),
      Didanosine (ddI) or Lamivudine (3TC) in combination with 1592U89.
