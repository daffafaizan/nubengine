      Response is monitored solely by testing serum prostate specific antigen (PSA), with
      biochemical failure following radiotherapy defined as a prostate specific antigen (PSA) level
      of 2 ng/ml above the nadir.

      T2 and Dynamic Contrast Enhanced (DCE) MRI have been shown to be able to detect the
      recurrence of prostate cancer following radiotherapy. Changes seen in Apparent Diffusion
      Coefficient (ADC) variables post-treatment have potential use in monitoring disease response
      to radiotherapy but the natural history of these changes during and after treatment remains
      uncertain and warrants further investigation.

      This study investigates the feasibility of using multi-parametric MRI (mpMRI) and novel
      diffusion-weighted sequences called VERDICT (Vascular, Extracellular and Restricted Diffusion
      for Cytometry in Tumours) at various stages during the treatment of prostate cancer with
      radiotherapy. Patients will be first scanned before androgen deprivation therapy (ADT)
      starts, then 3 weeks before the start of radiotherapy, again in week 6 of radiotherapy and
      once more 6 months after the end of radiotherapy. In addition, all patients entered into the
      study will already have had a mpMRI scan prior to prostate biopsy as part of their standard
      care.

      Multi-parametric MRI and VERDICT sequences may reveal changes in the tumour and normal
      prostate before a detectable PSA increase. This could allow for their use in response
      assessment following radiotherapy and androgen deprivation treatment. If such clinical
      utility is proven, referral for salvage treatment using High Intensity Focussed Ultrasound
      (HIFU), cryotherapy or salvage radical prostatectomy may be expedited.
