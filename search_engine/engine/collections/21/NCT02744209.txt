      the first cycle of Pembrolizumab therapy. White blood cells will be separated according to
      cluster of differentiation (CD) markers into CD4+, CD8+, CD14+ populations using magnetic
      beads. A portion of each cellular fraction will be stimulated in the lab with a
      lineage-specific agonist cocktail. Ribonucleic acid (RNA) will be purified from both
      unstimulated and stimulated cell populations from both pre- and post-therapy timepoints for
      each patient. Lineage-specific transcriptomes will be quantitated and used to derive gene
      expression profiles for comparisons to clinical phenotypes.
