      of the stage of liver fibrosis is of major importance for determining prognosis and
      therapeutic decisions. Liver biopsy is a costly and invasive technique with associated
      mortality and morbidity. A typical biopsy fragment represents only 1/50,000 of the organ.
      Several noninvasive radiological techniques have been investigated for the diagnosis of liver
      fibrosis and cirrhosis. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) is a
      particularly appealing method for the diagnosis of liver fibrosis. Because it is easy to
      implement, non-operator dependent, and process without the need for contrast agents. However,
      preliminary studies on small numbers of patients in which various hardware and sequencing
      profiles were used have reported inconsistent results for staging liver fibrosis with DW-MRI.
      The aims of this study are to evaluate correlation between stage of hepatic fibrosis and
      liver apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and normalized liver ADC with spleen assessed by
      DW-MRI in patients with chronic viral hepatitis B or C. Also, this study aim to evaluate
      factors that influence liver ADC and normalized liver ADC with spleen value for predicting
      the stage of liver fibrosis as well as to estimate the optimal cutoff values of DW-MRI for
      determining significant liver fibrosis (fibrosis stage ≥2) and advanced fibrosis (fibrosis
      stage ≥3).
