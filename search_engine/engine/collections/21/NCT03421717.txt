      peri-implantitits surgery. Traditionally, the maintenance has been performed by titanium
      curettes to remove microbiological deposits from the submucosal area.

      The Labrida biodegradable brush is a novel debridement device intended for use on dental
      implants. The concept of using a biodegradable material is related to the suggested problems
      with leaving remnants on the treated implant surface which would be negative from a bone
      regenerative aspect. The use of a flexible brush relates to the access problems when treating
      dental implants both related to the threads as well as due to the prosthetic supra
      construction hindering access for debridement with regular instruments developed for teeth.
      The material used in the brush will be Chitosan which is a natural polysaccharide, chitosan
      (poly-N-acetyl glucosaminoglycan), which is a nontoxic and bioabsorbable (REK-approval
      2012/791 polymer).

      H0: It is possible to maintain peri-implant health after surgical peri-implantitis treatment.
      There is no short- or long term clinical or radiographical differences between patients
      surgically treated for peri-implantitis maintained by the use of titanium cyrettes or with
      the Labrida brush in chair-side supportive care
