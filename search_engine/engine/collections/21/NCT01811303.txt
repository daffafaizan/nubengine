      replicated twice.

      Randomization: Subjects will be randomized to a Williams Latin square design balanced for
      treatment order.

      Washout: 2 days or more (may return on day 3)

      Run-in: High carbohydrate diet guidance (>150 g/d) 1 day before treatment, recommend same
      sized dinner the previous night (no food record collection required)

      Drop-outs: Subjects who have dropped out before visit 2 will be replaced by another subject
      randomized in their place (the new subject will complete all treatments)

      will consume the test product in a fasted state.
