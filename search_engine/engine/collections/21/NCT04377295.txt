      melanoma. The radiation maculopathy is characterized by the compromission of the macular
      microvasculature that can lead to the leakage, lipid exudates, hemorrhages, teleangiectasie,
      macular edema, non perfusion areas with consequent significant impaiment of visual acuity.

      Ranibizumab is a vascular endothelial growth factor antagonist and it represents an efficacy
      treatment acting on vascular hyperpermeability. The optical coherence tomography and optical
      coherence tomography angiography represent novel and non-invasive diagnostic techniques that
      allow a detailed analysis of retinal and vascular features. The study evaluates the changes
      in optical coherence tomography and optical coherence tomography angiography parameters at
      baseline and after intravitreal injections of Ranibizumab at the last follow up to one year
      in patients affected by radiation maculopathy.
