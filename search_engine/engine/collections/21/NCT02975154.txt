      Microcurrent therapy on pain and physical function in patients with osteoarthritis of the
      knee. The secondary objective is to compare the effects of different currents. Patients will
      be randomized to four groups: Group 1 and 2 both will receive Microcurrent Therapy, but
      different currents will be used. Group 3 will receive treatment with the Microcurrent
      treatment apparatus, but without any current. Group 4 will be a control group without
      specific intervention.

      Group 1, 2 and 3 will receive 10 sessions of treatment in a treatment phase of four weeks.
      Assessments for group 1, 2, and 3 will be scheduled for screening (T0), at the first day of
      treatment (T1), at the end of treatment (T2) and three months after the end of treatment
      (T3). Group 4 will be assessed at a screening visit T0, at T1, at T2 (approximately 21 days
      after T1), and at T3 (three months after T2). Patients will be recruited based on the records
      of the clinic.
