      patients, and left untreated can lead to severe visual loss and blindness. While systemic
      administration of DHPG has been shown to be an effective treatment for CMV retinitis, the
      chronic administration required may be complicated by decreased blood cell counts
      (granulocytopenia) which may require discontinuation of treatment. While withholding
      treatment may allow recovery from the granulocytopenia, interruption of therapy may result in
      reactivation of the retinitis. Injection of DHPG into the vitreous cavity of the eye may be
      of benefit to severely neutropenic patients with CMV retinitis.

      Patients must have active CMV retinitis in one or both eyes, despite prior systemic therapy.
      Following medical evaluation, the decision is made whether to treat the eye(s) immediately or
      to watch the eye(s) carefully for advancement of the retinitis. Eyes with sight-threatening
      lesions or eyes without functional vision are treated immediately and eyes without
      sight-threatening lesions are randomly chosen for either immediate or deferred therapy. DHPG
      is given by injection with a very fine needle twice a week for the first 3 weeks and once a
      week for the remaining 24 weeks.
