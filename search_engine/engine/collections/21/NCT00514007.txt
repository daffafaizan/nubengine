      The study will open with the QD schedule, with initiation of the BID schedule occurring after
      observation of clinically significant related toxicity â‰¥ grade 2 in the QD schedule.

      Dosing will be initiated on Day 1 with daily dosing (either QD or BID) continuing for 21
      days.

      Once the recommended phase 2 dose has been determined for the BID schedule, 2 expansion
      cohorts will be opened: 1) Biomarker Expansion Cohort in patients with locally advanced or
      metastatic colorectal cancer and 2) Diabetic Expansion Cohort in patients with advanced solid
      tumors who have active Type 2 diabetes mellitus not requiring insulin or insulinotropic
