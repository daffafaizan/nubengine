    
      Twenty subjects in total will participate in this study. Subjects will be randomized to
      focused-attention meditation training with or without the neurofeedback device, MUSE.
      Subjects will be asked to practice ~10 min of daily meditation for 6-8 weeks.
      Neuropsychological testing will be performed at the beginning of the study and after six
      weeks of training. At this time point, those randomized to the non-MUSE group will be given a
      device and asked to train for an additional two weeks. At the conclusion of the study, all
      subjects will also undergo a brief telephone or in-person exit interview regarding their
      experiences using the MUSE device.
