      to assess the effectiveness of the investigational drugs DSM265 or OZ439 in reducing
      parasitemia. Transmission blocking activity of DSM265 (in P. falciparum infection; cohort 1
      only) and infectivity to vector mosquitoes prior to drug treatment (in P. vivax infection;
      cohort 2 and 3) will also be assessed. This study will be conducted in up to three cohorts (n
      = 8 per cohort), and will be divided into 2 parts. In Part A (cohort 1) the efficacy of a
      single administration of 400 mg DSM265 for the clearance of asexual blood stages of P.
      falciparum will be determined. Activity of a second single dose of 400 mg DSM265 against
      gametocytes will be assessed in this cohort only if sexual stages are identified by PCR
      following the initial drug treatment. In Part B, subjects will be infected with P. vivax by
      IBSM, then treated with a single 200 mg dose OZ439 (cohort 2) or 400 mg dose of DSM265
      (cohort 3). For cohort 2, if recrudescence occurs following initial drug treatment with 200
      mg OZ439, then affected participants who reach the treatment threshold will receive a single
      400 mg dose of OZ439. The PK/PD relationship following drug treatment will be determined in
      order to further characterize the antimalarial activity of the investigational drug in the
      IBSM system using P. falciparum (for cohort 1; 400 mg DSM265) or P. vivax (for cohort 2, 200
      mg OZ439; cohort 3, 400 mg DSM265).

      The treatment effects on gametocytemia (if sexual blood stages are detected by PCR) and
      transmission blocking activity of DSM265 will be investigated as a secondary objective for
      cohort 1 (P. falciparum infection). Prior to drug treatment, the infectivity of P. vivax IBSM
      infection to vector mosquitoes will also be investigated as a secondary objective for Part B,
      cohorts 2 and 3. The exposures achieved with the doses proposed for DSM265 used in Part A and
      DSM265 or OZ439 in Part B are associated with a safety profile which is well described from
      previous studies and significantly below the maximum tolerated exposures reported for either
      drug.
