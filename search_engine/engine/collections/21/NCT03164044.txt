      diagnostics of IgE-mediated allergy to antibiotics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
      (NSAIDs). Among commonly used CD63/CD203c markers, newly proposed molecules, such as CD69,
      CD107a, CD164, CD13, CD11b and CD300a will be assayed. Results obtained together with the
      other clinical data will be used to calculate sensitivity and specificity of the method.
