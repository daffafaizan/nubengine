      want visible orthodontic appliances. Recently, lingual orthodontic treatment outcomes have
      become similar and comparable to those produced with labial orthodontic treatment. However,
      placement of orthodontic brackets on the lingual surfaces of teeth causes changes in their
      morphology, which results in articulation problems, chewing difficulties, tongue irritation
      and other impairments. In this respect, the main difference between the labial and lingual
      techniques is the distance between the point of application of the force that is transmitted
      through the bracket and the centre of resistance of the tooth. Consequently, the displacement
      and stress induced in bone by these two techniques will also differ, and these need to be
      evaluated so that useful comparisons can be made between these two techniques. Patients who
      have moderate crowding that could be treated without extraction will be treated in this study
      using either lingual or labial fixed orthodontic appliances. All patients will receive a
      cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) scan in two different times (T0: before treatment, T1:
      after treatment). The dentoalveolar changes will be assessed.
