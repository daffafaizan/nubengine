      under physiologic stress, correlate with myocardial flow reserve as measured in low spatial
      resolution nuclear SPECT scans. Secondary hypothesis is that stress perfusion as quantified
      with bolus height corrected gadofosveset trisodium images, better correlate with SPECT
      perfusion than uncorrected, relative perfusion values.

      The investigators propose implementing the scan protocol using a 1.5T or 3.0T MRI scanner.
      The investigators will scan a series of 20 patients recruited from the nuclear stress lab at
      Northwestern Memorial Hospital. These subjects will be approached and enrolled into a HIPPA
      Compliant, IRB approved research study to assess the effectiveness of myocardial perfusion
      and blood volume images to measure myocardial blood volume. Subjects will be scanned with a
      modified version of the clinical stress-perfusion protocol. Correlation analysis will be used
      to test the hypothesis that quantitative blood volume is an indicator of myocardial flow
      reserve.
