      on pain management in this population. Current optimal HNCA pain control usually requires the
      use of a strong opioid (WHO-ladder step 3), increasing the risk of opioid side effects and
      toxicities. Gabapentin, originally an anticonvulsant drug, has been effectively used
      off-label to treat multiple neuropathic pain syndromes such as cancer pain, and has been
      suggested to reduce the need for high doses of strong opioids in HNCA patients under
      radio(chemo)therapy. A multi-centre, phase III, double-blind, randomised-controlled trial
      will be set up randomising patients between the experimental group (E) receiving gabapentin,
      or the control group (C) receiving a matching placebo, both in addition to standard analgesic
      therapy (steps 2 and 3 on WHO-ladder). The investigators aim to establish if addition of
      gabapentin is more effective in reducing the need to start (or dosage-increase) a strong
      opioid for HNCA pain than a matching placebo additional to standard pain management
      (WHO-ladder step 2 and 3), in HNCA patients scheduled for a curative 7-week
      radio(chemo)therapy course.
