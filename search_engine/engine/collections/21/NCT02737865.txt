    
      1. To evaluate the detection rate of 'spoke-wheel sign' on CEUS using sonazoid and SMI
           (primary outcome).

           Each US findings during exam for patients with FNH were recorded by radiologist. The
           results were interpreted by consensus using 4 scale bar.

           0. Absence of 'spoke-wheel sign'

             1. Mild suspicious of 'spoke-wheel sign'

             2. Highly suspicious of 'spoke-wheel sign'

             3. Definite "spoke-wheel sign'

        2. To evaluated the accuracy of size measurement for FNH on gray-scale US and SMI
           (reference standard: CEUS using sonazoid).

           To calculate the measurement error between each method and CEUS using sonazoid on US
           images using measurement of maximum diameter of tumor.

        3. Sample size calculation according to the primary outcome.

      Expecting the detection rate of "spoke-wheel sign" on SMI, 20% (known detection rate on CEUS
      using sonazoid, 23.5%), a sample size of 62 patients was required using 95% confidence
      interval.
