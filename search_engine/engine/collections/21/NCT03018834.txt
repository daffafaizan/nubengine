    
      It is a Double Blind Randomized clinical trial Phase IIb of superiority, enrolling two
      groups: one group treated with the standard of care, defined as the maximum tolerated dosage
      of any beta blockers and ACE, and placebo versus ANAKINRA in addition to the standard of care
      in patients treated for an acute Myocarditis.

      Patients will be randomized to receive ANAKINRA 100 mg/daily or placebo subcutaneously once a
      day until hospital discharge, for a maximum of 14 days, in addition to standard care: ACE and
      Beta-blocker for 6 months. Randomization 1:1 will be conducted centrally using the electronic
      Case Report Form (eCRF).

      As an exploratory analysis, a second randomization for ACE discontinuation in patients
      without left ventricular dysfunction (LVEF > 50%) at one month post discharge will be
      performed.

      One group will stopped the treatment at one month and the second group will continued the ACE
      for 6 months. This second randomization is in open label.
