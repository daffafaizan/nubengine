      the Intensive care unit (ICU). Treatment of these patients is complex. Evidence based
      therapies that can improve survival exist; however, implementation is extremely inconsistent.
      As a potential solution to this problem, the investigators developed the Treatment of
      Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure (HRF) and ARDS with Protection, Paralysis, and Proning
      (TheraPPP) Pathway to reduce practice variation and improve adherence to evidence-informed
      therapy.

      The TheraPPP pathway is a comprehensive evidence-based, stakeholder-informed pathway for the
      diagnosis and management of HRF. The overall objective of the pathway is to improve the
      quality of care for patients with HRF. The specific objectives are to evaluate:

        1. Effectiveness of the pathway. A cost-effectiveness analysis is a secondary objective.

        2. Implementation of the pathway by conducting a process evaluation which will assess
           fidelity of the delivered interventions and clinician perceptions about the
           acceptability of the pathway.

      Mechanically ventilated patients admitted to any one of 17 adult ICUs in Alberta will receive
      the intervention. One ICU (Calgary) is the setting for a pilot study (NCT04070053).

      For data analysis, the investigators will use chart abstraction to quantitatively assess the
      fidelity of the delivered intervention, and surveys and focus groups to qualitatively assess
      clinician perceptions about the acceptability of the pathway. Fidelity of the intervention
      will be tracked using process of care indicators that reflect the five key steps of the
      pathway.
