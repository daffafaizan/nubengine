        -  To evaluate day +35 ANC engraftment in autologous stem cell transplantation for high
           risk pediatric malignancies after stem cell selection and immunotherapy.

      Secondary Objectives

        -  To estimate incidence of relapse, disease-free survival and overall survival.

        -  To characterize lymphocyte and hematopoietic reconstitution in these patients.

        -  To describe the characteristics of the stem cell and natural killer cell grafts.

        -  To estimate the overall survival of patients treated without stem cell manipulation or
           NK cell infusion due to off therapy criteria
