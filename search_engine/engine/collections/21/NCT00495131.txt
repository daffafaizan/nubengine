      sustained virologic response (SVR) rate in approximately 31-47% of treatment naïve patients
      with chronic hepatitis C.(1-5) Patients with genotype 1 virus infection are less likely to
      have SVR that those with other genotypes infection, and therefore, patients infected with
      hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1 should receive treatment for 48 weeks.(6) Recently,
      combination therapy with pegylated interferon alfa (pegylated IFN-α) plus ribavirin produces
      higher SVR rates (54-56%) than that with IFN-α plus ribavirin.(7,8) Furthermore, a large
      trial assessing the effect and duration of pegylated IFN-α plus ribavirin showed that the
      overall SVR rate was 63%. Among patients with genotype 1 HCV infection, standard dose
      ribavirin (1000 to 1200 mg per day) and 48 weeks of treatment were significantly more
      effective than low dose ribavirin (800 mg per day) or 24 weeks of treatment.(9) The SVR rate
      was 51% for genotype 1 patients receiving pegylated IFN-α plus standard dose ribavirin for 48
      weeks, whereas only 29% and 41% for those receiving pegylated IFN-α plus low dose ribavirin
      and standard dose ribavirin for 24 weeks, respectively. Based on these lines of evidence, 48
      weeks of therapy with pegylated IFN-α (pegylated IFN-α 2a 180 μg or pegylated IFN-α 2b 1.5 μg
      per kilogram body weight weekly) plus ribavirin (1000 to 1200 mg per day) is recommended to
      treat patients with HCV genotype 1 infection.(10) In Taiwan, a multicenter study showed that
      a 6 month course treatment with pegylated IFN-α plus standard dose ribavirin had a comparable
      SVR rate to that with IFN-α plus standard dose ribavirin (67.1% versus 63.6%) in patients
      with chronic hepatitis C. Subgroup analysis showed that treatment with pegylated IFN-α plus
      standard dose ribavirin had a significantly higher SVR rate to that with IFN-α plus standard
      dose ribavirin (65.8% versus 41.0%) in patients with genotype 1 HCV infection.(11) Recently,
      a pilot study comparing 24 and 48 weeks of pegylated IFN-α plus standard dose ribavirin in
      patients with genotype 1 HCV infection showed that 48 weeks of treatment is more efficacious
      that 24 weeks of treatment (SVR rate: 80.0% versus 48.9%).(12) However, much difference of
      SVR rates occurred in these two studies, making optimal therapy in Taiwanese patients
      infected with genotype 1 HCV difficult to be determined. In the study, we aim to investigate
      in a large cohort whether 48 weeks treatment with pegylated IFN-α plus standard dose
      ribavirin is more efficacious than 24 weeks treatment in patients with genotype 1 HCV
      infection.
