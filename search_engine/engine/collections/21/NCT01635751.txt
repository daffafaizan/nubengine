      swell and draw a sufficient amount of water, plus a highly water - soluble middle layer that
      rapidly draw water into the tablet core simultaneously.

      The water drawn into the tablet (about 3 to 4 times the weight of the tablet itself)
      functions as an additional media which enables additional and later drug release out of the
      dosage form. This serves to overcome the shortage of surrounding media that has been reported
      to be one of the key reasons for malabsorption of a drug in colon.

      As the middle layer induces a rapid water draw into the tablet core, the penetrated water
      also diffuses to the upper and lower layers, which makes the tablet to rapidly swell and
      controls drug release.

      At virtually the same time, the swollen upper and lower layers form to surround a lateral
      side of the middle layer, which can, in turn, further control drug release.

      This relatively rigid swollen matrix structure makes drug release not affected by surrounding
      mechanical flux, which can provide relatively consistent in vivo drug release irrespective of
      degree of gastrointestinal motility.
