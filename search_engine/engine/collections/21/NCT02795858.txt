      safety and effectiveness of ramucirumab in advanced, progressive carcinoid tumors.

      Cancer cells can make growth factors that cause the abnormal growth of new blood vessels.
      Ramucirumab is an investigational drug which works by blocking a receptor for a vascular
      growth factor, thereby preventing new blood vessels from forming. This may stop the cancer
      from growing or spreading and the tumor cells may die.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved Ramucirumab for treatment of
      Carcinoid Tumors.
