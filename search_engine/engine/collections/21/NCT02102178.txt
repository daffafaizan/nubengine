      individuals to adapt to the difficulties that result from advanced disease. In this form of
      therapy, the use of certain manual play activities are highlighted as a working tool, with
      the aim of intervening in relation to the limitations and/or physical and psychological
      diseases. Such interventions may transform some of these patients' interests in life,
      facilitate the development of undiscovered talents and skills and allow them to discover
      their artistic, artisanal or physical potentials.

      The role and interventions of occupational therapy within palliative care are wide-ranging
      and challenging, with a vocation to help individuals to value the remainder of their lives
      and live for the present moment in the best way possible, through providing options for them
      to keep themselves in a physical and emotional condition that allows them to carry out
      activities that would be gratifying and stimulating. The effects from this will assist them
      in preparing for the end of life with more dignity and respect.

      The relevance of occupational therapy interventions in relation to oncology and, in
      particular, palliative care has been little studied. However, it is known that this may
      contribute towards improving the quality of life in interpersonal relationships and
      diminishing pain and distress, through providing guidance regarding activities of daily
      living and through the use of therapeutic activities, especially in relation to
      hospitalization processes.
