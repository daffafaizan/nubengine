      an oral food challenge (OFC) to pHWF in each subject. Subjects who pass the challenge will be
      placed on pHWF for 2 years. Subjects who do not pass the challenge will receive routine care.
      The investigators will perform allergy skin testing, specific IgE measurement, other
      serologic assays, and longitudinal OFCs to profile subject characteristics in the two groups
      at baseline and over time.
