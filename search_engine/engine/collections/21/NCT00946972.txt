      drug), placebo-controlled (substance containing no medication), study in male and female
      volunteers with type 2 diabetes mellitus. For each volunteer, the study consists of a
      screening phase (up to 45 days), a run-in phase during which volunteers discontinue their
      oral anti-hyperglycemic drugs (21 to 35 days), a treatment phase during which volunteers will
      continue to be off their anti-hyperglycemic drugs and receive daily study drug (JNJ-38431055
      or placebo) for 14 days, and a follow-up phase (10 days). After the follow-up phase,
      volunteers will restart their oral anti-hyperglycemic drugs. The following safety evaluations
      will be taken throughout the study: Electrocardiogram (an ECG is a painless procedure that
      gives a picture of the electrical activity of the heart), blood pressure, heart rate, and
      blood samples for laboratory tests. The primary outcomes will be safety and tolerability of
      JNJ-38431055 and 24-hour weighted mean glucose concentrations after 14 days of dosing with
      JNJ-38431055. Study drug will be administered as daily doses for 14 days. The two treatments
      will be JNJ-38431055 and placebo.
