      stem/stromal cell function, kidney function, markers of inflammation, and physical function
      in individuals with advanced chronic kidney disease, particularly diabetic kidney disease.
      This study will involve a single 2-day oral treatment regimen with fisetin or placebo. Study
      subjects will be randomized 2:1 to study drug or placebo. Study visits will consist of blood,
      urine, and abdominal wall skin and subcutaneous fat samplings in addition to testing of
      physical strength at given time points. Subjects will be followed for a total of 12 months.
