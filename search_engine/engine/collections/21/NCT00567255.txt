      is associated with greater weight loss than naltrexone alone, bupropion SR alone or placebo
      in subjects with uncomplicated obesity. The current study investigated the safety and
      efficacy of the combination of naltrexone SR and bupropion SR compared to placebo in obese
      subjects with uncomplicated obesity and in those with overweight/obesity and hypertension
      and/or dyslipidemia.
