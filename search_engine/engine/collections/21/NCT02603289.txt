      replace conventional wire and bracket technology for many orthodontic cases. Each custom
      manufactured aligner exerts gentle, continuous forces to move teeth incrementally from their
      original state to a final, treated state. The aligners are designed to optimally move each
      tooth at a speed that follows physiologic principles. The purpose of this study is to
      demonstrate that changing aligners weekly provides similar results to changing aligners every
      two weeks.
