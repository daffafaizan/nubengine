      percent per year. Myocardial infarction (heart attack) as a complication of stroke adds to
      stroke death and disability. Because homocysteine may be a major contributor to stroke, its
      reduction by appropriate intervention with vitamin supplements could reduce the impact of
      recurrent stroke, myocardial infarction, and vascular death. The purpose of this trial is to
      determine whether a multivitamin containing high-dose folic acid, pyridoxine, and
      cyanocobalamin, in addition to best medical/surgical management and risk factor modification,
      reduces the recurrence of stroke or occurrence of myocardial infarction in stroke patients
      with elevated homocysteine levels.
