      issue of debate. By capturing drinking trajectories over time, we may be equipped to obtain
      new insights into this relationship. Studies have shown that such trajectories have
      differential associations for intermediate traits (carotid intima-media thickness, pulse wave
      velocity and inflammatory markers), but no studies exist that link stability of drinking to
      actual CHD. The current study will employ a longitudinal cohort design to evaluate the
      association between long-term alcohol consumption trajectories and time-to-event for CHD.
      Data will be drawn from six cohorts (five British, one French). The combined participant pool
      comprises 64,926 individuals (58% male, individual cohort sizes ranging from 1,444 to 25,636
      participants); those with a baseline history of CHD will be excluded. Repeat alcohol intake
      measurements across a 10-year interval will be the exposure, with participants' intake
      trajectory defined according to their alcohol consumption volume and its consistency over
      time. To account for heterogeneity across cohorts, individual participant data meta-analysis
      methods will be employed in determining CHD diagnosis rates and hazard ratios for the
      different intake trajectories, with adjustment for relevant demographic and clinical
      characteristics. Results from the modelling work illustrating the form and magnitude of the
      association between the alcohol intake categories and CHD will be presented.

      This work will help further understanding of the role that alcohol intake and its stability
      over time play in subsequent CHD risk, and will have implications for our understanding of
      alcohol's relationship to cardiovascular health in the general population.
