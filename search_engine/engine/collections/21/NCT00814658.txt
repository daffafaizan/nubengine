      6-month, multicenter, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the combination of galantamine
      with nimodipine in patients with mixed dementia on cognition and quality of life. The target
      dose of galantamine is 24 mg/day and nimodipine will be taken in fixed doses of 90 mg/day.
      Primary outcomes will be measured by a computerized battery of neuropsychological tests and
      Quality of Life (QoL) scores. Secondary outcomes will be measured by ADAS-cog, Clinical
      Global Impression (CGI) and Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). Mixed dementia (Alzheimer's
      Disease (AD) associated with cerebrovascular disease) is one of the most common causes of
      dementia, which remain largely underdiagnosed. Little is known about specific treatments for
      this condition. Ischemic lesions by themselves seem to play an important role in cognitive
      impairment, even in the presence of AD pathology. Hypotheses: - Galantamine 16-24 mg/day in
      combination with nimodipine 90 mg/day is superior to galantamine monotherapy (16-24 mg/day)
      in improving or stabilizing cognition in patients with AD associated with cerebrovascular
      disease (mixed dementia), as measured by the CNTB at 6 months. - Galantamine 16-24 mg/day in
      combination with nimodipine 90 mg/day is superior to galantamine monotherapy (16-24 mg/day)
      on QoL measures in this population as measured by QoL - AD at 6 months. Group 1: galantamine
      oral 8mg/day for a month, 16mg/day for 4 weeks and after 24mg/day until end of study plus
      nimodipine oral 30mg tid during all study. Group 2: Group 1: galantamine oral 8mg/day for a
      month, 16mg/day for 4 weeks and after 24mg/day until end of study plus placebo oral 30mg tid
      during all study.
