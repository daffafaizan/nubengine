      dietary intake; and 2) examine the relationship between metabolites that reflect dietary
      intake and kidney disease progression. This secondary data analysis leverages the completed
      Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) study, a randomized clinical trial of dietary
      protein restriction (N=840).
