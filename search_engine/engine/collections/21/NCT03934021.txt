      will be recruited in the study.

      After the informed consent, their first bowel opening will be collected for storage. They
      will also receive assessment by the stroke team at 3 and 6 months to determine their outcomes
      (NIHSS and mRS). Clinically and radiologically parameters including their degree of
      disability, imaging findings will also be collected to determine whether there are any
      correlations with the stool microbiota composition against matched individuals.
