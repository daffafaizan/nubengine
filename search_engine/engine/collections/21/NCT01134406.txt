      of osteoarthritis symptoms, compared to a commercial control, as assessed by the WOMAC
      Osteoarthritis Index.

      The WOMAC Osteoarthritis Index is a validated assessment instrument that is self-administered
      and designed to subjectively elicit patient symptoms of osteoarthritis in the knee in the
      areas of pain, stiffness, and physical function. The WOMAC Osteoarthritis Index with its Pain
      Subscale has been used extensively as an effectiveness endpoint in clinical trials of
