      modeling reconstruction may lead to an evaluation of the coronary artery anatomy that
      approximates more correctly the real anatomy, thus subsequently leading to a more tailored
      diagnosis and therapy for the patients with ischemic heart disease.

      Aim of the current study is to assess whether a 3-D model of the coronary tree offers a less
      foreshortened and less operator-dependent evaluation of the length of the coronary arteries
      with respect to standard coronary angiography. Furthermore, for the first time "in-vivo", a
      comparison with the "real" length of the vessel will be performed using as "gold standard" an
      intra-coronary guide-wire with radiopaque markers at fixed and known distance one from the
      other along its distal part.
