      demonstrate that (1) Chinese medicine prescription "Wu Zhu Yu Tang" can prevent Acute
      Mountain Sickness(AMS) (2) "Wu Zhu Yu Tang" can prevent AMS especially for Yang-Xu body
      constitution.

      We will randomize 240 unacclimatized healthy adults. They will be randomized after
      stratification of the Yang-Xu score and the AMS history to receive Chinese medicine during
      one ascent and placebo during the other ascent. We will take them in Hehuan mountain for two
      days hike (24 hours) and an overnight over 3,000m. One month before the study, the subjects
      will fill the "Body Constitution Questionnaire BCQ" in order to evaluate their body
      constitution. Before, during and after the two days hike we will measure their blood
      pressure, heart rate and arterial oxygen saturation. The incidence of AMS will be measured by
      the Lake Louise Self Report (Lake Louise Score â‰¥4 with headache), we will also report the
      Lake Louise Clinical Assessment score and Lake Louise Functional Score.
