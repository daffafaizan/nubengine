      everolimus monotherapy preserves renal function and is associated with a lower acute
      rejection rate.

      We wish to assess whether the introduction of a de novo immunosuppression everolimus under
      protection of basiliximab induction, mycophenolate mofetil and then low doses of
      corticosteroids, reduces the nephrotoxicity of immunosuppressive therapy in liver transplant
      patients, compared to a standard protocol with tacrolimus associated with mycophenolate
      mofetil and low dose corticosteroids.
