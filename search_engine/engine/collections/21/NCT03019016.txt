    
      This is a multi-center, retrospective chart review study of all consecutive cases of right
      colectomy performed by participating surgeons at their respective institutions that meet all
      inclusion and exclusion criteria. All cases of right colectomy performed with intracorporeal
      or extracorporeal anastomoses or via laparoscopic or robotic platforms that meet the study
      inclusion and exclusion criteria, will be considered for inclusion. The chart review will be
      performed in a reverse chronological order starting at a minimum of 30 days prior to IRB
      approval of the study at the site until the number of robotic-assisted and laparoscopic cases
      to be included per surgeon has been met. Study initiation at the participating site will
      occur once a research agreement has been executed between Intuitive Surgical and the
      participating Institution/Investigator and IRB approval has been obtained.

      It is anticipated that the retrospective chart review will span the period between January 1,
      2010 through 30-days prior to IRB approval of the study in 2016. Baseline patient
      characteristics, perioperative and post-operative short term clinical and pathological
      outcomes, and incisional hernia data will be obtained from hospital records for a total of up
      to approximately 1000 robotic and laparoscopic cases, among the 4 subgroups: robotic-assisted
      right colectomy with intracorporeal anastomosis (RRCIA), robotic-assisted right colectomy
      with extracorporeal anastomosis (RRCEA), laparoscopic right colectomy with intracorporeal
      anastomosis (LRCIA) and laparoscopic right colectomy with extracorporeal anastomosis (RRCEA).
      Since the data will have been de-identified, and is archival in nature, there will be no
      active subject recruitment.
