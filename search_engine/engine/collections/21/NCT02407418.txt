      for alleviating acute and chronic musculoskeletal complaints. This form of treatment is also
      delivered to enhance the performance and augment the rehabilitation of athletes. However,
      despite research findings alleging the strength-modulating effects of spinal manipulation
      alongside numerous professional athletes' positive anecdotal claims concerning its results,
      the physiological processes to explain its effects remain largely unexplained. Therefore, the
      purpose of this work was to investigate the effects of spinal manipulation in a college-aged
      sample population.

      This study examined the effect of spinal manipulation delivered to the lumbosacral region on
      concentric force production of the knee extensors and flexors. A randomized, controlled,
      single-blind repeated measures design was utilized with 21 subjects. Isometric and isokinetic
      peak torques (Nm) were recorded during two separate session while subjects performed maximal
      voluntary contractions post-treatment of either spinal manipulation or a sham manipulation.
