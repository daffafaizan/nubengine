    
      A prospective randomized open-label study that will evaluate the effectiveness of the pliable
      and absorbable bone hemostats (BoneSeal®) composed of synthetic materials and hydroxyapatite
      on the reduction of bleeding from the sternal bone marrow in patients undergoing Coronary
      Artery Bypass Grafting, with or without valve replacement or repair. This product will be
      compared to the similar, currently used product, Ostene®. Bleeding will be evaluated
      qualitatively by the surgeon as well as quantitatively by comparing pre- and post-operative
      hemoglobin levels, intra-operative and post-operative blood product usage, and post-operative
      chest tube output. A 30 day follow-up will be conducted to evaluate the patient's tolerance
      of the product, possible complications, or infection. Additionally, surgeons will be asked to
      comment on the ease of use of the product.
