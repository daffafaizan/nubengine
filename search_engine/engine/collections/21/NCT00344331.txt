    
      Niemann-Pick Tyoe C disease (NPC) is an autosomal recessive, lysosomal storage disorder
      characterized by accumulation of cholesterol and gangliosides. NPC is a rare (estimated
      prevalence of 1:120,000-150,000) neurodegenerative disorder with a wide clinical spectrum and
      a variable age of onset. Classically, children with NPC demonstrate neurological dysfunction
      with cerebellar ataxia, dysarthria, seizures, vertical gaze palsy, motor impairment,
      dysphagia, psychotic episodes, and progressive dementia. In general, adolescent and adult
      onset forms have a more insidious onset and slower progression.

      There is no effective treatment for NPC and it is a lethal disorder. A major impediment to
      the testing of therapeutic interventions is the lack of well-defined outcome measures. The
      purpose of this protocol is to obtain both baseline and rate of progression data on clinical
      and biochemical markers that may later be used as an outcome measure in a clinical trial.
