    
      To evaluate the effect of evolocumab, patients who are taking Evolocumab plus another
      cholesterol-lowering medication (e.g statins), will undergo diagnostic testing including
      non-invasive coronary CT angiographic (CCTA) scans and positron emission tomography (PET)
      scans. The CCTA and PET scans will be done before and after being treated with evolocumab.

      At the initial visit, standard imaging eligibility screening will take place, as well as
      blood sampling to test cholesterol levels and presence of proteins (biomarkers) associated
      with heart disease. A CCTA will be done (if not done for clinical purposes within the past 90
      days) and a PET scan with administration of 18F-NaF injection will take place. Patients will
      receive the first injection of evolocumab and will be taught how to self-inject once or twice
      a month for 18 months.

      After the initial visit, patients will self-inject evolocumab at approximately 6, 12 and 18
      months in front of a medical professional for site monitoring and re-training. Labs will be
      drawn to assess blood components related to heart disease.

      Follow-up phone calls will be made at approximately 1,3, 9, 15 months and approximately 3-7
      days after their final on-site visit (18 months) to monitor safety and drug adherence.

      The final visit (18 months after the initial visit) will involve another PET scan, CCTA and
      blood collection for biomarker testing.
