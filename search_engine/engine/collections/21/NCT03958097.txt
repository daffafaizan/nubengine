      at the time of diagnosis, and the overall prognosis is poor. Currently, patients with
      advanced non-small cell lung cancer are treated individually according to the molecular and
      histological features of the tumor. For patients with negative driver mutation in EGFR, ALK,
      ROS1, BRAF and other driving genes, platinum-based dual chemotherapy combined with PD-1/PD-L1
      monoclonal antibody is recommended for first-line treatment. In patients who have not used
      PD-1/PD-L1 antibody in first-line therapy, the second-line treatment regimen is the first
      choice for the recommended single-agent PD1/PD-L1 antibody. However, the current efficacy of
      PD-1/PD-L1 antibody for second-line treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer is
      limited, only between 15-20%. NK cells secrete IFN to promote the expression of PD-L1 in
      tumor cells and enhance the role of PD-1 inhibitors. At the same time, PD-1 antibodies can
      bind to NK cell surface PD-1, prevent NK cell depletion, and enhance NK cell anti-tumor.
      Therefore, the application of NK cells combined with PD-1 antibody in the treatment of
      patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer may achieve better results.
