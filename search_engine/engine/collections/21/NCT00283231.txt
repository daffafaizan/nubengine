      RESPeRATE in 12 healthy peri- or postmenopausal women between 40 and 60 years old who report
      experiencing at least 4 hot flashes per day or 30 hot flashes per week. Participants will be
      screened by telephone, then attend a clinic visit for further screening, and a baseline visit
      for final eligibility assessment and to learn how to use the RESPeRATE. Participants will
      receive information about the use of the RESPeRATE and paced respiration from a trained staff
      member and practice using the RESPeRATE during the clinic visit. Participants will also be
      instructed how to record hot flashes in a diary. The intervention will consist of using the
      RESPeRATE device for 15 minutes daily. Outcomes will be assessed in the clinic after 3 weeks
      and 6 weeks use of the device. The main efficacy outcomes are change in number of hot flashes
      per week and change in hot flash score (number of flashes x mean severity) from baseline to 3
      and 6 weeks post-training, reported on the 7-day diary. Frequency of hot flashes will also be
      measured at baseline and 6 weeks using a 24-hour ambulatory hot flash monitor. Change in
      breathing rate will be calculated from baseline to 3 and 6 weeks and changes in sleep and
      quality of life from baseline to 6 weeks as measured by validated self-administered
      questionnaires. The mechanism of response to the RESPeRATE will be explored by measuring
      blood pressure at baseline, 3 weeks and 6 weeks and, body mass index and 24-hour levels of
      urinary epinephrine, norepinephrine and cortisol at baseline and 6 weeks. We will also draw a
      fasting blood sample at baseline and 6 weeks to measure serum lipids, glucose and insulin.
