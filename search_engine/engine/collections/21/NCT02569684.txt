      design compared to maltodextrin as placebo. Additional outcome measures: blood glucose,
      insulin, GLP-2, ghrelin, PYY and leptin after a standardized mixed meal test. Also measured
      changes in microbiota composition and SCFA in feces before and after intervention/placebo
      periods, and subjective measures of appetite.
