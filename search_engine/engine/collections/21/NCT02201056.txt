      600, 900 and not to exceed 1350 mg in subsequent cohorts.

      This single-center trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall time to
      participate in this study is up to 51 days. Participants will make 2 visits to the clinic,
      including one 7-day period of confinement to the clinic. All participants will be contacted
