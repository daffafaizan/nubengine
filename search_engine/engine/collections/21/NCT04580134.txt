      responsive to the pharmacological properties of clozapine because they have low Intrinsic EEG
      Activity (IEA), an index of compromised cortical neuronal responsiveness. This is plausibly
      associated with both (ii) reduced excitatory and (iii) reduced inhibitory stimulation in
      cortex and that IEA will track this altered excitatory/inhibitory balance and parallel
      clinical antipsychotic response. Furthermore, (iv) B2 probands (based on their high IEA) will
      not respond to clozapine. In this study clozapine response is measured by a 'super-APD'
      (AntiPsychotic Drug) drug response, a response in addition to what is seen with a usual APD
      (e.g., risperidone). The investigators believe that the 30-35% of individuals who show a
      'super-APD' clozapine response in schizophrenia in the pivotal study will be predominantly in
      B1, because the B1 completers will no longer be diluted by the other non-responders like B2s.
      Therefore, the investigators postulate that >50% of B1 will show a unique therapeutic action
      of clozapine (beyond general APD action), contrasted with the usual predicted response of B1
      to risperidone or of B2 to clozapine or risperidone.
