      with chronic fatigue syndrome. Since used drug dosage and the ways of administering vitamin C
      were not identical, the results were not consistent throughout those studies. This study is
      aimed to evaluate the efficacy of high dose vitamin C with parenteral supplement on relieving
      fatigue for apparently healthy volunteers.
