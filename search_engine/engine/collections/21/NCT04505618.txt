    
      The objective of this study is to perform a prospective, longitudinal analysis of clinical
      and imaging findings from normal controls and subjects with retinal vascular disease to
      better define the diagnostic imaging criteria that signify change in disease stage. This
      includes disease progression in early stages of disease or disease regression with
      appropriate standard-of-care treatment.

      Subjects will be identified from healthy subjects (seen for screening eye exams) and diseased
      subjects undergoing standard-of-care treatment or screening at eye clinic locations. The
      study population will include subjects with retinal vascular disease including but not
      limited to diabetic retinopathy, hypertension, retinal vein/arterial occlusion, and macular
      degeneration. Subjects who are enrolled will undergo non-invasive, minimal risk, FDA approved
      diagnostic imaging procedures to identify vascular changes.

      The study methods will include retrospective review and collection of clinically approved
      imaging data that is obtained through standard-of-care methods for subjects who meet
      inclusion and exclusion criteria. Subjects who are identified in this manner will be asked to
      participate in a prospective study by each clinical study site.

      The study end-points include the correlation of diagnostic imaging findings from OCT based
      images with fundus photographs, clinical disease stage and visual acuity.
