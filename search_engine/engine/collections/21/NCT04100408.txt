      I. To comprehensively characterize germline variants in SMAD6 and their association with LCH.

      II. To identify novel germline variants associated with LCH.

      III.To determine the role of genetic ancestry on LCH-related somatic mutations.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To integrate clinical and epidemiologic questionnaire data with genetic risk factor data
      from the Primary Aims to more comprehensively elucidate LCH susceptibility.

      OUTLINE:

      Case identification and recruitment followed by questionnaires and specimen processing.
