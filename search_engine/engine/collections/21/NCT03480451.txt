      patients with IPF will significantly improve participant health related quality of life. The
      objective is to develop a comprehensive, multi-disciplinary 12-week PR program with disease
      specific educational components for IPF patients. The specific aims of the proposal is to
      evaluate the effect of the comprehensive PR program on 1) improvements in quality of life
      using the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form 36 (SF-36), a quality of life instrument
      and 2) improvements in patient self-reported dyspnea scores using the chronic respiratory
      questionnaire. The investigator intends to evaluate sustained benefits of the PR
      intervention, changes in depression, anxiety, stress and functional physical capacity.
