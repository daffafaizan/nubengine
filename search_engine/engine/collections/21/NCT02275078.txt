      Canada and the only chronic disease where mortality rates continue to climb. Acute
      exacerbations are common.Unfortunately, exacerbations are often viewed as trivial events or
      "simple bronchitis"despite being linked with accelerated lung function decline, poor health,
      hospital admissions and premature death.Conversely, prompt treatment reduces recovery
      time,improves health status, and decrease hospital admissions.In most patients, exacerbations
      are managed either in primary care walk-in clinics or emergency departments (ED), resulting
      in suboptimal management and high utilization costs.Furthermore, less severe exacerbations
      (~60%) remain unreported and untreated, although these likely have a significant negative
      impact on health. In Canada, quality indicators suggest that chronic disease management
      remains suboptimal, especially in COPD.

      RATIONALE: In COPD clinics, the investigators group and others have shown that patients who
      learn how to self-monitor and manage acute exacerbations by following a COPD Action Plan have
      better health outcomes and lower rates of health care utilization (unplanned office visits,
      ED use, and hospital admissions). Key elements of effective self-management programs include
      a written Action Plan, standing orders for exacerbation medications (antibiotics/prednisone),
      and self-management skills training combined with access to nurse case manager support.
      However, these programs are time and resource intensive and hence very challenging to
      implement across practices, especially in those that are not specialized. Recent advances in
      patient-provider communication technology, such as interactive phone systems, show promise in
      helping inform and motivate patients with asthma, diabetes and hypertension to effectively
      self monitor symptoms and better self-manage their diseases.Communication technology offers
      new opportunities to develop chronic disease self-management programs that can be easily
      implemented and less likely to place additional burden on busy practices.
