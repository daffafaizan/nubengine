      of the sprain and can diagnose complications that may have gone unnoticed on physical
      examination.

      Patients will be evaluated clinically : demographics, history, clinical examination,
      functional scores. Ultrasound and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) will be performed during
      the first month to determine the stage of severity and to look for complications. The main
      aim is to evaluate the interest of ultrasound in the diagnosis of the severity of lateral
      ankle sprain. The secondary purpose is to compare an ultrasound assessment of severity with
      clinical and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) assessment.
