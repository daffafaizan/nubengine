      live volumetric rendering. This study will explore if this approach improves patient and
      caregiver understanding of their disease. Eligible patients should have available diagnostic
      imaging consisting of CT, MRI, and/or PET-CT. Prior to their consultation in radiation
      oncology, patients will complete a survey about their prior experience reviewing their
      diagnostic imaging. During the consultation, patients and caregivers will be shown their
      medical imaging in 2D on a computer screen, then in 3D with virtual reality. After the
      consultation, the patient and caregiver(s) will complete a 2nd survey comparing virtual
      reality to standard imaging review with domains of perceived understanding, patient
      preference, and satisfaction. Then, the patient and caregiver(s) will undergo a qualitative
      interview exploring their experience with virtual reality compared to standard imaging
      review. The survey questions comparing virtual reality to standard imaging review will be
      statistically evaluated. The recorded interview session will be qualitatively analyzed using
      with a mixed methods approach by thematically categorizing the respondents' answers.
