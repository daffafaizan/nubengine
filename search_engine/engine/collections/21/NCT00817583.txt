      benefit gained from adding induction chemotherapy to concurrent chemoradiation has not been
      defined yet. In the present clinical study, we hope to assess the tolerance and survival
      benefits of induction chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemoradiation in patients with
      stage III, IVa and IVb NPC.
