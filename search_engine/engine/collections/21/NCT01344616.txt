      intervention system to significantly reduce preterm births in high-risk populations. This
      system will: (1) assess a pregnant woman's unique risks in six modifiable areas associated
      with increased risks of preterm birth including smoking cessation, poor nutrition, domestic
      violence, maternal depression and stress, urinary and reproductive tract infections and
      substance use; (2) provide her with tailored advice and action planning tools on reducing her
      risks; (3) provide her certified nurse midwife or physician with information related to her
      assessed risks and counseling suggestions tailored for her needs, and [(4) promote effective
      referrals to, and successful linkages with community-based support organizations.] Because
      preterm birth rates are much higher for underserved African American women, we are proposing
      to focus the intervention with this population.
