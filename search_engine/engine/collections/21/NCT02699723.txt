      I. To evaluate the response of arsenic trioxide/itraconazole in patients with refractory
      basal cell carcinoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if this treatment is associated with a reduction in Gli messenger ribonucleic
      acid (mRNA) levels in tumor and/or normal skin biopsy samples, when compared to baseline
      levels.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive arsenic trioxide orally (PO) and itraconazole PO daily for 50 days, followed
      by maintenance therapy consisting of 2 weeks off treatment and then 2 weeks on treatment for
      up to 6 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 2 years.
