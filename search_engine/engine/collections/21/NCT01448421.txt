      patients with aortic stenosis (a disease of the aortic valve), to be treated with
      Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR).

      The TAVR procedure consists in replacing the diseased aortic valve by a new artificial valve.
      The new valve is put into place using a long, thin tube called a catheter that is inserted
      into a small incision (cut) in the patient's groin and threaded through his/her arteries up
      to the heart.

      During the TAVR procedure, there is a risk that an abnormal particle (called embolism) could
      break off from inside the arteries and travel to the brain. The embolism could be made of
      clumps of blood (clots), air, part of your body tissue, or part of a medical device. If the
      embolism is carried through the blood to the brain, it could cause a stroke or other
      neurological (brain) problems. A stroke happens when blood flow to a part of the brain is
      blocked, causing brain cells to die.

      The Keystone Heart Embolic Deflection Device has been developed to prevent an embolism from
      going to the brain and causing a stroke or other brain damage. The device is a wire mesh
      filter that covers the vessels that carry blood to brain, deflecting any any blood clots or
      other materials away from the patient's brain and towards the lower body, where they are less
      likely to cause harm.
