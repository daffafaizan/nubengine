      and middle-aged adults. Both patching and atropine are accepted treatment modalities for the
      management of moderate amblyopia in children. Despite best efforts with conventional
      amblyopia treatment, many older children and teenagers with amblyopia fail to achieve normal
      visual acuity in the amblyopic eye. In a previous PEDIG study (ATS3) where children 7 to 13
      years old were treated with atropine and patching, only 36% of the children with moderate
      amblyopia and only 23% of the children with severe amblyopia achieved 20/40 or better acuity.
