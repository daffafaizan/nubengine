      a common complication in advanced NSCLC, finally decreases the quality of life and lifespan.
      Nowadays, it is still a challenge to effectively control malignant pleural effusion. In this
      multi-center randomized and controlled clinical trial, 134 NSCLC patients diagnosed as
      malignant pleural effusion in the first time will enroll. Based on systemic chemotherapy and
      pleural cavity perfusion, all eligible patients are randomly assigned into treatment group
      (recombinant human adenovirus type 5 and Endostatin injections) and control group (cisplatin)
      with ratio 1:1. Local control rate and side effects are record respectively. The anticipation
      is that treatment group obtains faster and longer control of pleural effusion.
