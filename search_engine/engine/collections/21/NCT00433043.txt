      morbidity and mortality. However, initiation and uptitration remains a challenge in many
      patients. Worsening of heart failure, symptomatic hypotension and symptomatic bradycardia all
      limit up-titration to the target doses that have been shown to have mortality benefits
      (carvedilol [Coreg] 25 mg bid, metoprolol succinate [Toprol-XL] 200 mg qd) in the large
      clinical trials (COPERNICUS, MERIT-HF).

      It is debated whether the benefit of beta-blockade is solely due to heart rate reduction or
      more broadly from the cardiac, central and peripheral effects of blocking sympathetic
      activity. Clearly, there is a remodeling effect on the dilated ventricle. Furthermore,
      patients with heart rates of 64 bpm or less are rarely begun on beta-blocker therapy. It is
      not known whether these patients should be given a pacemaker in order to then safely initiate
      beta-blocker therapy.

      It is also clear that isolated right ventricular pacing can have deleterious effects on
      ventricular dyssynchrony and symptomatic heart failure despite medical therapy. Biventricular
      pacing (BIVPM), also known as cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT), is the pacing mode of
      choice for patients with wide QRS complexes and symptomatic HF.

      It is hypothesized that CRT therapy allows for increased Beta -blocker dose (or initiation of
      beta-blocker in patients previously intolerant) with improved NYHA, ejection fraction, and
      remodeling effects. The synergy between two established heart failure therapies requires
      further evaluation in a prospective randomized trial.
