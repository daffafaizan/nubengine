    
      This is a single center study to evaluate the use of non-invasive measurement of stroke
      volume and cardiac output to assess risk and response to treatment in patients with acute
      pulmonary embolism (PE). A total of 40 subjects at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center are
      anticipated to be enrolled.

      After informed consent is obtained, the following procedure will be performed:

      Patients requiring ICU level care with confirmed diagnosis of PE by CT angiogram or EBUS will
      be connected to a device that measures hemodynamics non-invasively called the Edwards
      ClearSight system and Edwards EV1000 clinical platform for 12 to 24 hours. The device is a
      finger probe worn with a supportive forearm strap. Hemodynamic measurements from the finger
      cuff will be recorded at intervals. After 12 hours, measurements will be taken if patient
      comfort and compliance allows.

      Patients will be followed through their hospitalization. Standard of care data will be
      collected from the medical record including vital signs, cardiac monitor recordings, baseline
      electrocardiogram, central venous pressure (CVP) if available, ventilator settings and
      measurements, labs (troponin, d-dimer, lactate, pH, complete blood count, basic metabolic
      panel, B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) or N-terminal-pro hormone BNP (NT-proBNP),
      prothrombin time and international normalized ratio (PT/INR), anti-Xa assay, and partial
      thromboplastin time (PTT)), imaging, interventions performed, therapies administered,
      discharge outcome and functional status.

      As this is a study looking at the feasibility of non-invasive measurement of cardiac output
      and stroke volume for treating acute pulmonary embolism, study personnel performing the study
      procedures will not be blinded to the clinical diagnosis and the management of the subject.
