    
      SPECIFIC AIMS:

        1. To investigate the role of urinary Kim-1 excretion as a marker of delayed graft
           function, acute kidney allograft rejection and/or virus-induced allograft nephropathy
           and/or calcineurin-inhibitor nephrotoxicity.

        2. To determine the role of urinary Kim-1 excretion in predicting long term outcome after
           kidney transplantation compared to standard diagnostic tests.

        3. To determine the role of reduction in urinary Kim-1 excretion after a rejection episode
           and/or viral infection as a marker of repair of renal tubules.

      HYPOTHESIS:

      Monitoring of urinary KIM-1 in kidney transplant recipients will facilitate the detection of
      delayed graft function, acute allograft rejection or infectious causes of proximal tubular
      injury, allowing earlier intervention with better long-term graft survival. Detection of
      urinary KIM-1 will precede increases in serum creatinine to detect acute graft injury and
      urinary KIM-1 will decrease faster than serum creatinine and will predict responsiveness (or
      lack thereof) to intervention more accurately.
