    
      The study will be performed on 140 subjects with verified IBS. Patients will be recruited
      from the clinic of Gastroenterology or Internal medicine as well as primary health care
      centers. At the start of the study patients will fill out protocols concerning Rom IV
      criteria (to validate that IBS criteria are filled) as well as IBS symptom rating scales.
      They will be examined by a physician/researcher who will complete protocols of clinical data.
      Blood and fecal samples will be collected. A control group of healthy, non-IBS individuals
      will go through the same procedure as described above.

      Study participants with IBS will thereafter be randomized to receive an alternative diet
      resembling the FODMAP (Fermentable, Oligo-, Di-, Mono-saccharides And Polyols) diet (n=130),
      or to continue with their regular diet (control group; n=20). After 4 weeks of dietary
      intervention, there will be a follow-up where blood and fecal samples are once again
      collected. At this point in time, participants will also fill in IBS symptom rating scales
      again.

      Samples from baseline and 4 weeks will be used for genetic/epigenetic (including genomic-wide
      association studies), gut microbiota and inflammatory parameter analyses.

      Statistics

      To study differences in the above-mentioned parameters between patients and controls as well
      as before and after dietary intervention, Mann-Whitney U-test and Wilcoxon test will be used,
      respectively.
