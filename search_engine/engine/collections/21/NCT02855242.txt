      energy harvest and fat storage with the hopeful goal of discovering a modifiable intervention
      to affect obesity and its consequences. Mouse models have already shown that transplantation
      of an obese microbiota into germ-free mice yields increased adiposity compared to
      transplantation of a lean microbiota. In humans, initial studies looked at the relative
      proportion of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes in obese versus lean individuals and then followed
      those obese individuals who lost weight on low-calorie diets. The relative proportion of
      Bacteroidetes was decreased in obese people, and this then increased with weight loss. While
      certainly provocative, the findings were not consistently reproduced.

      Subjects will include members of the Dan Abraham Healthy Living Center (DAHLC) program or the
      Healthy Living Program (HLP) at Mayo Clinic Rochester, who are seeking advice for weight
      management concerns.
