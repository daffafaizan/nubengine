      sufficient number of natural teeth(class I and \or class IV Aramany classification)not less
      than five teeth, intact soft palate , sufficient mouth opening , not exposed to radiotherapy
      or chemotherapy. Patients were divided into two equal groups, each of seven patients:
      patients of group I(Comparator) received a clasp retained obturator, while patients of group
      II(Intervention) received an attachment-retained obturator (RCT). The design of the
      definitive obturator for group I included double Aker's clasp on the first , second premolars
      and molars with alternating buccal and lingual retention, palatal plate as a major connector
      and a meshwork extension at the defect side. For group II, crown preparation of all the
      remaining abutments was done. Then, in the wax pattern, a lingual guiding plane was prepared
      and two OT Vertical attachments were attached mesial to the most anterior abutment and
      palatal to the second premolar and first molar . Construction of the splinted crowns were
      completed and the final impression was made with the splinted crowns in place to be picked up
      into the impression. After final try-in of the obturator, construction of the definitive
      obturator was completed with a hard resin hollowed obturator bulb, functional relining with
      soft silicone liner for both groups.

      Evaluation included patient satisfaction (primary outcome)where Two scales were followed in
      this study which are"The Obturator Functioning Scale" and " The European Organization for
      Research and Treatment of Cancer Head and Neck 35"
