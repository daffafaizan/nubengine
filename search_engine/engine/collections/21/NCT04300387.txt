      and the incidence of the end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are extremely high in Taiwan. Early
      diagnosis of disease and proper management remain challenging. The aims of this study are:

        1. Explore risk factors associated with CKD: demographic, social and genetics factors

        2. Establish multidisciplinary care model for CKD patients

        3. Development cost-effective clinical care pathway for CKD

        4. Provide bio-specimen repository for future study: serum, PBMC, urine and stool
