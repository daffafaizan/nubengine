      central nervous system. The origin of most acute pain from surgical stimulation is the
      mechanical trauma of the local tissue and the subsequent acute inflammatory response. Open
      inguinal hernia repair is one of the commonest surgical procedures which may provoke pain of
      variable intensity and duration.

      Etoricoxib (ArcoxiaÂ®) is a NSAID with anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties mainly
      achieved via selective peripheral COX-2 inhibition. Spinal anaesthesia using local
      anaesthetics combined with opioids affects the transmission, modulation and modification
      stages of nociceptive afferent impulses and its analgesic qualities are superior to local
      anaesthesia alone.

      No studies have investigated the combined use of anti-inflammatory analgesics with spinal
      anaesthesia/analgesia for pre, intra and postoperative multimodal pain protection in patients
      undergoing day-case IHR. The aim of the investigators study is therefore to assess the
      efficacy of preoperative combined administration of etoricoxib and standard spinal
      anaesthesia in the reduction of postoperative pain following IHR.
