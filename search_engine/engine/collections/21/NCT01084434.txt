      preventative vaccination reduces the severity of infection but ageing reduced its efficacy
      and it is only effective in 17-53% in elderly individuals. Thus, nutritionists and medical
      researchers are looking for opportunities to improve the immune response to influenza
      vaccine. Functional foods, such as probiotics, prebiotics and synbiotics, apart from other
      health benefits, may contribute towards immune protection.

      Probiotics are beneficial bacteria, which are regarded as safe and serve health benefits to
      the host, while prebiotics are carbohydrates which by escaping digestion in the upper
      gastrointestinal tract may reach the colon and there serve as food for beneficial bacteria in
      the colon. When prebiotic used in combination with probiotic bacteria, it is called
      synbiotic, and it may improve survival and implantation of probiotic in the gut.

      The human study will examine the immune response to vaccination and changes in faecal
      microbiota during administration of probiotic, prebiotic and synbiotic supplements. The study
      will be conducted between vaccinations seasons in 2010-2011 and recruit 100 healthy subjects
      aged 40-65years old. Participant will be given one of four different treatments over a 7 week
      period following 3 weeks of wash-out period. Treatments given include: a probiotic, a
      prebiotic, a synbiotic and a placebo. In the 3rd week of product consumption the participant
      will be given a flu jab. Specific antibody titre against the 3 viral strains composing the
      vaccine and total immunoglobulin concentration in the serum will be monitored during 2 and 4
      weeks after vaccination. Faecal samples and saliva will be collected and analysed for changes
      in faecal microbial populations.
