      pharmacological prophylaxis reduces the risk of thrombosis after surgery but there are still
      doubt about the best type of prophylaxis and duration of treatment. The American College of
      Chest Physicians recommend thromboprophylaxis with either Low molecular weight heparin,
      factor Xa-inhibitors or Vitamin-K-antagonists for up til 10 days after total knee replacement
      (TKR) and 35 days after total hip replacement(THR). However whether these recommendations are
      applicable in fast-track patients receiving early mobilisation is uncertain.

      Studies on fast-track patients receiving early mobilisation and thrombosis prophylaxis only
      during hospitalisation showed very small incidence of symptomatic thromboembolic events.
      Therefore we conduct a quality-cohort-study on all patients receiving fast-track TKR/THR with
      short-term anti-thrombotic treatment, in order to investigate frequency of symptomatical deep
      vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolus, acute myocardial infarction and stroke.
