      neurosurgeons. Pretreatment pain, neurologic function (including facial numbness), and health
      related quality of life will be assessed. Patients will be treated in a single session with
      75 Gy maximal dose covering a 6 mm segment of the retrogasserian cisternal portion of the
      trigeminal sensory root. Treatment will be delivered using the CyberKnife Robotic
      Radiosurgery System with the patient in the supine position. An aquaplast head mask will be
      used to ensure adequate immobilization during therapy. The target volume shall be the 6 mm
      segment of the retrogasserian cisternal portion of the trigeminal sensory root. Patients will
      receive subcutaneous injection of amifostine (500 mg) or placebo 30 minutes +/- 30 minutes
      prior to SRS. Facial pain will be assessed using the Visual Analog Scale and Short-form
      McGill Pain Questionnaire. Following SRS, patients will be followed at 1, 3, 6, and 9 months
      Â±7 days. Facial numbness will be assessed using the Barrow Neurologic Institute (BNI) Facial
      Numbness Score. Patient reported BNI facial numbness scoring and complete cranial nerve exam
      by a physician will be performed pre-treatment and at follow-up visits.
