      improvement of treatment efficacy, meaning increasing toxicity to tumor tissue, without
      additional toxicity to non-tumor tissues.

      The literature indicates that DHA sensitizes breast malignant tumors, but not non-tumor
      tissues, to chemotherapy and to radiotherapy through a variety of mechanisms. DHA enrichment
      of tissues can be achieved through a dietary supplementation of DHA-containing oils, such as
      fish oil, both in experimental animal models or in humans. Therefore, this represents an
      original nutritional approach to increase the activity of anticancer treatments through an
      enhanced specificity toward tumor tissues.
