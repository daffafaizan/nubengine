      nervous system based on molecular imaging of myelin. Preclinical studies have shown [11C]
      MeDAS uptake in the brain and spinal cord to be an indicator of the microstructural integrity
      of the tissue.

      [11C]MeDAS PET (Positron Emission Tomography) scans will be performed on healthy subjects at
      2 timepoints to assess for safety of the radiotracer and to assess its performance in humans.
      Following measurement of [11C]MeDAS pharmacokinetics and biodistribution, an optimal protocol
      for dosing and imaging will be established.
