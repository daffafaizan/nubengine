      nerve block (GGNB), and their combination in patients with irreversible pulpitis. Methods:
      One hundred fifty subjects with irreversible pulpitis of a mandibular molar were selected.
      subjects randomly received two IANB injections or two GGNB injections or their combination of
      1.8 mL 2% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine. Success was specified as no or mild pain on
      the basis of Heft-Parker visual analogue scale recordings up on the access cavity preparation
      or initial instrumentation. Data were analyzed by Kruskal-Wallis, and ANOVA tests.
