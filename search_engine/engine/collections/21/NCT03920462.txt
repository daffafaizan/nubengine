      workshops using the intelligent electric bike for health with different devices such as two
      connected vests (non-invasive) measuring on the one hand the cardiological and respiratory
      parameters (connected vest named : Etisens) and the other hand the kinetic energy of movement
      (connected vest named : Optimove).

      The development of this ambulatory physiology platform and the engine brake create
      perspectives for an outdoor rehabilitation tool that for example could stimulate, on an
      altitude free-excursion, a mountain pass of Alpes doing the link of health, sport and
      well-being.
