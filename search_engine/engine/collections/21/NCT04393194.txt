    
      The study is a multi-center, randomized trial of women with symptomatic utero-vaginal or
      post-hysterectomy vaginal vault prolapse desiring non-surgical treatment with a pessary. This
      study will compare outcomes in women randomized to vaginal estrogen cream or vaginal placebo
      cream.

      Women who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be evaluated. A pessary (ring with
      support) will be fit by an experienced physician. After successful pessary fitting, they will
      be randomly divided into experimental active medication and control groups. The experimental
      group will start intravaginal estrogen cream, and the control group will start intravaginal
      estrogen-free cream. Then patients will be followed every 3months until 1year.

      The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the effect of intravaginal estrogen use on pessary
      treatment for pelvic organ prolapse, including short-term and long-term use rate, patient
      impression of improvement, improvement in symptom-specific quality of life and complication
      incidence.
