    
      This is a prospective, randomized, open-label phase III study of adjuvant chemotherapy after
      curative resection in patients with pathologic stage IB (by AJCC 6th edition) gastric cancer
      with at least one additional risk factor (additional risk factors for recurrence include age
      >65 years, male gender, presence of lymphovascular invasion, presence of perineural
      invasion). The superiority design will compare the efficacy and safety profiles of adjuvant
      capecitabine (Arm A) versus observation alone (Arm B).
