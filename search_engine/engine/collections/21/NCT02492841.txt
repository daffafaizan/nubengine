    
      Methodology: It is a randomized controlled study. groups signed the informed consent for
      clinical trial patients, a clinical evaluation of 90 permanent molars teeth through
      endodontic diagnostic tests and radiograph. will be conducted to determine diagnosis. Will be
      assigned randomly to the type of material to use and direct pulp teeth affected by caries
      coating is carried out; Patients will not have knowledge of the material to be used in the
      coating. The patient will be clinically evaluated at 1 week, 3 months and 8 months, and
      radiographically; at the beginning and end of the study. In each clinical control endodontic
      diagnostic tests of heat, cold, electric and percussion will be performed. In radiographic
      controls take a radiograph control with positioner or surveyor at baseline and 8 months, to
      evaluate the periapical status. Clinical success will consider that tooth in continuous
      controls and after 8 months presented vitality and radiographic signs of apical image without
      injury. Failure unresponsive to consider whether susceptibility testing of cold and
      electricity in more than one control and presents radiographic image with apical lesion.
