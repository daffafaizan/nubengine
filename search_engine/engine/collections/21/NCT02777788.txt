    
      Lung cancer is the most common malignant tumor in the world with about 80%-85% non small cell
      lung cancer.

      The investigators perform a multi-center, randomized, controlled, prospective study in
      patients with advanced NSCLC. Patients are randomized over observational group(Chinese patent
      drugs plus chemotherapy), and control group (chemotherapy). The investigators will observe 2
      cycles and after that regular follow-up will be arranged.

      The primary end point is: Objective response rate;

      The secondary end points are:

        1. progression-free survival(PFS);

        2. overall survival(OS);

        3. Time to Progression (TTP);

        4. quality of life questionnaire（QOL);

        5. other end points are: Toxicity, side effects and security of the treatments will be
           assessed at the same time.

      The investigators expect that integrated TCM combined with chemotherapy has a better efficacy
      on enhancing Objective response rate，prolonging PFS, OS, improving QOL, reducing the adverse
      reaction of patients than that of chemotherapy.Therefore our study can provide evidences for
      optimizing and promoting integrated TCM combined with Western Medicine treatment.
