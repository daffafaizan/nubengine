    
      This study is designed as a pilot study where 30 patients receiving a below the knee
      amputation with at least one open wound on the limb will be enrolled. Patients are identified
      through medical records. The patients will be selected based on inclusion and exclusion
      criteria through pre-screening through the Comprehensive Wound Center's Limb Preservation
      Program and wound physicians/providers at Indiana University. The decision of amputation is
      made independently of the study and is solely made by the patient and their
      physician/provider. The provider decides based on the severity of the limb's condition
      if/when the limb should be amputated and will schedule this surgery with the patient based on
      current clinical standard of care. Study participation is decided independent of clinical
      decision. Patients enrolled in the study will wear the Patterned Electric Dressing (PED) on
      the wound(s) for up to 3 weeks or until amputation, whichever comes first and will have up to
      a total of 4 study visits.
