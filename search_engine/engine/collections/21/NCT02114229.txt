    
      We propose a study with 3 primary treatment strata according to participant's previous
      treatment, age and presence of extra-CNS disease, with substrata for presence of focal or
      metastatic disease:

        -  STRATUM A - RECURRENT OR PROGRESSIVE DISEASE: Patients < 22 years of age at diagnosis
           with recurrent or progressive MRT (either CNS and/or extra-CNS) and measurable disease
           as defined in the protocol.

             -  Stratum A1: patients with AT/RT (CNS MRT).

             -  Stratum A2: patients with extra-CNS MRT (patients with concurrent progression of
                AT/RT and MRT are eligible for therapy, but their data will be analyzed
                separately).

             -  Stratum A3: patients with synchronous AT/RT and extra-CNS MRT

        -  STRATUM B - NEWLY DIAGNOSED DISEASE IN YOUNG CHILDREN < 36 MONTHS: Patients < 36 months
           of age at diagnosis of CNS-AT/RT, no prior therapy:

             -  Stratum B1: Patients with no metastatic disease (M0).

             -  Stratum B2: Patients with metastatic disease (M+) regardless of degree of
                resection.

             -  Stratum B3: Patients for whom CSF by lumbar puncture was not obtained for clinical
                reasons and have no other evidence of metastatic disease (MX).

        -  STRATUM C - NEWLY DIAGNOSED DISEASE IN CHILDREN > 3 YEARS: Patients > 3 years (36
           months) of age at diagnosis of AT/RT, no prior therapy:

             -  Stratum C1: Patients with gross total (GTR) or near total resection (NTR) defined
                as <1.5 cm2 of residual tumor, and no metastatic disease.

             -  Stratum C2: Patients with metastatic disease (M+) and/or bulky residual tumor >1.5
                cm^2.

      STRATUM D - SYNCHRONOUS EXTRANEURAL AT/RT and EXTRA-CNS MRT: Treatment will be based on the
      extent of both CNS and extra-CNS disease. CNS-directed therapy will be given according to
      Strata B1, B2, C1 or C2 according to age and metastatic status. In addition, patients may
      receive irradiation according to best clinical management for local control of extra-CNS
      disease.

        -  Stratum D1: Patients < 36 months at time of diagnosis with synchronous AT/RT and
           extra-CNS MRT and no metastatic CNS disease (M0).

        -  Stratum D2: Patients < 36 months at time of diagnosis with synchronous AT/RT and extra-
           CNS MRT and metastatic CNS disease (M+).

        -  Stratum D3: Patients < 36 months at time of diagnosis with synchronous AT/RT and
           extra-CNS MRT for whom CSF by lumbar puncture was not obtained for clinical reasons and
           without other evidence of metastatic disease (MX)

        -  Stratum D4: Patients â‰¥ 36 months at time of diagnosis with synchronous extra-CNS MRT
           with or without metastatic CNS disease regardless of the degree of tumor resection.

      Biological parents of participants with ATRT/MRT may consent to and provide a genomic blood
      specimen for DNA extraction and analysis.

      OVERVIEW OF TREATMENT PLAN: Patients with recurrent disease (Stratum A) will receive
      alisertib as a single agent days 1-7 out of 21 days. Newly diagnosed patients (Strata B, C
      and D) will receive alisertib in sequence with chemo and radiotherapy. Patients on sub-strata
      B1 and D1 will receive focal RT once they are >12 months of age. Patients on sub-strata B2
      and D2, with disseminated disease will not receive CNS radiation therapy (RT). Patients on
      sub-strata C1/C2/D4 will receive risk-stratified craniospinal irradiation (CSI) and boost to
      primary tumor site followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. Patients on sub-strata B3 and D3 will
      receive therapy similar to sub-strata B2 and D2 and will be considered for local radiotherapy
      depending on their age, response to therapy, and subsequent metastatic staging. Those
      patients with concurrent CNS and extra-CNS MRT may undergo irradiation of the extra-CNS MRT
      according to best clinical management in addition to CNS directed therapy. Alisertib will be
      administered only to eligible patients under the supervision of the investigator or
      identified sub-investigator(s).
