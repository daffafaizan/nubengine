      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of bortezomib with or without anticonvulsant drugs
      known to be metabolized by the P450 hepatic enzyme complex in patients with recurrent glioma.

      II. Determine the biologic activity of this drug by measuring proteasome 20S activity in
      these patients.

      III. Determine the effects of hepatic enzyme-inducing drugs, such as anticonvulsants, on
      biologic activity of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      concurrent anticonvulsant drug use (phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, primidone, or
      felbamate vs gabapentin, lamotrigine, valproic acid, or no anticonvulsant drugs).

      Patients receive bortezomib IV over 3-5 seconds twice weekly for 2 weeks. Courses repeat
      every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of bortezomib until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, 10 additional
      patients are treated with bortezomib at the MTD. Patients are followed every 2 months.
