    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Examine the effects of the repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) training
      program on perceptions of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) versus placebo
      (PC) and wait-list control groups (WLC).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Explore changes in cortical activity: Electroencephalography (EEG) brain maps (low
      resolution electromagnetic tomography) will be assessed over time and compared between
      groups.

      II. Determine if rTMS improves other aspects of CIPN, quality of life (QOL), and mental
      health (MH) compared to PC and WLC.

      III. Explore moderators/mediators of the intervention by examining the extent to which
      changes in EEG patterns mediate the effects of the intervention and the extent to which there
      are interaction effects of the intervention and each of the baseline brain regions.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 groups.

      GROUP I: Patients undergo rTMS over 30 minutes for 10 sessions over 10 business days.

      GROUP II: Patients undergo sham rTMS over 30 minutes for 10 sessions over 10 business days.

      GROUP III: Patients receive standard of care.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up within 1 week and at 1 month.
