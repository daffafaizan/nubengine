      hormonal therapy using exemestane can shrink the size of your breast tumor and allow you to
      preserve your breast or have less extensive surgery on your breast. Additionally, by
      receiving chemotherapy or hormonal therapy before surgery, we will be able to determine if
      the treatment you receive is effective in treating your cancer. Prior to entering this study,
      a special test, called the Oncotype DX assay, will be performed on a small amount of your
      cancer from the biopsy you had at the time you were diagnosed with breast cancer, to
      determine the likelihood that your cancer will benefit from and shrink with chemotherapy and
      hormonal therapy. You will only be eligible to enter this study if the recurrence score of
      your cancer determined using the Oncotype DX assay is less than or equal to 24. Patients with
      hormone receptor-positive breast cancers with recurrence scores less than or equal to 24 have
      been previously demonstrated to obtain a larger benefit from hormonal therapy, compared to
      chemotherapy, when these agents are given after surgery. The ability of hormonal agents and
      chemotherapy to shrink cancers prior to surgery has not been specifically examined in hormone
      receptor-positive cancers with recurrence scores less than or equal to 24.
