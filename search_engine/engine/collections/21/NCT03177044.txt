      gastrointestinal (gut) conditions which tend to flare up some times and be quiet for other
      periods of time. They are usually controlled by medication. Inflammatory bowel disease is
      becoming more common, is usually diagnosed at a young age and is lifelong.

      A significant number of people with inflammatory bowel disease can have bowel symptoms which
      are bothersome even when the disease is quiescent. These symptoms include bowel urgency,
      frequent toileting, incontinence (leakage), constipation (infrequent bowel actions and/or
      difficulty emptying the bowel), abdominal pain, rectal pain or abdominal bloating. The
      symptoms can be very embarrassing or stressful, limiting activities and making life less
      enjoyable.

      People with these bowel symptoms, but without inflammatory bowel disease, respond to a type
      of therapy called behavioural treatment. We don't know yet if this treatment helps people
      with inflammatory bowel disease.

      Behavioural treatment involves learning about how the bowel works, better ways to manage
      bowel problems and specific exercises to improve bowel control. Specially trained pelvic
      floor physiotherapists provide 2-6 sessions, over 6 months, of behavioural treatment which
      may include the use of biofeedback techniques.

      Participants will be asked to complete surveys at the beginning and end of treatment and 12
      months later.

      There are no recognised risks or unwanted side effects caused by behavioural treatment. The
      benefits are that people with inflammatory bowel disease will have an alternative low cost,
      low risk treatment which enables them to self-manage bowel symptoms and improve the quality
      of their life long term.
