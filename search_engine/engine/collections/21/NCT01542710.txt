    
      PURPOSE: To compare the efficacy of bimatoprost/timolol (BTFC) or travoprost/timolol (TTFC)
      fixed combinations on intraocular pressure (IOP) reduction in an Egyptian population.

      METHODS: Patients with primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) were randomized to receive either
      BTFC or TTFC. IOPs were measured at baseline, 2 weeks, and 1, 2, 4, and 6 months. The primary
      outcome measures were the mean change in IOP from baseline
