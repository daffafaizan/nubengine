      groups. After general anesthesia induction and intubation patients will receive analgesia
      according to group allocation. In group TAP (Group T) the transversus abdominis plane block
      will be commenced with ultrasound guidance while the patients is in the supine position with
      a subcostal approach using 20 mL 0.25% bupivacaine and 21 G block needle. In group
      infiltration anesthesia (Group I) the trocar insertion sites will be infiltrated with 20 mL
      0.25% bupivacaine: 7 mL for the 10 mm trocar insertion sites and 3 mL for the 5 mm trocar
      insertion sites. The control group (Group C) will not receive any local anesthetic. All
      patients will receive rescue analgesia with intravenous patient controlled analgesia with
      tramadol (20 mg bolus dose and 20 minutes lockout time)

      Postoperative pain will be assessed during resting and coughing with a Numeric Pain Scale
      (NRS) and nausea and vomiting with a Postoperative Nausea Vomiting Score at the postoperative
      1, 3, 6, 12. and 24 hours. The amount of tramadol consumed in the postoperative period will
      be recorded. Patient satisfaction will be assessed with the Likert scale at postoperative 24
      hours.
