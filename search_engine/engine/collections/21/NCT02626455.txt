    
      Patients should be in need of and fit for immunochemotherapy and should not be resistant to
      rituximab (resistance defined as lack of response or progression within 6 months of the last
      date of rituximab administration, including rituximab, and/or rituximab biosimilars, and/or
      anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody).

      This study will be composed of two parts: Safety run-in and phase III part. The purpose of
      the safety run-in part of this study is to assess whether the drug being tested (copanlisib)
      in combination with standard immunochemotherapy (R-B or R-CHOP) is safe and at what dose
      level of the study drug (copanlisib - 45mg or 60 mg) patients are able to tolerate the study
      treatment combination. In addition to finding a safe and tolerable dose level for the phase
      III part of the study, efficacy will also be evaluated for patients that stay on the study
      treatment during the safety run-in. The phase III part of the study started with the
      determined recommended dose of copanlisib of 60 mg in combination with R-B.

      A maximum of 24 patients will take part in the safety run-in part of this study. In the phase
      III part approximately 520 patients will be randomly assigned to blinded treatment arms of
      copanlisib plus R-B or R-CHOP or placebo plus R-B or R-CHOP.
