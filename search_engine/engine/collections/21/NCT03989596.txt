      Results of commonly used approaches are unsatisfactory, especially in patients who are not
      candidates for neoadjuvant chemotherapy due to poor performance status, comorbidities,
      radioresistant pathology or disease progression on the commonly used chemotherapy regimens.
      The addition of regional hyperthermia to irradiation and in the prolonged gap between the end
      of hypofractionated 10x 3.25 Gy radiotherapy and surgery may allow obtaining the long-term
      local control with the maintenance of a good treatment tolerance.

      Hypofractionation represents a variation of radiotherapy fractionation in which the total
      dose is divided into fewer fractions with an increased fraction dose. Such treatment may lead
      to additional biological effects when compared to conventionally fractionated radiotherapy
      (eg. vascular damage, increased immunogenicity, and antigenicity). The main advantages of
      hypofractionation are those related to the decreased overall treatment time which is more
      convenient for both patients and physicians, increased compliance and makes the treatment
      more cost-effective. Intriguing, such an approach may provide an additional benefit when
      treating non-radiosensitive tumors with a low alpha/beta ratio (eg. sarcomas).

      Hyperthermia is a method of increasing the temperature in the tumor to damage cancer cells
      with minimum injury to the normal cells. It should be combined with another treatment
      modality (radio- or chemotherapy) rather than used alone. Its efficacy was proven in clinical
      trials. The treatment tolerance is usually very good.
