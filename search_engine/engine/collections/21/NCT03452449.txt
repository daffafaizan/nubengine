      study. All outcomes will be assessed within 1 week preoperatively and at 6 and 12 weeks
      postoperatively. Changes in outcome scores will be detected using analysis of variance.
      Association of changes in physical activity and changes in secondary outcomes will be
      detected using stepwise linear regression models.
