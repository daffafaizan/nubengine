      evaluating the efficacy and safety of SEP-363856 in acutely psychotic adult subjects with
      schizophrenia using SEP-363856 (50 or 75 mg/day [ie, once daily]) versus placebo over a
      4-week treatment period. Primary hypoathesis to be tested: H0: μSEP = μPBO versus H1: μSEP ≠
      μPBO, where μSEP and μPBO are the mean changes from Baseline at Week 4 in PANSS total score
      for the SEP-363856 and placebo arms, respectively. Subjects who complete study SEP361-201 may
      be eligible to enroll in the open-label extension study SEP361-202.
