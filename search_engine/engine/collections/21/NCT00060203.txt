        -  Determine the objective tumor response rate (confirmed complete response and confirmed
           partial response) of brostallicin in patients with recurrent or refractory multiple
           myeloma.

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the time to and duration of response, time to treatment failure, time to tumor
           progression, and survival in patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients.

        -  Correlate baseline whole blood levels and activity of glutathione with clinical outcome
           in patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation study.

        -  Phase I: Patients receive brostallicin IV over 10-30 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat
           every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of brostallicin until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

        -  Phase II: Additional patients are accrued and treated at the MTD of brostallicin as in
           phase I.

      Patients are followed every 2 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 23-52 patients will be accrued for this study.
