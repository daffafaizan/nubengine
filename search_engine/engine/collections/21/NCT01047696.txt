      pneumonia and the majority occur among poor children under five years in developing
      countries. Poverty might be said to be the primary cause, which manifests as malnutrition,
      including micro-nutrient deficiencies, and lack of access to medical care. Another attribute
      of poverty is household indoor air pollution (HAP) from use of unprocessed solid fuels such
      as biomass (wood, animal dung and crop wastes) and coal in simple stoves. A meta-analysis of
      published observational studies found that young children exposed to smoke from household
      solid fuel use had a rate of ALRI twice that of children not exposed or where clean fuels
      were used. Recent studies have shown similar ALRI risks associated with short-term air
      pollution measurements and other indicators of exposure.
