      structural heart disease and heart failure, which is not only has the high incidence but also
      has a high predictive value of sudden death. The purpose of the study is to assess the
      effects of Chinese medicine Shensong Yangxin capsule for the chronic cardiac dysfunction
      complicated with ventricular premature beats, which based on the numbers of premature
      ventricular contractions in 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiogram (ECG) as the main endpoint
      of the study. Secondary endpoints are evaluation of the Shensong Yangxin capsule on cardiac
      function and quality of life. This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled,
      multi-center trial. Chronic heart failure patients(cardiac function is Class II-III)
      associated with premature ventricular contractions (premature number 720-10000 / 24h), who
      received standardized treatment for heart failure at least three months, were involved in the
      study. Patients were randomly assigned into Shensong Yangxin capsule group or placebo group,
      with the capsule administration of 4 granules t.i.d.for 12 weeks. 24-hour ambulatory ECG,
      echocardiography and evaluation of heart function were observed at baseline and 12 weeks
      after the intervention. The primary outcomes are the numbers of premature ventricular
      contractions in 24-hour ambulatory ECG, and the secondary outcomes are New York Heart
      Association (NYHA) classification, NT-proBNP, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and
      left ventricular end-diastolic dimension (LVEDD, 6 minute walking test and Minnesota living
      with heart failure questionnaire (MLHFQ).
