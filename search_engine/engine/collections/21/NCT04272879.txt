      the purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical service delivery of home non-invasive
      ventilation (NIV) therapy in patients who have recently undergone, and recovered, from a
      life-threatening exacerbation of COPD.

      This prospective cohort observational study is designed to evaluate the clinical
      implementation of the delivery of home non-invasive ventilation in COPD patients with
      persistent hypercapnia following an acute exacerbation of COPD to validate that the clinical
      benefit demonstrated by the HOT-HMV trial is maintained when the home non-invasive
      ventilation is incorporated into routine clinical practice.

      Patients who have an admission to hospital with an acute exacerbation of COPD requiring
      non-invasive ventilation will be referred for assessment. Eligible patients will be referred
      by the critical care or appropriate respiratory team to a monthly assessment clinic for
      assessment of chronic hypercapnia. The total UK sample size will be 200 participants. St
      Thomas' critical care unit managed between 80-100 patients per year with non-invasive
      ventilation for life threatening exacerbation of COPD. This study will run over 4 years;
      therefore it is anticipated that 200 patients will be enrolled into the trial over this
      period. Patients will also be referred from peripheral hospitals to the Lane Fox Unit as a
      regional centre for home ventilation.
