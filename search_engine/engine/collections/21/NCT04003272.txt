      data confirming safety, performance and clinical benefits of the Comprehensive Versa-Dial
      Reverse Ti Glenosphere when used for primary total shoulder arthroplasty, fractures and
      revision total shoulder arthroplasty (implants and instrumentation) at a 1,2,3,5,7 and
      10-year follow-up* to meet EU Medical Device and other regulatory requirements for post
      market surveillance. Because Comprehensive Reverse Ti Glenospheres have only been on the
      market since 2009, a prospective aspect to the study will be utilized as well in order to
      collect long-term data.

      The primary objective is the assessment of safety by analyzing implant survivorship. This
      will be established by recording the incidence and frequency of revisions, complications, and
      adverse events. Relation of the events to either implant or instrumentation should be
      specified.

      The secondary objective is the assessment of performance and clinical benefits by recording
      patient-reported clinical outcomes measures (PROMs).

      *The most recent available data will be used. If any of the listed time points are not
      available, data will be used from last available time point and follow-up will move forward
      at the closest available time point.
