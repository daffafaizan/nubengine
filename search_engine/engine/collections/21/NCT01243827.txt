      heart failure because these beta-blockers have cardio-protective effects. Recent studies have
      shown that the change in central pulse pressure is more closely associated with the change in
      cardiac load than the change in brachial pressure during hypertension treatment. Vasodilating
      beta-blockers may decrease central pulse pressure more than beta1- selective beta-blockers,
      because vasodilators reduced the magnitude of reflection wave by dilating peripheral muscular
      arteries. The investigators hypothesized that carvedilol, a vasodilating beta-blocker, would
      be more effective than bisoprolol, a beta1- selective beta-blocker in reducing central pulse
      pressure and thereby LV mass, through the reduction in the magnitude of reflection wave. The
      aim of the present study was to test this hypothesis in an active controlled, 2-arm parallel
      group comparison, prospective randomized open blinded end-point (PROBE) design study. At
      least 100 patients will be enrolled in each group and the follow up duration will be 48
      weeks. The primary endpoint is to compare the change in central pulse pressure between the
      two groups.
