        -  Determine the duration and efficiency of hematopoietic and immunologic engraftment in
           patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma treated with pentostatin followed by related
           allogeneic stem cell transplantation.

        -  Determine the hematologic and non-hematologic toxic effects of this regimen in these
           patients.

        -  Determine the incidence and severity of graft-versus-host disease in patients treated
           with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of pentostatin.

        -  Phase I: Patients receive pentostatin IV on days -7, -5, and -3 followed by allogeneic
           stem cell transplantation on day 0. Beginning on day 1, patients receive filgrastim
           (G-CSF) IV over 1 hour or subcutaneously daily until blood counts recover. As
           graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis, patients receive cyclosporine IV continuously
           until stem cell engraftment and then orally with gradual tapering.

      Cohorts of 3 to 6 patients receive escalating doses of pentostatin until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which 2 of 6 patients
      experience dose-limiting toxicity.

        -  Phase II: Patients receive treatment as in phase I at the MTD for pentostatin. Patients
           are followed weekly for 60 days and then monthly for 10 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24 patients (12 per phase) will be accrued for this study.
