    
      A randomized controlled trial in a Norwegian context, involving an effect evaluation, a
      cost-benefit evaluation and a qualitative evaluation. Independent medical evaluation (IME)
      will be compared to treatment as usual (TAU). Independent medical evaluation (IME) will
      comprise a consultation with an independent general practitioner (IME GP) who will assess
      whether the sick listed worker has been given eligible and available opportunities in return
      to work follow-up in Norway. The independent medical evaluation general practitioner (IME GP)
      will write a short report that is sent to the treating general practitioner as input from a
      colleague. The report can be used in the follow-up of the sick listed participant. The
      participants in the treatment as usual (TAU) group will not receive any other follow-up than
      normal follow-up by the treating general practitioner. The qualitative evaluation will be
      conducted to gain insight into the experiences of the general practitioners and the
      participants.
