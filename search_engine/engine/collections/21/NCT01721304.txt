      treatment of abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) is useful and if it will improve patient
      satisfaction with clinical care and decision making. This study was designed to develop and
      test the use of ACA as part of routine clinical care for women diagnosed with AUB. After
      pilot testing, the ACA survey is administered in this study where patients are assigned to
      receive the ACA or to usual care.
