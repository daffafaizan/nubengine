      pembrolizumab. Patients will be randomized into arms 1 and 2, to either receive Metformin
      prior to pembrolizumab or to begin Metformin after pembrolizumab treatment begins. The
      patients are randomized for the exploratory endpoints in order to better understand the
      difference of effects of metformin versus pembrolizumab on the immune system although
      efficacy is based on combination.
