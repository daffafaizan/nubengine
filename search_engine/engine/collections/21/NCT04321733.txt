      group .

      The predominant bacteria causing tonsillitis are group A b-haemolytic streptococci (GABHS),
      which are highly susceptible to the penicillin group of antibiotics.

      It has been reported in the literature that the rate of penicillin failure has consistently
      increased from about 7% in the 1950s to almost 40% in the 2000s.

      Authors propose many reasons to explain such failure rates e.g. the coexistence of
      oropharyngeal beta-lactamase producing bacteria .

      Although there were no documented reports, it was observed that there are rising reports of
      failure in treatment of acute follicular tonsillitis by amoxicillin clavulanate.
