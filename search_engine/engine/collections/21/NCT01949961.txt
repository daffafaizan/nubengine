      ischemic stroke. Patients eligible for thrombolysis (randomized tenecteplase or alteplase)
      are included in the NOR-SASS A sub-study, patients receiving standard (non-trial)
      thrombolysis with alteplase are included in the NOR-SASS B sub-study, and patients not
      eligible for thrombolysis are included in the NOR-SASS C sub-study.

      DESIGN: NOR-SASS is a PROBE (prospective randomised, open-label, blinded endpoint) trial,
      designed to establish the superiority of contrast-enhanced ultrasound treatment given within
      4Â½ hours after stroke onset in consecutively admitted patients with acute ischaemic stroke,
      as compared with 1) standard iv thrombolysis with tenecteplase (TNK) or alteplase (tPA) in
      patients eligible for thrombolytic treatment, and 2) no specific treatment in patients not
      eligible for thrombolytic treatment.

      HYPOTHESIS: 1.) In patients eligible for intravenous thrombolysis, contrast enhanced
      sonothrombolysis (CEST) has superior effect as compared with standard intravenous
      thrombolysis and may be given safely. 2.) In patients not eligible for thrombolysis, contrast
      enhanced sonolysis (CES) has superior effect as compared with no specific treatment and may
      be given safely.

      RANDOMISATION: In NOR-SASS-A (two step randomisation), 1st randomisation is 1:1 to either
      tenecteplase (TNK) or alteplase (tPA); 2nd randomisation is 1:1 to either CEST or no CEST. In
      NOR-SASS-B, randomisation is 1:1 to either CEST or no CEST. In NOR-SASS-C, randomisation is
      1:1 to either CES or no CES.
