    
      This study is a multicenter, randomized, placebo-control, efficacy and safety study of
      VERU-111 for the treatment of COVID-19. Subjects will receive either 18 mg of VERU-111 or
      matching placebo orally or through nasogastric tube daily for to 21 days or until the subject
      is discharged from the hospital, whichever comes first.

      The primary efficacy endpoint of the study will be the proportion of subjects that are alive
      without respiratory failure at Day 22. Respiratory failure is defined as non-invasive
      ventilation or high-flow oxygen, intubation and mechanical ventilation, or ventilation with
      additional organ support (e.g., pressors, RRT, ECMO).

      The total study duration for a subject from screening to follow up visit is planned to be 62
      days.

      An evaluation of the effect of VERU-111 on SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) compared to the placebo
      control will be evaluated after the last subject has completed Day 22. This will allow for
      the decision to move to Phase 3 more quickly if the Phase 2 portion of the study shows a
      clinically relevant difference in the proportion of subjects that are alive without
      respiratory failure at Day 22 in the VERU-111 treated groups compared to the Placebo
      treatment group and VERU-111 is well tolerated in the study.
