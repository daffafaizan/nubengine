      treatment outcomes. Subsequently, there has been a study that shows inhibition of
      hypoxia-induced transcription factor (HIF-1 alpha), with radiation, was effective in disease
      treatment in pre-clinical models. This shows how important hypoxia was in playing a role in
      overall disease outcome and survival.

      As a means of examining tumor features, such as hypoxia, hybrid PET/MR imaging combines the
      advantages of MRI's soft-tissue and contrast resolution with PET's functional metabolic
      capabilities. There have been few reports of using 18F-FDG in diagnostic PET/MRI. with the
      use of 18F-FAZA in this study, parameters such as diffusion, micro-perfusion, and contrast
      enhancement (as a surrogate marker for viable tumour tissue) can be simultaneously compared
      with the FAZA-derived pattern, in a single procedure.

      The study is being conducted to measure the volume of hypoxic tumor in high-risk STS
      patients, using FAZA-PET/MRI, before and after neoadjuvant radiotherapy/chemotherapy.
