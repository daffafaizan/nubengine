      for Americans (PAGA), is the primary United States (U.S) government resource for weight
      control. The researchers propose that chronic, low grade inflammation (CLGI) limits weight
      control by acting upon physiological and behavioral factors that moderate weight control.
      Diet and exercise reduce CLGI and provide weight control, but no one has investigated the
      efficacy of the DGA and PAGA to reduce CLGI, whether reduced CLGI promotes greater weight
      control, and the moderating roles of physiological and behavioral factors on the association
      of reduced CLGI with weight control. To accomplish this, the researchers will conduct a
      6-month trial in 224 obese adults; a 3-month controlled feeding trial with four dietary arms;
      1) DGA with weight loss, 2) Western diet with weight loss,3) DGA diet weight maintenance, 4)
      Western diet weight maintenance. Each dietary arm will have PAGA-recommended exercise and
      non-exercise arms. Post-trial is a 3-month weight maintenance period. The primary outcome is
      change in C-reactive protein (CRP), a marker of CLGI. The results will inform the DGA and
      PAGA; thereby helping clinicians, public health workers, and policymakers to improve the
      health of Americans.
