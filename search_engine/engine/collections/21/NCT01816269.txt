    
      Patients over 18 years with no comorbidities especially liver, cardiac and haemorrhagic
      diathesis and giving informed consent will be categorised according to their status of dental
      scaling, eradication and reinfection rates of h.pylori.

      Statistical examination will include the multiple regression and Chi-Square.

      1-6 months after treatment) and reinfection ( reappearance of Hp 12 months later than the
      treatment).
