    
      This is a Phase 1, open label, parallel group study to investigate the effect of severe
      hepatic impairment on the plasma PK, safety and tolerability after a single oral 30 mg dose
      of dacomitinib under fasted conditions.

      Approximately 18 participants will be enrolled into the study to ensure at least 6 PK
      evaluable (having data for estimating primary PK parameters for dacomitinib) participants in
      each cohort.
