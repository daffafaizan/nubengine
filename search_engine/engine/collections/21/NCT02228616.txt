    
      This is a multicenter, open-labeled, single-arm, interventional study to evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of prucalopride in real clinical practice.

      It consists of 2 phases: a 1-week run-in phase, a 12 week, open-label treatment phase. Study
      population is women with CC who have been treated with laxatives but failed to obtain
      adequate relief within the preceding 6 months. Patients who meet the inclusive and without
      exclusive criteria will be enrolled in the study and signed an Informed Consent Form. They
      are instructed not to change their diet, lifestyle during the study.

      At the first week of the study, subjects will continue PEG or lactulose treatment, and they
      will not be allowed to use any other laxatives and drugs for CC. Subjects will be required to
      maintain a written stool diary as well as the use of PEG and lactulose. Any drug affecting
      the colonic motility will be prohibited during the study. Following this run-in phase,
      subjects enter the 12-week open-label treatment phase. During the treatment phase, subjects
      will be treated for 12 weeks with prucalopride 2 mg, given orally once daily with or without
      breakfast in the morning. Subjects will be required to continue PEG or lactulose treatment
      with the same dosage as that in the run-in period. If necessary, due to intolerable side
      effects (ie, severe diarrhea,), dosage decrements of PEG or lactulose treatment may be made
      at any time or the subject could discontinue the PEG or lactulose treatment, based on
      investigator's judgement. Subjects will record study drug and laxative medication dosing
      information and information related to BMs in a daily diary throughout the study. PAC-SYM and
      PAC QOL questionnaires will be completed at Weeks 0, 4, 12. Subject safety will be monitored
      throughout the study.
