      after gynaecologic laparoscopic surgery significantly reduces postoperative pain and
      postoperative morphine consumption.

      Ropivacaine was effectively administered with non-heating nebulizers (AeronebProÂ®).

      However, almost all patients still use morphine after surgery.

      The investigators hypothesize that intraperitoneal nebulization of Ropivacaine 150 mg may
      prevent the use of morphine after the laparoscopic ovarian cyst surgery.
