    
      Design: Randomized prospective study. Setting: University Hospital with an active kidney
      transplantation program. Patients: Adult kidney transplant recipients. Interventions: Kidney
      transplant recipients with asymptomatic bacteriuria will be randomly assigned to be treated
      with antibiotics or to be followed without antibiotic therapy.

      Measurements: Urine cultures will be collected weekly during the first month after
      transplantation, every 2 weeks until three months after transplantation, every month until 6
      months after transplantation and every 3 months until 12 months after transplantation. Urine
      culture will be as well collected if urinary symptoms appeared.

      Primary end points: To determine in both groups: the incidence of pyelonephritis.

      Secondary end points: To determine outcomes in both groups (renal function, hospitalization,
      rejection, graft loss, opportunistic infections and mortality) and infection by
      multiresistant microorganisms.
