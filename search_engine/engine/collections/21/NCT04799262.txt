      effect as a glucocorticoid sparing agent in patients with refractory polymyalgia rheumatica.
      Tofacitinib was given at the dose of 10mg daily through the 24 weeks. Patients were to
      receive prednisone in a dosage of 15mg daily (or equivalent) at baseline and decreased to
      10mg daily at week 2. The PMR-AS was determined every two weeks; if ≤10, the prednisone
      dosage was decreased by 2.5 mg every two weeks; and if >17 the dosage was increased to
      previous dosage; if 10≤PMR-AS ≤17, the dosage was maintained at previous stable dose. The
      primary end point was the proportion of patients achieving sustained low disease activity
      (PMR-AS<7) with GC independence (prednisone<2.5mg daily or equivalent) at week 24.
