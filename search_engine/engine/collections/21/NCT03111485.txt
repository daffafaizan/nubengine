    
      Participants with Parkinson's disease and sleep apnea will take long-acting levodopa and
      placebo at bedtime for 2 weeks each, in a randomized order, with a 2-week washout period
      in-between. Sleep studies will be done at the end of each period. The primary outcome will be
      the apnea-hypopnea index change from baseline to on-medication, comparing active medication
      to placebo. Other outcomes will include other polysomnographic parameters such as oxygenation
      measures and sleep architecture variables, as well as the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, the
      Montreal Cognitive Assessment, the Parkinson's disease sleep scale and the Unified
      Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale. Adverse events will be closely monitored.
