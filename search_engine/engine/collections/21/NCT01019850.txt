      Primary

        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose of vorinostat in combination with iobenguane I
           131 in patients with resistant or relapsed neuroblastoma.

        -  To define the toxicities of vorinostat in combination with therapeutic doses of
           iobenguane I 131 in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  To describe, within the context of a phase I study, the response rate in patients
           treated with vorinostat and iobenguane I 131.

        -  To describe histone acetylation levels and norepinephrine transporter mRNA levels in
           peripheral blood mononuclear cells after treatment with different doses of vorinostat.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral vorinostat once daily on days 1-14 and iobenguane I 131 IV over 1Â½-2
      hours on day 3. Patients undergo autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation on day
      17.

      Blood samples may be collected periodically for correlative biological studies.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.
