      cardiac data will be collected from participants with intermediate pretest probability of CAD
      who are referred to invasive coronary angiography (ICA). The CAD-det recording will be
      administered prior to the scheduled ICA procedure. The data collected by CAD-det will be
      processed using AusculSciences' Data Analysis Application (DAA) to produce a patient's
      indication for CAD.
