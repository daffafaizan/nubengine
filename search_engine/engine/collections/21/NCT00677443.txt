           colorectal cancer patients and promising results observed so far in trials with S-1
           combined with oxaliplatin in gastrointestinal cancer including colorectal cancer
           strongly warrants the comparison of S-1 combined with oxaliplatin to capecitabine
           combination with oxaliplatin acknowledged as a standard regimen in a first-line
           treatment for advanced colorectal cancer patients.

        -  Recently, a Phase I study was completed, indicating recommended dose as S-1 100
           mg/m2/day1-14 and oxaliplatin (130 mg/m2/day1), repeated every 3 weeks. However, in the
           phase II study using the above recommended dose, delayed toxicities of thrombocytopenia
           and anemia were observed. These delayed toxicities were also reported in a phase II
           study using S-1 90 mg/m2/day plus oxaliplatin 130 mg/m2/day1 in advanced gastric cancer.
           At 2007 GI ASCO, the interim data of S-1(80 mg/m2/day1-14) plus oxaliplatin (130
           mg/m2/day1) combination, repeated every 3 weeks, was presented, showing promising
           antitumor activity with favourable safety profile. Among 18 patients, there were only
           two patients with Grade 3 thrombocytopenia and one with Grade 3 neutropenia. Response
           rate was 57.1 % and disease control rate was 92.9 %. Considering these results and
           Japanese data which showed that enhanced efficacy was not observed with S-1 over 90
           mg/m2/day and oxaliplatin combination, S-1 80 mg/m2/day 1-14 and oxaliplatin 130
           mg/m2/D1, repeated every 3 weeks, will be tested in this study.
