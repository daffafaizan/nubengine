      observational study we plan to systematically investigate SB and the day-to-day variation in
      this phenomenon in PD patients by a prospective, repeated assessment for 14 days of both
      subjective and objective measures of motor function and sleep at patients' home, by an
      Android app developed ad hoc by our group and named "SleepFit".

      Since is still unknown if a spontaneous, subclinical improvement in motor performance might
      also occur in healthy subjects or if the SB is a phenomenon only involving subjects with PD,
      we had the idea to test this hypothesis comparing a subgroup of PD patients with age- and
      sex-matched healthy volunteers, employing the same assessments as in the Sleep & Move study.
