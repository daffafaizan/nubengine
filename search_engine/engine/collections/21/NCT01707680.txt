      absence of pain, anxiety and to provide comfort. Unfortunately this approach might have
      negative consequences such as prolonged time for mechanical ventilation, length of stay in
      the ICU and hospital.

      In this study, the investigators would like to investigate (in an exploratory way due to the
      non-interventional setup) whether weaning from mechanical ventilation will be affected by the
      choice of sedatives - including dexmedetomidine, midazolam and propofol. This study also aims
      at investigating how the choice of primary sedative will affect delirium/anxiety, need of
      other medications (sedatives, analgesics, anti-psychotics), quality of life after ICU and the
      presence of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. In addition, the investigators aim at receiving
      information from the caregivers on their ICU experience, as recent data imply that not only
      the ICU patient but also the caregiver suffer from PTSD after the ICU stay.
