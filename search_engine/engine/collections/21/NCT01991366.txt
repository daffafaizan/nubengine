    
      This is a retrospective, observational, data analysis of approximately 800 patients who
      underwent primary Percutaneous Coronary Intervention at our institution since September 2000.
      Patients will have either received eptifibatide pre-or during Percutaneous Coronary
      Intervention or have received no eptifibatide. Patients who received a thrombolytic prior to
      Percutaneous Coronary Intervention will be excluded.

      This analysis is estimated to take 1-2 months.
