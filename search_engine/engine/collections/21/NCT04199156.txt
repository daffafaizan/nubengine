    
      In the preparation room, the parturient will relax in supine position with left uterine
      displacement by placing a wedge below the right hip. Appropriate size non-invasive blood
      pressure (NIBP) cuff for the arm and ankle will be chosen according to arm circumference just
      proximal to antecubital fossa and ankle circumference just above the malleoli, respectively.
      The cuff's bladder will be directed anteriorly in the arm and in posteriorly in the leg.
      Simultaneous NIBP measurement of both arms then both ankles will be done. The arm and the
      ankle with the higher reading will be used for intraoperative NIBP assessment. The baseline
      reading of the arm and ankle will be obtained as average of 3 reading 2 minutes apart.
      Simultaneous arm and ankle NIBP measurement will be every 2 minutes from injection of local
      anesthetic into subarachnoid space till 5 minutes after delivery, then every 5 minutes till
      the end of surgery. Left uterine displacement will be continued intraoperatively till the
      delivery. All NIBP measurements will be collected by a research assistant who have no role in
      parturient management.

      Position of the parturient during the spinal anesthesia, drug dosage, fluid management and
      vasopressor administration will be according to local protocols and the discretion of the
      attending anesthetist. Intraoperative blood pressure management will be according to the arm
      NIBP readings
