    
      Fatigue is one of the most common and debilitating symptoms of multiple sclerosis (MS). MS
      fatigue can impact all aspects of quality of life, including physical, mental, and social
      function. MS fatigue is a profound barrier to participating in meaningful activities, such as
      employment and hobbies. Currently, the FDA has not approved medications for MS fatigue in the
      United States (US). However, there are empirically tested, non-pharmacological strategies
      that can support people with MS in reducing the impact of fatigue. Thus, the aim of the study
      is to compare 3 modes of delivering the Managing Fatigue course-2 telerehabilitation formats
      (teleconference and internet) and 1-to-1, in-person format (traditional mode of clinical
      service delivery)-upon outcomes important to people with MS, i.e., fatigue and its impact on
      physical, mental, and social function. The intervention arms will focus on reducing fatigue
      as a strategy to directly improve physical, mental and social functioning.
