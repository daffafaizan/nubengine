      Primary

        -  Determine the overall response rate in patients with HER2/neu-overexpressing metastatic
           breast cancer treated with first- or second-line therapy comprising capecitabine,
           vinorelbine, and trastuzumab (Herceptin^®).

      Secondary

        -  Determine the time to disease progression, duration of response, and overall survival of
           patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the safety profile of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral capecitabine twice daily on days 1-14, vinorelbine IV over 6-10 minutes
      on days 1 and 8, and trastuzumab (Herceptin^®) IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat
      every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months until disease progression and then every 6 months for up
      to 5 years.
