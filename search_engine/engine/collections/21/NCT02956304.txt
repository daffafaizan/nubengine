      systems. More specifically, it has been proposed that language comprehension relies on
      internal simulation of the meaning. For instance, numerous studies have shown that the
      processing of action-related concepts involve a motor activation similar to when the action
      is actually performed. However, even if those studies show clearly that action-related
      concepts involve a motor activation, such activations may be incidental to the activation of
      their representations, rather than part of it. Another way to show that this motor component
      takes part in the representation of manipulable objetcs is to investigate whether an
      impairment of motor system would impair the memory of manipulable object. In this study,
      investigators will use Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) to stimulate ventral premotor
      cortex (PMv) to see whether this stimulation will affect memory of manipulable objects, but
      not memory of nonmanipulable objects. For this purpose, three TMS conditions will be
      assessed: cTBS to inhibit the motor cortex, iTBS to excite the motor cortex, and a SHAM
      condition as control.
