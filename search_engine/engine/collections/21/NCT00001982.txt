    
      A selected sample of volunteer blood donors with chronic hepatitis C viral (HCV) infection
      and various levels of serum aminotransferase activity will be offered a complete medical
      evaluation and liver biopsy to determine the severity of their liver disease. Various
      virological and host factors will be studied in an attempt to determine why patients with HCV
      infection develop differing degrees of liver disease.
