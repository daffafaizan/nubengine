      associated with contact lens wear. Previous research has demonstrated higher levels of
      observed corneal staining when certain combinations of contact lenses and lens care products
      are used, particularly under daily wear regimens. B+L lenses made from Balafilcon
      (PureVision) have been associated with the highest rates of observed staining. Additionally,
      polyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB) based lens care products, specifically B+L ReNu MultiPlus
      have been implicated in higher rates of staining. In general, many lenses constructed from
      newer, silicone hydrogel (SiHy) materials appear more susceptible to increased rates and
      amounts of corneal staining.

      Although the clinical significance of staining is debated, most clinicians agree that less
      staining is preferable to greater amounts of staining. Advances in understanding as well as
      the specifics of lens care product formulation ideally will have resulted in design of newer
      products that minimize corneal staining and maximize product performance. This study will
      examine rates of corneal staining using B+L's recently introduced lens care product: BioTrue
      with the B+L PureVision lens which has previously been associated with the highest levels of
      staining.

      This pilot study is intended to assess the presence of corneal staining among patients who
      are using BioTrue solution
