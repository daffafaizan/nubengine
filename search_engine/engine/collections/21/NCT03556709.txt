      nervous system (PNS) injuries (e.g., peroneal nerve injury, neuropathy, radiculopathy, and/or
      musculoskeletal injury) that affect their ankle movement have residual impairments that
      affect their walking and balance. These impairments include the disability "foot drop," which
      increases the risk for falling.

      This study will focus on PNS injuries that cause foot drop.

      Current therapy to address foot drop is limited primarily to the use of ankle foot orthoses
      (braces) that help keep the foot from hitting the ground to prevent falling. Also, some
      individuals with foot drop use functional electrical stimulation to the leg nerve to lift the
      foot. Regardless, none of these, or other existing, methods to address foot drop cures or
      even improves significantly the underlying neurological deficit behind this disability.
      Braces improve walking safety only while they are worn, and functional electrical stimulation
      does not work when it is turned off, or when the nerve has been severely damaged. Thus, the
      increased fall risk due to foot drop is generally considered life-long and incurable.

      The investigators have developed a shoe-interfaced ankle robot with an adaptive control
      system, to assist an individual with ankle movement only as needed. Data from the
      investigators' previous studies on foot drop due to stroke show great promise for this ankle
      robot as a new rehabilitation tool for invididuals with foot drop, when used during treadmill
      walking. The investigators would like to utilize our findings from these stroke studies in
      learning how they can be used for PNS-related foot drop.
