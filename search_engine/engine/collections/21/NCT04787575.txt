    
      This will be an open-label, multicentre, randomized, parallel group study. The study plan
      will include a screening visit (Visit 1, Day -7/-3) in which patients will be screened on the
      basis of inclusion/exclusion criteria and clinically evaluated.

      At the end of the 3-7 days of run-in (Visit 2, Baseline visit, Day 0), patient still eligible
      will be randomised to one of the two following treatment groups:

        1. Oxygen-ozone therapy SIOOT plus antibiotic therapy

        2. Antibiotic therapy

      Patients in both groups will receive oral antibiotic therapy, which will be prescribed at
      discretion of the Investigator, based on the results of the colture of the swab collected in
      the target lesion at the screening visit (and later, if needed) and the associated
      antibiogram.

      Follow-up visits will be performed after 7 days (Visit 3, Day 7), 14 days (Visit 4, Day 14),
      28 days (Visit 5, Day 28) and 42 days (Visit 6, End of study, Day 42) from the start of
      treatment.

      A visit window of ± 2 days for the date of Visits 3-5 and of ± 3 days for the date of Visits
      6 will be allowed.

      Patients prematurely discontinued from the study will perform an 'Early termination visit',
      in which procedures schedule for Visit 6 (End of study, Day 42) will be performed. In case of
      premature study discontinuation, the Investigator will duly record the reason for premature
      withdrawal in the appropriate section of the case report form (eCRF).

      Visit 6, or the 'Early termination Visit' will represent the conclusion of patient's
      participation in the investigation.
