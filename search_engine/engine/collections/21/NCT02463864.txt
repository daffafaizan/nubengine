      acute hospital admission and this can persist for up to three months. The targeted exercises
      are designed to prevent this functional decline by maintaining the patients' strength,
      balance and endurance. To counterbalance the considerable time spent with the physiotherapy
      services in the intervention arm, the control group will receive stretches and relaxation
      exercises. Patients' length of stay is the primary outcome measure. Their physical
      performance and quality of life at discharge and at 3 months post discharge and their
      readmission rates are the secondary outcome measures.
