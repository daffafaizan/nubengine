      ability to walk as far as they can in six minutes. It is widely used in the assessment of
      functional disability in response to medical intervention in respiratory and cardiac
      conditions.

      This test requires a corridor measuring between 20 and 30 metres and does not require any
      special technical equipment or training.

      While the test appears simple to set up, factors such as the length or width of the corridor,
      and external disruptive elements, may affect the results. Indeed, the configuration of the
      test site plays a role in the test result. For example, the distance traveled in a 6-minute
      walking test is greater on a continuous circuit than in a lane that requires people to walk
      back and forth or when others are using the lane (zigzags, slowdowns). In a hospital setting,
      while it is easy to find a corridor that is long enough, it is not always possible to
      dedicate it exclusively to walking tests.

      An alternative would be to perform this test on a non-motorized treadmill to avoid these
      biases. The main objective of this study is to evaluate the equivalence of a 6-minute walking
      test performed on a non-motorized treadmill to the reference test in healthy subjects. In
      addition, a small number of patients will be invited to perform a 6-minute CT scan on a
      non-motorized treadmill in order to first evaluate the perception and acceptability of this
      new method in this population (seniors, pathologies). If the results are conclusive, a
      similar study with patients only will be performed.
