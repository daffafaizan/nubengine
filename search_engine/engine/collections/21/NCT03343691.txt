    
      Prospective, two arms, observational, blinded, cohort study enrolling 200 women which
      intended to validate the cut-off points between women with malignant tumors, benign tumors,
      and women without tumors (controls) and to validate the sensitivity and specificity of TM-B1
      for the detection of an invasive breast tumor.

      Two cohorts will be tested with TM-B1. The cohorts will differ in the percentage of women
      that are expected to yield a positive finding for breast cancer. Any finding in TM-B1 will
      not influence medical standards of care.
