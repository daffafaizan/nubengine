      This is a two-center, non-randomized, open label, and uncontrolled study.

      All participants will undergo an extensive baseline evaluation 7-14 days before the first
      dose that will include an excisional biopsy of a lymph node, colonic biopsies, and
      leukapheresis. Participants will then receive three doses of N-803 administered every 21
      days. A second excisional biopsy will be performed between 7-14 days after the final dose.
      The study drug N-803 will be administered at 6 mcg/kg, which is the maximum tolerated dose
      determined in a recently completed dose-escalation study.
