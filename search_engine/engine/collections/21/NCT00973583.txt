      participants were randomly allocated to receive 400 IU vitamin D daily and half received
      placebo from October through March. Serum vitamin D and plasma parathyroid hormone
      concentrations were determined. Subjects were followed for 6 months and the primary outcome
      was the number of days absent from duty due to ARTI.
