      pain and disability is reported in literature. Microorganisms are also held responsible for
      Modic Changes of the vertebral bodies.

      Patients underwent surgery for degenerative pathology of the spine independent of this study.
      After being informed about this study, all patients giving written informed consent who met
      eligibility requirements were included. Treatment of the patients was independent of this
      study. Intraoperative removed disc tissue was examined using microbiological culture, viral
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and histopathological analysis.

      Other used data were demographic data (Gender, age), Modic Changes on MRI, preoperative
      Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), preoperative Neck Disability Index (NDI), and preoperative
      C-reactive protein (CRP).

      Frequency of positive microbiological culture findings, viral PCR, and inflammation signs in
      histopathological analysis was described, and statistical analysis was performed to identify
      if any of the above mentioned parameters influences the frequency of positive microbiological
      culture and Modic Changes significant.
