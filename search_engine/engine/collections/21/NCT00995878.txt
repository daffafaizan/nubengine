      200,000 hysterectomies are performed each year for uterine fibroids in the USA. The direct
      health care costs attributable to uterine fibroids exceed $2.1 billion annually. Fibroids are
      reported to cause a number of symptoms including heavy or prolonged menstrual bleeding,
      pelvic pressure, pain with menses and bowel and bladder dysfunction. However, fibroid
      symptomatology is incompletely understood. Understanding and addressing the myomas pain are
      important in optimizing treatment outcomes and controlling health care costs from a societal
      perspective. This study proposes to optimally characterize symptoms and symptom relief in
      women with leiomyomas severe enough to seek interventional therapy. Secondly we will
      characterize a variety of symptoms utilizing standardized instruments for other pelvic
      diseases and symptoms to optimize comparisons with other disease processes.

      Clinical and scientific significance of the studies is high. We look to generate resources
      which can be used at a later time to assess the biologic and genetic variables affecting
      treatment outcome and to comprehensively assess the societal economic impact of uterine
      fibroids and their treatment with UAE and MRgFUS.

      Participants will be in the study for up to 36 months following fibroid treatment.
