    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      Determine the safety and feasibility of the chimeric antigen receptor NK92 cells transduced
      with the anti-CD33 vector (referred to as anti-CD33 CAR-NK cells).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. For patients with detectable disease, measure anti-leukemia response due to anti-CD33
      CAR-NK cell infusions.

      II. For patients with stored or accessible leukemia blasts, determine leukemia cell killing
      by anti-CD33 CAR-NK in vitro.

      III. Determine if cellular or humoral host immunity develops against the murine anti-CD33.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 group according to order of enrollment.

      Patients receive anti-CD33 CAR-NK (coupled with CD28, CD137 and CD3 zeta signalling domains)
      vector-transduced NK92 cell line on days 0,3, and 5 in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed intensively for 6 months, every 3
      months for 2 years, and annually thereafter for 10 years.
