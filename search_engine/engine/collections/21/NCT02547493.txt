      a treatment by sub-cutaneous abatacept in association with methotrexate who agreed to
      participate to the study.

      At the time of their inclusion, patients will be randomized for receiving either pneumococcal
      polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV) or pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV).

      The primary endpoint will be evaluated at one month after vaccination. The total of follow-up
      will be of 12 months.

      For the patients of the group PCV, the prime-boost strategy will be applied in order to be in
      accordance with the current French recommendation and a revaccination at 2 months after the
      initial vaccine will be realized with PPSV.
