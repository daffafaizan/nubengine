      HPV-associated lesions in the female genital tract. Findings suggest that HIV infection
      and/or HIV-related immunosuppression increases a woman's susceptibility to HPV infection or
      alters the natural history of preexisting HPV infection. Treatment with HAART has been shown
      to result in significant increases in CD4+ cell counts and "partial reconstitution" of the
      immune system. It is not known whether treatment of HIV infection with potent antiretroviral
      regimens could affect the persistence of HPV infection and progression of cervical dysplasia.
      This study is important for HIV-infected women because of the implications for gynecologic
      management and determination of cervical disease risk.

      At baseline, Weeks 24 and 48, and then every 48 weeks until study completion, women undergo
      pelvic examination and cervical specimens collection by the following methods: 1) Sno-strip;
      2) cervicovaginal lavage; 3) cervical brush method; and 4) Pap smear. A colposcopy is
      required for any woman who has an abnormal Pap smear reading unless the abnormal Pap smear is
      thought to be due to an intercurrent infection. A cervical biopsy is strongly recommended in
      the event of an abnormal colposcopy. Blood is collected for HPV antibody testing, viral load,
      and CD4 measures.
