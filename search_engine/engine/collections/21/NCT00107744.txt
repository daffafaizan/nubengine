    
      Background: Epidemiologic studies suggest that vegetable protein intake is inversely related
      to blood pressure.

      Objectives: To examine the effect of soybean protein supplementation on blood pressure in
      persons with prehypertension or stage-1 hypertension

      Design: Randomized, double-blind, controlled trial

      Study Participants: 350 participants, aged 35-64 years, with an initial untreated systolic
      blood pressure of 130-159 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure of 80-99 mmHg

      Intervention: Study participants will be randomly assigned to take 40-grams of isolated
      soybean protein supplements per day or complex carbohydrate control for 12 weeks.

      Outcomes: Blood pressure measurements will be obtained using random-zero sphygmomanometers at
      baseline and during the trial at weeks 6 and 12. Net changes in systolic and diastolic blood
      pressure before and after the intervention is the primary outcome.
