    
      Golimumab is a type of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor. TNF is a naturally occurring
      substance in the body and this substance may cause long-term inflammation. Golimumab may help
      treat this disease by blocking the activity of TNF in the body and reducing the symptoms of
      severe, persistent asthma.This study will assess the safety and effectiveness of
      subcutaneously (under the skin) administered golimumab and determine if there is a reduction
      of signs and symptoms in patients with active severe, persistent asthma. The effect of
      subcutaneously (SC) administered golimumab on the quality of life in patients with severe,
      persistent asthma will also be assessed. About 200 patients will take part in the study at
      approximately 60 centers worldwide. Participation in the study will last for about 42 weeks.
      The study consists of 3 phases: the screening phase (lasting between 1 and 4 weeks), the
      treatment phase (20 weeks), and the follow-up phase (20 weeks). Visits are scheduled to occur
      once every 4 weeks during the treatment and follow-up phases of the study. Patients eligible
      to take part in this study will be randomly placed into one of the following study groups:
      Group 1: Placebo (an inactive or dummy treatment that looks the same as the study drug,
      golimumab, but does not contain any active medication) from Week 0 through Week 20. Group 2:
      Golimumab 100 mg from Week 0 through Week 20. This study is "blinded." This means that
      neither patient nor study doctor will know in which group a patient is placed. However, if
      needed for safety or health reasons, the study doctor can find out a patient's study group at
      any time.

      Patients will receive an injection (under the skin) of placebo (Group 1) or golimumab 100 mg
      (Group 2) every 4 weeks from Week 0 through Week 20.
