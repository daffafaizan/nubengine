      the theoretically sound principles.The prevalence of obesity is increasing, and, accordingly,
      an increasing number of morbidly obese patients are eligible for Bariatric Surgery. This
      surgical procedure is highly effective and is often followed by resolution or remission of
      obesity related comorbidities (e.g. diabetes and obstructive sleep apnea). However, some
      individuals may have psychological and motivational problems that reduce these beneficial
      effects. Bariatric surgery represents a substantial part of total health care costs, and such
      costs may increase in the future. Another issue is that it is important to prevent
      post-surgical relapses. Hence, there is every reason to increase the effect and efficacy of
      both conservative treatments and bariatric surgery.

      Clinically the investigators meet patients who regain their weight post-surgically, and the
      investigators have some experience that these patients may display more dysfunctional eating
      than those who are able to maintain a lower target weight. Given the expected outcome of the
      RCT, the autonomous motivation for lifestyle changes will be increased. Lowering
      dysfunctional eating, as well as increasing the probability of better success in preoperative
      weight loss, may help the patient to maintain a healthier weight after the surgical
      procedure. Moreover, developing a more tailored intervention for surgery patients may enable
      new evidence based treatments to be established for these patients.
