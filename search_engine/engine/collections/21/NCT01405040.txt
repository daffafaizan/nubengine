    
      Transpulmonary thermodilution has been proposed to measure transpulmonary thermodilution
      cardiac output (TPTD), preload (GEDV, global end diastolic volume) and to quantify pulmonary
      edema (EVLW, extravascular lung water). The method currently available on the market is based
      on the estimation of time characteristics of the curve (mean transit time and down slope
      time).

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate a new transpulmonary thermodilution method to assess
      the TPTD, EVLW and GEDV in patients requiring cardiac preload and lung water assessment. Up
      to one hundred (100) patients will be enrolled at four (4) study sites, (up to 25 subjects at
      each site). Hôpitaux Universitaires de Genève, Universität Bonn, Stadtspital Triemli Zürich,
      and Universitätsklinikum Aachen will participate in the study.

      This is a prospective, observational data collection study.
