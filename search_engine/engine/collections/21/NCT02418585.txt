    
      This is a randomized, double-blind (neither the researchers nor the subjects know what
      treatment the subject is receiving), active-controlled, multicenter study (more than 1 study
      site) in subjects with TRD to assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of flexible doses
      of intranasal esketamine plus a newly initiated oral antidepressant compared with a newly
      initiated oral antidepressant (active comparator) plus intranasal placebo. The study will
      consist of 3 phases: Screening/Prospective Observational Phase (4-7 weeks), Double-blind
      Induction Phase (4-weeks), Follow-up Phase (24-weeks). Subjects who rollover into a long-term
      maintenance study will not participate in the Follow-up Phase. The antidepressant treatment,
      as well as any other ongoing medications being taken for depression at screening (including
      adjunctive/ augmentation therapies), will continue unchanged, at the same dosage, from the
      start of Week 1 through the end of Week 4 of the screening/prospective observational phase.
      Subjects' safety will be monitored throughout the study.
