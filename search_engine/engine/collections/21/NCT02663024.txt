    
      This is a randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, dose-ranging study, where patient will
      receive one of the three doses of GC1111 (0.5 mg/kg, 1.0 mg/kg, and 1.5 mg/kg) or ELAPRASE
      0.5 mg/kg. Approximately 20 patients will be administrated each study drug once every week as
      an iv infusion for 24 weeks. Efficacy of GC1111 will be evaluated in Six-Minute Walk Test
      (6MWT), urine Glycosaminoglycans(uGAG), liver and spleen volume, percent predicted Forced
      Vital Capacity(FVC), and cardiac size and function. Also immunogenicity, Pharmacokinetics(PK)
      and safety will be evaluated.
