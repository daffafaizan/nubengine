      of brain metastases. Patients with brain metastasis showed poor prognosis and displayed an
      untreated median survival of only 3-6 months, and most patients died due to the progression
      of brain metastases. Some research showed that Icotinib alone can improve the efficiency of
      NSCLC with brain metastases, but there is still unknow about the result about combination
      with EGFR-TKI and radiotherapy. This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy of icotinib
      combined with radiotherapy for NSCLC patients with brain metastases.
