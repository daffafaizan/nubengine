    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To define the phase II recommended dose of intracerebrally administered cytosine deaminase
      (CD)-expressing neural stem cells (NSCs) in combination with oral 5-fluorocytosine (FC)
      (flucytosine) and leucovorin.

      II. To determine the feasibility of treating study patients with more than 1 dose of NSCs
      followed by 7-day courses of 5-FC and leucovorin.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess for possible development of NSC immunogenicity (anti-NSC T cell and/or antibody
      response) with repeat doses of NSCs.

      II. To characterize the relationship between intracerebral and systemic concentrations of
      5-FC and 5-FU at the maximum tolerated dose/maximum feasible dose level.

      III. To describe the clinical benefit (defined as stable disease, partial response, or
      complete response) of this treatment regimen.

      IV. To determine, at time of autopsy, the fate of the NSCs.

      OUTLINE: This is dose-escalation study of CD-expressing genetically modified neural stem
      cells and flucytosine.

      Patients receive CD-expressing neural stem cells intracranially (IC) on days 1 and 15 and
      flucytosine orally (PO) every 6 hours on days 4-10 and 18-24. Depending on when a subject
      enters the study, s/he may also be given leucovorin orally every 6 hours on days 4-10 and
      18-24. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 30 days, 3 months, 6 months, 1
      year, and then annually thereafter.
