      I. To determine the rate of response according to the International Myeloma Working Group
      Criteria.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine progression free survival (PFS) at 2 years. II. To determine overall survival
      (OS). III. To determine duration of response (DOR). IV. To determine the clinical benefit
      rate (CBR). V. To evaluate safety of single agent treatment in this population. VI. To
      evaluate the immunogenicity of isatuximab.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive isatuximab intravenously (IV) over 5 hours on day 1 of cycle 1, and over 3
      hours thereafter on days 8, 15, and 22 of cycle 1, on days 1 and 15 of cycles 2-6, and on day
      1 of subsequent cycles. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 30 cycles in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6-12 months.
