      the feasibility of monitoring subject infection progress using Vitalbeat digital therapeutics
      monitoring platform for remote patient monitoring and integrated chronic disease management
      with mobile app, AI-bot, IoT wearables and cloud computing algorithms developed by health
      technology company Aventyn, Inc., in collaboration with Intel Corp., clinicians and
      scientists from Baylor Heart, Abrazo Health, Karolinska Institute, Dignity Health. Coromec
      registry is a real time epidemiology solution deploying Vitalbeat for pandemic public health
      stakeholders to enable immediate reporting, assess subject risk prediction for COVID-19
      avoiding hospitalization.

      The digital health technology aims to assess predictors of risk and predictors of preventing
      COVID-19, assess what preventive strategies are being used and the efficacy of treatment
      strategies for avoiding hospitalization. The platform launched globally and is available on
      the public internet at www.coromec.org

      Users can self-report symptoms, mental health assessment, chronic illness status and vital
      sign measures on a daily basis for risk assessment and preventive treatment with a variety of
      digital tools by downloading Coromec mobile app, access interactive chatbots and the Coromec
      real time epidemiology website Researchers aim to study ECL-19 as a drug treatment in
      stabilizing the endothelium as the first line of approach in COVID 19 positive subjects that
      may quickly restore their glycocalyx and endothelium thus avoiding hospitalizations and
      progression of disease with ECL-19

      A validated approach would enable vulnerable subjects and communities access to pandemic
      care. Registry data can assist public health scientists in further studies and enable global
      registries in future pandemic emergencies to help better understand use of digital tools,
      intelligent algorithms and predict risk outcomes with targeted novel treatment strategies
