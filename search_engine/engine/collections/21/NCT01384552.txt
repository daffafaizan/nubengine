      estimated prevalence of overweight and obesity was 68.0% [1]. Although there are no clear
      reasons for the current obesity epidemic, there is a general consensus that environmental
      dietary factors, such as package unit size, encourage excessive food intake and positive
      energy balance [2, 3]. It is believed that the package unit size of food indirectly
      influences food intake by impacting the accuracy of consumption monitoring [2, 4]. Large
      packages decrease the accuracy of consumption monitoring by making it difficult to assess how
      many servings have been consumed in one sitting, while small single-serving packages can
      increase the accuracy of consumption monitoring by providing a clear definition of what a
      standard serving is and how much one has consumed [2, 4, 5]. Therefore, it has been proposed
      that small, single-serving packages of snack foods may help reduce energy intake [4, 5]. To
      date, limited studies have been conducted in this area and the results are inconsistent
      [4-9]. Mixed results could be related to differences in participant variables, specifically
      weight status and level of dietary restraint (a term that refers to the amount of control
      exerted over food intake) [4, 9]. These individual characteristics may interact with food
      package unit size to influence one's food intake [2, 4]. Overweight individuals or restrained
      eaters may more closely monitor the volume of food they consume as compared to normal weight
      or unrestrained eaters [4, 9]. The [smaller] size of food packaging may aid in monitoring
      food consumption and thus, influence how much food is consumed in overweight and/or
      restrained eaters [2, 4]. Therefore, the objective of this study is to determine if weight
      status and the level of dietary restraint moderate the relationship between package unit size
      and food intake.

      Specific Aims:

        1. Determine the effect of dietary restraint on the relationship between package unit size
           and food intake.

        2. Determine the effect of weight status on the relationship between package unit size and
           food intake.

        3. Determine the combined effect of weight status and dietary restraint on the relationship
           between package unit size and food intake.
