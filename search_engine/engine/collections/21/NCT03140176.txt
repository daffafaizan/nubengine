      outcomes from Sunitinib use on one hand; and outcomes from the combined Sunitinib-2nd line
      sequence on the other hand in real life clinical practice.

      This will be addressed in many countries across AfME and in individual country cohorts to
      understand specificities and differences in use and outcomes
