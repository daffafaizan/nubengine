      mother/infant dyads recruited but not enrolled will be tracked. If provided, reasons for
      non-participation will be noted. Enrolled dyads will be tracked and monitored for the number
      of times the interventions are used and completeness of study data. Acceptability and burden
      will be assessed by theme analysis of the responses to the interview by the mPI's using
      traditional strategies of reading and re-reading the transcripts, coding participant
      responses using their language, and developing categories and subcategories to create a
      structure for considering acceptability will be completed.. Finally, perceptions of
      usefulness and satisfaction of the mothers will be assessed by looking at frequencies of
      Likert responses.

      Means and standard errors of the maternal stress and feeding behavior variables will be
      estimated and graphed across the data collection time points. Although the sample size is
      small, it is anticipated the mixed effects linear model will be used to assess and quantify
      changes across time. This model will include a random effect for participant and a fixed
      effect for time. The model is flexible enough to model potential cofactors, such as age at
      birth. The study will track the number of successfully obtained, transported, processed and
      stored samples and compare those number to the proposed maternal and infant cortisol
      collections.
