      peripheral blood stem cell transplantation using a nonmyeloablative preparative regimen and
      post-transplant cyclophosphamide. The overall objective of this study is to collect the
      efficacy and safety data to provide the basis to decide whether a larger study of clinical
      efficacy is warranted in this setting.
