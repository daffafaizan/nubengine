      characterized by ventilatory impairment that results in arterial hypoxemia. This condition
      worse during sleep and occurs in patients with normal mechanical properties of the lung. It
      is diagnosed in the absence of primary neuromuscular disease, identifiable brainstem lesions,
      and other sleep disturbances or substance use.

      Amiel et al. (2003) identified a mutation in the Phox2B gene associated with CCHS,
      characterized by 5 to 9 alanine expansions within a 20-residue polyalanine region in exon 3
      of the Phox2B gene. Several reports confirmed the findings of Amiel et al., supporting the
      view that this gene is a master switch for the development of the autonomic nervous system
      network linked to respiratory control. Transgenic animals carrying the human Phox2B mutation
      develop a similar phenotype and lack glutamatergic neurons located in the parafacial region
      in the brainstem, which are involved in breathing control.

      Although patients typically present with CCHS as newborns and rarely in later infancy, there
      have been reports of patients presenting with CCHS in adulthood. In cases of late-onset CCHS,
      most patients report having had some symptoms since childhood, and they have parents with a
      history of CCHS. Symptoms of right-side heart failure are generally observed at the time of
      diagnosis, and nocturnal noninvasive ventilation is frequently indicated.

      The present study reports a unique familial case of CCHS in which the father (proband)
      presented late-onset CCHS linked to a Phox2B gene expansion mutation. The presentation,
      course of development and treatment response for this patient was unique His son presented
      CCHS as a newborn, while his daughter did not.
