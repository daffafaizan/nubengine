      vaginal progesterone or pessary versus control (placebo) to prevent early preterm birth in
      women carrying twins and with a cervical length of less than 30 millimeters.

      Multiple gestation increases the risk of preterm delivery. Babies born preterm have increased
      rates of neonatal mortality and long-term neurodevelopmental morbidities. Short cervical
      length is known to be an important risk factor for spontaneous preterm birth and to occur
      more frequently in women with a twin gestation. Although there is no evidence that
      progesterone reduces the risk of preterm birth in multifetal gestation, there is evidence
      that progesterone reduces the risk of prematurity in singleton gestations complicated with a
      short cervix. The Arabin pessary has also been shown to reduce the risk of preterm birth
      among singletons with a short cervix, and in a secondary subgroup analysis of a recent study
      of the use of pessary in multiple gestations, women with a cervical length < 25th percentile
      had a significantly reduced risk of the primary composite neonatal adverse outcome. Secondary
      analysis of studies of vaginal progesterone in multiple gestation with a short cervix also
      suggest a possible beneficial effect on preterm delivery.
