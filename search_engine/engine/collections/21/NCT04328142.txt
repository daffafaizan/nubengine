      This study investigated the effectiveness of a Physiotherapy treatment versus a Qigong
      exercise programme for the improvement of the quality of life of subjects with Fibromyalgia.

      Design:

      A single-blind randomized clinical controlled trial.

      Setting:

      University of Extremadura, Spain

      Subjects:

      Interventions:

      141 Participants were randomized to a Qigong exercise program group (n=47), a physiotherapy
      treatment group (n=47) and control group (n=47) for 6 weeks.

      Main Measures:

      Measures were taken at baseline (week 0), pre intervention (week 1) and post intervention
      (week 6). The primary outcome measure were quality of life (Spanish Fibromyalgia Impact

      (Spirobank-G MIR spirometry) and balance (Wii-Fit, Nintendo Â©). The secondary outcome
      measures were flexibility (Wells and Dillon test and Sit and Reach test), Range of movement
      (goniometer), muscle strength (Lowett scale).
