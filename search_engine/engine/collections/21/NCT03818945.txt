      several methods. The problem is very annoying for the patients and making them seek for
      effective rapid treatment.

      It can affect several teeth in one area of the mouth or only one specific tooth. Careful
      diagnosis of such condition necessitates precise differentiation of its signs and symptoms
      from the other causes of tooth sensitivity which may be resulted from dental caries, micro
      leakage, cracked tooth or fractured restoration. There are two well-known ways to reduce the
      discomfort of the hypersensitivity either by blocking the exposed dentinal tubules by
      occluding materials or use some depolarizing agents that reducing the excitability of the
      intra dental nerves.Most of the desensitizing agents reduces the dentin hypersensitivity by
      its own way and each one has different long lasting effect. But there are some drawbacks that
      appeared with their use. Fluoride based agents were appeared in 90's but it was clarified
      that their high concentration irritated the odontoblasts. Furthermore, the oxalates and
      potassium nitrate were introduced to treat the hypersensitivity effectively but their effects
      did not persist for a long period of time.

      Sodium fluoride varnish is one from the most commonly used desensitizing agent and its
      efficacy was approved in many studies. The Giomer varnish containing surface pre-reactive
      glass particles (S-PRG) is a light-cured protective varnish and it was introduced to promote
      prolonged protection for the hypersensitive dentin.
