      Multiforme (GBM). Stratum 2-patients with Anaplastic Glioma [anaplastic astrocytoma (AA),

      BG at 120mg/m2 administered intravenously over 1 hour followed immediately by 48-hour
      infusion at 30mg/m2/24hrs. Temozolomide 472mg/m2 administered orally, in fasting state,
      within 60 minutes of end of the 1-hour administration of BG infusion. Treatment cycles may be
      repeated every 28 days following dose of Temodar from previous cycle.

      Temodar has been well tolerated by both adults and children with most common toxicity being
      mild myelosuppression. Other, less likely, potential toxicities include nausea and vomiting,
      constipation, headache, alopecia, rash, burning sensation of skin, esophagitis, pain,
      diarrhea, lethargy, hepatotoxicity, anorexia, fatigue and hyperglycemia. Hypersensitivity
      reactions have not yet been noted with Temodar. As in the case with many anti-cancer drugs,
      Temodar may be carcinogenic. BG toxicities include agitation, lethargy, nausea, vomiting,
      rapid heart rate, elevated liver functions, & leukemia; but, not with BG as single agent.
      Transient lymphopenia has been seen with BG as single agent.
