      I. To estimate the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) for several imaging modalities in brain
      malignancy as compared with normal brain parenchyma separately by type of malignancy and
      treatment status.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To assess the conspicuity of each imaging modality to differentiate radiation necrosis
      from progressive disease.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess patient experience in the 7 Tesla (7T) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) system
      compared to their most recent MRI examination.

      II. To assess the typical significance values seen for areas of maximal brain activity
      associated with each functional MRI (fMRI) test.

      III. To assess the geometric distortion of a radiation planning sequence on a ultra-high
      field (UHF) system.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo 7T MRI over 60 minutes.
