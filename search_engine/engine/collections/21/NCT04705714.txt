      pockets of patients with chronic periodontitis. Frankincense extract displayed an
      antibacterial activity with a range of minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) values from
      1.5 mg/ml to 25 mg/ml. Frankincense extract decreased the bacterial growth by 58.3 % and
      increased the leakage of nucleotides in 33.3 % of isolates. It also reduced the extracellular
      polysaccharide production and the cell surface hydrophobicity in the tested isolates. Crystal
      violet assay revealed inhibition of biofilm formation by the frankincense extract.
      Examination of the biofilm formation by both light microscope and SEM before and after
      treatment with the frankincense extract confirmed the reduction of biofilm formation. The
      downregulation of the genes encoding the virulence factors that are linked to biofilm
      formation (fimA, hagA, and hagB), detected by quantitative RT-PCR, explained the inhibitory
      effect of biofilm formation. This study examined the potential of frankincense extract to
      have an antibacterial activity against P. gingivalis periodontal pathogen; thus, it could be
      used in health care products as a treatment approach for periodontitis.
