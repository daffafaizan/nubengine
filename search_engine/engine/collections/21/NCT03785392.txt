      approach to the interscalene brachial plexus block. The patient population with pulmonary
      comorbidities with poor reserve cannot afford to have a further deterioration of their
      pulmonary status due to phrenic nerve blockade. These patients are not ideal candidates for
      increased opiate therapy for intraoperative and post-surgical pain as well due to further
      depression of their respiratory function. To optimize their pain control as well as avoid any
      respiratory-related morbidity and mortality, it is ideal to develop a technique which can
      provide appropriate brachial plexus block at the interscalene level while completely avoiding
      any local anesthetic spread to the phrenic nerve.

      The study aims to examine the influence of out of plane interscalene approach to a brachial
      plexus block on the effect of phrenic nerve blockade. Practitioner preference and
      institutional norms often influence the in plane approach for the above-mentioned block. The
      most common practice at our institution is the in plane approach to the brachial plexus
      block.
