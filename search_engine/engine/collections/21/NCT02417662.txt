    
      SARON is a confirmatory phase III study examining the efficacy and safety of stereotactic
      ablative radiotherapy (SABR) and conventional radiotherapy (RT) alongside standard
      chemotherapy in patients with oligometastatic non-small cell lung cancer.

      Current treatment for this group of patients is systemic anti-cancer therapy. The choice of
      SACT is determined by the treating clinician and will be supplied from hospital commercial
      stock, and prepared and administered according to institutional guidelines. There is
      sufficient evidence regarding the safety of SABR, its effect on local control and a possible
      impact on overall survival. This trial will further examine overall survival, progression
      free survival and local control, as well as toxicity, feasibility, patient reported outcomes
      and health resource use.

      There will be a feasibility analysis performed after 50 patients have been randomised. This
      will assess the practicality of achieving recruitment targets, logistics of delivering the
      experimental treatment and the potential for contamination (as patients may seek SABR outside
      of the trial if randomised to the non SABR arm). There will also be a parallel thoracic SABR
      safety and feasibility study after recruitment and treatment of 20 patients with thoracic
      metastases.

      This is a multicentre randomised phase III study based on patients with oligometastatic
      NSCLC.

      Trial arms:

      Control Arm: systemic anti-cancer therapy alone (SACT) Experimental Arm: SACT plus radical RT
      to primary and SABR and/or SRS to metastases
