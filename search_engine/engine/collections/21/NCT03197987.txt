      colorectal cancer screening. Adenoma detection rate is a marker of high quality colonoscopy
      and a high adenoma detection rate is associated with a lower incidence of interval cancers.
      Several technological advancements have been explored to improve adenoma detection rate.
      Endocuff Vision™ has been shown to improve adenoma detection rate in several studies.
      Cap-assisted colonoscopy is a technique that allow improved visualization of the colonic
      folds by flattening the fold within the viewing field. However, studies have reported mixed
      results on adenoma detection in cap-assisted colonoscopy.

      This is a prospective, single-centre, randomized controlled trial comparing the adenoma
      detection rate in patients undergoing Endocuff Vision™-assisted colonoscopy versus
      cap-assisted colonoscopy. Patients are randomized according to bowel cancer screening status
      to receive Endocuff Vision™-assisted colonoscopy or cap colonoscopy on the day of procedure.
      Baseline data, colonoscopy, and polyp data including histology are collected. Patients are
      followed up at 30 days for complications. This study will take place in an University
      Hospital in Spain. A maximum of 9 expert colonoscopists will recruit a total of 712 patients.

      This is the first trial to evaluate the adenoma detection rate of Endocuff Vision™ vs cap
      colonoscopy in all screening, surveillance, and diagnostic patient groups. This study will
      guide clinicians to decide what device to use to increase adenoma detection rate in routine
      colonoscopy
