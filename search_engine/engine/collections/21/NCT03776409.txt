    
      The combination of vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam has been associated with an
      increased risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) in non-critically ill patient populations, but
      limited data regarding this association exists in critically ill patients. The objective of
      this study is to compare AKI and efficacy of vancomycin plus piperacillin-tazobactam or
      beta-lactams.

      This is a multicenter, retrospective cohort study. Patients from the retrospective cohort
      will be divided into 2 groups based on the combination regimen received . Patients who meet
      the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be included in our registry. As a non-intervention
      study, these information as below will be collected: basic demographics, diagnosis,
      concomitant nephrotoxic and other antibiotic medications, serum creatine levels, vancomycin
      concentrations, and indication for antibiotics.
