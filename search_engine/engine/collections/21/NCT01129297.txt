      risk factor for this condition. More than 80% of the diabetic subjects are obese. By analogy
      with the metabolic syndrome, the close association between obesity and T2D justifies the
      recognition of a new disease entity named by the neologism "diabesity".

      This study will examine the contribution of different genetic variants on "diabesity"
      development, by integrating multiple genomics approaches (linkage analysis on whole genome,
      transcriptomics and bioinformatics) and analysis of biological pathways in relevant animals
      models and humans.
