      Tropical Medicine (CCVTM), Oxford. There will be 6 study groups and a total of 48 volunteers
      will be enrolled. Groups 1-3 will receive ChAdOx1 Zika alone. Groups 4-6 will receive a
      co-administration of ChAdOx1 Zika and ChAdOx1 Chik administered contralaterally. Staggered
      enrolment will apply for the first three volunteers within each group.
