      care unit and emergency department. It allows continuous hemodynamic monitoring and repeated
      arterial blood sampling. Although severe complications are rare, successful radial artery
      cannulation can be technically challenging, particularly in hypotensive patients and those
      with vascular disease. Multiple unsuccessful attempts at arterial cannulation increase
      patient discomfort, delay timely care and may also contribute to adverse events such as
      arterial spasm or local hematoma.

      The radial artery is traditionally located by palpation. A number of techniques to aid radial
      artery localization have been described. Doppler-assisted radial arterial cannulation was
      first described in 1976. Several case reports suggest that Doppler can be helpful in patients
      with difficult arterial access. More recently, ultrasound-guided radial artery cannulation
      has been described. In a recent meta-analysis of four randomized controlled trials,
      ultrasound increased the rate of cannulation on the first attempt by 71% compared with
      palpation. However, two of the studies were of children and all four were small, with 30-152
      participants (311 in total), making the generalizability of these results to adult patients
      uncertain. Furthermore, variation in the training and experience of the operators was evident
      within one of the studies.

      Accordingly, the aim of this study is to compare three different radial arterial cannulation
      techniques in adult surgical patients when performed by anesthesia residents: Doppler;
      palpation; and ultrasound. We think that ultrasound would have a higher rate of cannulation
      on the first attempt compared with other techniques.
