      Primary

        -  Identify all applied therapy strategies in pediatric patients with craniopharyngioma.

        -  Correlate relapse status with different therapy strategies/modality in these patients.

        -  Determine the health status (i.e., ophthalmologic, neuropediatric, and endocrine
           findings) and the health-related quality of life of these patients after treatment.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the incidence of craniopharyngioma in pediatric patients.

        -  Identify quality control measures for diagnosis and therapy in these patients.

        -  Improve long-term care through a standardized follow-up program in these patients.

        -  Determine the efficacy of endocrine substitution for postoperative hypopituitarism in
           these patients.

        -  Identify risk factors for developing obesity and correlate the neurotransmitter
           concentration of leptin and neuropeptide Y in cerebral spinal fluid, serum, and
           craniopharyngioma cystic fluid with the likelihood of developing obesity in these
           patients.

        -  Determine the incidence and extent of eating disorders in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients undergo neurologic, endocrine, and ophthalmologic tests and anthropometric
      diagnostic measurements. Patients then undergo 1 of the following surgical procedures: total
      resection; incomplete, subtotal, or partial resection; biopsy; or cyst pressure release.
      Patients whose tumor relapses may undergo a second resection and/or radiotherapy.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline and then periodically thereafter.

      After surgery, patients are followed periodically.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 120 patients will be accrued for this study.
