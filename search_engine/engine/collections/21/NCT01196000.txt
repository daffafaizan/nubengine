      I. To evaluate robotic-assisted rectal cancer surgery versus standard laparoscopic rectal
      cancer resection by means of a randomized, controlled trial.

      II. To assess technical ease of the operation, as determined by the clinical indicator of low
      conversion rate to open operation.

      III. To assess surgical accuracy and improved oncological outcome as determined by clear
      pathological resection margins.

      IV. To assess quality of life and analyze cost-effectiveness to aid evidence-based knowledge
      to inform NHS and other service providers and decision-makers.

      V. To analyze disease-free and overall survival and local recurrence rates at 3-year
      follow-up.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients undergo standard laparoscopic resection.

      ARM II: Patients undergo robotic-assisted laparoscopic resection.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 month, 6 months, and then
      annually thereafter for 3 years.
