    
      OBJECTIVE:

      The objective of this protocol is to investigate the local response of the retinal pigment
      epithelium (RPE) across the posterior pole of the eye by recording the focal electrooculogram
      (EOG) in participants with macular disease.

      STUDY POPULATION:

      Up to 50 healthy volunteers and 80 participants, age 10 or older, with macular disorders
      affecting the retina/retinal pigment epithelium complex. Examples of such macular disorders
      include Stargardt s disease and age-related macular degeneration (AMD).

      DESIGN:

      This single-center, observational, case-control study will be comprised of three related
      aims. The first aim is focused on developing the focal EOG method which will require
      parameter optimization. The second aim is focused on establishing the normal range and
      variability of the focal EOG in normal volunteers. The third aim is to examine the focal EOG
      in participants with macular disease.

      OUTCOME MEASURES:

      The primary outcome for this study is to develop a method for recording the focal EOG. The
      secondary outcome will be to establish the normal range for the focal EOG and determine the
      inter-session and intra-session variabilities of this test. Exploratory outcomes include: 1)
      to examine the focal EOG in participants with macular diseases and 2) determine the
      inter-session and intra-session variabilities of this test in participants with macular
      diseases.
