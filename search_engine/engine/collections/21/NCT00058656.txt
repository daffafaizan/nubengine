    
      This is a Phase I/II single arm dose escalation study of a novel T cell immunotherapy for
      chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Patients will receive one dose of Xcellerated T
      Cells(tm), an ex vivo activated and expanded autologous T cell product, in an attempt to
      enhance immune responses with anti-tumor activity. This study is being conducted to test the
      safety and determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of Xcellerated T Cells in patients with
      CLL. In addition, lymphocyte counts, lymph node area, and quantitative immunoglobulins will
      be assessed for preliminary evidence of a therapeutic effect. In correlative studies, changes
      in the phenotype of T and B lymphocytes will be evaluated by flow cytometry. Changes in T
      cell repertoire and anti-tumor immune activity will also be assessed. It is expected that 12
      to 18 patients will be treated.
