      incidence of 4-7/1000/year. More recent literature describes a 1-3% rate over the course of a
      lifetime, most typically affecting individuals between the ages of 35 and 50.

      Tennis elbow is a common occurrence in the general population that causes lateral elbow pain
      and diminished grip strength, which may be debilitating. Most affected individuals achieve
      symptom resolution within 6 months to 1 year with measures such as physiotherapy,
      anti-inflammatories and corticosteroid injections, but a small subset will go on to develop
      chronic symptoms. Chronic tennis elbow can be treated surgically, by arthroscopic tennis
      elbow release (ATER), which has gained popularity in recent years as it presents a less
      invasive option, allows for direct visualization of the elbow joint for other pathology and
      has a faster return-to-work time compared to other surgical procedures. Despite its promise
      there have been no high quality studies evaluating the efficacy of arthroscopic tennis elbow
      release, bringing the actual efficacy of this procedure into question. A randomized
      controlled trial on arthroscopic tennis elbow release would provide much needed evidence in
      order to define its role in the management of tennis elbow and to help refine treatment
      protocols.
