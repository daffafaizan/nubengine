      (100% O2 and ambient air). They are examined immediately after each HBO/ ambient air therapy.
      The allocation is randomized treated every three weeks with 2-hour therapies using pure O2 or
      indoor air. Randomized and double-blinded in a cross-over setting, one group of patients with
      type 2 diabetes is first treated with HBO therapy and the other group is first treated with
      room air. Here, an ambient pressure of 2.4 ATM is built up and then administered for
      respiration over a total of 90 minutes of pure O2. Patients are examined on two consecutive
      days for each part of the study.On the first day serum samples are taken and a sample is
      taken from the vastus lateralis muscle. A magnetic resonance spectroscopic examination (MRS)
      is performed on the patient subsequently. In this case, phosphorus metabolites (absolute
      quantification of ATP, Pi) and the ATP synthase flow rate (fATP) are determined
      non-invasively by means of 31P MRS and TG storage (HCL) by means of 1H-MRS.

      On the next day of the trial patients are treated with HBO therapy or room air. A
      hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp test (120-300 min) with administration of deuterated
      glucose (D- [6,6-2H2] glucose) (0-120 min) to measure muscular and hepatic insulin resistance
      will be performed after the end of HBO therapy or room air treatment performed. Indirect
      calorimetry determines energy consumption and substrate selection (lipid and glucose
      oxidation) in hyperinsulinaemia. After the end of the HBO therapy or room air treatment and
      30 minutes after the start of the clamp test, a sample is taken from the vastus lateralis
      muscle again.
