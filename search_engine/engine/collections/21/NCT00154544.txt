      medium) DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum and incubated at 37 C in 5% CO2 incubator. The
      rationale of using HCC cell line instead of clinical HCC samples is that HCC tissues are
      heterogeneous and might contain some non-HCC cells. The cell will be harvested when cells
      reach 95% confluence.

      Sera collection 20 mL of venous 20 mL of venous blood was collected from 20 HBV-related HCC
      and 20 HCV-related HCC patients before treatment. The venous blood was allowed to clot,
      centrifuged at 800 g for 5 min, and serum was aliquoted and stored at -80 0C. Control sera
      were obtained from 20 HBV carriers without HCC, 20 chronic hepatitis C patients without HCC,
      and 10 normal subjects without liver diseases.

      Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis using patients' sera for immunoblotting will be done.
      Spots of interest will be identified by delayed extraction matrix-assisted laser desorption
      ionization.
