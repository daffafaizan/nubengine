      loss in the aging population. Intravitreal anti-VEGF agents constitute the mainstay in the
      treatment of neovascular AMD.

      Aflibercept is a recombinant fusion protein targeting vascular endothelial growth factor
      A(VEGF A) and placenta growth factor (PlGF), developed for intravitreal administration in
      conditions such as neovascular age related macular degeneration, macular edema due to retinal
      vein occlusion, diabetic macular edema or myopic choroidal neovascularization. However,
      treatment with anti-VEGFs like aflibercept, carries a potential risk of arterial
      thromboembolic events, including stroke and myocardial infarction.
