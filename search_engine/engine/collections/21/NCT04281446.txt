      ovarian cycle and the influence of photobiomodulation therapy in this setting. Methods: The
      research will be conducted in two subprojects - Subproject I is a cross-sectional study.
      Initially the participants will be evaluated in two days separately, being the first day
      within the ovarian cycle in the follicular phase (FF) and the second day in the luteal phase
      (FL). The aspects of body composition, body water volume by infrared thermography and skin
      temperature will be evaluated, and the physical performance evaluation will be constituted by
      the evaluation of the muscular performance by isokinetic dynamometer, and by a treadmill
      maximal effort test. , together with analysis of VO2max and blood lactate levels. Subproject
      II is a double-blind placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial. After completion of
      subproject I, during the next ovarian cycle within the participants will return to conduct
      the second part of the study, which will analyze the influence of photobiomodulation therapy
      on the physical performance of women within their menstrual cycle, related to low hormone
      rate ( FF). 180 J of energy will be applied before each evaluation, which is muscle
      performance and endurance. The tests will be performed in the same order, following the same
      protocol in both phases of the study. For data analysis, a normality test will be used to
      verify the distribution and statistical tests consistent with the appropriate intra and
      intergroup comparisons, being considered two factors in the comparisons, time and group. A
      significance level of 5% will be adopted. The effect size will be calculated by Cohens'd.
