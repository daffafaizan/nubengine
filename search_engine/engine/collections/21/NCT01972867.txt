      cancer criteria defined by this protocol. The biopsy and imaging techniques that we will
      adopt within this trial are multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) and transperineal prostate biopsy
      (template mapping and/or limited targeted). The subjects' prostate cancer foci, the location
      of which will be determined by ultrasound guided transperineal prostate biopsy, will be
      targeted for treatment with the NanoKnife System. The primary objective of this the study
      will be to evaluate procedural and short-term post treatment safety of the NanoKnife
      treatment via incidence of adverse events and evaluation of effect on urologic (urinary and
      erectile) function. The secondary objective of this study is to evaluate the short term
      efficacy of the NanoKnife treatment. Local efficacy in the area of treatment will be assessed
      by histological evaluation of transperineal prostate biopsy cores at six (6) months post
      NanoKnife treatment, to evaluate the ablation zone created by the NanoKnife treatment. Other
      secondary outcomes include health-related quality of life levels evaluated using validated
      patient questionnaires. Following the 6 month transperineal prostate biopsy and mpMRI
      assessment, the data from these 6 subjects will be submitted to FDA for confirmation of short
      term safety and efficacy.
