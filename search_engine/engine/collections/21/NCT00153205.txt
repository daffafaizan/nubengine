    
      This is a prospective cohort study at Children's Hospital and Brigham and Women's Hospital
      (BWH), before and after the introduction of two distinct interventions. The first
      intervention at Children's Hospital was the introduction of clinical pharmacists on inpatient
      pediatric wards to target errors at the stages of physician ordering and nurse transcription.
      The second intervention is technological: the introduction of physician computer order entry
      at the BWH neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). This intervention will most effectively
      target errors at the stage of physician ordering, and secondarily address errors at the stage
      of pharmacy dispensing and nurse transcription. Data on serious medication errors will be
      collected pre and post each intervention.
