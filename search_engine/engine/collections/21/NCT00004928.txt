        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of calcitriol administered with zoledronate in
           patients with progressive prostate cancer.

        -  Assess the effects of this regimen on calcium homeostasis and bone turnover in this
           patient population.

        -  Assess changes in PSA in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine other antitumor effects of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of calcitriol.

      Patients receive oral calcitriol weekly for 3 consecutive days and zoledronate IV monthly.
      Treatment continues in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of calcitriol until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 3
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.
