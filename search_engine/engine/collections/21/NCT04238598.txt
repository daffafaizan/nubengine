    
      Patients Adult patients with intractable knee pain for more than 6 months and radiographic
      evidence of grade II, III or IV knee osteoarthritis. Must not have had a knee injection or
      other interventional procedure for knee pain within the past 12 weeks. Must be on stable
      medications for the past 12 weeks and willing to keep medications stable for the first 12
      weeks of the study.

      Study Design Pilot study will enroll 30 patients randomized 1:1:1.

        1. Active control - intra-articular 4 milliliters 0.5% bupivacaine + 10mg dexamethasone +
           sham Pulsed Radiofrequency

        2. Placebo control - intra-articular 5 milliliters 0.9% saline + sham Pulsed Radiofrequency

        3. Treatment group - intra-articular 5 milliliters 0.5% bupivacaine + Pulsed Radiofrequency

      Methods Two 18-gauge radiofrequency needle with 10 millimeter active tip will be placed
      intra-articularly from an anterolateral and anteromedial approach to target the medial and
      lateral compartments. Once satisfactory fluoroscopic placement is noted, the Pulsed
      Radiofrequency or sham-Pulsed Radiofrequency treatment will be administered. Subsequently,
      the injectate will be administered. Dexamethasone is selected as the corticosteroid as it is
      colorless and will be indistinguishable from the saline used in the Intra-articular Pulsed
      Radiofrequency and placebo groups.
