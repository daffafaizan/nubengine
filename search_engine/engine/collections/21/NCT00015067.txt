      methylphenidate (MPD) daily for treating cocaine dependence. This within-subject study was
      completed in an inpatient setting. It was non-blinded for MPD dose and single-blinded for
      cocaine dose. Each patient was given intravenous cocaine at 0, 20 and 40 mg while at three
      different steady state levels of MPD (0, 60 and 90 mg). Seven non-treatment seeking cocaine
      addicts, who were recruited from the community, completed the study. There were no cardiac
      rhythm abnormalities noted except for sinus tachycardia and sinus bradycardia. There were no
      incidences of seizures or myocardial ischemia. In a repeated measures ANOVA, MPD was shown to
      have an independent positive effect on heart rate (p=0.0001) but not on SBP or DBP. There was
      no cocaine by MPD interaction for any vital sign. Peak systolic blood pressure (SBP) and
      diastolic blood pressure (DBP) for any patient up to 60 minutes after infusion was 169 mm and
      108 mm, respectively. The first occurred when 60 mg of MPD and placebo cocaine were given and
      the second when no MPD and placebo cocaine were given. Peak heart rate for any patient up to
      60 min after infusion was 143/min at 60 mg of MPD and 40mg of cocaine. The number of adverse
      events reported when cocaine and MPD were given together was less than the number reported
      when either drug was given alone. The adverse events reported when cocaine and MPD were given
      together included headache, nervousness, and lightheadedness. Subjective ratings of drug
      effect revealed that MPD did not enhance patients' response to, or desire for, cocaine. MPD
      appears to be a safe drug to use in cocaine addicts who continue to use cocaine at the
      dosages tested.
