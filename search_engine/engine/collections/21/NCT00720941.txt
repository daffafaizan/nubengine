      subjects with advanced RCC who have received no prior systemic therapy for advanced or
      metastatic RCC. Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 800mg pazopanib
      to be administered once daily orally continuous dosing or 50mg sunitinib to be administered
      in 6-week cycles: 50mg orally daily for 4 weeks followed by 2 weeks off treatment. Subjects
      are permitted to receive supportive care throughout the study including transfusion of blood
      and blood products, treatment with antibiotics, anti-emetics, anti-diarrheal agents,
      analgesics, erythropoietin, or bisphosphonates, when appropriate. The study treatment will
      continue until subjects experience disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdraw
      consent, or death.
