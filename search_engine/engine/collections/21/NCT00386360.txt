      "microarchitecture" level, without the need for invasive bone biopsies. The primary objective
      is to evaluate the sensitivity of the technology to detect a difference between those treated
      with risedronate 35mg OAW (once a week) or placebo. Early phase postmenopausal women with
      osteopenia have been chosen because they have a more rapid and higher level of bone loss
      during the first few years of the menopause.
