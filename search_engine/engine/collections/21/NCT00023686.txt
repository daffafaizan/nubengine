        -  Compare overall survival in patients with stage II prostate cancer treated with radical
           prostatectomy vs brachytherapy.

        -  Compare metastasis-free survival and probability of survival without symptoms of
           patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the side effects of these treatment regimens in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo radical prostatectomy.

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo brachytherapy with implanted iodine I 125 or palladium Pd 103
           seeds Patients are followed every 6 months for 5 years and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 1,980 patients (990 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 5.5 years.
