      must have at least one measurable lesion that can be accurately assessed according to RECIST
      v.1.1. Potential eligible patients will be screened to assess somatic (s) BRCA promoter
      methylation at an reference central laboratory. Germinal (g) BRCA mutational status will be
      analyzed also centrally at 'Myriad Genetics GmBh' laboratory unless the BRCA mutational
      status is already known based on a Myriad previous report. Patients with a positive
      methylation status on at least one of the two genes and lacking of known deleterious or
      suspected deleterious mutations in both genes could be enrolled in the study and receive
      olaparib.

      Blood and tumor samples collected from all screened patients could be used for the biomarker
      analysis, including the assessment of germline methylation status and gene expression levels
      of BRCA1/2. An early efficacy review will be performed after 12 evaluable patients are
      enrolled; if at least 4 of them show tumour response, additional patients will be included to
      complete a total of 34 patients.
