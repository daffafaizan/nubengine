    
      Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) that
      inhibits angiogenesis and extends survival in non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
      patients when given with carboplatin and paclitaxel. TRC105 is an antibody to endoglin, an
      essential angiogenic target expressed on proliferating endothelial cells that is distinct
      from the VEGFR and overexpressed in response to VEGF inhibition. TRC105 inhibits
      angiogenesis, tumor growth and metastases in preclinical models and complements the activity
      of antibodies and small molecules that target the VEGFR. In a phase 1b study, the combination
      of TRC105 and bevacizumab produced radiographic reductions in tumor volume in
      bevacizumab-refractory patients, and was well tolerated. TRC105 was also well tolerated with
      chemotherapy in a trial with capecitabine in breast cancer patients. The use of TRC105 with
      bevacizumab and paclitaxel/carboplatin may result in more effective angiogenesis inhibition
      and improved clinical efficacy over that seen with bevacizumab and paclitaxel/carboplatin
      alone.
