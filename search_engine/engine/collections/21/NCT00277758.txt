      of IL2 immunotherapy in combination with Pegylated Interferon Alpha (PEG-IFN-alpha)
      /Ribavirin (RBV) antiviral therapy for the treatment of individuals infected with Hepatitis C
      virus (HCV) genotype I. The study is designed to determine whether immunotherapy
      immunotherapy with low dose daily IL-2 can be safely added to the standard antiviral therapy
      of 48 weeks of PEG-IFN and RBV. Because IL-2 targets recently antigen- activated T cells,
      IL-2 therapy will be initiated 12 weeks before PEG-IFN/RBV therapy, when HCV antigen load is
      high, to activate and expand HCV antigen-specific T cells prior to the initiation of
      antiviral therapy.
