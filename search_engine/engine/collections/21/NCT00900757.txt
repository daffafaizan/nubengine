      in primary malignant glioma patients receiving radiation therapy (RT) and concomitant
      temozolomide (TMZ). All eligible patients should receive a planned total dose of 54-60 GY of
      radiation and 75 mg/m2 of daily temozolomide for a total of six weeks of treatment. For each
      week of radiation patients will receive a single 0.25 mg intravenous dose of palonosetron
      approximately 30 minutes before each week of radiation fraction. This schedule will be
      repeated for each week of radiation for a total of 6 weeks. After the start of radiation the
      type of rescue medication will be up to the investigator's discretion (however given the
      results of recent published phase II study by Navari et. al. we recommend using olanzapine
      for rescue medication). All patients will be given written informed consent.
