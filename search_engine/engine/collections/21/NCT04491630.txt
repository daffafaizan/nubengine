    
      The primary aim of this study (Aim 1) is to compare the immediate effects of self-hypnosis
      (SH), mindfulness meditation (MM), and Christian meditation (CM), relative to a control group
      (CN), for increasing pain tolerance and reducing pain intensity and pain-related stress, in
      response to experimental painful stimulation in a sample of healthy volunteers.

      An exploratory aim of this study (Aim 2) is to identify possible shared and unique predictors
      of response to the three treatment conditions. The possible predictors we plan to test
      include sex, age, religious affiliation, hypnotic suggestibility, baseline mindfulness,
      acceptance, pain-related beliefs, religiosity, trait spirituality, previous experience with
      SH, MM and CP, outcome expectancies, and trait absorption.

      This is a randomized quantitative experimental mixed-model repeated-measures study with three
      assessment points: baseline (T0), pre-test (T1), and post-test (T2). Eligible healthy adults
      will be randomized to one of the four study conditions. Interventions will be a 20-minutes
      audio-guided practice of either self-hypnosis, mindfulness meditation, or Christian prayer.
      Participants in the control group will not be instructed to use any specific strategy during
      the painful stimulation. Participants will be submitted to a first cycle of Cold Pressor Arm
      Wrap. They will then listen to a 20-minutes audio recording inducing one of the three
      interventions, or, in the case of the control group, to a 20-minutes recording of a natural
      history textbook. Primary outcomes are pain intensity, pain tolerance, and pain-related
      stress as measured by salivary cortisol level and heart rate variability.
