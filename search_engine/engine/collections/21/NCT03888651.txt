      I. Assess prevalence of chronic opioid use and severity of symptom burden (M. D. Anderson
      Symptom Inventory-Head and Neck [MDASI-HN]) in patients undergoing surgery of head/neck
      cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To investigate the extent of association of chronic opioid use with risk of opioid use
      disorder (as assessed by Screener and Opioid Assessment for Patients with Pain[SOAPP-14] and
      Cut down, Annoyed, Guilty and Eye Opener [CAGE] scores) and psychosocial factors (as assessed
      by MDASI).

      II. To assess frequency of positive risk of opioid use disorder as assessed by Screener and
      Opioid Assessment for Patients tool (SOAPP-14) and CAGE-adapted to include drugs (AID).

      III. Assess frequency of aberrant opioid use behaviors. IV. Assess frequency of
      post-operative complications.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients complete questionnaires and quality of life assessments over 10-15 minutes at
      pre-surgery, after-surgery, at discharge, within 2-3 weeks after surgery, and within 90 days
      after surgery.
