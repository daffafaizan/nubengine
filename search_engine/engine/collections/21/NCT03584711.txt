      tolerability of the combination of FOLFOX plus panitumumab according to a "stop and go"
      strategy. If disease control is achieved while on induction treatment, oxaliplatin and
      panitumumab will be stopped after the sixth cycle; a maintenance treatment of
      fluoropyrimidine alone will be continued. In case of progression during maintenance
      treatment, oxaliplatin and panitumumab reintroduction loops will take place according to the
      same regimen (maintenance treatment after six cycles of the reintroduced therapy if disease
      control is achieved).
