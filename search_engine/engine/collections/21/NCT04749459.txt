    
      A single-center, randomized, evaluator blind, intra-individual comparison, no treatment and
      positive controlled clinical study to determine the SPF of two ChapStick sunscreen-containing
      lip balms as per ISO 24444:2010. For each participant, 4 test sites will have a random
      assignment number for up to two test materials, control standard, and minimal erythemal dose
      of unprotected skin (MEDu), with at least 3 of the test sites being utilized for application.
      All three test sites will be exposed to UV radiation at the expected MED and subsequently
      evaluated for erythema 16-24 hours after UV exposure.
