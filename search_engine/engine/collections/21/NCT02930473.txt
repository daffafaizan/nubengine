    
      This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of a psychotherapeutic intervention model in nursing
      on nursing diagnosis "Anxiety" (according to International Classification for Nursing
      Practice (ICNP)/North American Nursing Diagnoses Association (NANDA) standardized nursing
      language). A randomised controlled trial will be carried out to do so. In a single-blinded
      nurse-led 6 months controlled trial, conducted at a hospital outpatient setting in Portugal,
      approximately 60 patients with anxiety will be randomised to the intervention (n=30) or
      control groups (n=30). The objective is to compare the outcomes associated with
      "treatment-as-usual" and the benefits of implementing the psychotherapeutic intervention
      model in nursing previously developed (5 sessions), which will be evaluated using Nursing
      Outcomes Classification (NOC) outcomes "Anxiety Level" and "Anxiety Self-Control" (Portuguese
      version).
