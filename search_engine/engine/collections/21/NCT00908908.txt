      radio-labeled 14C-eribulin and collection of PK samples, and the Extension Phase when the
      patients will continue to receive non-radio-labeled eribulin. In the initial Study phase,
      patients will receive a single 2 mg flat dose of 14C-eribulin (approximately 80 to 90
      microCuries) administered on Cycle 1 Day 1 as an intravenous (IV) bolus injection or infusion
      over 2-5 minutes. Following this initial dose, patients will remain in the research unit
      until Day 8 to complete sample collections of urine, blood and feces for PK analysis and
      determination of 14C-eribulin concentrations between Days 1 and 8.

      On Day 8 patients will be re-assessed and discharged, and return on day 15 for physical exam,
      adverse event evaluation, and lab tests. The patients will then enter the Extension Phase of
      the study and continue to receive on-radio-labeled eribulin at a dose of 1.4 mg/m^2 on Days 1
      and 8 of every 21 day cycle.
