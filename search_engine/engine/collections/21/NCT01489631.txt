      Prospective randomised study

      Study population:

      Patients aged eighteen years or older, in whom knee replacement surgery is indicated. They
      will have spinal anaesthesia and epidural analgesia if indicated by randomisation. They must
      not have contraindications for epidural analgesia or the used medication in this study.

      Intervention:

      The first group will be treated with epidural analgesia. Before surgery the epidural catheter
      will be placed according to local guidelines. After the operation epidural infiltration with
      bupivacaine and sufentanil will be commenced. The second group will receive local
      infiltration with ropivacaine of the knee during surgery. Half of these patients will
      additionally be treated with gabapentin.

      Primary study parameters/outcome of the study:

      NRS-score (11-scale Numeric Rating Scale in which 0 means no pain, and 10 means most pain
      imaginable) in rest.

      Secondary study parameters/outcome of the study:

      Speed of mobilisation, postoperative opiate consumption. NRS scores during flexion exercise
      of the knee and during walking exercise.
