      with Rucaparib as maintenance therapy vs. Placebo after receiving Bevacizumab for 12 to 15
      months.

      Patients will be stratified according to time point of surgery (adjuvant vs. neoadjuvant),
      result of surgery (tumor free vs. not tumor free resection), study site and response
      (complete response (CR) vs. partial response (PR)/SD) and randomized 2:1 to receive either
      Rucaparib (Arm A) or Placebo (Arm B).

      In both of the arms, tumor assessments (CT or MRI) are performed before randomization, and
      every 12 weeks thereafter.

      During treatment, clinical visits (blood cell counts, detection of toxicity) occur every 4
      weeks. Physical examinations and tumor assessments will take place every 12 weeks. Safety
      will be monitored continuously by careful monitoring of all adverse events (AEs) and serious
      adverse events (SAEs).

      About 30 sites in Germany will participate in this study to recruit 190 patients in 24
      months.
