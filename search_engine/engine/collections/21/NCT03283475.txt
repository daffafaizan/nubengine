    
      Preoperative assessment:- Patients will be assessed regarding skin redundancy, history of
      weight loss and site of lipodystrophy whether deformity is proximal, distal or diffuse.

      The same measurements mentioned above will be recorded for the patient group before surgery.

      Preoperative photographs in anteroposterior, lateral and oblique positions will be taken.

      Informed consent will be signed by the patient before surgery illustrating possible risks and
      complications of the surgery.

      Postoperative assessment:- The outcomes will be evaluated 3 months after surgery regarding
      patient satisfaction and achievement of symmetry.

      Early complications will be assessed within one week after surgery including hematoma,
      seroma, surgical site infection and wound dehiscence.

      Late complications will be assessed at 3 months follow up including asymmetry, conspicuous
      scar and lymphedema.

      Postoperative measurements and photographs will be recorded and compared with preoperative
      ones.
