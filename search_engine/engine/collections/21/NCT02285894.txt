      ventilated patients. In adults the atelectasis occur mainly in the dependant areas of the
      lung. In this study the investigators examine whether these atelectasis can be opened by
      repeatedly sustaining the inspiratory pressure for 10 seconds when the patient has been
      positioned so that the atelectasis is located in a non-dependant position. Furthermore, the
      investigators examine how many times the inspiratory pressure needs to be sustained before
      the atelectasis is opened and at what pressure.
