      radiopharmaceutical distribution from coronary arteries to cardiac tissue. This standard
      interpretation however, lacks the clinical utility of modern quantitative techniques that are
      now routinely obtained during cardiac catheterization, such as fractional flow reserve (FFR).
      Cardiologists routinely base critical management decisions, including the choice for
      revascularization, stenting, or angioplasty, on these measurements.

      Non-invasive measurements of MBF (Myocardial Blood Flow), CFR (Coronary Flow Reserve) and RFR
      (Relative Flow Reserve) using PET/CT have been investigated, but have yet to reach clinicl
      use. Given the inherent gains in sensitivity and resolution, digital PET/CT, may allow for a
      more robust and accurate platform to obtain quantitative measurements of MBF, CFR and RFR
      which may greatly enhance the clinical utility of cardiac PET/CT for management of coronary
      artery disease.
