      during Days 5-13 after immunization with live, attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV).

      Investigators hoped to enroll 27 healthy children, 2 years of age who had not had any prior
      LAIV or trivalent inactivated vaccine (TIV) within the past 2 years. Due to low enrollment,
      the study was halted. Due to the limited number of samples, no analysis was performed.
