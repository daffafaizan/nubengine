    
      The purpose of this study is to assess the value of 68Ga-NODAGA-RGD PET/CT for detection of
      neoangiogenesis at level of neoplastic processes, in patients, compared to 18F-FDG PET/CT
      (tumors other than glioma) or 18F-FET PET/CT (patients affected by glioma) and to determine
      the respective diagnostic contribution of every technique.

      Every patient will undergo a routine 18F-FDG (or 18F-FET) PET/CT followed by a
      68Ga-NODAGA-RGD PET / CT specific for the study within the next 7 days.

      (each image procedure duration: 2h)

      The criteria of primary evaluation for each of the techniques will be defined:

        -  On the images of PET/CT: SUVmax, SUVmoyen, VOI ( mL ), SUV41 % ratio [mean SUV of pixels
           â‰¥ 41 % of the SUVmax] of lesions / SUV

        -  On the images of CT: size of the lesions measured in 3D (axial, coronal and sagittal),
           density in Hounsfield unit (HU)

      The 18F-FDG/18F-FET and 68Ga-NODAGA-RGD PET / CTs will be analyzed at first separately then
      will be compared according to the methods described in the analysis
