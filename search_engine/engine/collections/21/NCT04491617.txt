      Aim 1. To compare patient satisfaction and pain control using two different opioid
      prescribing protocols.

      The study investigators hypothesize that postoperative pain control and satisfaction will be
      non-inferior between patients not routinely prescribed opioids after surgery and those
      prescribed a standard quantity. Participants will be asked to rate their pain control during
      the first 7 postoperative days with validated questionnaires. Participants' satisfaction with
      pain control will be evaluated at their postoperative visit.

      Aim 2. To examine opioid use patterns after ambulatory and major urogynecologic surgery.

      The study investigators hypothesize that most postoperative patients will use few or no
      opioids after urogynecologic surgery, regardless of prescribing protocol. All participants
      will receive thorough counseling with detailed instructions on non-opioid pain management, as
      well as multimodal analgesia via ERAS protocol during the perioperative period. Participants
      will be asked to log their opioid and non-opioid medication use in the first postoperative
      week. The investigators will also assess the number of requests for opioid prescription (in
      those randomized to the restrictive protocol) and opioid refills (from patients in the
      standard protocol).

      Aim 3. To determine patient and perioperative factors associated with opioid use after
      urogynecologic surgery.

      The study investigators plan to collect and analyze demographic, clinical and psychometric
      data on all participants with the goal of predicting analgesic needs and opioid use after
      urogynecologic surgery. Results from this study will guide surgeons on how to tailor opioid
      prescriptions to the needs of each patient, based off individual patient and perioperative
      characteristics.
