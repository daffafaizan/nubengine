      effectiveness of the Zenith® Dissection Endovascular System in the treatment of dissections
      (length-wise tear) of the descending thoracic aorta. The Zenith® Dissection Endovascular
      System is comprised of the Zenith TX2® TAA Endovascular Graft and the Zenith® Dissection
      Endovascular Stent. Instead of making a large incision in the chest, the physician makes a
      small incision near each hip to insert, and guides the graft and the dissection stent into
      place in the aorta.
