           a long, thin tube (catheter) that is inserted through the skin into a large vein in the
           chest. This is placed by a radiologist or surgeon.

        -  Panitumumab will be given in 4-week cycles. Panitumumab infusions will be given on days
           1 and 15 of each cycle (every 2 weeks).

        -  The following procedures will be performed on days 1 and 15 of each cycle, before each
           infusion: physical exam; questions about any symptoms or side effects; performance
           status; routine blood tests and CT or MRI (every 2 cycles).

        -  Participants can continue to receive panitumumab until their disease gets worse or they
           experience unacceptable side effects.
