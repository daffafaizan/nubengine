    
      Aim of the work:

      To study the effect of intrauterine injection of human chorionic gonadotrophin on the
      endometrial T regulatory cells (Treg cells)and the electromicroscopic endometrial
      characteristics.

      Background:

      It has been demonstrated that regulatory T cells expand during pregnancy and are present at
      the feto-maternal interface at very early stages in pregnancy.

      Rational:

      Intrauterine injection of hCG around the time of implantation may increase endometrial Treg
      cells and improve implantation.

      Methods:

      Intrauterine injection of 100 IU hCG will be done followed by endometrial biopsy to check for
      Treg cells and pinopodes.
