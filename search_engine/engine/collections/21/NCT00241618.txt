      worldwide, the hepatitis C virus (HCV) represents a clear and significant public health
      issue. Unfortunately, for most people infected with HCV (70%-85%) spontaneous resolution is
      uncommon and 60% to 80% of patients with acute hepatitis C infection develop chronic
      hepatitis. This randomized trial focuses on defining the effect of treatment of acute HCV on
      prevention of chronic hepatitis in addition to optimization of the treatment regimen, onset
      and the length of peginterferon alpha therapy in acute hepatitis C infections. This
      randomized, multi-center prospective study assesses the efficacy of peginterferon in acute
      hepatitis. We will also compare differences in sustained viral response rates in patients
      with acute hepatitis C starting treatment at 8, 12, or 24 weeks. We will also compare the
      efficacy of 8, 12 or 24 weeks therapy with PEG-IFN-alpha. All eligible patients are enrolled
      and screened for an initial observation period starting from the time of their first positive
      HCV-RNA-PCR, during which bi-weekly serum ALT and HCV-RNA subjects were performed. Patients
      who did not resolve spontaneously (loss of HCV-RNA without treatment) by the end of the
      observation period were randomly assigned to receive PEG-IFN-alpha at the assigned onset
      and/or duration. Patients who do not consent to therapy at enrollment are included as a
      non-randomized comparison group. All subjects with SVR were followed for 48 weeks after the
      follow-up at 24 weeks when SVR was determined.
