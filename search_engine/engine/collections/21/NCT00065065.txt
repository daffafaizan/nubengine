    
      Ulcerative colitis is a disease characterized by inflammation (the changes that happen when
      tissues in the body are injured) of all or a portion of the large intestine. There is
      presently no medical cure for ulcerative colitis, although surgical removal of the colon
      would cure the disease. Ulcerative colitis is generally treated with medications against
      diarrhea and infection, medications which suppress the immune system (the body system that
      protects a person against foreign substances) or with surgery.

      It is thought that the chronic inflammation associated with ulcerative colitis may be related
      to the release of certain chemicals produced by the body. Rosiglitazone has been shown to
      inhibit the production of some of these chemicals. The active component of rosiglitazone has
      also been shown to improve colitis in animal models of colitis. The purpose of this study is
      to evaluate the benefit of the drug for ulcerative colitis by comparing it to placebo.

      This is a randomized controlled trial of rosiglitazone versus placebo in patients who have
      failed to respond to 5-ASA therapy. Participants will be randomized to receive either
      rosiglitazone 4mg bid or placebo bid twice daily for a total of 12 weeks. Disease activity
      will be measured using the Disease Activity Index (DAI) at visits 3 through 8. Additional
      outcomes measured will include histological disease activity (visits 3 and 7) and quality of
      life using the IBDQ (visits 3 through 8). The principle analyses will be an intent-to-treat
      analysis to examine the efficacy of rosiglitazone at a dose of 4mg twice daily compared to
      placebo to achieve a partial or complete response. Additionally, the change in NF-ÎºB
      activation prior to and following therapy with either placebo or rosiglitazone will be
      examined using immunohistochemistry techniques.
