      levels of vitamins, minerals, neurotransmitters, and biomarkers for nutritional deficiencies.
      The study design is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled. Blood and urine
      measurements will be measured at the beginning of the study in children with autism and
      typical children. Then, the children with autism will be given the supplement or placebo for
      12 weeks, and then their blood and urine will be re-measured.
