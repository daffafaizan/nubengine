      tiredness, irritation, nervousness, despair, frustration, or depression, thus severely
      impacting the quality of life and health of the affected person. To date, there exists no
      pharmaceutical treatment for persisting tinnitus.

      Non-clinical studies with AM-101 have shown that the inhibition of cochlear NMDA receptors is
      successful in suppressing tinnitus without affecting normal glutamate neurotransmission
      respectively hearing function. In particular, it could be demonstrated that local
      administration of AM-101 in a single dose resulted in a complete suppression of tinnitus
      induced by acute acoustic trauma without any relapse thereafter.
