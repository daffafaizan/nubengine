      response-evaluable patients in each of the 5 tumor indications will be enrolled (Phase
      2-Stage 1). An interim analysis will determine which tumor indications will proceed to enroll
      an additional 25 patients (Phase 2-Stage 2) to further evaluate Overall Response Rate (ORR)
      and other secondary endpoints.
