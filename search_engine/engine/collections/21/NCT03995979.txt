      impact changes in cell energetics and dampen the normal subclinical inflammatory state. These
      changes can provide benchmarks for future research focused on using nutritional interventions
      aimed at improving the probability of a successful outcome following open aortic aneurysm
      surgery. The investigators will conduct a short term dietary restriction protocol to
      characterize these changes in a normal control cohort to be compared to patients which
      undergo surgery, to identify the optimal time points for sampling in the surgical population.
      These changes will be characterized by looking at inflammatory cells in the blood, proteins
      excreted in the urine, changes in microbiome signature identified by stool sample and oral
      swab, as well as changes in muscle energetics in small muscle biopsies.
