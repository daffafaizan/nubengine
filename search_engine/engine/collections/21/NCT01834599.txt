      therapy for the treatment of arterial hypotension induced by spinal anaesthesia during
      caesarean delivery. In some studies, there are trends toward a lower PaO2 values in the
      umbilical cord venous blood when the mother receive this vasopressor. These findings may be a
      result of the vasoconstrictor effect of phenylephrine on utero-placental vessels, and a
      subsequent increased oxygen extraction by the fetus. The possibility to extract more oxygen
      would provide a certain "safety margin" in the event of compromised utero-placental blood
      flow during normal pregnancy. However, this "safety margin" should not be taken for granted
      in cases where signs of fetal distress are present, and this situation might influence the
      choice of vasopressors.

      It is well establish on a physiological basis that during labour, utero-placental blood flow
      is lower during the contractions. This lower blood flow could result in a lower saturation
      value measured by the cerebral oximeter.

      Twenty patients in labour will be included in this study. Patients will be recruited in
      obstetric clinic during pregnancy. Based on the second trimester ultrasound, patients with
      anterior placenta will be included.

      During labour, once a functional epidural is in place, an Invos oximeter will be install. Two
      sensors will be applied on the abdomen (one above the placenta and the other above the
      myometrium at a place without placenta). Two sensors will also be applied on the extremities
      (forearm and leg).Saturation values and timing of the contractions will be recorded for sixty
      minutes. Half of the recording will be done with an oxygen mask. Vitals signs will also be
      registered every five minutes.
