      destroys cancer cells. In RFA, imaging techniques such as ultrasound or magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI) are used to help guide a needle electrode into a cancerous tumor.
      High-frequency electrical currents are then passed through the electrode, destroying the
      cancer cells. Use of an RFA device was approved by the Food and Drug Association (FDA) in
      1997 for the purposes of treating soft tissue tumors. The device we (Moffitt Cancer Center)
      will be using in this study has clearance for clinical use from the FDA. The effectiveness of
      the device is measured using biopsy cores at the site of the cancer after the RFA procedure.
      To evaluate the benefits of this procedure, we will also evaluate the change in
      quality-of-life indicators from baseline to 6 months following RFA. RFA is being developed as
      a minimally invasive potential treatment for prostate cancer.

      This research study is a pilot clinical trial. Pilot clinical trials are smaller versions of
      larger studies that are conducted to prepare for the larger study. This pilot study pre-tests
      a research device before a large-scale multicenter study is launched.

      The specific purpose of this pilot trial is to find out if RFA can effectively treat prostate
      cancer with fewer side effects including effects on urination, bowel function, and sexual
      function. RFA for early stage prostate cancer is designed to affect only the part of the
      prostate where cancer has been detected. The reasoning for this approach is the smaller the
      area given RFA, the less damage to surrounding tissues.
