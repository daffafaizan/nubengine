      10 years of age who have been diagnosed with MPS IIIB. Data will be prospectively collected
      from 20 to 30 subjects to understand the clinical progression of MPS IIIB in terms of
      neurocognitive function, behavior, quality of life, imaging characteristics, genotype, and
      biochemical markers of disease burden. This information may help inform the design and
      interpretation of subsequent interventional studies.
