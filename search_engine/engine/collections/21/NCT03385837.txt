      this disease are estimates in 38 billion of dollars per year, many of those have a
      relationship to high number of hospitalizations and decompensated heart failure.
      Non-adherence to drug treatment and non-pharmacological measures as cardiac rehabilitation
      are the major causes of high number of mortality and hospitalizations by heart failure. Our
      objectives will be to identify in decompensated heart failure inpatients the level of
      physical activity that they done before hospitalization, the barriers for the non-use of
      cardiac rehabilitation and their disposition to changes of lifestyle. Correlation between
      level of physical activity and readmission in 30 and 90 days after hospital discharge will be
      done. To understand the profile of these patients and difficulties for to do physical
      exercise could help to make future actions with focus in to obtain high adherence to changes
      in lifestyle.
