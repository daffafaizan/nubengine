      capacity which contributes to increased cardiovascular risk in this patient population. Prior
      studies have shown that CKD patients have an exaggerated increase in blood pressure (BP)
      during both static and rhythmic exercise. Such abnormal hemodynamic responses to exercise can
      contribute to poor physical capacity and abnormal muscle blood flow during exercise in these
      patients. The goals of this project are to investigate the mechanisms and potential therapies
      targeting the abnormal hemodynamic response during exercise in CKD by examining the roles of
      impaired vasodilation, and exaggerated vasoconstriction.
