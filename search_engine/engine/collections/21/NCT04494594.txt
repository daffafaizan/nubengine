      rates higher in the AF than the general population. Research indicates that the trend
      continues after personnel leave service ('veteran' or 'ex-serving' are used interchangeably
      in the UK). It has been estimated that more than 50% of those who have left the AF meet the
      criteria for hazardous alcohol use, a score of eight or above on the Alcohol Use Disorders
      Identification Test (AUDIT).

      The last two decades has seen a proliferation in the use of digital technologies to support
      brief intervention management and treatment of alcohol misuse in the general public, yet
      little attention has focused forwards the AF community. In the late 1990's interventions were
      commonly delivered via a computer using CD-ROM-based programmes, but with the advent of the
      World Wide Web many new opportunities arose to harness increase reach, provide real-time
      monitoring, and offer personalised treatment. This includes the use of Short Message Service
      (SMS) which have been shown to be effective in encouraging people to change their behaviour.

      The aim of this Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) is to assess the efficacy of a 28-day brief
      alcohol intervention delivered via a smartphone app (Drinks:Ration) in reducing self-reported
      weekly alcohol consumption between baseline and 3 months (day 84) among veterans who drink at
      a hazardous or harmful level and are receiving, or have received, support for mental health
      symptoms in a clinical setting.
