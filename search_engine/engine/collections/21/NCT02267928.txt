      measure people's perceptions of their own likelihood to having that medical condition. This
      will include an opportunity for people to pursue more information by directing them to a
      website that features more information about the condition. The initial information provision
      will vary slightly in presentation (method of eliciting symptoms will vary), and the rate at
      which individuals visit the subsequent medical website to receive more information will be
      recorded as a measure of information seeking behavior. Rates will be compared across symptom
      elicitation conditions to determine which formats are most effective at encouraging
      information seeking about health issues. No personally identifying information will be
      collected, and all results will be reported in aggregate. Critically, no deception will be
      used: Participants will only be provided with information that is as accurate as possible
      (given existing knowledge in the health/medical fields).
