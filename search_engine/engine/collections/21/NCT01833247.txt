      and saliva. The time course of this rise is unknown. If lactic acid rises within a few
      minutes of a seizure, than it might be feasible to develop lactic acid sensors to provide
      notification of a recent seizure. This could lead to better safety monitoring for people with
      epilepsy. This study was designed to utilize a commercially available lactic acid sensor
      (investigators have no connection with the sensor manufacturer and purchased the device at
      list price) to measure salivary lactic acid levels after a seizure during inpatient video-EEG
      epilepsy monitoring.
