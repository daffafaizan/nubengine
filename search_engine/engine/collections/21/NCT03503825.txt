    
      This is a Phase 1, non-randomized, open label, single centre clinical trial. 6 healthy
      volunteers (3 male and 3 female,4 study visits) and 6-18 subjects with Osteoarthritis of the
      knee (3 study visits) will be enrolled. At visit 2, all subjects will have knee pain
      assessed, using a visual analogue scale, prior to receiving a single, 555 MBq (15 mCi)+/-10%
      dose of [Tc-99m)-RPI-T-087 injection. Knees will be imaged with a SPECT/CT camera at
      specified time-points post injection. Safety monitoring will include vital signs, ECG,
      clinical laboratory tests (serum biochemistry, haematology, urinalysis) and adverse event
      monitoring.

      Additionally, HVs will have whole body planar imaging and blood sampling conducted at Visit 2
      and 3 to evaluate bio-distribution, estimate dosimetry and measure clearance of total
      activity over time in blood samples. A final follow-up visit will be conducted by phone
      interview.

      Once 6 HVs and 6 KOA participants have completed the study, a blinded assessment of the image
      data will be conducted to determine whether any more KOA subjects should be imaged.
