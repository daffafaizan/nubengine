      and B (multiple ascending dose). Part B will be conducted after a thorough review by the
      Sponsor and the Principal Investigator of the data arising from part A.

      Part A This will be a randomised, double blind, placebo controlled, parallel group titration
      of up to seven single dose levels of ATX2417. In each cohort, six subjects will receive
      active compound and two will receive placebo in a randomised fashion. At each dose level, 2
      subjects (1 subject will receive ATX2417 and 1 subject will receive placebo) will be dosed on
      Day 1 and the remaining 6 subjects will be dosed at least 24 hours later. Safety and
      pharmacokinetic observations will be made. There will be a minimum of two weeks between the
      first dosing day at each dose level. Safety and ATX2417 pharmacokinetic data will be reviewed
      prior to each dose escalation and, based on pharmacokinetic data, it is also possible to
      decrease the dose if the pharmacokinetic profile so indicates. This part will also include an
      assessment of the effect of a high fat breakfast on the absorption and pharmacokinetic
      profile of ATX 2417, performed at a dose predicted to be associated with therapeutic plasma
      concentrations.

      Part B Following completion of Part A, and selection of appropriate dose levels, Part B will
      be performed. This will be a randomised, double blind, placebo controlled, parallel group
      study of up to two dose levels of ATX2417 given once daily for eight days. In each cohort,
      six subjects will receive active compound and two will receive placebo in a randomised
      fashion. Safety and pharmacokinetic observations will be made.
