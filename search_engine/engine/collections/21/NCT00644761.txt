    
      Multi-center, phase 2, open-label, sequential-cohort, drug interaction study. Cohort 1
      subjects (tacrolimus and adefovir dipivoxil) were enrolled first. Based on the findings in
      Cohort 1, a decision was made on whether to enroll subjects in Cohort 2 (cyclosporine and
      adefovir dipivoxil)(i.e., if no interaction was observed in Cohort 1, Cohort 2 subjects would
      not be enrolled). Since no pharmacokinetic interaction was observed in Cohort 1, Cohort 2 was
      not enrolled.
