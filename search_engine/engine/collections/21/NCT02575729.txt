    
      Material and methods: We have enrolled 26 ideopathic carpal tunnel syndrome patients (minimal
      to moderate according to Padua's classification).Thirteen patients were allocated in
      sonography approach group( sonography-guided local wrist injection, SAG) and the 13 patients
      were placed in direct approach group(direct local injection without using sonography, DAG).
      One , 3 and 6 months later after injection, we performed the outcome measures, including
      Boston symptom and functional scale, QuickDASH, nerve conduction study and sonography. If the
      patients receive the second injections, we will follow their treatment outcome by phone
      regularly at 1,3 and 6 months after first injection. If the patients were referred to
      surgery, the failures of local injection were considered and we will stop follow up them.
      After performing all assessment, we will compare the outcomes between the two groups.
