    
      Patients aged 3-5 years with 48 teeth affected by white spot lesions (WSL) Class V on their
      primary anterior teeth (ICDAS 1-2) will be selected by simple random sample. A minimum of 1
      tooth and a maximum of 12 teeth affected by WSL in each patient can be included. Subjects
      whose parents are willing and able to maintain good oral hygiene for their children and
      attend study visits.Subjects with Saliva of normal flow rates (30-60sec) and with healthy
      saliva pH 5.0-5.8.

        1. All participating patients' parents will sign an informed consent.

        2. Patients will receive oral health education on how to maintain a proper oral hygiene and
           proper diet consumption.

        3. Unstimulated Salivary flow test, salivary pH testing will be done to decide whether to
           include or to exclude the patient according to his/her salivary flow rate.

        4. They will be given manual tooth brushes and non-fluoridated tooth pastes to use during
           the study. The tooth brushes will be replaced every 3 months and the tooth pastes will
           be replaced whenever they are empty.

        5. Every patient will receive prophylaxis (polishing) using non-fluoridated prophylaxis
           paste prior to the commencement of treatment to avoid possible confounding factors.

        6. Then each patient will be assigned to one of the two groups:

      Group 1: Self Assembling Peptides P11-4 (Regenamel)

        1. 24 teeth will receive treatment by self-assembling peptides P11-4 at Day 0 and will be
           followed up after 3 months using the above-mentioned measurements.

        2. 12 teeth (50%) will receive re-application at Day 90 and the other 12 teeth (50%) won't.
           Follow up will be done every 3 months for 12 months.

      Group 2: Topical Fluoride Varnish (Duraphat)

        1. 24 teeth will receive treatment by topical fluoride varnish at Day 0 and will be
           followed up after 3 months using the above-mentioned measurements.

        2. 12 teeth (50%) will receive re-application at Day 90 and the other 12 teeth (50%) won't.
           Follow up will be done every 3 months for 12 months.

      The assessment of the baseline and follow up data will be performed by the main investigator
      and two blind investigators to avoid bias.

      Assessment will be done at baseline using the ICDAS II and Light Induced Fluorescence using
      Soprolife Camera and then after 1 week of the 1st application, at Day 90, Day 180, Day 270
      and Day 365.
