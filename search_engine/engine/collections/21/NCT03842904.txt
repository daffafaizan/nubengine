      (within triple therapy) to improvements in small airway function in COPD patients. This will
      be achieved by recruiting patients with hyperinflation, and measuring improvements in
      hyperinflation and expiratory flow limitation as measurements of small airway disease.

      This study will help understand the mechanisms of action of the bronchodilators within
      BDP/FF/GB, and potentially encourage treatment of small airway disease in COPD with
      extra-fine bronchodilator treatments. This trial will be conducted in compliance with the
      Declaration of Helsinki (1964 and amendments) current Good Clinical Practices and all other
      applicable laws and regulations.
