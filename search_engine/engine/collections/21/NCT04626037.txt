      The Cuddle and Calm Book, mother and child mutual narrative and the WECS for emotional
      connection, make up the WECS Relational Health toolkit. The WECS Relational Health Toolkit
      provides family-based resources to help mothers and children emotionally connect. The WECS
      Relational Health Toolkit is designed to create emotional connection and establish
      mother-child co-regulation, which helps shape the behavior of the mother and child and
      therefore determines early child development and mother well-being. The investigators will
      test whether this toolkit can be a positive part of a standard preschool education program.
      Practicality will be measured through virtual participant attendance, a participant survey,
      and staff notes. Effects of these modalities on the emotional connection of mother-child pair
      will be measured through the Welch Emotional Connection Screen (WECS). Effects of child
      behaviors at home and school will be measured through the Strengths & Difficulties
      Questionnaire (SDQ) by recruiting the teachers to fill out the assessment.
