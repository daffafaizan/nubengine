      of around 50%. Management of these patients is largely supportive. Even in patients who do
      not develop clinical evidence of acute lung injury, markers of inflammation and oxidative
      stress are present in blood and exhaled breath condensate after lung resection. The purpose
      of this randomised double-blind placebo-controlled study is to determine whether lung injury
      can be prevented by pre-administration of N-acetylcysteine.
