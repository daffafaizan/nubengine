      arthritis (RA) or Osteo arthritis (OA) affecting the hands. The design allows a broad range
      of common objects of daily life to be seamlessly transformed into 'therapeutic' input devices
      by instrumenting with a small motion sense mouse. Based on individual abilities and treatment
      needs, objects are selected to train specific fine/ gross dexterous functions. The object
      manipulations (therapeutic exercises) are then used to control and play any commercially
      available computer game, making practice challenging and engaging.

      The study is of six weeks duration comparing the computer gaming and conventional hand
      exercises in thirty people diagnosed with RA or OA affecting the hands. The investigators
      hypothesize that the game based exercises will improve hand function and reduce
      pain/stiffness and be feasible compared to the conventional hand exercises.A mixed-effect
      repeated measures analysis of variance will be conducted to test pre to post treatment
      outcomes. This will be the first study to evaluate the therapeutic effects and feasibility of
      the computer gaming hand exercise regimen in people with RA or OA.
