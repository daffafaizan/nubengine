      colony-stimulating factor, e.g. Leukine速/Sargramostim) rapidly reduced cerebral amyloid
      deposition and completely reversed memory deficits in transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer's
      Disease (AD). To assess the efficacy of GM-CSF in humans, the investigators performed a
      retrospective analysis of a cognition study of human patients undergoing hematopoietic cell
      transplantation for cancer and who garner cognitive impairments from the chemotherapy or
      irradiation. In the patients that received a colony-stimulating factor (CSF) to stimulate the
      bone marrow and recover immune system function, the investigators found that those who
      received GM-CSF (Leukine速/Sargramostim) plus G-CSF (Filigrastim) significantly improved in
      cognitive function as compared to those who received G-CSF alone. These findings combined
      with over two decades of accrued safety data using recombinant human GM-CSF,
      Leukine速/Sargramostim, in elderly leukopenic patients, suggested that Leukine速 should be
      tested as a treatment to reverse cerebral amyloid pathology and cognitive impairment in AD.
