      dysfunction of both the serotonergic and dopaminergic neurotransmitter systems. These two
      neurotransmitter systems are presumed to play a key modulatory role at the limbic-motor
      interface of the fronto-subcortical circuitry. However, in vivo knowledge linking the
      serotonergic and dopaminergic systems to OCD and OCD-related disorders is limited. In the
      current protocol, we plan to use PET to image the serotonin transporter (SERT) within the new
      radioligand [11C]DASB, in order to delineate regional abnormalities in SERT binding in
      drug-naive or drug-free OCD patients in comparison to healthy volunteers. In addition, we
      plan to examine the relationship between the regional PET measures of SERT and clinical
      severity measures of OCD. The goal of the present study is, thus, to further our
      understanding of the role of the serotonergic system in the pathophysiology of OCD.
