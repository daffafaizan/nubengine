    
      This is a 30-week prospective, randomized delayed treatment control group design in which 20
      participants from the community will be randomized 1:1 into (a) an immediate treatment group
      that will receive 12 weeks of osteopathic manipulation (OMT) treatment plus standard of care
      right away or (b) delayed treatment group that will receive 12 weeks of OMT plus standard of
      care after a 6-week waiting period. The delayed treatment group initially serves as a control
      condition but then receives the experimental treatment. The investigators selected this
      control condition to improve our statistical power in this small pilot study. As noted, all
      participants will continue to receive standard of care throughout the study as a washout is
      not feasible with osteopathic manipulation and removing standard of care could exacerbate the
      participant's symptoms. Participants in both arms will be followed for another 12 weeks after
      the 12 weeks of OMT, resulting in 24 weeks of study participation for the immediate treatment
      group and 30 weeks of study participation for the delayed treatment group, with participants
      in both arms answering a series of questionnaires to evaluate migraine frequency and impact,
      treatment efficacy, side effects, adherence t standard of care and depressive symptoms every
      6 weeks throughout their study participation. Participant encounters will consist of
      screening, psychometric and functional scale administration at every 6 weeks for a total of
      24-30 weeks, as well as 12 weeks of OMT treatments for participants in both study arms. Study
      participants will likely come from UCSD internal referrals.
