      therapy. The first days in the intensive care unit (ICU), patients are unstable and it can be
      questioned whether therapeutic levels of anidulafungin are reached after a standard loading
      scheme. At this moment there are several clues that the PK of anidulafungin in critically ill
      patients is different, but an overall picture is lacking.

      For the investigation of the correlation of the pharmacokinetics of anidulafungin and the
      disease severity a full pharmacokinetic profile will be obtained. Predictive scoring systems
      will be used to assess disease severity.
