      indication for a flexible bronchoscopy who are attended at the University Hospital Aachen
      (UKA) to obtain new knowledge concerning safety and patient comfort using different
      medications for sedation.

      Therefore a routine flexible bronchoscopy is carried out, whereat the choice of
      analgosedation medication is for the investigators decision, independent from the study.

      Subsequently the following data are collected:

        -  duration of medical examination

        -  medication (e.g. midazolam, fentanyl, propofol, lidocain)

        -  vital signs at the end of the examination

        -  complications

      Furthermore the patient should be asked concerning the general tolerance for the procedure
      and different symptoms like emesis, feeling of suffocation, cough and pain (0 = no stress,
      100 = intolerable). In addition to that the grade of amnesia and the acceptance for later
      bronchoscopies should be asked.

      Analyzing this data will optimize the internal quality control concerning the conducted
      examination, collect all complications related to the analgosedation and enhance the patients
      comfort during a flexible bronchoscopy.
