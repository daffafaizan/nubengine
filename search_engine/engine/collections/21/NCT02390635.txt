    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To estimate the incidence of extramedullary myeloid leukemia (EML) in patients with newly
      diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML), including acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), by
      imaging criteria using PET/MR (magnetic resonance), whole body MR, and PET/CT.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To qualitatively and quantitatively assess PET/MR and PET/CR that will be performed with
      and without fiducial markers, and to correlate these findings with clinical outcomes of
      treatment response, relapse, and patterns of relapse.

      II. Correlate findings of EML as in the primary objectives with clinical outcomes of
      treatment response, relapse, and patterns of relapse including location of relapse compared
      to site of EML.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive gadolinium intravenously (IV) and undergo whole body PET/MRI comprising
      diffusion weighted imaging and 3-dimentional (3D) fast spoiled gradient echo dual echo
      (FSPGR-DE) with and without fiducial markers. Patients then undergo 18F-FDG PET/CT before
      start treatment for acute myeloid leukemia.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up periodically.
