      with AIDS-associated Kaposi's sarcoma.

      II. Determine the antitumor activity of IL-12 in these patients. III. Determine the effect of
      IL-12 on angiogenic factors, including basic fibroblast growth factor, vascular endothelial
      growth factor, and interferon-inducible protein 10 in these patients.

      IV. Determine the immunologic and virologic effects of IL-12 in these patients.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive interleukin-12 (IL-12)
      subcutaneously twice a week (at least 3 days apart) for 6 months. Patients with stable or
      better disease continue IL-12 treatment in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of IL-12 until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients
      experience dose limiting toxicity. Ten additional patients are treated at the MTD.

      Patients are followed at 4 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL:

      Up to 55 patients will be entered over approximately 4.0 years.
