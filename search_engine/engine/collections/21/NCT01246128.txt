      The objective of this study is to determine the distribution and volume of distribution (Vt)
      in vivo of Beta2* acetylcholine receptors (Beta2* nAChR) in schizophrenic smokers and
      nonsmokers and compare this to published data from normal healthy subjects who are smokers
      and nonsmokers.

      Study population:

      Participants will be volunteers with a diagnosis of schizophrenia aged 18 to 50 years. The
      proposed sample size is 10 per group: nonsmokers or ex-smokers and smokers for a total of 20
      participants.

      Design:

      One PET study lasting up to 8 hours after combination of bolus and continuous infusion
      administration of 2[(18)F] FA-85380. Smokers will be abstinent for at least 48 hrs. Subjects
      will also undergo a structural MRI scan for purposes of registration of PET scan data.

      Outcome Measures:

      Data from 20 schizophrenic patients (10 smokers and 10 nonsmokers) will be compared to
      published data from healthy controls. Total volume of distribution (VT) which is a measure of
      receptor density and distribution of Beta2 nAChR* will be determined in Schizophrenic smokers
      and nonsmokers and differences in these values will be compared to published values for the
      differences in nicotinic acetylcholine receptor density in healthy smokers and nonsmokers
      (Mukhin et al., 2008) Also, receptor distribution and VT will be correlated with levels of
      smoking and symptom profiles in the schizophrenic patients studied.
