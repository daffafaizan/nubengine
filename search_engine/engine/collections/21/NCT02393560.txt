      chemical composition of the scanned materials. This study will determine the extent of MSU
      crystal volume in the hands/wrists, feet/ankles, and knees as determined by DECT of subjects
      with gout taking a dose of at least 300 mg allopurinol daily for the past 12 weeks.

      Patients with gout on allopurinol with and without tophi to be assessed using DECT imaging
      for crystal deposition with assessments, which include patient and provider assessments of
      disease severity and pain, prior to and after the scan.
