      important to tailor appropriate management plans. Brain imaging, electrophysiological
      evaluations, biomarkers all take part in neuroprognosis in cardiac arrest patients, however,
      these modalities are more expensive or not suitable to repeat in a short time. Optic nerve
      sheath diameter (ONSD) had been proved to be associated with increased intracranial pressure2
      and can be used as one of the prognostic factors in cardiac arrest patients. It is simple,
      quick and can be measured repeatedly. Carotid duplex and transcranial duplex(TCD) provide
      rapid, noninvasive, real-time measures of cerebrovascular function. It can be used to assess
      the vascular territory by measuring blood flow, and to evaluate factors include brain
      perfusion, plaque morphology, and patency of intracranial collaterals.

      Hence, it could act as a crucial role in neuroprognosis in post-arrest patients. In this
      study, the investigator aimed to analyze the ONSD diameters, carotid duplex and transcaranial
      duplex parameters in different stages of post-cardiac arrest care, demographic
      characteristics and resuscitation information with the neurological outcome of post-cardiac
      arrest patients.
