      poliovirus type 1 and type 3. It will be an 8-arm, randomized, observer-blind, controlled
      trial, with Sabin monovalent vaccines serving as the control for each type. Two hundred and
      thirty healthy, adult participants will be recruited, 80 participants with an exclusive
      inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) prior vaccination history and 150 participants with an
      oral poliomyelitis vaccine (OPV)-containing prior vaccination history.
