      cancer (HREC), and it appears to reduce the incidence of pelvic relapses but doesn't seem to
      improve survival. Paclitaxel (P) has shown in vitro and clinical activity against endometrial
      cancer, and it is also a potent radiosensitizer by blocking dividing cells in G2/M phase.
      This study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a treatment with concomitant weekly
      chemotherapy with paclitaxel and RT in high risk advanced endometrial cancer.
