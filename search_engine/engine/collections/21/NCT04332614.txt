      services while often reducing burden to both patients and providers. However, fewer than half
      of patients have enrolled in Geisinger's patient portal, myGeisinger.

      The purpose of the current study is to assess what kind of messaging improves the
      effectiveness of an email campaign targeted at enrolling patients into Geisinger's online
      patient portal, called myGeisinger. Currently, Geisinger sends an email every month to
      patients who have started but not completed the enrollment process (they have had an
      activation code generated but have not yet used that code to enroll). This study will A/B
      test 5 email messages to assess if they perform better than the current standard email
      message.

      Performance will be assessed based on whether patients open the email, click on the
      myGeisinger enrollment link, and enroll in myGeisinger. Statistical analyses will employ
      generalized linear models with a binary distribution and log-link function.
