      Primary

        -  Determine the safety, efficacy, and tolerability of imatinib mesylate in patients with
           myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia.

        -  Determine the 3-, 6-, and 12-month major and minor erythroid response rates in patients
           treated with this drug.

      Secondary

        -  Determine reduction in marrow fibrosis in patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine decrease in spleen size in patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, open-label, nonrandomized, pilot study.

      Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate once daily for 1 year in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who do not experience a minor erythroid
      response or a 50% reduction in spleen size after 6 months of treatment are removed from the
      study. Patients experiencing clinical benefit (e.g., ongoing erythroid response) after 1 year
      of treatment may continue treatment with imatinib mesylate as above at the discretion of the
      principal investigator.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued for this study.
