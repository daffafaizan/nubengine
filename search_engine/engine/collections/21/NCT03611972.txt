      meal for two weeks. At the beginning and end of the two-week intervention, participants will
      have blood drawn under fasting and postprandial (after a meal) conditions for the measurement
      of lipid risk factors associated with cardiovascular disease. Participants will also undergo
      an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) to assess insulin sensitivity. All sugar-sweetened
      beverages will be provided.
