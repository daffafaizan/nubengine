      regimen, and to estimate the response rates and survival of participants with large cell
      lymphoma treated on this protocol.

      Patients will be treated with induction, consolidation, and maintenance treatment.

      Induction

      MIED chemotherapy - High dose methotrexate, ifosfamide, etoposide, and dexamethasone for 2
      cycles.

      2-4 (total of 3 days) Etoposide (VP-16) 200 mg/m2/day on Days 2-4 (total of 3 days)
      Dexamethasone 40 mg/m2/day IV on days 1-4 (given IV or PO daily x 4) Intrathecal MHA, age
      adjusted dosages.

      Consolidation

      COPADM chemotherapy for 2 cycles - cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone, adriamycin,
      high-dose methotrexate

      COPAM#1 High dose methotrexate (HD MTX) 5 gm/m2 IV over 4 hours on Day 1 with leucovorin

      (divided bid) Days 1-5, Intrathecal MHA, age adjusted dosages.

      COPADM#2 - like COPADM#1 except: 1. cyclophosphamide dose increased to 1 gm/m2/day divided
      every 12 hours on Days 2-4, and 2. second dose of vincristine given on Day 6.

      Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation - high-dose cyclophosphamide and etoposide

      Involved field radiation to the primary tumor will be given over 3-4 weeks. Participants with
      CNS disease at diagnosis will also receive cranial irradiation.
