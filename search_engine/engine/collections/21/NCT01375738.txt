    
      Purpose:

        -  To investigate the effect of gastrectomy on remission of type 2 diabetes in patients
           with gastric cancer and type 2 diabetes

        -  To investigate the mechanism of blood glucose alteration and intestinal hormonal
           signaling by the reconstruction methods

        -  To evaluate the applicability and efficacy of Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy after
           gastrectomy in gastric cancer patients with diabetes

      Contents:

        -  Evaluation of the status of diabetes in gastric cancer patients with DM after
           gastrectomy

             -  Comparison of two reconstruction types after gastrectomy Bypass duodenum and upper
                jejunum: Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy Preservation of duodenal passage:
                Gastroduodenostomy

             -  Analysis for biochemical markers reflecting diabetic status: fasting glucose,
                postprandial 2h glucose, HbA1c, C-peptide, lipid profile

        -  Correlation of parameters associated with diabetes and GI hormones

             -  Evaluation of mechanism of Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy on controlling diabetes

        -  Evaluation of Feasibility of Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy in gastric cancer surgery in
           patients with DM

             -  Degree of high blood glucose control, the amount of antidiabetic medication, costs
                for DM treatment, quality of life assessment
