           of the lung, the lining of the lung, the covering of the heart, and the muscle that
           separates the chest and abdomen. At the conclusion of the resection, if the patient has
           less then 1 cm3 of residual gross disease in one or more areas, then the heated
           chemotherapy lavage will begin. If more than this volume of disease is present, then the
           patient will receive additional treatment off-study.

        -  The chemotherapy treatment consists of a one-hour lavage of the chest and abdomen cavity
           with heated cisplatin given in the operating room through the surgical incision. At the
           completion of the hour, sodium thiosulfate is given intravenously to reduce the
           potential side effects of cisplatin.

        -  During the surgery and for four hours following the completion of the cisplatin lavage,
           blood samples, urine samples, chest wall muscle samples, and samples of the chemotherapy
           solution will be done in order to measure the concentration of chemotherapy and the
           impact of cisplatin on the various cell samples.

        -  Patients will remain in the hospital until they have recovered from surgery (7-14 days).
           Following discharge from the hospital, patients will be seen 1-2 weeks post-operatively
           for blood tests. 6 weeks later additional blood tests and and echocardiogram will be
           performed. This echocardiogram will be repeated 6 months post-operatively to re-assess
           heart function.
