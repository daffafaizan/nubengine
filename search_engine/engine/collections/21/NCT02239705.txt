      thermodilution curve and the physiological significance of the Global End Diastolic Volume (
      GEDV ) .

      The mathematical derivation of the Global End Diastolic Volume (GEDV) is intimately linked
      with the Cardiac Output (CO), because EV1000, to calculate the GEDV, uses a formula in which
      the CO is the term "flow " for both the calculations of Volume Thermal Intra Thoracic (ITTV)
      and Lung Thermal volume (PTV) .

      The clinical validation of GEDV as an index of preload has been substantially based on
      measuring changes in GEDV and CO in response to the Fluid Challenge only in patients "volume
      responsive".

      In this scenario, GEDV and CO may show a close correlation only on the basis of their
      mathematical derivation.
