      invasive than classical laparoscopic open procedure. Particularly, MIS is used for resection
      of some gynecological cancer such as endometrial cancer, cervical cancer or ovarian cancer.
      Several studies demonstrated that MIS induce less surgical complications (bleeding,
      infections, post-operative pains...), shorter hospitalization time, earlier recovery of
      activity and better quality of life than laparoscopic open procedure.

      However, MIS is the selected method in only 9 to 25 % of gynecologic cancer surgery in
      France. This is likely due to the longer learning curve of MIS compared to laparoscopic open
      procedure.

      In 2001 the FDA allowed the use of robot assisted laparoscopic surgery (RALS). This technique
      adds some advantage to laparoscopic surgery. Indeed, surgeon operates with better precision
      while seated comfortably at a computer console viewing a 3-D image of the surgical field.
      Moreover learning curve of RALS is shorter than MIS. Comparative studies between RALS and MIS
      demonstrate an equivalence of these techniques for operation length and bleeding. However for
      surgery linked complications and time for recovery of activity, RALS had better results than
      MIS.

      Despite its expensive cost, RALS is now commonly used in North America (90% of prostatectomy
      and 40% of cancer linked hysterectomy). However RALS need to be evaluated in a randomized
      clinical trial before it's acceptation in gyneco-oncology in France.

      Thus, the purpose of the ROBOGYN clinical trial is to compare clinical benefit of RALS and
      MIS in a randomized study for patients with cancer of cervix, uterus or ovary.
