      the effect of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) dietary supplementation in subjects with macular
      dystrophy to determine whether DHA can improve macular function. Subjects will receive either
      oral DHA supplementation (5x200 mg BID, 2,000 mg/day) or placebo. Subjects will 'crossover'
      to the opposite treatment twice during this study. Primary outcomes will measure the change
      in macular function during periods with and without DHA supplementation.

      Zhang and colleagues found a mutation in the gene, ELOVL4 (elongation of the very long chain
      fatty acid-4), in individuals with Stargardt-like macular dystrophy. The gene is presumed to
      function in the pathway of synthesis of very long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids,
      including DHA. DHA is the major very long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid of the retina. As
      our North American diet is poor in DHA, we hypothesize that a DHA dietary supplement might
      improve macular function in individuals with the ELOVL4 mutation. Since the effect of DHA
      supplementation may be non-specific, we propose to study a second cohort with Stargardt
      macular dystrophy, which has a different genotype involving a different metabolic pathway in
      the eye, but presents with a similar phenotype. Two cohorts of up to 10 subjects for analysis
      will be recruited from patients with either Stargardt-like macular dystrophy or Stargardt
      macular dystrophy.
