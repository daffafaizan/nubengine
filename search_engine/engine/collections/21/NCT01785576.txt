      four-session intervention to teach patients and partners specific couple-based cancer-focused
      support skills. In addition, in order to gather information on outcome variables, couples
      will complete three assessments during the course of treatment (pre-treatment, following
      treatment, and six month follow-up). These assessments will include questionnaire measures as
      well as couple communication whereby couples will participate in two videotaped conversations
      whereby one partner of the couple discusses a concern and the other member of the couple
      provides support. We also will implement a "daily diary" assessment whereby day-to-day
      psychological and physical symptoms experienced by the patient and partner will be assessed
      and daily effects of the intervention can be analyzed. Patients and partners will participate
      in the daily diary portion of the study following the post-assessment. They will be emailed
      an electronic link to a brief questionnaire daily for 7 days. The items in this daily
      assessment will comprise questions that are part of the general assessment measures such as
      dyadic coping, spousal support, and relationship satisfaction. The patient will also complete
      questions about pain and fatigue.
