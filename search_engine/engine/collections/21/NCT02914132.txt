    
      This trial is a prospective, non-randomized study in patients as an adjunctive treatment for
      blood stream infection (BSI) in patients on renal replacement therapy. The heparin surface
      being studied is currently marketed on extracorporeal circuits. It has been shown to absorb
      various types of Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria and to reduce toxins and cytokines
      in in vitro studies using whole blood. For this study, patients on renal replacement therapy
      who develop bacteremia will have the Seraph® 100 Microbind® Affinity Blood Filter included in
      the dialysis circuit for up to 4 hours, on one day, with hourly monitoring. Patients will be
      followed for 14 days post treatment. Patients will be monitored by vital signs and laboratory
      indices on the day of treatment and on post procedure day 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 14.
