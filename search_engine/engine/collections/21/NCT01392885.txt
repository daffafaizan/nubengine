    
      This is a 12-week, randomized trial with two parallel groups. Throughout the trial, subjects
      will be treated on their prescribed dose of medication. Once informed consent is obtained,
      subjects and healthy volunteers will be randomly assigned to either an aerobic or a
      resistance exercise program (N = 24 per diagnostic group in each of two exercise conditions).
      Patients will continue to receive their antipsychotics and other prescribed medications.
      Healthy volunteer data will be used to establish normal exercise-induced neuroplasticity in a
      non-psychiatric, non-medicated population. All training will be conducted at the Riverview
      Hospital fitness facilities and at dedicated exercise training facilities at the University
      of British Columbia. All exercise sessions will be monitored by trained research assistants
      (RAs) under the guidance of the Canadian Society for Exercise Physiology-Certified Exercise
      Physiologists (CSEP-CEPs). The RAs will receive pre-study exercise training from the
      CSEP-CEPs. During the course of the study, the training intensity will be changed according
      to the individual participant's response and needs via the CSEP-CEPs and RAs.
