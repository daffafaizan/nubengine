    
      Primary objective:

      To demonstrate the non-inferiority of cfDNA-based versus tumor tissue-based genotyping as it
      pertains to the detection of clinically-actionable biomarkers in first line, treatment na√Øve,
      metastatic non-squamous NSCLC.

      The following secondary objectives will be studied:

        -  Turn around Time (TAT) of cfDNA vs. tissue results.

        -  Time to treatment (TtT) initiation.

        -  Quantity not sufficient rate (QNS) of tissue for clinically-actionable biomarker
           testing.

        -  Tumor Not Detected (TND) rate of cfDNA in blood.

        -  Rescue rate of QNS samples using cfDNA-derived genotyping.

        -  Rate response for patients that are actionable biomarker positive (either in cDNA or
           tissue) treated with target-drugs according investigator criteria. Up to three RECIST
           assessments per patient will be retrospectively done by external personnel (no
           investigational team).

        -  Rate of discovery of genomically mediated, acquired resistance to targeted therapies in
           the biomarker-positive subsets.
