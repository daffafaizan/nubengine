      six month intervals by trained study staff through one year total study time. Differences
      between groups will be assessed with generalized linear mixed modeling. Information obtained
      to address Aim 3 will be gathered at the 12 month follow-up and analyzed with simple
      proportions and Chi-square test to assess differences between sexes and other socioeconomic
      indicators.
