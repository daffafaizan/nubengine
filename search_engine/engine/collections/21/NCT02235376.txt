    
      Prospective clinical study in ICU with brain injured ventilated patients eligible to
      extubation.

      Identification of clinical and biological criteria associated with failure of extubation.

      Elaboration of a prognostic score of extubation failure of brain injured patients, based on
      criteria previously identified with multivariate analysis.

      Failure of extubation is defined by the need of re-intubation or the need for non-invasive
      ventilation within 48 hours or more after extubation.
