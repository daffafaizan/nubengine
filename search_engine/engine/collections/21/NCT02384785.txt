      (Spinal Cord Stimulation- SCS). The electrode will serve as a voltage reader deep in the
      tissue. The voltage is generated from electrodes applied on the skin and delivers therapeutic
      currents to the patients back. The study will be tested 4 different types of currents and
      number of electrode placement.
