      therapy option for heavily pre-treated patients. The toxicity profile and activity level
      suggest that this combination will provide a useful platform onto which novel compounds may
      be added. Sirolimus has been shown to demonstrate single-agent activity in preclinical models
      of rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, medulloblastoma, glioblastoma, neuroblastoma, and
      osteosarcoma. Sirolimus has also been shown to have additive effects in pre-clinical models
      of solid tumors when combined with cyclophosphamide. This trial therefore will evaluate the
      combination of sirolimus with cyclophosphamide and topotecan. Pharmacokinetic studies of
      sirolimus as well as pharmacodynamic studies to assess antiangiogensis and inhibition of the
      mTOR pathway will be done.

      Patients will be accrued to dose levels in cohorts of 3 using a 3 + 3 design. Patients will
      initially be enrolled on dose level 1. Patients will receive daily oral sirolimus and
      cyclophosphamide on days 1 - 21 in a 28 day cycle. This will be combined with oral topotecan
      given on days 1 - 14. Sirolimus will be dosed based on steady-state plasma trough
      concentrations with a goal level in dose level 1 of 3-7.9 ng/ML and goal levels in subsequent
      dose levels of 8-12.0 ng/ML. Dosing of cyclophosphamide and topotecan will be 25 mg/m2/dose
      and 0.8 mg/ m2 /dose respectively for dose levels 1 and 2. Level 3 dosing will escalate
      cyclophosphamide to 50 mg/ m2/dose. If level 1 dosing is not tolerated, patients will then be
      enrolled in a level -1 cohort with cyclophosphamide and sirolimus administered only on days 1
      - 14. If level -1 is not tolerated, patients will be enrolled in level -2 with topotecan
      administration limited to days 1 - 7.
