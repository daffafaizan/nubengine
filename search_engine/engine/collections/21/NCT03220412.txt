      PG-13 films that target youth has increased from the level of G and PG files in 1985 when the
      rating was introduced, to the level of R films by 2005, to exceed the level of R films since
      2012. By definition, a PG-13 movie is supposed to have less violence than an R-rated movie.
      The Motion Picture Association of America says on its website that the violence in a PG-13
      movie "does not reach the restricted R category." Our study shows that it does. By including
      guns in violent scenes, film producers may be inadvertently increasing aggression in youth
      via a weapons effect. This experiment directly tests this hypothesis.
