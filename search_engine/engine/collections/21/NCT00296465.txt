    
      This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study will be performed in
      approximately 132 women with anovulatory/oligoovulatory infertility. The treatment duration
      will be approximately 4 weeks with pulsatile GnRH or placebo and 5 days with Clomiphene
      Citrate or placebo. All subjects will be screened based on inclusion/exclusion criteria,
      medical/infertility history and general safety assessments. Subjects that complete screening
      will be dispensed 100 mg of oral progesterone twice a day for 10 days to induce uterine
      bleeding. On Cycle Day 5 from the start of bleeding the subject will be randomly assigned to
      1 of 7 treatment groups. All subjects will be monitored weekly throughout the 4 week
      treatment period for ovulation and intercourse will be timed. All subjects will be required
      to return to the study center for a total of 8 visits. In addition, all subjects with a
      confirmed clinical pregnancy will be monitored until fetal heartbeat is confirmed at
      approximately 5-6 weeks gestation
