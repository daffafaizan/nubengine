      coagulation system like catheters, severe infections or congenital heart defects will be
      recorded. Also a full workup of prothrombotic risk factors are routinely performed in those
      infants. The study included basic coagulation analysis, Protein C, S and Antithrombin III
      activity, Activated Protein C Resistance, serum homocystein, lipoprotein (a) and Lupus
      Anticoagulant.

      Also the three common genetic factors are analysed including Factor F Leiden (G1691A),
      Prothrombin Mutation (G20210A) and MTHFR polymorphism (C677T).
