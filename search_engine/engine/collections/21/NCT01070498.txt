      avoidance of the allergenic food is the only established method of preventing reactions in
      allergic patients. This situation impacts significantly the lives of patients, mainly
      children, and their families. The current increase in the prevalence of allergic diseases,
      food allergy in particular, in the Western world has been attributed in part to changes in
      life style. Before the mid 20th century individuals were exposed to numerous bacterial,
      parasitic and viral agents. Since these times the progress of hygiene has considerably
      reduced the risk of exposure to these agents. It is thought that this lack of exposure,
      particularly during childhood, has led to subtle changes in humans' immune system resulting
      in an increased propensity to develop allergic and autoimmune responses, the so-called
      hygiene hypothesis. One of the means of reverting this propensity could be exposure to
      harmless biological agents. One such agent, eggs of the parasite Trichuris suis (Trichuris
      suis ova, TSO), has been shown to be well tolerated and efficient in patients with
      inflammatory bowel diseases. This phase I study will assess whether TSO is safe in adults and
      children with peanut or tree nut allergy.
