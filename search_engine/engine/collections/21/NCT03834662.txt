      the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) that enhances the metastatic potential of
      tumor cells. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are a critical constituent of the TME. As
      is the case for fibrosis in other settings, these cells are myofibroblast-like, and respond
      to and are activated by tumor-derived TGFβ. CAFs play a critical role in promoting EMT
      resulting in increased tumor cell migration and invasion as well as maintaining the TME to
      support tumor cell survival. The immunosuppressive role of TGFβ in the TME has been clearly
      demonstrated with the activation of CAFs being an important mechanism underlying immune cell
      exclusion. Exclusion of immune cells from tumors and local immunosuppression can both be
      reversed by AVID200 therapy.
