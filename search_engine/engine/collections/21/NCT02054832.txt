      children only) will be enrolled during their usual follow-up. Parents will be asked to
      complete a quality of sleep questionnaire (as it pertains to both child and parent) relating
      to the past month on their current dietary regimen (standard UCCS) and a quality of life
      questionnaire (as it pertains to the child only). Parents will then complete a sleep diary
      (for both child and parent) and both child and parent will wear an actigraph that will record
      movements during sleep over a 1 week period. Adult GSD patients will complete their own
      questionnaires. Following this first assessment, they will be hospitalised over a 24 hour
      period as part of standard of care to start the modified UCCS, Glycosade, under supervision
      and with a continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) sensor. Following hospitalization, the family
      will return home. Glucose will be monitored with the aid of the CGM sensor for 5 to 7 days.
      The actigraphy and the sleep diary will be repeated after 2 weeks (for 1 week) while on
      Glycosade. One month after starting the modified UCCS, questionnaires on quality of sleep and
      quality of life will be repeated.
