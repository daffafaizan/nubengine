      trendelenburg positon. And a long duration of this position could lead to delayed emergence
      or agitation. Stimulation at some acupoints were reported to improve homeostasis. In this
      study we tend to observe whether transcutaneous electrical stimulation at specific acupoints
      could improve the quality of emergence in patients undergoing robotic laparoscopic
      gynecologic surgery.
