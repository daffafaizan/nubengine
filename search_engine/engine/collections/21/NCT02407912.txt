      then the patients were enrolled into the trial.First, premedication including antiemetics and
      hydration were performed. Thereafter, 75 mg of body surface area of cisplatin in 50 ml of
      distilled water was injected through a chest tube.The patients were asked to change position
      (supine and bilateral decubital) from time to time for 30 minutes. The chest tube was clamped
      for 48 h and then the tube was declamped and allowed to drain. When the drainage effusion was
      less than 100 ml a day, the chest tube was removed. Any patient whose drainage effusion
      continued for over 2 weeks was withdrawn from the trial and was also judged to be a
      nonresponder.
