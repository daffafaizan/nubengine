        -  Compare disease-free survival of women with clinically node-negative breast cancer with
           sentinel lymph node micrometastases treated with surgical resection with or without
           axillary dissection.

        -  Compare overall survival of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Assess sites of recurrence, particularly reappearance of disease in the undissected
           axilla.

        -  Assess long-term surgical complications in patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to participating
      center, menopausal status (pre- vs postmenopausal), and preoperative sentinel node biopsy
      (yes vs no). Patients are followed every 4 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 4 years, and
      then annually thereafter.
