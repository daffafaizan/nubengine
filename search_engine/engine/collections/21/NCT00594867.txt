      thromboembolic events. As a non-selective inhibitor of cyclooxygenase, aspirin use results in
      irreversible COX-1 inhibition leading to impaired platelet aggregation. However, aspirin also
      inhibits COX-1 activity in the gastric mucosa by suppressing the synthesis of protective
      prostaglandins. In doing so, this creates a state of propensity for the development of
      aspirin-associated gastrointestinal ulcers and ulcer complications.

      A high proportion of aspirin users also require concomitant use of anti-inflammatory
      medications for the treatment of pain and arthritis. However, evidence suggests that the risk
      of developing gastroduodenal ulcers and ulcer complications is significantly increased when
      aspirin is co-administered with other nonselective NSAIDs. In a previous study, concomitant
      aspirin (325 mg daily) in healthy subjects taking naproxen (500mg bid) was associated with
      endoscopic ulcer rates of 27.3% as compared to aspirin alone (7.6%). In a separate and
      independent trial of similar design, patients using 81 mg of aspirin in conjunction with
      daily naproxen also resulted in a higher incidence of gastric and duodenal ulcers than
      aspirin therapy alone. Beyond endoscopic ulcer rates, the risk of upper gastrointestinal
      hemorrhage has been reported to be substantially increased with concurrent administration of
      low-dose aspirin with nonselective NSAIDS. These data suggest that the gastrointestinal
      toxicity of combined aspirin with other NSAIDs may be more than additive.
