      depression. No objective markers have been identified that indicate which patients are most
      likely to respond to TMS therapy. The goal of the present investigation is to determine
      whether an electroencephalographic measure called cordance or a measure of blood flow in the
      frontal brain, as measured by near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) can serve as predictors of
      outcome with TMS therapy in depression. Subjects with depression will be treated in this
      study for 6 weeks with TMS. Frontal brain blood flow measured using NIRS will be assessed
      prior to TMS therapy, and repeatedly thereafter. EEG cordance will also be obtained following
      a similar schedule. Measures of depression and other psychiatric disorders will be collected
      prior to, during and for 2 weeks after the completion of TMS treatment. The correlation
      between these measures and the EEG and NIRS measures will then be determined to see if these
      latter measures are predictive of improvement in depression.
