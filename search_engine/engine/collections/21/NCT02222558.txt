      after administration of TSX-002 (easy to swallow testosterone capsules) to hypogonadal men.
      This will be determined by blood sampling at specified times during the study. The study is
      also intended to evaluate the PK parameters of the testosterone metabolite,
      dihydrotestosterone (DHT), as well as the safety and tolerability of TSX-002. The study
      consists of three (3) periods, for which TSX-002 will be taken orally at various doses. Study
      duration is approximately 9 weeks.
