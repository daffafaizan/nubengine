      metabolic disturbance to understand the relationship between red raspberry intake, metabolic
      and immune- balance and cognitive and psychomotor performance in older/over weight adults. A
      secondary goal of the project is to provide data on central vascular function in relation to
      metabolic-, inflammatory- and cognitive outcomes. Our primary working hypothesis is that red
      raspberries will improve metabolic- / inflammatory- balance in older overweight and obese
      adults resulting in improved cognitive and psychomotor performance mediated in part through
      improvements in vascular function. Two main objectives have been devised to meet the goals of
      the project and test our hypotheses: 1) Evaluate the effects of acute dietary raspberry
      intake on metabolic-associated impairments in cognitive and psychomotor function in
      overweight/obese adults (55-70y) following a meal challenge. 2) Evaluate the effects of acute
      dietary raspberry on measures of vascular function
