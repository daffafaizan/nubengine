      immune modulating nutrients (eg, ω-3 fatty acids and antioxidants) enriched with β-glucan
      stimulates immune functions compared with standard enteral nutrition (control: 20% of total
      calorie from protein) or high-protein (24% of total calorie from protein) enteral nutrition
      of immune modulating nutrients without β-glucan in critically ill patients. In a randomized
      double-blind placebo-controlled study, 30 patients consumed 1 of 3 enteral nutrition:
      control, enteral nutrition of immune modulating nutrients enriched with β-glucan (250mg/L) or
      enteral nutrition of immune modulating nutrients without β-glucan. Enteral nutrition was
      initiated within 24 hours of ICU admission and continued during the ICU stay for a 7 days.
