      and is widely available. Accurate characterization of gastric emptying may guide medical and
      surgical treatment choices. In addition, these techniques may allow for monitoring of
      therapeutic results for follow-up patient management.

      The SmartPill GI Monitoring System offers an alternative non-invasive method for
      characterizing disorders of the stomach. The system consists of an ingestible capsule that
      houses sensors for pH, temperature, and pressure, a receiver for receiving and storing
      signals from the capsule, and software for displaying data on a personal computer. The
      capsule samples at regular intervals and transmits the sensed pH, pressure, and temperature
      data to a portable receiver worn by the subject. After test completion, the recorded data is
      downloaded to a personal computer for subsequent evaluation.
