      of the virus and/or can help the immune response to prevent the illness from getting worse in
      the lungs. We hope that INFERGEN will either prevent patients from getting worse and
      requiring intensive care or will decrease the time for which they will need intensive care.

      The Interferon-alpha (also called Interferon-alphacon1 or IFN-alphacon1 or INFERGEN) is an
      immune molecule, which has been shown to work against different viruses (anti-viral).
      Interferon is the standard of treatment for patients with chronic (infection that has been
      there for a long time) hepatitis C (a virus which affects the liver over many years) by
      giving it for 6-12 months. It has also been used for a shorter time of up to 14 days, in a
      small study for patients with respiratory disease caused by SARS and seemed to help these
      patients get better more rapidly. It also has been shown to stop different Influenza viruses
      from growing in test tubes and in lung tissue. It has also been shown to decrease the immune
      response to prevent it from over-reacting to viruses.
