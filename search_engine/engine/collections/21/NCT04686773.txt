    
      This is a prospective, multicenter, open-label clinical study, designed to provide data on
      the heterologous prime-boost use of AZD1222 and rAd26-S, to be administered one after the
      other.

      All participants will be healthy adults ≥ 18 years of age. They will receive 1 intramuscular
      (IM) injection of 5×10^10 viral particles (vp) (nominal) of AZD1222 on Day 1 followed by
      rAd26-S 1×10^11 viral particles (vp) (nominal) on Day 29 of the study.

      All participants will remain on study for 6 months (180 days) following the first
      vaccination. Safety will be assessed for the duration of the study as follows:

        -  Solicited adverse events (AEs; local and systemic) will be assessed for 7 days following
           each vaccination (ie, until Day 8 following the first administration and Day 36
           following the second administration)

        -  Unsolicited AEs will be recorded for 28 days following each vaccination (ie, until Day
           29 following the first administration and Day 57 following the second administration)

        -  Serious adverse events (SAEs) will be recorded from signing of the informed consent form
           through Day 180

      Immunogenicity will also be assessed for the duration of the study, including serologic
      quantification of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2)
      antigen-specific antibody levels and antibody seroconversion rate, neutralizing antibody
      assays.

      The study will allow to explore the safety and immunogenicity of two different adenovirus
      vector vaccines combination, thereby complementing data from other pivotal controlled vaccine
      trials in other countries.

      This study is going to be conducted in the Republic of Azerbaijan. It is expected that
      approximately 100 participants will be included in the study and receive the vaccine.
