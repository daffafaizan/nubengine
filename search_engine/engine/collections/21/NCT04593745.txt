      high dose steroid therapy. One of the known side effects of high dose steroids is Intraocular
      hypertension, glaucoma, and even irreversible optic nerve injury. Early diagnosis of elevated
      intraocular pressure (IOP) and early therapeutic interventions might help to prevent future
      ocular damage.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the risk of developing evaluate Intraocular
      pressure during high dose steroid therapy. If elevated IOP will be common enough, we will try
      to corelate the risk of elevated IOP with potential risk factors, such as initial IOP, WBC at
      diagnosis, etc.

      Intraocular pressure will be measured by ophthalmologists using iCare devise: TONOPEN during
      general anesthesia at the day of diagnosis of ALL before steroid therapy initiation, and then
      after 15 and 33 days. Children with elevated IOP will continue ophthalmologists' follow up
      and treatment as necessary.

      All parents or patients' guardians will sign informed consent for participating in the study.

      The study group contains all newly diagnosed children with ALL in Schneider Children Medical
      Center.
