      amifostine prior to daily radiation therapy and the other group will receive radiation
      therapy alone.

      Amifostine will be administered 30-60 minutes prior to radiation treatment. Vital signs will
      be monitored 5 minutes and 15 minutes after amifostine injection as well as immediately
      following radiation treatment.

      Patients will also complete a quality-of-life questionnaire on the first and last day of
      radiation treatment. Follow-up questionnaires will be done at follow-up visits 1 month, 3
      months, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months and 24 months after completion of radiation therapy.

      Patients will be removed from the study if they develop an allergic reaction to amifostine.
