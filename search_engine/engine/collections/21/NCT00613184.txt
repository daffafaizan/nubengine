      performed using the nasal saline aspirate technique described by Hall in 1975.

      Nylon flocked swabs (NFS) and universal transport medium for room temperature (UTM-RT) (Copan
      Medical, Murrieta, CA) storage media have been found to be an effective collection and
      transport method for bacteria causing sexually transmitted infections.

      We adapted these swabs and storage medium to collect respiratory viruses from children less
      than18 months old and compared detection rates using NFS and traditional nasal aspirates. We
      will determine the relative roles of the UTM-RT and NFS release and therefore measured viral
      detection rates of common respiratory pathogens in traditional saline aspirates stored in
      UTM-RT.

      Our primary hypothesis is that nasal secretions collection using NFS stored in UTM-RT will
      lead to a higher detection rate of the respiratory viruses we arestudying; namely RSV,
      Influenza and human metapneumovirus from than collection of unpreserved saline nasal
      aspirates in children less than 18 months of age.
