      of a complex process in which musculoskeletal and neurological systems function. Two
      different balance states are defined as the static balance where the individuals maintain
      their inactive position or the dynamic balance when they perform a foreseen movement. The
      balance is maintained by keeping the center of gravity within the boundaries of the support
      surface and is provided by sensory impulses from the visual, vestibular and somatosensory
      systems organized by the central nervous system. Balance is an important factor to lead an
      independent life, and it is imperative that the balance be ensured in order to ensure that
      daily living activities are performed safely. The neural control of the bipedal posture
      varies depending on the width of the supporting surface, which has a significant impact on
      the frontal plane biomechanics. There is a linear relationship between increased support
      surface size and mechanical stability. In experimental studies, it has been shown that
      increasing muscle width levels in response to translational perturbations seen on the support
      surface on the horizontal plane have decreased with increasing step width. The changes in the
      preferred support surface vary depending on the age of the external environment, recurrent
      falls due to decreased sensory input, or various neurological disorders. However, there are
      few quantitative studies examining the relationship between different support surface widths
      and equilibrium, and the effect of posture width on sensory feedback control is still poorly
      understood. This study was planned to evaluate the effect of age, visual sensation and
      different soil properties on postural release and stability limits at different support
      surface widths.
