    
      Patients and age-matched control subjects will be recruited from the Urogynecology clinic in
      Hadassah Mt Scopus and the gynecology clinic, respectively.

      After assessment of inclusion and exclusion criteria and patient's consent to participate, a
      history intake (detailing demographics, medical history, risk factors for rUTI etc.) and
      gynecological examination will be conducted as part of the usual assessment in the clinic.

      Vaginal, urine and fecal samples for microbiome molecular analysis will be collected during
      clinic visits, given at least one month without antibiotics before samples collection, using
      agreed protocols and will be kept for future evaluation. Urine will be collected for
      urinalysis and for a urine culture.

      In addition, urine cultures, as well as vaginal, urine and fecal samples for molecular
      analysis will be collected during an acute UTI episode from the same patients.

      Healthy patients (the control group) will be examined only once.
