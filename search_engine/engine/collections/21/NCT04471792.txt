      million U.S. adults above the age of 40, significantly increasing the rate of morbidity and
      mortality with concomitant decreases in quality of life. These patients are often given
      medical therapy (e.g., statins, antiplatelet, anticoagulants) and are also recommended to
      begin structured exercise programs. However, the limb ischemia that occurs during physical
      activity in these patients often limits exercise tolerance. A previous study by Bauer and
      colleagues showed that impaired muscle metabolism is a major contributor to functional
      limitations in PAD patients. These data are important in that they show alterations in blood
      flow and metabolic machinery likely impact exercise tolerance. As such, the development of
      tolerable countermeasures to improve limb blood flow and muscle energetics may increase
      adherence to exercise therapy and improve health outcomes in PAD patients. Previous work by
      the investigators has shown that daily muscle stretching, achieved via 30-minutes of ankle
      dorsiflexion, significantly improved soleus muscle function and muscle blood flow during
      exercise in a rat model of aging . In a follow-up study, the investigators have also shown
      that this model improves vascular function and walking function in PAD patients. As noted
      above, muscle energetics are delayed in PAD patients, so improving the rest-to-exercise
      transition with creatine supplementation may help PAD patients sustain exercise longer. The
      investigators are now testing to see if an added supplement can further improve the effects
      of muscle stretching in PAD patients.
