      major aims of the larger study are to determine the extent to which aspects of circadian
      rhythmicity, including, sleep/wake rhythms, daily social routines (i.e., social rhythms),
      circadian type (morningness/eveningness), endogenous circadian rhythms and polymorphisms
      associated with altered circadian function in specific genes (namely, CLOCK, Period 2 and
      Period 3) moderate treatment response in bipolar disorder.

      The overarching aim of the study is to clarify the nature of rhythm abnormalities in bipolar
      disorder and, especially, their relation to clinical state. We propose to do this in the
      context of a randomized intervention protocol in which half of the subjects will receive a
      treatment aimed at rhythm regularization. We expect to study individuals with a range of
      circadian and sleep-wake abnormalities, social rhythm disturbances, and circadian type and to
      examine the extent to which these parameters predict subjects' clinical outcomes. Since one
      half of the subjects will receive IPSRT as part of their treatment regimen (with increasing
      regularity of social routines as a goal of treatment), we will be able to examine the extent
      to which changes in social rhythm regularity and sleep quality are associated with clinical
      and functional improvement and whether these outcomes are mediated by changes in endogenous
      circadian rhythms.
