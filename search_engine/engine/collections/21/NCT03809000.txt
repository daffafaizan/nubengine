    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      To determine whether, in men with post-prostatectomy PSA (prostate specific antigen)
      recurrences with aggressive disease features, salvage radiotherapy (SRT) with enhanced
      androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), consisting of enzalutamide (MDV3100) and a GnRH analog,
      will improve progression-free survival compared to SRT with standard GnRH analog -based ADT.
