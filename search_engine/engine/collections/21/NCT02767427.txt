      at home before surgery in patients undergoing spine surgery. This study will investigate
      whether patients who use a chlorhexidine cleansing wipe have decreased amounts of bacteria on
      their skin when they arrive for scheduled spine surgery. Spine surgeons strive to decrease
      infections in their patients, so it is important to see if this intervention helps to do
      this.
