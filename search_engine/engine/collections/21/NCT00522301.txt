    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine the 12-month progression-free survival (PFS) rate of women with ovarian
           epithelial, fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer in second or greater remission treated
           with oral sorafenib tosylate.

      Secondary

        -  To determine the safety and tolerability of prolonged treatment with oral sorafenib
           tosylate in women with a history of recurrent ovarian cancer.

        -  To correlate serum markers of angiogenesis (i.e., VEGF and bFGF) and tumor markers pAKT,
           HIF-1 α , and VEGF with 12-month PFS.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral sorafenib twice a day on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28
      days for up to 24 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients undergo tumor tissue and blood sample collection at baseline, every 12 weeks during
      study, and after completion of study therapy for pharmacokinetic studies. Samples are
      analyzed for soluble markers of angiogenesis (i.e., VEGF and bFGF) via ELISA and HIF-1 α,
      VEGF, and pAKT via IHC staining.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 4 weeks.
