      events in patients with cardiovascular disease. Which is shown to greatly increase the risk
      of myocardial infarction or stroke, especially in elderly patients with hypertension. Direct
      laryngoscopy and laryngoscopic stimulation of pharyngolaryngeal structures may be an
      important factor in the hemodynamic stress response associated with tracheal intubation.

      Patients were randomly allocated to two groups using a permuted block randomization method:
      1) patients intubated by using the videolaryngoscopy 2) patients intubated by using the
      Macintosh laryngoscope . SAP, MAP, and heart rate were measured and recorded in the operating
      room: At baseline, before intubation, immediately after intubation and 1,2,3,4 and 5 minutes
      after tracheal intubation.
