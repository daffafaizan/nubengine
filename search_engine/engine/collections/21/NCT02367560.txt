      The chronic and variable course of the condition can lead to dissatisfaction with
      conservative management. Current guidelines recommend conservative management initially and
      failing this, a variety of minimally invasive options exist. These include subacromial
      steroid injection (SSI), needle decompression (ND), and Shock wave therapy (SWT).

      Few trials of these methods exist, but generally a benefit is seen with all minimally
      invasive methods. Most promising results have occurred with needle decompression and
      shockwave therapy. To date, no direct trials comparing SWT and ND have been published.

      The purpose of this trial is to preliminarily establish the comparative efficacies of NDSSI
      and SWT using a number of outcome measures. Secondarily, the investigators aim to determine
      prognostic factors for success of minimally invasive therapies. The results of this study
      will serve as a foundation for more rigorous trials in this area.
