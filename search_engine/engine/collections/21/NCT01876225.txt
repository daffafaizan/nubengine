      Colposcopically guided punch biopsies are a standard procedure performed in women with
      abnormal cervical cytology, as a part of the diagnosis and treatment selection.

      Coughing is thought to provide a distraction and to cause a momentarily increase in blood
      pressure, reducing pain perception.

      Therefore, the present study is designed to compare pain associated with cervical punch
      biopsy and the effect of forced coughing on pain and pain perception.
