      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of SU5416 when administered with daunorubicin
      liposomal in patients with acute myeloid leukemia, refractory anemia with excess blasts
      (RAEB), RAEB in transformation, or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia not in complete remission
      21-50 days after one course of induction chemotherapy.

      II. Determine the efficacy of this regimen in these patients. III. Determine the qualitative
      and quantitative toxicities of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of SU5416.

      Patients receive daunorubicin liposomal IV over 6 hours on days 1-3 and SU5416 IV twice a
      week for 2 months. The second course is administered for 1 month, then treatment continues
      every 4-6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of SU5416 until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients
      experience dose limiting toxicities.

      Patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-37 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.
