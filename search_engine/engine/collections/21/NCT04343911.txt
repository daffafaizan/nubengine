      position and intermittent Trendelenburg position, which is associated with postoperative
      peripheral neuropathy, which is a substantial cause of anesthesia-related claims. This study
      aims to primarily assess the incidence of postoperative peripheral neuropathy of patients
      positioned conventionally by shoulder braces and secondly to compare this group with patients
      positioned on the foam mattress Pink Pad ® 24-hours after surgery and secondarily at a 30-day
      postoperative follow-up.

      This consecutive single-center prospective cohort study of 155 patients undergoing colorectal
      surgery was performed between November 2014 and June 2015. After initial results the
      implementation of the Pink Pad ® took place and a total of 52 patients were included between
      May 2016 and February 2017 in order to compare the two groups.

      Position related postoperative peripheral neuropathy is an important complication after
      laparoscopic colorectal surgery. This study concludes that careful attention should be payed
      to positioning and favors Pink Pad ® over conventional positioning with shoulder braces.
