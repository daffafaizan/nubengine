      I. Estimate the objective response rate (ORR) using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
      Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Estimate the 6-month and median progression free survival (PFS) rates. II. Estimate the
      2-year and median overall survival (OS) rates. III. Evaluate the safety of trametinib in
      patients with epithelioid hemangioendothelioma.

      IV. Evaluate patient-reported symptoms using National Institutes of Health Patient Reported
      Outcomes Measurement Information System (NIH PROMIS) global health; pain intensity,
      interference and behavior short form inventories prior to, after 4 weeks and after 6 months
      (if stable or better disease) of treatment, and on evidence of disease progression.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Compare the rates of epithelioid hemangioendothelioma progression prior to starting
      trametinib to rates on treatment by central review of radiology images.

      II. Evaluate the effect of trametinib on change in tumor volume and compare to RECIST 1.1
      response through central imaging review.

      III. Evaluate the effect of trametinib on markers of inflammation including c-reactive
      protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and plasma connective tissue growth
      factor (CTGF).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive trametinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every
      28 days for up to 52 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 6 months.
