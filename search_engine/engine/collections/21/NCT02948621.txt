      banding. Nowadays, practitioners have the possibility to reduce stomach size by merging
      tissues through an endoscopic endoluminal suture approach without any incision. This could
      reduce the complications associated with current surgical techniques while obtaining the
      target gastric restriction, weight loss, comorbidities and quality of life improvement.

      The primary objective of this study is to assess weight loss after endoscopic sleeve
      gastroplasty in patients with morbid obesity according to the technique described in the
      literature: reduction of the gastric pouch into a sleeve structure by modification of the
      stomach greater curvature thanks to a plication.
