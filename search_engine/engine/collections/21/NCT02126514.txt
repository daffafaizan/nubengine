      to evaluate the mass balance, metabolite profiles, and rates and routes of elimination of
      [14C]-AZD3293 and derived metabolites following administration as a single 100-mg (containing
      approximately 150 ÂµCi) oral dose (as an oral solution) following at least an 8-hour fast from
      food (not including water). Seven healthy male subjects will be enrolled in the study at a
      single study site to complete a minimum of 6 subjects. The study will consist of 2 visits.
