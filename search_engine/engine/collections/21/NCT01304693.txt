      receive either ESBA1008 at the lowest dose (Dose A) or LUCENTIS. After Safety Committee
      review, a second cohort was enrolled and randomized (5:2) to the next higher dose of ESBA1008
      (Dose B). Safety review and enrollment of patients into the third cohort (Dose C) and fourth
      cohort (Dose D) was conducted in the same manner. Part 2, the expansion period, consisted of
      2 arms. In the first arm patients were randomized to receive ESBA1008 Dose C or LUCENTIS
      (43:44) . In the second arm, patients were randomized to ESBA1008 Doses A:B:D:Lucentis
      (5:30:35:9). All enrolled patients (Part 1 and Part 2) were evaluated for safety and efficacy
      across 13 study visits, including Screening, Randomization, and 11 post- treatment follow-up
      visits (Day 1 through Month 6).
