      who will enroll up to 2500 patients with management observations based on four visits by the
      patients in an outpatient setting. The timing of the visits will be baseline, 6±2 months,
      12±2 months, and 18±2 months during which patient management by their physician will be
      captured using the electronic data capture form (DCF). The DCF will be created and managed by
      the CHRC.
