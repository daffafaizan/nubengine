    
      The HemoCare™ Hemodialysis System has been evaluated in previous clinical trials and is
      designed to perform hemodialysis (HD) in a clinic setting, in a self-care setting, or in a
      home environment for conventional HD, short daily HD or extended-duration HD therapy during
      the daytime or at night dependent on the users' lifestyle or work schedule. This
      multi-center, open-label, single-arm cross-over study is designed specifically to gather and
      evaluate safety data for the use of the HemoCare™ Hemodialysis System (including labeling and
      training tools) during home nocturnal (during sleeping hours based on the patient schedule)
      use. Nocturnal HD therapy was chosen as a treatment in this study because of the clinical and
      humanistic benefits associated with it. In addition, its risk profile, especially when
      performed in a home setting, may be greater than either existing conventional or short daily
      HD therapies. In this regard, establishing an acceptable safety profile for home nocturnal HD
      therapy should be sufficient evidence to support conventional and short daily HD home
      therapies with HemoCare™ Hemodialysis System.
