      Primary

        -  Compare the complete response rate (confirmed or unconfirmed) in patients with
           previously untreated aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with cyclophosphamide,
           doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone with vs without gemcitabine.

      Secondary

        -  Compare the safety profile of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Compare the feasibility of these regimens, defined as the proportion of courses given as
           scheduled, in these patients.

        -  Compare freedom from treatment failure in patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified
      according to participating center, International Prognostic Index score (0-2 vs 3-5), and
      histology (B cell vs T cell). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive CHOP chemotherapy comprising cyclophosphamide IV, doxorubicin
           IV, and vincristine IV on day 1 and oral or IV prednisone on days 1-5.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive CHOP chemotherapy as in arm I and gemcitabine IV over 30
           minutes on days 1 and 8.

      In both arms, treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 3 courses in the absence of unacceptable
      toxicity or progressive disease. Patients achieving partial response or complete or
      unconfirmed complete response receive an additional 5 courses of therapy (for a total of 8
      courses).

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 3 years, every 6 months for 2 years, and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 76-82 patients (38-41 per treatment arm) will be accrued for
      this study within 2 years.
