      strategy of hearing care aims to preserve the quality of life and patient hearing. For severe
      to profound hearing loss and anatomical auditory nerve preservation, the cochlear implant is
      put forward compared to the auditory brainstem implant. Indeed, cochlear implant provides
      better speech outcomes. If cochlear implantation is not possible or no benefit for the
      patient, the brainstem implant is the most widely used. The Neuristim device is used to
      investigate the auditory nerve integrity following neuroma surgery or on an affected auditory
      nerve. The Neuristim is an intra-cochlear stimulator used in an intraoperative way. The
      intra-cochlear electrodes provide an electrical stimulation to auditory nerve fibers, and
      auditory nerve response measurements to these electrical stimulation are recorded and
      evaluated to determine the auditory nerve functionality. The Neuristim is a device for
      helping surgeons to choose the most appropriate implantable solution. 2 groups of patients
      will be involved in this study:

        -  a group of 17 patients with an acoustic neuroma or a past neuroma surgically removed or
           acoustic neuroma not requiring a surgery and with severe to profound hearing loss
           candidate for a cochlear implant or a auditory brainstem depending on the auditory nerve
           functionality,

        -  a group of 17 patients with severe to profound hearing loss candidate for a cochlear
           implant.
