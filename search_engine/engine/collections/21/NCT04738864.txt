      clinics in Assiute University Hospital Patients under 16 years old, patients with
      hyperlipidemia, hypertension, diabetes mellitus and all other risk factors affecting blood
      vessel intimal thickness will be excluded from the research.

      All patients and control groups underwent a complete extracranial and intracranial ultrasound
      assessment by 2 experienced neurovascular sonographers .The ultrasound examination was done
      at the Neurovascular Ultrasound Laboratory in the Neurology department, Assiut University
      hospitals using a color-coded duplex ultrasound device Philips HD5 (Philips Medical Systems,
      Nederland B.V.) for the carotid and vertebral arteries and for the intracranial arteries.

      Intimal medial thickness (IMT) of the common carotid artery (CCA), peak systolic velocities
      (PSVs) and end diastolic velocities (EDVs) were measured in the common, internal, and
      external carotid arteries (CCA, ICA, ECA) with L 3-12 MHz linear transducer probe and when
      stenosis was detected the velocities were measured at the maximally stenotic area.

      The intracranial arteries were evaluated in all patients with transcranial color-coded
      duplexsonography (TCCS) with the use of a low-frequency (2- to 5-MHz) phased-array probe
      through the transtemporal acoustic bone window. The middle cerebral artery (MCA),
      intracranial segment of vertebral artery (V4)and basilar artery (BA) were examined. Peak
      systolic velocity (PSV) and flow direction (antegrade or reversed) used for the diagnosis of
      any intracranial atherosclerotic disease (ICAD).

      The findings and the atherosclerotic changes in the extracranial and intracranial vessels
      were interpreted according to the internationally published data Data will be analyzed using
      the computer program SPSS
