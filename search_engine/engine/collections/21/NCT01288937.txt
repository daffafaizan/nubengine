      system. Serotonin and noradrenaline are molecules made by the brain that affect how your body
      responds to pain. Milnacipran, a dual norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake inhibitor has
      been a safe and beneficial treatment for patients with fibromyalgia and may be useful to
      treat patients with painful peripheral neuropathy. Many clinical trials for neuropathy pain
      are done in patients with diabetic neuropathy. Idiopathic neuropathy however, is a common
      cause of neuropathy and accounts for 25% of all neuropathies, and over 50% of small fiber
      neuropathies. The information in this study will provide information on whether milnacipran
      also provide benefit as a medication for neuropathic pain.
