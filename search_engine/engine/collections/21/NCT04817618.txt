      placebo and standard of care in patients with native C3G. CLNP023B12301 is a Phase 3 pivotal
      trial for registration of iptacopan in C3G. The study aims to determine the reduction in UPCR
      and improvement in eGFR in participants treated with iptacopan compared to placebo, as well
      as the proportion of participants who achieve a composite renal endpoint consisting of eGFR
      and UPCR elements. These effects of iptacopan in conjunction with increases in serum C3
      levels will provide support for an iptacopan profile that includes stabilization of eGFR,
      clinically meaningful reductions in proteinuria and inhibition of the complement AP. Kidney
      biopsies will be performed in all participants to evaluate histopathological improvements in
      immunofluorescence and light microscopy that support these functional benefits of iptacopan.
