      cyst under EUS guidance, an ethanol solution is placed into the cyst via the needle. The
      ethanol solution is withdrawn and new ethanol injected, and this process is continued for 5
      minutes, repeatedly washing the cyst with the ethanol solution.

      After this treatment, usual clinical follow-up is obtained including assessments of the cyst
      by CT or MRI scans. If a cyst of significant size persists, additional EUS-guided ethanol
      injections of the cyst were offered.
