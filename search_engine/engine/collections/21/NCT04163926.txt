      participants are randomized after cataract surgery to follow up to be consultant led follow
      up or conducted by a trained optometrist 4-6 weeks following surgery. All participants will
      then return 6 months after surgery for an additional follow-up visit with an ophthalmologist
      other than the operating surgeon with patient healthcare satisfaction (main outcome),
      cost-effectiveness and safety outcomes being measured. A subset of patients and local
      clinicians will also take part in a one-time, individual, semi-structured interview.

      This research will test an alternative model of aftercare for cataract surgeries, which may
      reduce patient waiting time and inconvenience. In turn, this could help improve patient
      satisfaction and reduce costs for both patients and the National Health Service (NHS).

      Participants will be recruited by operating surgeons. The research will take place in the
      hospital/clinic/optometrists' offices.
