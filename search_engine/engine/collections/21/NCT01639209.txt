      incidence of approximately 10 per 100,000 population. Both of the treatments under
      investigation are widely used and accepted by vitreoretinal surgeons, but randomised,
      prospective comparison of the two techniques has not been reported in the scientific
      literature to date. Currently, the management decisions surrounding primary retinal
      detachment are grounded on a weak evidence base. The findings of this study will allow
      vitreoretinal surgeons and their patients to select the most appropriate intervention for
      that individual, in an informed and holistic manner.
