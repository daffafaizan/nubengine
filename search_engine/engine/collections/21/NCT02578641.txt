      informed consent has been obtained. Patients will be randomly allocated to receive either Arm
      A (Gemcitabine and Carboplatin (GC) x 4* cycles and EBV-specific CTL) or Arm B (GC x 6 cycles
      alone) in a 1:1 ratio using a stratified block randomization scheme. The stratification
      variables are country and disease stage (metastatic vs locally recurrent). *Additional 1-2
      chemotherapy cycles (up to total 6 chemo cycles) might be given upon discretion of
      Investigator, if EBV-specific CTL infusions are not available in time for the 1st scheduled
      infusion.

      After randomization, patients in Arm A will have their peripheral blood taken for the
      establishment of cytotoxic T cell line and EBV transformed lymphoblastoid cell line (CTL).
      Within two weeks of enrollment, patients will commence combination GC chemotherapy for a
      total of 4 cycles. Patients in Stage 2 of study will receive the EBV-specific CTL
      immunotherapy.

      As of 1 May 2020, patients who have not received the first infusion of EBV-specific CTLs,
      will instead continue to receive a total of 6 cycles combination of Gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2)
      and carboplatin (AUC2) on Days 1, 8, 15 every 28 days
