      remission, in patients with localized prostate cancer treated with two different radiotherapy
      regimens using different doses and number of fractions. II. Compare the nadir of PSA and the
      delay in obtaining the nadir in patients treated with these two regimens. III. Compare acute
      and long-term toxicity of these two regimens in these patients. IV. Compare overall survival
      and quality of life in patients treated with these two regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      participating center. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. Arm I: Patients
      receive radiotherapy to the seminal vesicles at 46 Gy in 23 fractions and to the prostate at
      70 Gy in 35 fractions, with 5 fractions per week. Arm II: Patients receive radiotherapy to
      the seminal vesicles as in arm I and to the prostate at 80 Gy in 40 fractions, with 5
      fractions per week. Treatment continues in both arms in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Quality of life is assessed annually. Patients are followed every 4
      months for a minimum of 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 306 patients (153 per arm) will be accrued for this study
      within 2.5 years.
