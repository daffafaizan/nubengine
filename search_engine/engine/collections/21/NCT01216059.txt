    
      We propose to conduct a randomized, controlled 6-week trial to evaluate the impact of a text
      message-based reminder program on adherence to health maintenance behaviors among adolescents
      diagnosed with Atopic Dermatitis. After obtaining informed consent, subjects will be
      randomized into either an intervention or control group. Subjects in the intervention group
      will receive a daily text message with a tailored message regarding atopic dermatitis, while
      control group subjects will receive a weekly text message with information on local weather,
      sport or news without any reference to atopic dermatitis. Of note, the decision to send a
      weekly text message to the control group reflects the expectation that a message will be
      sent, although the frequency and content of the message will not be revealed.
