      increases the risk of postoperative cardiac dysfunction. The main principle of myocardial
      protection in cardiac surgery is to preserve myocardial function by preventing ischemia with
      blood cardioplegia . Previous studies have shown that adenosine as an adjunct to blood
      cardioplegia can be safely used in cardiac surgery. In the Amphia Hospital, adenosine is
      already used as standard care as an initial cardioplegic bolus in minimally invasive port
      access operations. Whether, adenosine as an adjunct to intermittent warm blood cardioplegia,
      has an added value remains unclear. Therefore the investigators would like to investigate
      whether the addition of adenosine to standard intermittent warm blood cardioplegia reduces
      the 6-hours post-operative cardiac troponin T (cTnT) in patients scheduled for minimally
      invasive, port access operations (mitral valve surgery).
