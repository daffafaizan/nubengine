    
      This is a single-blind (investigator-blinded), randomized, parallel group, single center
      study to evaluate the tolerability and efficacy of combination therapy with Duac Gel/Tazorac
      Cream and Acanya Gel/Tazorac Cream for the treatment of facial acne vulgaris. Approximately
      40 male and female subjects will be enrolled (20 per study group).

      Subjects will participate in the study for 12 weeks; visits will be scheduled at baseline and
      at weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 (total of 6 visits). Eligible subjects will be randomized at
      baseline to 1 of the 2 study groups in a 1:1 ratio (Duac Gel/Tazorac Cream to Acanya
      Gel/Tazorac Cream). Subjects will apply either Duac Gel or Acanya Gel to the face each
      morning and apply Tazorac Cream to the face each evening.

      Tolerability will be evaluated through subject assessments of burning/stinging, itching, and
      oiliness and through investigator assessments of peeling, erythema, and dryness. In addition,
      subjects will evaluate their overall skin comfort and record the usage of moisturizer and
      sunscreen, if needed. Efficacy will be assessed through lesion counts (total, inflammatory
      and noninflammatory) and ISGA. Safety will be assessed by evaluating adverse events (AEs),
      concomitant medication use, and withdrawals from the study.

      This is an investigator-blinded study; therefore, subjects and study-center staff will not be
      blinded to study treatment allocation. Subjects (and parents or legal guardians) and
      study-center staff will be instructed not to reveal study product allocation to the
      investigator.
