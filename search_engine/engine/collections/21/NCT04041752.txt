      response, food reward variations and satiating responses after the ingestion of three
      different lunch meals: i) one classical cooked meal; ii) one iso-energetic meal consumed
      using a pre-prepared liquid meal; iii) one iso-energetic meal consumed using a prepared
      liquid meal. This will be the first study to assess all these nutritional factors after such
      meals.
