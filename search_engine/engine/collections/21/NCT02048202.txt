      impairments ranging from minor neurological dysfunction (MND) to cerebral palsy (CP), mainly
      due to developmental brain injury. Infant Aquatics have been found to benefit and promote
      infant development. The support and sensory stimulation of the water may improve the
      development the sensory, motor, as well as, autonomic system of preterm infants.
