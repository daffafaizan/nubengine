      or postmenopausal women. This decreased risk of CHD is likely due, in part, to the more
      favorable lipid profile observed in premenopausal women. The menstrual cycle is associated
      with the ovarian processes of follicular growth and ovulation, and corpus luteum (CL)
      development, function, and regression. The steroids estrogen (E2) and progesterone (P4) are
      secreted from the follicle and CL, which travel via the bloodstream to elicit their effects
      on target tissues. The production of E2 has been implicated as the menstrual cycle-associated
      factor underlying the favorable lipid profile as it is known to increase atheroprotective
      high density lipoprotein and decrease atherogenic low density lipoprotein. However, other
      factors may play a role such as direct ovarian metabolism of circulating lipids. Furthermore,
      the role of P4 is unclear and there is some evidence that it may inhibit the beneficial
      effects of E2. Therefore, we aim to determine the contributions of ovarian metabolism of
      lipids, independent of the effects of ovarian-derived E2 and P4, to the circulating lipid
      profile in premenopausal women. Also, we will determine the relationship between E2 and P4,
      both natural and synthetic forms found in hormonal oral contraceptives, on circulating
      lipids. With the recent controversial findings of the Women's Health Initiative, further
      evaluation of the factors underlying menstrual cycle protection from CHD is warranted. This
      study may have implications for the management of CHD and the use of hormonal therapies in
      women.
