      usage of dental Implants might be difficult in cases of alveolar bone deficiencies.

      Different ridge preservation techniques were successfully used, using membrane with or
      without bone substitutes.new grafting material is Mucograft Seal, a collagen matrix graft,
      which originally used as an alternative to the connective tissue graft for the treatment of
      gingival recessions. Mucograft has demonstrated a good tissue reaction with high
      biocompatibility and a low shrinkage tendency, in order to increase the amount of keratinized
      gingiva in the augmented area.

      Study Hypothesis: The observed changes in ridge dimensions when using Geistlich Bio-Oss®
      Collagen and Geistlich Mucograft® Seal as ridge preservation will be less pronounced in
      comparison to natural healing after tooth extraction.
