      50,000 IU oral ergocalciferol (active treatment group) or placebo (delayed intervention
      group) once a week for 12 weeks. The investigators will measure endothelial function at
      randomization and week 12 using RH-PAT and serologically measured adhesion molecules (s-VCAM,
      s-ICAM, soluble e-selectin). Changes in levels of plasma cytokines and chemokines
      representing a T-cell activation pathway (IL-12, IFN-g and CXCL-10 - "IFN-g axis") the
      investigators have linked to coronary atherogenesis (independent of CRP) and poor CV
      outcomes, will be measured over the 12 week study period. Given published evidence showing
      that Vit D can influence this T- cell pathway, specific aim 2 will add mechanistic insights
      to this proposal. High sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) will be measured as it is a
      well established traditional marker of inflammation in CAD and has also been linked to Vit D
      status.
