      amputation especially if limbs cannot be revascularized. Urokinase is effective in improving
      the microcirculation in critical limb ischemia by lowering fibrinogen and might improve
      outcomes. There are however no data on the efficacy and safety of urokinase treatment in
      terms of survival free of major amputation, ulcer healing and the rate of minor and major
      bleeding. Therefore this trial is conducted to investigate the effect of urokinase treatment
      on these parameters.
