      pibrentasvir (G/P) for 12 weeks to G/P for 16 weeks in non-cirrhotic NS5A (non-structural
      protein 5a)-inhibitor plus sofosbuvir ± RBV (Ribavirin) treatment-experienced adults with HCV
      genotype 1 (GT1) infection, and to compare the efficacy and safety of G/P with RBV for 12
      weeks to G/P without RBV for 16 weeks in NS5A-inhibitor plus sofosbuvir (SOF) ± RBV
      treatment-experienced adults with compensated cirrhosis and GT1 infection.
