      regulate energy usage and hormone levels. Women with HA who do not have regular periods have
      low leptin levels and may also have other hormone abnormalities as well as loss of bone
      density (osteopenia or osteoporosis). This study will evaluate how leptin (a fat cell hormone
      that normally circulates in the blood) affects bone density, menstrual periods, hormone
      levels, bone metabolism (how bone forms and turns over), immune function (how well the body
      can fight infection), metabolic rate (how many calories are used at rest), and overall sense
      of well-being and appetite in women with HA (i.e. no regular menstrual periods due to low
      levels of pituitary hormones that regulate estrogen production from the ovary). It will also
      investigate whether leptin replacement can be used as an adjunct to the current standard of
      care for HA patients, i.e. OCPs.

      Part A is a Randomized, placebo-controlled 36-week study. Part B is an Optional open-label
      52-week study. There will also be an optional Reward Sub-study, including healthy controls,
      designed to investigate leptin's relation to reward processing by collecting participants'
      brain and behavioral responses to images (e.g., pictures of food vs. non-food). Brain
      responses will be collected and will also be assessed via functional Magnetic Resonance
      Imaging (fMRI).

      Comparison: Part A = leptin-treated group to placebo-treated group and Part B optional sub
      study = leptin-treated group to health controls
