    
      In Project Year 1, the program will be evaluated with about 160 Head Start children, aged 3
      to 5 years, and their parents (one parent per family) in four urban and four rural Head Start
      centers. The investigators will compare the program outcomes between urban and rural
      settings. All involved Head Start centers will support MSU staff to conduct data collection
      activities (e.g., online survey completed by parents; height, weight, and blood pressure
      measures; hair samples collected from both children and parents). MSU staff, along with Head
      Start staff, will implement the 14-week healthy eating program activities including four
      components:

        1. A 14-week parent Facebook-based program focusing on stress management and healthy eating
           to reduce emotional eating and increase parents' capacity to initiate healthy eating
           practices at home

        2. Three parent face-to-face meetings at Head Start centers to connect parents with each
           other in person, offer healthy cooking tools/classes, and discuss behavioral change
           strategies and challenges

        3. 14-week child "Eat My ABCs" program at Head Start centers to provide an age-appropriate,
           healthy eating program to children

        4. Weekly child letter to parents to connect child learning at the Head Start center with
           parental practices at home

      In Project Year 2, the investigators will finalize the program based on the evaluation
      outcomes in Project Year 1, and work closely with the participating Head Start organizations
      to disseminate the healthy eating program to all the participating Head Start centers and
      classes.
