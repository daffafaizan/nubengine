      TAAA larger than 55 mm During the surgery, a heart lung machine is applied for distal
      perfusion during aortic cross clamping to enable distal organ perfusion.

      Regardless an intensive inflammatory reaction is a well known effect after reperfusion,
      leading to a uncontrolled inflammation during th first days after surgery. This may be
      associated to bad outcome and decreased survival rates. By the application of a
      intraoperative cytokine and DAMP filter this negative ffect could be reduced, resulting in a
      better outcome after surgery.
