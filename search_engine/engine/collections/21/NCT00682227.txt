      lymphocyte antigen 6 complex locus K (LY6K), and insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-II mRNA
      binding protein 3 (IMP-3)) derived from novel Cancer-Testis antigens (CTA) for the
      development of immunotherapies against esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), and
      reported that the pre-existence of specific T cell responses to these epitope peptides were
      frequently seen in ESCC patients. Then, we performed Phase I vaccination trial using
      multi-epitopes involving TTK, LY6K, and IMP-3 peptides for locally advanced, recurrent or
      metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma who had failed for the standard therapy. Each
      of three HLA-A2402-restricted epitope peptides mixed with IFA were injected every week at
      five round. Primary endpoints were to evaluate the safety and feasibility of the therapy.
      Secondary endpoints were to investigate the immunological monitoring and clinical effect.
