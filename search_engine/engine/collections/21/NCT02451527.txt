      males will be admitted to the clinical facility on Day -1, the day prior to the start of
      dosing. The subjects will be observed in clinic twice: Day -1 to 8 and Day 37 to 44. Subjects
      will receive a single dose of digoxin on Day 1 followed by 5 weekly subcutaneously injected
      doses of PEX168 and a second single dose of digoxin on Day 38. To determine the
      pharmacokinetic parameters of digoxin after drug administration alone and after multiple
      doses of PEX168, blood and urine samples will be collected after each dose of digoxin and
      tested by the laboratory.The subjects will be discharged on Day 8 and Day 44. Approximately
      28 days after the last discharge, the subjects will be called for a post study visit.
