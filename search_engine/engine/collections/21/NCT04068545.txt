    
      The Thoraguard System is intended for use for drainage of blood, fluids, and gases following
      cardiac and thoracic surgery. The system consists of an electronic control module and
      drainage kit (fluid collection canister and drainage line) which connect to a proprietary
      chest tube but may also connect to other thoracic drainage catheters. The system continuously
      monitors line patency, automatically clears the chest tube (when used with Thoraguard Chest
      Tube) and drainage line from build-up, and provides digital readings of fluid output trends.
      The system is battery powered with integrated suction for ease of ambulation.

      Additionally, the system has patient safety alarms to notify clinical staff of unexpected
      events associated with postoperative drainage. These functions offer significant improvements
      over the current standard of care. Reliable post-operative drainage, reduced workload, and
      decreased variability in chest tube maintenance procedures have the potential to increase
      patient safety, reduce complications, and improve the patient experience.
