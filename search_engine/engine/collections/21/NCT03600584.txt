      techniques after pancreaticoduodenectomy, with comparable incidence rate of pancreatic
      fistula (PF). We modified the conventional two-layer duct-to-mucosa PJ into one-layer PJ. The
      aim of this study is to examine if the investigator's modified duct-to-mucosa PJ can reduce
      PF after PD when compared to invagination PJ.

      This trial is a single-center, randomized, controlled, patient- and observer- blinded study,
      whose primary aim is to assess whether a modified duct-to-mucosa PJ (trial group) is superior
      to an invagination PJ (control group), in terms of clinically relevant PF and other
      complications. A total of 380 patients, who are to undergo elective PD, will be recruited and
      randomized intraoperatively into either of the two groups. The primary efficacy endpoint is
      the incident rate of clinically relevant PF. Secondary outcome measures are: entry into
      adjuvant therapy, mortality, surgical complications, non-surgical complications, hospital
      stay. Patients will be followed up for 3 months. Statistical analysis will be based on the
      intention-to-treat population. The duration of the entire trial is estimated to be two years.
