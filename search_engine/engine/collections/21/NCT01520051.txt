      mepolizumab. Two weeks after the third infusion, subjects will be experimentally infected
      with RV16. One day before and six days after infection a bronchoscopy will be performed to
      collect bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and bronchial brushes. Blood will be collected at each
      infusion and each bronchoscopy and at least 6 weeks after infection. Lung function will be
      evaluated throughout the study.
