    
      A randomized, controlled, single-center, double-blind, clinical trial, with 1:1 allocation
      ratio, will be carried out involving patients diagnosis of CMC joint OA grade 1-2 (aged 18
      years and above). Both assessor and statistician will remained blinded. The research
      diagnostic criteria for carpometacarpal joint osteoarthritis will be used to assess all
      individuals who agree to participate. Based on the clinical and radiological findings, the
      participants will be classified by a rheumatology. Those with CMC OA grade 2-3 will be
      included in the study.

      Standard conservative thumb CMC joint OA treatments will received for both the control and
      experimental groups for a period of 12 weeks. The experimental group will received a
      proprioceptive training program during the same intervention period, which will be conducted
      twice weekly (24 sessions).

      The severity of pain with activity will be measured according to the visual analog scale
      (VAS). QuickDASH questionnaire will be used to measure upper extremity function. Patient's
      occupational performance will be measured with the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure
      (COPM) and proprioception with Joint position sense (JPS) testing. All outcome measures will
      be collected at baseline, immediately following the intervention at 4 weeks and at 12 weeks
      following the end of the intervention.

      Participation in the study will be voluntary and patients will be included if they satisfied
      specific inclusion criteria.

      All procedures will be follow in accordance with the ethical standards of the responsible
      committee on human experimentation (institutional and national) and with the Helsinki
      Declaration. All participants will sign a written informed consent in accordance with
      guidelines approved by the local ethics committee.
