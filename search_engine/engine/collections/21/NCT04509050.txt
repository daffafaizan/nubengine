    
      This is a two-part, multi-center, prospective longitudinal, exploratory study of highly
      effective cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulators and their
      impact in children with cystic fibrosis (CF) on endocrine growth factors and height,
      gastrointestinal function and gut microbiome, lung function and respiratory microbiome, liver
      and pancreatic function, sweat chloride, inflammatory markers, and bone health.

      Total duration of the study is expected to be 6 years. Part A will be a prospective
      cross-sequential study to describe the natural history of hormonal growth factors in early
      childhood and assess the feasibility of additional measurements. In Part A, subjects will
      have up to 6 visits over a period of up to 3 years.

      Part B will be a prospective longitudinal study to observe the effects of administration of
      either ivacaftor or elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (elex/tez/iva) on growth. In Part B,
      subjects will have one "before ivacaftor or elex/tez/iva" visit within 30 days before
      initiation of the therapy and five "after ivacaftor or elex/tez/iva" visits over a 24-month
      follow-up period.
