      intravenous bolus dose of carbetocin following Cesarean delivery. However, a dose response
      study to determine the minimum effective dose of carbetocin has not yet been published.

      Studies thus far show that carbetocin may be just as effective as oxytocin in promoting
      uterine contraction, with a similar side effects profile. In addition, patients receiving
      carbetocin may experience less blood loss, and require less additional uterotonics when
      compared with oxytocin.

      The results of this study will define the minimum required dose of carbetocin for uterine
      contraction, thus minimizing unnecessary side effects, improving quality and safety of
      patient care. It may also contribute in establishing carbetocin as a substitute to oxytocin
      for elective cesarean section at our institution as well as others.
