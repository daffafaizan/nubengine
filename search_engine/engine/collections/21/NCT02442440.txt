      crude mortality is reported to be from 30% to 65% (1-5). Although there are significant
      advances in the management of septic shock in recent decades, the mortality rate was only
      marginally reduced. For example, the CUB-RÃ©a Network study reported that the mortality rate
      of septic shock declined from 62.1% in 1993 to 55.9% in 2000 (6). The well-known Surviving
      Sepsis Campaign has also made every effort to reduce mortality rate of severe sepsis and
      septic shock. The organization recommended bundled strategies including early goal directed
      therapy (EGDT) for the management of septic shock (7,8). Although EGDT was once the mainstay
      therapy of septic shock, its efficacy has been questioned by recent several large randomized
      controlled trials (9,10). Therefore, the treatment of septic shock is still a global
      challenge and there is no well-established intervention that can reduce its mortality.

      Anisodamine is an active agent isolated from a Chinese herb medicine. Both experimental and
      clinical studies have shown some potential beneficial effects of anisodamine in improving
      outcomes of shock (11-13). It was reported that anisodamine could reduce the mortality rate
      of fulminant epidemic meningitis from 66.9% to 12.4% (14). The efficacy of anisodamine might
      be mediated via the inhibition of thromboxane synthesis, granulocyte and platelet aggregation
      (15). Although anisodamine has been widely used in the treatment of septic shock in mainland
      China, there is no solid evidence from well designed clinical trials to support its efficacy.
      The aim of the study is to investigate the effectiveness of anisodamine in the treatment of
      critically ill patients with septic shock.
