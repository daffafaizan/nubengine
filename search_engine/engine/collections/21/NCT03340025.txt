      donor sites with mixed results. It is well established that NPWT is safe and causes no harm,
      and no delay in healing. A previous study performed at UAB showed that NPWT in complex Head &
      Neck Surgery reconstruction is safe, including free flap donor sites. There have been studies
      that state the rate of tendon exposure is lower with NPWT in free flap donor sites, and
      studies that conclude there is no difference in complication rates. Current clinical practice
      is varied, often within a single institution.

      While no studies of NPWT in free flap donor sites have noted inferior results with its use, a
      primary reason cited for not using it is cost. Traditional NPWT using canister-based vacuum
      devices adds significant cost. The PICO single-use NPWT device (Smith & Nephew) is a
      relatively inexpensive, low-profile dressing that does not require attachment to an external
      canister. It is battery-powered and disposable. Empiric use on our patients undergoing
      split-thickness skin-grafting to free flap donor sites shows good results with minimal
      intra-operative effort compared to traditional bandaging. We would like to prospectively
      investigate the use of this low-cost NPWT device and compare it directly to the traditional
      post-op dressing method.
