        1. Only collect antibiotics, anti-fungal and anti-infective medications.

        2. ABI (with toe pressure) can be done at screening or baseline.

        3. Once wound is healed, wound debridement will not be done at weekly visits.

        4. Once wound is healed, eKare will not be done at weekly visits.

        5. EOS will occur on the date the subject is healed. *Screening and Visit 1 may be done on
           the same day.
