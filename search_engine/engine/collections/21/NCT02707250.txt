      postoperative lower pain scores and quick recovery of the patient. However some of patients
      may complain of considerable pain after surgery . There are several approaches to
      postoperative pain management after laparoscopic cholecystectomy such as patient-controlled
      analgesia with opioids (IV-PCA), neuraxial blocks, intraperitoneal injection of local
      anesthetics, wound infiltration, each being more or less effective, with specific side
      effects.

      The transversus abdominis plane block (TAP-Block) is a regional analgesia technique that
      comes as an alternative to "classical" procedures of postoperative analgesia. Described by
      Rafi and McDonnell et al. this technique has undergone some changes over times, which
      increased its efficiency. Thus, Hebbard et al. described ultrasound subcostal oblique
      approach (OSTAP) of the block allowing analgesia in both the upper and lower abdomen, with a
      lower rate of complications due to the direct ultrasound visualization. Different studies
      confirmed the analgesic efficacy of this technique and the postoperative opioid sparing
      effect after laparoscopic cholecystectomy .

      Traditionally, the transversus abdominis plane block is achieved with classical amino-amides
      local anesthetics, bupivacaine, levobupivacaine and ropivacaine being the most commonly used
      .

      Based on the local anesthetic properties of pethidine, a synthetic opioid, our study aimed to
      evaluate prospectively the analgesic efficacy of pethidine in achieving transversus abdominis
      plane block by ultrasound oblique subcostal approach in patients scheduled for elective
      laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
