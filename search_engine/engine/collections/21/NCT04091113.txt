    
      Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare autosomal dominant genetic disorder characterized by
      recurrent tissue angioedema episodes, mainly caused by mutations in the SERPING1 gene that
      encodes C1 inhibitor (C1-INH), a protease involved in limiting bradykinin production. Low
      levels of C1-INH (HAE type 1) or dysfunctional C1-INH (HAE type 2) lead to bradykinin
      accumulation, resulting in capillary leakage and tissue swelling.

      High Molecular Weight Kininogen (HMWK) proteolysis, by active plasma kallikrein, results in
      bradykinin and cHMWK generation.

      The goal of this study is to explore the cHMWK concentrations in HAE type 1/2 patients, as a
      biomarker for this disease.

      The HAEKA study is performed in collaboration with Shire. Shire is a wholly owned subsidiary
      of Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited.
