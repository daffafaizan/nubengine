      primitive breast cancer. EMDR could then allow the affected patients to readjust their point
      of view on the pathology and thus promote more adapted behaviors or additional resources to
      cope with the disease. 190 Patients are going to be randomized in two groups : one group with
      EMDR psychotherapists and one group with support psychotherapists. Patients will receive 8
      sessions. We expect that patient in EMDR psychotherapists group will have an higher decrease
      of anxiety score, depressive score and PTSD score, and a higher increase in quality of life
