      young-adults who have had bone fractures after treatment for childhood cancer. Bone
      complications including fracture can be important issues for some childhood cancer survivors.
      In this study we are measuring bone mineral density in children and young adults who have had
      bone fracture after treatment for childhood cancer. We will measure bone mineral density in
      two ways. We will use: 1) dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (also known as DXA), and 2)
      peripheral quantitative computed tomography (also known as pQCT).
