      colonoscopy examination. Water method for colonoscopy examination has been studied widely and
      evidence showed effectiveness in reducing discomfort and increase cecal intubation time and
      increasing cecal intubation rates in unsedated patients. Our previous studies showed that
      water immersion method reduced the VAS score, accelerated the intubation time significantly
      without different changing cecal intubation rate. Previous right-sided vs. left-sided
      starting position colonoscopy study in sedated patients with air insufflation colonoscopy
      method showed that right-sided starting position improved the abdominal discomfort score and
      faster cecal intubation time. We want postulate that the right-sided starting position can
      also maximize the water method advantages in lowering the discomfort score, faster cecal
      intubation time and higher cecal intubation rates, and it will improve patient acceptance of
      water unsedated colonoscopy and willingness to repeat.
