    
      We propose to evaluate the long-term efficacy of the continuous intraarticular delivery of
      local anesthetics via a disposable, self-regulated DonJoy Pain Control infusion pump.
      Patients will be randomly assigned to receive either an intra-articular infusion of
      bupivacaine 0.125%, or saline delivered at a rate of 5 ml/hr for 48 hours by a DonJoy® Pain
      Control infusion pump. Patients will receive a femoral block (FNB) and a sciatic block (SNB)
      for knee arthroscopy or an interscalene block (INB) for shoulder arthroscopy prior to
      surgery. After the operation, patients will receive morphine via a Patient Controlled
      Analgesia (PCA) pump for pain control. The patient will be admitted overnight to a Care Unit,
      with the PCA discontinued at discharge or 24 hours, whichever is earlier. If clinically
      indicated, the PCA may be extended at the discretion of the pain team. Upon discharge and
      during the 48 hour study period the patient will receive oral oxycodone and acetaminophen.
      The patient and their family will remove the DonJoy® Pain Control infusion pump 48 hours
      after the surgery.
