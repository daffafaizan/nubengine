      little is known of its effect on the microbiome. Therefore, this investigation aimed to
      identify the changes in periodontal microbiome following treatment with EMD using a
      deep-sequencing approach. Thirty-nine patients having mandibular class II buccal furcation
      defects were randomized to beta-tricalcium-phosphate/hydroxyapatite graft (BONE group),
      EMD+BONE or EMD alone. Plaque was collected from furcation defects at baseline, 3 and 6
      months post-treatment. Bacterial DNA was analyzed using terminal restriction fragment length
      polymorphism (t-RFLP) and 16S pyrotag sequencing. 169,000 classifiable sequences were
      compared to HOMD using the QIIME and PhyloToAST pipelines. Statistical comparisons were made
      using parametric tests. At baseline, a total of 422 species were identified from the 39
      defects, belonging to Fusobacterium, Pseudomonas, Streptococcus, Filifactor and Parvimonas.
      All three regenerative procedures predictably altered the disease-associated microbiome, with
      a restitution of health-compatible species. However, EMD and BONE+EMD groups demonstrated
      more long-term reductions in higher number of species than in BONE group (p<0.05), especially
      disease-associated species e.g. Selenomonas noxia, F.alocis, and Fusobacterium. EMD may
      promote periodontal regeneration by predictably altering a dysbiotic subgingival microbiome,
      decreasing pathogen richness and increasing commensal abundance.
