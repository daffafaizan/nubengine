    
      Participants will be randomized into one of two treatment plans

        1. Hydroxycholoquine sulfate in combination with Azithromycin Hydroxycholorquine as above,
           plus Azithromycine: 500 mg po for day 1and then 250 mg QD for 4 days

        2. no active medication (placebo)

      All participants will be followed for 2 months. The primary aim is to determine if there is
      any benefit (reduced likelihood for development of fever and other symptoms of COVID-19 ) to
      taking only Hydroxychloroquine sulfate, or to taking Hydroxychloroquine sulfate in
      combination with Azithromycin, or if there is no benefit to taking these medications for this
      population.
