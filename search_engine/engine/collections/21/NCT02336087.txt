    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the compliance, toxicity and feasibility of administering gemcitabine
      hydrochloride (gemcitabine), nab-paclitaxel (abraxane), metformin hydrochloride (metformin),
      and the dietary supplement (DS).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the response rate associated with this combination therapy in pancreatic cancer
      patients.

      II. To assess the progression-free survival and overall survival of all patients who start
      protocol therapy, and describe the outcomes based on measures of compliance during the
      lead-in week, and compliance with supplement during chemotherapy.

      III. To collect and analyze peripheral blood and pre-treatment biopsy samples for an
      exploratory analysis of biological correlatives.

      IV. To assess quality of life utilizing the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General
      (FACT-G) questionnaire.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride and paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle
      formulation intravenously (IV) on days 1, 8, and 15. Patients also receive metformin
      hydrochloride orally (PO) twice daily (BID) starting day -6 and dietary supplement PO BID
      starting day -3. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months.
