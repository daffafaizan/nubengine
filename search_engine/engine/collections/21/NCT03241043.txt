    
      Using an open-label, randomized, controlled, 2-period cross-over design, two treatments
      (Envarsus® and Advagraf®) will be compared (with regard to PK profile and bioavailability)
      after administration of IMP to 20 de novo transplanted recipients. The patients will be
      randomly assigned to one of the two treatments as treatment period 1 and afterwards switched
      to treatment period 2 (Group 1: Envarsus® - Advagraf®; Group 2: Advagraf® - Envarsus®).
