      autologous (the patient's own) umbilical cord blood cells in term gestation newborn infants
      with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. For this study, infants who have signs of moderate to
      severe encephalopathy at birth and have cord blood collected at birth can receive their own
      cord blood cells during the 3 days of age. Babies will be followed for neurodevelopmental
      outcome at 1, 4 - 6, 9 - 12 months and 18-24 months. MRI brain will be obtained at 1-2 weeks
      and 4-6 months old.
