      Surgical repair of TOF often results in chronic pulmonary regurgitation (PR) with associated
      RV dilatation and dysfunction. Mounting evidence indicates that PR leads to significant
      long-term morbidity and mortality, including arrhythmias, sudden death, and right heart
      failure. Using CMR, there is a high prevalence of regional dysfunction and aneurysms in the
      RV in patients with repaired TOF. Current standard clinical practice in patients with
      repaired TOF, severe PR, ventricular dysfunction, and/or clinical deterioration is to insert
      a bioprosthetic pulmonary valve to reduce the volume load on the RV. Although PVR can be
      achieved with low mortality, research has shown a persistent or worsening RV dysfunction
      postoperatively, despite a competent pulmonary valve. In patients with left ventricular (LV)
      aneurysms, surgical remodeling with aneurysm resection has been shown to improve LV
      mechanics. In view of the potentially deleterious effects of aneurysmal and akinetic wall
      segments on RV mechanics, researcher have recently modified their PVR surgical technique in
      selected patients to include surgical remodeling of the RV with resection of the akinetic
      wall segments. However, no studies have systematically compared the efficacy of PVR plus
      surgical RV remodeling to PVR alone.

      Research Question:

      Is there a difference between two surgical strategies-PVR alone (bioprosthetic pulmonary
      valve insertion and, when present, resection of right ventricular outflow tract [RVOT]
      aneurysm) versus PVR and surgical RV remodeling (bioprosthetic pulmonary valve insertion and
      resection of akinetic scarred areas on the anterior RV wall to reduce RV volume)-on RV
      mechanics and on the incidence of adverse events in patients with repaired TOF and chronic
      pulmonary regurgitation?
