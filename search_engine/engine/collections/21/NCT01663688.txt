    
      This is a prospective, open-labeled, multi-center clinical study. After qualifying
      examination of a subject, 3D retinal measurement in the proximity of the optic disc and the
      macula are carried out for eligible subjects with normal eyes using an investigational
      three-dimensional eye imaging photography device called the Nidek Optical Coherence
      Tomography (OCT) RS-3000. The primary objective of this clinical study is to develop
      age-specific normal ranges for the thickness of the retina and retinal nerve fiber layer
      (RNFL) etc. using the Nidek Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) RS-3000 with normative
      database. The secondary objective is to evaluate any adverse events found during the clinical
      study.
