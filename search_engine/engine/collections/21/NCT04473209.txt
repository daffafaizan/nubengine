      be directly linked with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The aim of this study was to assess serum
      resistin level in type 2 diabetic patients with chronic periodontitis.

      Methods: Forty individuals were recruited in this study and were divided into three groups,
      diabetic group consisted of 15 diabetic patients (type 2 diabetes mellitus) with moderate to
      severe chronic periodontitis, non-diabetic group consisted of 15 non-diabetic patients with
      moderate to severe chronic periodontitis and healthy group consisted of 10 non-diabetic
      individuals with healthy periodontium. Non-surgical periodontal therapy with supra and
      subgingival debridement was performed for the diabetic and non-diabetic groups. Pocket depth,
      clinical attachment level, plaque index, gingival index, serum Resistin and high sensitivity
      C-Reactive Protein assay were recorded for both groups before and after treatment, while
      HbA1c was recorded for the diabetic group.
