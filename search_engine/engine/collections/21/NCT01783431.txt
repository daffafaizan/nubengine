      fight disease. This is a vaccine trial, as your own cells will be extracted (removed),
      treated in a lab, then re-administered to your body with the study drug in hopes of creating
      an immune response to the disease. It is not guaranteed that your disease burden will be
      reduced by participating in this trial.TScreening tests will be conducted to determine
      whether or not subjects can participate in this study. If subjects are eligible and choose to
      participate, they will have a procedure called leukapheresis. The leukapheresis product that
      is collected from you will be taken to a special lab at MUSC where it will undergo a process
      that will grow additional dendritic cells under controlled conditions in the lab. These cells
      will be given together with Poly-ICLC therapy when you begin study treatment. Some days you
      will receive both Poly-ICLC and dendritic cells, but on other days you will receive the
      Poly-ICLC by itself. After study treatment, subjects may be asked to return to MUSC
      approximately every 3 months for the first 2 years, then every 6 months thereafter for follow
      up procedures.
