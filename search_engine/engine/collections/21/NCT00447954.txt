      vision and health. These visits may include visual exams, blood draw for laboratory testing,
      brief medical history and exam, and occasionally a questionnaire (survey), in addition to the
      visits for the surgical procedures. There will be about 8 centers participating in this
      study, and up to 48 people enrolled, across the US. Each participant joining the study who
      has completed initial screening will then be scheduled to have a brief surgical procedure
      performed on one eye, which may or may not include a very small cell-filled implant.
      Follow-up visits for repeat assessments will be required regularly to determine if the
      implant being tested is safe and effective for use to treat AMD.
