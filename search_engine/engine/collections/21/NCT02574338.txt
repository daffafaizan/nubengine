    
      This is a randomized clinical study which will be made up of two arms or groups. The first
      arm or group - 1 will have cervical ripening with intracervical extraamniotic Foley's
      catheter while group - 2 will have cervical ripening with intravaginal misoprostol. The
      parturients will be randomly selected by simple lottery and recruited into the two arms of
      the study. Each parturient will pick by simple lucky dip from a pool of folded papers with
      inscription group 1 or group 2 in a bag in a double blinded manner and will be recruited into
      the group picked among the two arms of the study. The Bishop's score of the cervix will be
      accurately determined and documented before cervical ripening. Bishop's score of â‰¥6 will be
      considered ripe. Oxytocin will be used for induction or augmentation of labor as required.
