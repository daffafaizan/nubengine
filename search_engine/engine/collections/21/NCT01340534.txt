      after a cesarean section. SSI can be mild or it can develop into septic shock and death,
      being cesarean section the most important cause of puerperal infections. Supplemental oxygen
      at high doses has been advocated as a protective factor for SSI. The purpose of this study is
      to determine if the use of oxygen at high doses (80% FIO2)can reduce the incidence of SSI
      after emergency cesarean section.
