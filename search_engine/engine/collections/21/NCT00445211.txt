      balloon pump is placed. Patients who agree to participate in this study will be randomized
      (they will be selected to receive heparin or not to receive heparin with their intra-aortic
      balloon pump) by a process that is similar to flipping a coin. Patients will have a 50%
      chance of receiving heparin and a 50% chance of not receiving heparin. If a patient does not
      want to participate in the study, his/her cardiologist will decide if the patient will
      receive or not receive heparin. Intra-aortic balloon pumps have been used with and without
      intravenous heparin and there is no known increase in complications in patients who do not
      receive heparin. Risks include bleeding and possible blood clots/decreased blood flow to the
      leg with the catheter in both groups (due to different medical reasons). The patients in both
      groups will be monitored closely in the cardiac care unit while the intra-aortic balloon pump
      is in place to prevent and/or minimize complications.
