    
      This multicenter, randomized, double-masked, controlled clinical trial evaluated the efficacy
      of inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) in the treatment of the preterm infant with respiratory failure
      secondary to respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), sepsis/pneumonia, aspiration syndrome,
      idiopathic pulmonary hypertension and/or suspected pulmonary hypoplasia.

      Infants were followed until death or discharge to home. The trial compared iNO therapy to
      mock gas delivery as the control, and otherwise incorporated conventional management
      strategies (including treatment with surfactant and high frequency ventilation as adjuncts to
      iNO therapy).

      During the initial dosing, iNO was started at 5 ppm and could be increased to 10 ppm. If the
      infant did not respond, study gas was discontinued. For infants who responded to study gas, a
      gradual weaning was initiated. The total exposure to study gas did not exceed 336 hours (14
      days). Infants were monitored for signs of toxicity.

      Medical and neurodevelopmental outcome of surviving infants were assessed at 18 to 22 months
      corrected age by masked, certified examiners.
