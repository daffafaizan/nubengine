        -  To identify potential improvements for a noninvasive method of diagnosing cervical
           dysplasia and neoplasia using the Multispectral Digital Colposcope (MDC), a device that
           uses fluorescence and reflectance spectroscopy to compare images with histopathologic
           mapping of the cervical epithelium.

        -  To measure MDC images in vivo of the cervix using a modified device that makes
           measurements in seconds rather than over 2 minutes before and after acetic acid.

        -  To evaluate, preliminarily, the effect of the fading of acetic acid in the image
           contrast obtained over time to see if this fading can predict the grade of
           intraepithelial neoplasia.

        -  To evaluate mapping of the cervix so that software can reconstruct the cervical
           epithelial map to compare the map with routine colposcopic images as well as with those
           from the MDC.

        -  To compare, preliminarily, MDC performance with colposcopy and pathologic analysis of
           tissue removed after colposcopy in the form of the loop electrosurgical excision
           procedure (LEEP).

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients undergo routine colposcopy as part of their regular colposcopic evaluation. The
      digital colposcope is used to take images of the vagina and cervix, pre- and post-acetic
      acid, using white, green, and blue light. Colposcopically abnormal areas are biopsied; a
      normal area may also be biopsied. Patients undergoing loop electrosurgical excision procedure
      (LEEP) may undergo one additional biopsy of a colposcopically normal site.
