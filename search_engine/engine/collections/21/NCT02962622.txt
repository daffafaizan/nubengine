      training (HIIT) exercise intervention on cardio-respiratory fitness (CR-fitness), insulin
      resistance, and cognitive function among normally active but physically untrained HIV+
      Hispanic women. The primary hypotheses are that HIIT will improve: 1) CR-fitness in all
      groups (HIV+ and HIV-), 2) insulin sensitivity in both groups of HIV+ women, and 3) cognitive
      function as determined by hippocampal function in HIV+ women with HAND. Participants will
      receive 2 weeks, 6 sessions of 8 x 60 seconds cycling bouts eliciting approximately 80% of
      maximal heart rate with 60 second rest between bouts after which they will receive 4 week, 12
      sessions of 10 x 60 seconds cycling bouts eliciting approximately 90% of maximal heart rate
      with 60 second rest between bouts. Then, participants will be evaluated with a CR-fitness,
      insulin resistance, anthropometry, and neurocognitive function tests.

      Participants will undergo an intervention (described above) designed for normally active but
      physically untrained HIV+ Hispanic women, one with (n=15) and other without (n=15)
      neurocognitive impairment & HIV- controls (n=15). After the HIIT intervention, measurements
      of CR-fitness, insulin resistance, and cognitive function including hippocampal function
      using the memory island test will be obtained, as well as CR-fitness, anthropometry, DEXA
      densitometry, and blood and urine samples for metabolic testing. The ultimate goal is to
      improve the understanding of mechanisms by which exercise influence neurocognitive function;
      thus, providing a potential non-pharmacological alternative to prevent, control or reduce
      chronic incapacitating diseases in HIV+ Hispanic adults.
