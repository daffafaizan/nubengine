      them has been validated in VLBW infants. The most commonly used methods are NEX
      (Nose-Ear-Xyphoid) and NEMU (Nose-Ear-Mid-Umbilicus) as predictors of nasogastric tube
      insertion. For the purpose of the present study NEX and NEMU methods were adjusted for
      orogastric tube placement.

      Hence, primary aim of this study is:

      To identify the most appropriate insertion length predictor for orogastric tube placement in
      VLBW infants by comparing NEX and NEMU methods.

      Secondary aim is:

      - To develop a new mathematical formula, based on the neonate's weight or length, to predict
      the insertion length of orogastric tube in VLBW infants
