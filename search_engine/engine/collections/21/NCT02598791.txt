      emptying, appetite and food intake in humans whereas its sister incretin hormone,
      glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), does not seem to have independent effects
      on these variables in humans. Interestingly, recent data from rodents have shown that
      concomitant activation of the GIP and the GLP-1 receptor may potentiate the satiety-promoting
      and body weight-reducing effects of GLP-1. Also, evidence suggests that GIP may be an
      important mediator of bone remodelling and lipid deposition. The effect of simultaneous
      activation of the GIP and GLP-1 receptors on appetite, food intake, fat metabolism and bone
      health has not been thoroughly examined in humans. The aim of this study is to delineate the
      effects of GIP/GLP-1 receptor co-activation on food intake, mechanisms regulating food
      intake, fat and bone metabolism in obese subjects.

      Material and methods:

      The investigators plan to include 18 obese/overweight men without diabetes. The primary
      endpoint of the study is food intake during continuous intravenous infusions of saline
      (placebo), GIP, GLP-1 and GIP+GLP-1, respectively. Secondary endpoints includes resting
      energy expenditure (measured by indirect calorimetry), appetite, satiety and hunger
      assessments (measured by visual analogue scales), plasma insulin, C-peptide and glucagon
      secretion, plasma triglycerides, cholesterols, and free fatty acid responses and changes in
      plasma bone turnover markers.
