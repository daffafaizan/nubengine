      Patients will be assigned randomly to either the Defibrotide (DF) prophylaxis arm or the
      control arm. Those allocated to the DF prophylaxis arm (DF 25 mg/kg/d iv in 4 doses) will
      begin treatment at day of conditioning and stop at day +30 after Stem Cell Transplantation
      (SCT) or upon discharge from inpatient care. There is no dose adjustment for a patient of the
      study arm who developed VOD, they continue with the 25mg/kg/d iv.

      Patients allocated to the control arm receive no prophylactic measures and will start DF (25
      mg/kg/d iv in 4 doses) beginning at day of diagnosis of Veno-occlusive Disease (VOD)
      according to modified Seattle criteria. Treatment will be stopped at complete resolution of
      symptoms. In both arms patients who developed VOD will continue DF until:

        -  complete resolution of the ascites and

        -  reversion of the hepatopedal flow (if present) and

        -  normalization of the total and direct bilirubin
