      the neural stretch group; and the placebo group. Each subject will receive one treatment
      session. Outcome measures included bilateral pressure pain threshold measured at the
      trigeminal, cervical, and tibialis anterior points, which will assess pre-treatment and
      immediately post-treatment by a blinded assessor. Three-way repeated measures analysis of
      variance was used to evaluate changes in pressure pain threshold, with group (experimental or
      control) as the between-subjects variable and time (pre-, post-treatment) or side (dominant,
      nondominant) as the within-subjects variable.
