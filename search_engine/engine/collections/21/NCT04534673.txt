    
      Recently, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has been identified as the causative pathogen of a
      rapidly spreading infection associated with pneumonia and severe acute respiratory syndrome
      (COVID-19), for which there is currently no approved therapy. Interferon Lambda (IFN Lambda)
      is a type III interferon with broad anti-viral activity and receptor distribution limited to
      the respiratory and gastrointestinal epithelium. Studies in animal models suggest that IFN
      Lambda may ameliorate infection with respiratory viruses such as influenza coronaviruses. The
      WHO has recently included pegylated interferon lambda in its landscape analysis of potential
      therapeutics for COVID-19.

      In this randomized, open-label, 2 arms, pilot trial, up to 40 patients diagnosed with
      COVID-19 and mild to moderate respiratory infection, will be randomized to one of 2 treatment
      arms in 1:1 ratio: 1. Lambda 180 mcg administered S.C once weekly, for up to two weeks (2
      injections at most) + standard care, Or 2. Standard care alone.

      Efficacy of Lambda will be assessed by PCR analysis for COVID-19 (Fluxergy, Irvine CA), from
      respiratory secretions obtained by nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs, collected
      consecutively at day 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 14 and 21 following initial diagnosis or until patients
      are discharged following achievement of two consecutive PCR negative tests for COVID-19.
      Safety and tolerability of Lambda will be assessed by adverse event (AE) monitoring, vital
      signs assessment and clinical laboratory tests (CBC, and extended chemistry panel).
