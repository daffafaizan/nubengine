      frail elderly population. Dietary proteins and amino acids act as anabolic substrates in
      muscles in elderly people. In particular the amino acid leucine is suggested to have an
      impact on muscle protein synthesis. In collaboration with the Danish dairy company Arla Foods
      we will use their conventional Whey protein and leucine enriched Whey protein in an acute
      study on elderly patients.

      Our aim is to examine the acute effects of supplementation with whey protein high in leucine
      compared to whey protein with normal leucine content on muscle protein synthesis and protein
      balance in elderly patients.

      Methods: We include 10 elderly patients, age 60-85 years in a randomized crossover study. The
      subjects will be recruited from the Osteoporosis Section at the Department of Endocrinology
      at Aarhus University Hospital. The subjects are their own controls in 2 x 1 day interventions
      A: whey protein high in leucine and B: whey protein with normal leucine content.
      Interventions are conducted with a 4 week washout period between them. On the intervention
      day postprandial protein synthesis rate will be measured over 2 X 3h using a tracer infusing
      protocol with 15Nphenylalanine along with blood samples and muscle biopsies. For analyzing
      steps of signaling in muscle protein synthesis initiated by leucine mammalian target of
      rapamycin (mTor) and sites downstream from mTor is quantified using western blotting. Whole
      body protein kinetics are calculated using the formula Q=i*Ei/Ep-i
