      control and motor functions in children with cerebral palsy. Up to our knowledge this is the
      first study intending to investigate the influence of selective voluntary motor control on
      upper extremity function in children with spastic cerebral palsy. Therefore, the current
      study will be conducted to investigate the correlation between selective voluntary motor
      control and upper extremity functions in children with spastic hemiparetic cerebral palsy.

      It is hypothesized that:-

        1. There is no relation between SVMC and upper limb function in children with spastic
           hemiparetic CP.

        2. There is no relation between upper extremity SVMC and hand grip strength in children
           with spastic hemiparetic CP.
