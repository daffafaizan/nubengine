      monotherapy or combination OHA and are scheduled to undergo ambulatory surgery will be
      identified. Informed consent will be obtained from 160 consecutive study participants.
      Patients will be randomized into 2 groups - OHA treatment on day of surgery (Metformin
      continue) (H1 group, n= 80) and patients not receiving OHA on day of surgery (OHA
      discontinue) (H0, n=80) as prescribed by their provider. All patients will be processed
      through the anesthesia preoperative clinic and instructions regarding preoperative medication
      handling will be provided to study participants by the investigator. The instructions will be
      reinforced by the clinic nursing staff in the usual fashion.

      On the morning of the surgical procedure, the investigator will verify that medication
      administration instructions provided to the study participant was adhered to. The patient
      will be checked-in into the ambulatory surgery suite and usual surgical preparatory
      procedures followed. Pre-anesthesia capillary blood glucose measurement will be performed and
      recorded in the pre-surgical area.

      Anesthesia will be induced and maintained in the usual fashion. Intraoperative capillary
      blood glucose levels will be checked and recorded.The investigator will ensure that glucose
      containing maintenance intravascular fluids are avoided throughout the anesthesia and surgery
      unless specifically indicated for treatment. All patients will be awakened and extubated at
      the end of surgery and transferred to the post anesthesia recovery (PAR) area as appropriate.
      Capillary blood glucose will be measured after arrival in the PAR. The capillary glucose
      tests obtained in this study is part of established and standard care and will be paid for by
      the patient.
