      genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 (BRCA1/2). Next generation sequencing techniques have made it possible
      to sequence multiple candidate ovarian carcinoma susceptibility genes simultaneously. The
      King Laboratory has developed a targeted capture and massively parallel sequencing test
      called BROCA to evaluate mutations in known or suspected breast and ovarian cancer genes. In
      a prospective series of 360 unselected women with ovarian carcinoma, the investigators found
      that nearly one fourth of women carried mutations in one of 13 genes, and mutations in genes
      other than BRCA1 and BRCA2 accounted for 26% of all inherited mutations. While BROCA and
      similar gene panels are already in clinical use, little is known about the relative risks of
      carrying these non-BRCA1/2 mutations, making it difficult to counsel unaffected family
      members and develop optimum prevention protocols.
