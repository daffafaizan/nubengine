      osteoarthritis is increased after both meniscus tear and meniscectomy. However, it is still
      unclear whether this is due to the meniscus tear per se (i.e., adverse mechanical effect on
      knee cartilage), the surgery (resection of the meniscus, and subsequent loss of cushion
      within the knee), or whether the development of knee osteoarthritis is completely independent
      of the two.

      Accordingly, the aim of the study is to investigate the effect of Arthroscopic partial
      meniscectomy on the development of knee osteoarthritis 2 to 10 years after the procedure.

      Patients included in the study will be randomized into one of two groups: arthroscopic
      partial meniscectomy and diagnostic arthroscopy (sham-surgery). The presence of knee
      osteoarthritis will be assessed preoperatively and 2, 5, and 10 years after the operation.
