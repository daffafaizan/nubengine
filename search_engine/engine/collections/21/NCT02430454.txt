      Vignettes will be validated through the evaluation of 8 experts in situations with or without
      bed scarcity. Vignettes with more than 80% concordance on ICU disposition (admission or
      refusion) will be used in the trial.

      Intensive care doctors in Brazil will be asked to answer an online questionnaire with
      demographic characteristics and randomized to one of two groups. The experimental group will
      be submitted to increased cognitive load conditions, meaning that they will be encouraged to
      give their first impression on the vignettes, will have a time limit to answer the questions
      and will have popups with sound and videos, with the purpose to distract the respondents. The
      control group will be encouraged to think thoroughly and will have no time limit or
      distractions.

      Vignettes will be presented, randomly, in conditions with or without scarcity of ICU beds to
      both groups. So, respondents with and without increased cognitive load will evaluate
      vignettes in conditions with and without scarcity of ICU beds.
