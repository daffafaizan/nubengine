      released into the bloodstream from tumor cells. These fragments of HPV DNA shed by tumor may
      therefore be measured in blood samples from the patients. By using the same setting as for
      real-time PCR with PCR primers and probes for fluorescence detection, the study uses digital
      droplet PCR (ddPCR), a method based on dilution and partitioning of the blood sample in many
      reaction chambers or droplets, to measure absolute quantities of HPV DNA fragments in blood
      samples from women with different stages of cervical cancer. Patients are recruited at the
      time of diagnosis, where a baseline blood sample is collected. Follow-up blood samples are
      collected during treatment and at follow-up visits up to two years after the diagnosis. We
      expect the HPV DNA load to decrease after treatment, and if an increase in viral load is
      detected during follow-up, we expect this to be an early sign of a disease recurrence. The
      method may therefore become an effective monitoring tool in these patients in terms of
      detecting a ongoing disease recurrence, which gives us the chance to intervene and treat
      these patients before the disease becomes too disseminated.
