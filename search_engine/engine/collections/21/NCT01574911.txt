    
      In each subject and patient, limb volume will be measured once by water - displacement (WD)
      and twice by 3D laser scanning (3D), by 2 independent operators, in random order. In a
      subgroup of patients, measurements will be repeated in the morning and evening, twice a year
      (during winter and during summer) to estimate the nycthemeral and seasonal effects.

      Measurements will be performed in healthy subjects and in patients with chronic venous
      insufficiency or lymphedema.
