      same volume of local anesthetics; 30 ml of 0.50% vs 0.375% vs 0.25% bupivacaine in patients
      undergoing hip surgeries.

      hospital orthopedic surgical theater.

      patients, undergoing hip surgeries will be randomly allocated into three equal groups, each
      (n=44), using computerized generated random tables

        1. Group F: 44 patients will receive single shot erector spinae block at the level of L4
           with 30 ml 0.50% bupivacaine.

        2. Group M: 44 patients will receive single shot erector spinae block at the level of L4
           with 30 ml 0.375% bupivacaine.

        3. Group H: 44 patients will receive single shot of erector spinae block at the level of
           L4with 30ml 0.25% bupivacaine .
