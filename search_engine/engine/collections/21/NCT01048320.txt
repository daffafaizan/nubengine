      identify the highest tolerable dose that can be given safely. Based on pre-defined
      dose-limiting toxicity, the maximum tolerated dose of the combination will be identified and
      a safer dose for further evaluation of this regimen in pancreatic cancer selected. The
      primary objectives are therefore based around safety of the drug combination.
