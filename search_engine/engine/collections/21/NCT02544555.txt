      lesions are commonly encountered. The decision to approach these lesions by either guide
      wire, intraluminal approach or subintimal approach is by the decision of the operator. The
      subintimal approach intentionally passes the guide wire through the subintimal layer of
      vessel which was developed by Dr. Bolia. Through the subintimal approach, the success rate of
      procedure has increased. However this technique has shown some limitations which are guide
      wire re-entry, intimal injury, lengthening of the original lesion, periadventitial hematoma,
      perforated vessel, collateral vascular occlusion and limited usage of atherectomy devices.

      On the contrary, intimal approach is not only able to overcome the limitations of the
      subintimal approach, but it has shown an advantage in improving the success rate of the
      procedure by the variable techniques of anterograde, retrograde and trans-collaterals
      approach. These techniques however usually require longer procedure time with more exposure
      to larger amounts of intravenous contrast and radiation. It often cause the need for more
      interventional devices which results in higher expense such that it is a less cost-effective
      method.

      Recently the recommendation is the combination of these 2 interventional techniques depending
      on the character of lesions. As above, these approaches are chosen depending on the character
      of the lesion, however there are only limited retrospective studies without prospective
      randomized controlled study present to decide which method is better in terms of
      post-procedural recurrence rate.
