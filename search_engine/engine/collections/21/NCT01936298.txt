      determine the necessary number of subjects needed for this study and was based upon the
      results of a previous pilot study. All patients had functional impairments of their upper
      extremities after the stroke.

      We hypothesized that the hand-rehabilitation oriented with robotics assistance, would improve
      edema by paralysis of the upper limb even in patient without sensory pathway recovery.
