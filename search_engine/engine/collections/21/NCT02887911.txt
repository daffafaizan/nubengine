    
      This is a prospective, observational, two-visit study in which approximately 200 subjects
      will be enrolled, including healthy controls, atopic controls without asthma, and patients
      with stable asthma (n = 150). Among asthmatics, 2/3 will be on regular inhaled corticosteroid
      therapy and 1/3 will not be taking inhaled corticosteroids. Subjects who meet study criteria
      will undergo phenotypic characterization in multiple domains, including evaluation of lung
      function, assessments of asthma/allergy history, asthma triggers, asthma symptom control,
      environmental microbial exposures and dietary intake. Oral rinse, sputum, stool, urine and
      blood specimens will be collected for microbiome-related analyses, including molecular and
      culture-based assays, metabolite studies, and to relate these to markers of inflammation and
      immune function. The overall goal is to enroll a cohort of well-characterized asthmatic and
      non-asthmatic control subjects to enable mechanism-oriented studies of how members of the
      airway microbiota and possibly also gut microbiota influence phenotypes of adult asthma.
