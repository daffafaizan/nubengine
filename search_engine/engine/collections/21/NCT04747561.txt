      targeting melanin probe - 18-5 - f FPN [18 f - 5 - fluoro - N - (2 - (diethyl amino) ethyl)
      pyridine formamide] for PET imaging, we found that combining FPN and melanin with high
      specificity and favorable pharmacokinetic characteristics, can be sensitive to detect the
      tiny metastases (lung, lymph node metastasis), which shows good potential of PET imaging for
      melanoma.The preparation method of 18F-5-FPN is simple and can be directly synthesized and
      purified by GE's synthesis module automatically.Then, we optimized the probe with triethylene
      glycol (PEG3), 18F-PEG3-FPN, to improve the labeling rate of the probe (44.68% >;6.98%,
      18F-5-FPN), reduced its uptake in the liver, improved its drug distribution in vivo, and was
      successfully applied in the detection of liver metastasis.The integrated TOF PET/MR imaging
      equipment is the most advanced imaging equipment at present, which combines the advantages of
      PET and MR. With the high sensitivity of PET and the high soft tissue contrast of MR, it has
      obvious advantages over PET/CT in head, neck, abdomen and pelvic lesions.

      At the same time, MR has no additional radiation and is more biosafety. With 18 f - PEG3 -
      FPN in clinical potential of melanoma imaging, 18 f - this project intends to apply PEG3 -
      FPN integrated PET/MR imaging diagnosis and staging of malignant melanoma tumors and clinical
      use of 18 f - FDG PET/CT imaging contrast, design of a prospective study, explore 18 f - PEG3
      - FPN detection performance of melanoma, to make up for 18 f - FDG PET imaging diagnosis and
      staging of melanoma value.
