    
      Novel, sensitive tools, such as 68Ga-PSMA PET imaging, have great potential for very early
      disease detection and open the possibility of early curative local salvage treatment (with
      surgery, radiotherapy or a combination of both). This project will moreover provide important
      insights into the biodistribution and dosimetry of 68Ga-PSMA, opening possibilities of
      90-Yttrium or 177-Lutetium-PSMA-based radionuclidetherapy of patients with metastatic PC in
      the future.

      The study consists of 2 work units (WU):

      Work-unit 1: Patients at high risk for nodal involvement prior to radical prostatectomy with
      extended lymph node dissection Work-unit 2: Biochemical recurrence after initial treatment
      with curative intent
