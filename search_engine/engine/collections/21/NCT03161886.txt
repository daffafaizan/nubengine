    
      This first prospective study on mucosal healing (MH) and deep remission (DR) in pediatric
      Crohn's Disease aims to evaluate:

        -  The ability of Pan-enteric capsule endoscopy (PCE) to assess MH and DR rates at three
           time points and to guide a treat-to-target strategy was the primary outcome sought.

        -  The efficacy of a "treat-to-target" strategy to MH and DR rates over 24 and 52 weeks was
           evaluated as a secondary outcome;

        -  Comparison between PCE, biomarkers, Magnetic Resonance Enterography (MRE) and Small
           Intestine contrast ultrasonography (SICUS) in evaluating intestinal inflammation.
