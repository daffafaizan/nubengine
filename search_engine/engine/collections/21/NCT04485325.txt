    
      In this clinical study, a design was chosen to reflect European standards recommended by
      EULAR for treatment of active RA by comparison of a Treat-to- target (T2T) approach in two
      treatment groups: Patients with active RA and lack of efficacy of at least one csDMARD
      treatment will be randomized to receive either TOFA or ETA. The study will be separated into
      two parts: The capability to decrease and discontinue pain-reducing treatment with a NSAID
      (Celecoxib, two times 200 mg as maximum standard dosage for RA) over the first 12 weeks of
      treatment will be measured for primary outcome. The proportion of patients with successful
      discontinuation of Celecoxib and significant and clinical relevant decrease of pain-levels
      measured using a visual analogue scale (VAS) with a reduction of at least 30% at week 12
      compared to baseline will be compared between the two treatment groups.

      Starting at week 12, the capability to taper CS treatment using a treat-to-target strategy,
      i.e. when at least low disease activity (LDA-DAS28) is achieved, will be measured in both
      groups. In addition to efficacy assessments (DAS28, ACR-response, SJC, TJC), patient reported
      outcomes, Quality of Life (QoL) measurements and patient satisfaction will be evaluated.
      Safety (severity and frequency of adverse events) will be evaluated over the 24-week
      treatment period.
