      administration (FDA) for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer. However, the combination
      of these three medications in participants has not yet been tested. Eribulin is a
      chemotherapy agent that is approved for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer for women
      who have previously received at least two prior chemotherapeutic regimens for the treatment
      of their metastatic disease. Pertuzumab and trastuzumab are also both approved for the
      treatment of advanced HER2-positive breast cancer. Both agents help treat breast cancer by
      binding HER2 receptor. However, pertuzumab and trastuzumab bind to different parts of the
      HER2 receptor. Another scientific goal of this research study is to perform gene sequencing
      (gene tests) on your cancer cells (obtained from biopsies or surgery) and normal tissues
      (usually blood). The results of the gene tests will be used to try to develop better ways to
      treat and prevent cancers.

      After the Phase I run-in, two cohorts based on prior exposure to pertuzumab were evaluated.
      The target accrual for Cohort A, without prior pertuzumab, is 56 participants. Using a
      two-stage design (n=34 stage 1, n=22 stage 2), there is 90% power assuming 10% Type I error
      to determine whether objective response (OR) rate is consistent with the alternative rate of
      40% versus the null rate of 24%. There is 57% probability of stopping the trial at stage one
      if the true OR rate is 24%. Cohort B, with prior pertuzumab, is evaluated using a single
      stage design. There is 91% power to detect an improvement in OR from 10% to 30% with accrual
      of 25 participants.
