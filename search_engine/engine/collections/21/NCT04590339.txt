      ridge atrophy. Ten of which will undergo computer guided nerve lateralization with subsequent
      implant placement and repositioning of the osteomotized bone window and ten patients will
      undergo computer guided nerve lateralization with subsequent implant placement and sticky
      bone grafting.
