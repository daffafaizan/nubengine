      of recovery from neurological insult, and document its relationship to rehabilitation
      compliance. Individuals currently completing rehabilitation programs and individuals from the
      community who meet study criteria are invited to participate. After consenting and enrolling
      in the study, participants complete 2 study sessions: a baseline session, and a follow-up
      session either at time of completion of rehabilitation program or 3 months later if not in a
      rehabilitation program. During the study sessions, participants will complete
      paper-and-pencil and computerized tests of cognition (including metacognitive tasks).
