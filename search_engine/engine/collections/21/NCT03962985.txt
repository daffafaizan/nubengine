      events. Older adults are exposed to precarity, especially those who were the old generation
      of immigrants in Canada. Art-based activities have also been proposed to community dwellers
      and have shown positive effects on health outcomes and are determinants for well-being with
      aging. The effects of participatory art-based activities on precarity in older adults have
      never been examined. Recently, the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts (MMFA) developed a new
      participatory art-based activity which is a 3 month-period of weekly museum visits for
      precarious populations.
