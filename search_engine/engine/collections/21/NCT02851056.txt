      the biological activity. A total sample size of 30 patients will be used for the study. In
      the 1st stage, 10 patients will be used to evaluate the safety and futility of the vaccine.
      If it passes the 1st stage, investigators will enroll another 20 patients (as 2nd stage) to
      evaluate the efficacy. The two- stage experiment is based on Simon minmax two-stage design
      for efficacy. Vaccine will be administered in two stages. After the first survivin
      vaccination, participants will be mobilized with G-CSF and both in vivo-primed T cells and
      stem cells will be collected in the same apheresis (the graft). T cells and the CD34
      progenitor cells will be transferred back to the participant at the time of autologous graft
      infusion. Participants will receive re-vaccination on, or near, day 21 after transplant.
