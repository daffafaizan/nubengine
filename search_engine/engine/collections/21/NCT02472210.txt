    
      The investigators will perform a double-blind, randomized cross-over study evaluating the
      efficacy and safety of an individual pattern of BTXA injections targeted at painful muscles
      vs. placebo injection. Primary outcome will be a measure of global pain as perceived by the
      participants. To assess this endpoint the investigators will use:1.

      change in pain on a Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) by telephone between BTXA and placebo
      injections at 4 week post injection and 2.change in Visual Analogue Scale (Edmonton Symptom
      Assessment System: Numerical Scale) at study visits.

      Secondary outcomes will be the percentage of responders, Physician rated Clinical Global
      Impression (CGI), Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) on medication, quality
      of life by Parkinson Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39) and adverse events as assessed at each
      study visit.
