      assigned into two groups: 1) no-treatment group, and 2) amantadine-treated group. Each group
      will have 150 patients. In addition, investigators will need 90 subjects in the control
      group. The data of these control subjects will be used to normalize the data of the two
      studied groups to diagnose POCD. The subjects in control groups will also be elderly but
      without the exposure to anesthesia and surgery.
