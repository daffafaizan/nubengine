    
      The study is designed to demonstrate that Whether the perioperative comprehensive treatment
      of primary focal resection plus lymph node dissection combined with chemotherapy and
      anti-PD-1 can prolong the overall survival of patients, narrow the range of metastatic
      lesions and improve the quality of life of patients.

      Compared with patients with extensive metastasis, 2-year tumor-specific survival and overall
      survival of patients with oligometastatic bladder cancer were significantly increased (53.3%
      vs 16.1%)；(51.9% vs. 15.4%).Gemcitabine plus cisplatin (GC) regimen has been shown to bring
      clinical benefits in neoadjuvant therapy of metastatic UC（urothelial carcinoma）.

      PD-1 inhibitors have been widely used in urothelial carcinoma in recent years, and positive
      data have been obtained in both advanced patients and neoadjuvant patients.

      If successful in this trial, it will serve to provide a therapeutic alternative for this
      patient who have oligometastasis of urothelial carcinoma.
