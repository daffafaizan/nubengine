    
      This is a trial of TTI-622 in subjects with relapsed or refractory lymphoma or myeloma.

      TTI-622 (SIRPα-IgG4 Fc), is a soluble recombinant fusion protein created by directly linking
      the sequences encoding the N-terminal CD47 binding domain of human SIRPα with the Fc domain
      of human immunoglobulin (IgG4). TTI-622 acts by binding human CD47 and preventing it from
      delivering an inhibitory "do not eat" (anti phagocytic) signal to macrophages.

      This trial will be conducted in 2 phases: Phase 1a (Dose-escalation phase) and Phase 1b
      (Expansion Combination Treatment).

      In the Dose-escalation Phase (phase 1a), subjects with lymphoma will be enrolled in
      sequential dose cohorts to receive TTI-622 to characterize safety, tolerability,
      pharmacokinetics, and the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD).

      In the Combination Treatment Phase (phase 1b), TTI-622 will be given to subjects with
      CD20-positive lymphoma (DLBCL or iNHL), classic Hodgkin lymphoma and Myeloma, in combination
      with other anti-cancer drugs, to further define safety and to characterize efficacy.
