      of the first four cycles where the tolerability, safety, pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity
      of BAT8001 for injections will be studied and preliminary efficacy will be evaluated.
      Efficacy and safety assessments continue from the fifth cycle until disease progression or
      intolerable toxicities.
