    
      Women with ESEC scheduled for laparoscopic surgery will be enrolled and randomized in three
      arms [vaginectomy group (VG), brachytherapy group (BG), and control group (CG)]. All
      laparoscopic procedures will consist of total hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy,
      peritoneal washing, systematic inspection of peritoneal cavity and biopsy of each suspect
      lesion, and pelvic (and eventual para-aortic) lymphadenectomy. In VG an upper vaginecomy will
      be added to standard laparoscopic procedures followed by observation, whereas BG will receive
      post-operative brachytherapy. CG will be treated with standard protocol for management of
      ESEC according to National Comprehensive Cancer Network (www.nccn.org).

      Safety and efficacy data will be recorded in each group for 24 months of follow-up.

      Data will be analyzed using the intention-to-treat principle and a P value of 0.05 or less
      will be considered significant.
