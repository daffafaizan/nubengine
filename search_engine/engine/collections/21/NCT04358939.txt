      context of COVID-19 disease. In patients with ARDS who are mechanically ventilated invasively
      through a tracheal tube and with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio (arterial oxygen partial pressure to
      inspired oxygen fraction ratio) of less than 150 mmHg, prone positioning significantly
      reduced mortality. Furthermore, nasal high flow, a non-invasive respiratory support and
      oxygenation technique, reduced the need for tracheal intubation and reduced mortality among
      the most severe patients (PaO2/FiO2 ratio less than 200 mmHg) suffering from acute hypoxemic
      respiratory failure. Prone positioning of ARDS patients treated with nasal high-flow was
      evaluated in 20 patients with predominantly viral pneumonia. The prone positioning was found
      to be feasible and associated with an increased PaO2/FiO2 ratio. Preliminary data from
      patients with ARDS related to COVID-19 disease appear to show a significant effect of prone
      positioning in intubated patients in terms of oxygenation improvement as well as nasal
      high-high flow appears effective in non-intubated patients. For instance, nearly half
      intensive care unit patients described in the princeps cohort in Wuhan City, Hubei Province,
      China, had received nasal high-flow. It should be noted that in Jiangsu province, secondarily
      affected, nasal high-flow combined with prone positioning was successfully integrated into
      care protocols.

      Investigators hypothesize that the combined application of nasal high-flow and prone
      positioning can significantly improve the outcome of patients suffering from COVID-19
      pneumonia by reducing the need for intubation and associated therapeutics such as sedation
      and paralysis, resulting in both individual and collective benefits in terms of use of scarce
      critical care resources.
