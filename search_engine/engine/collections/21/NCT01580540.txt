      randomized controlled trials demonstrating a reduction in CRC incidence and mortality from
      CRC screening. Despite the implementation and incremental improvements in gFOBT- and
      FIT-based tests, they continue to represent a small percentage of CRC screening and currently
      remain largely the province of large, integrated healthcare delivery systems. Reasons for the
      limited adoption of stool-based testing are complicated, but include lack of physician
      recommendation, patient preferences, and cultural barriers.

      Availability of a blood-based test may overcome the adoption challenges presently facing
      stool-based CRC screening and facilitate better compliance with CRC screening guidelines.
      However, there are currently no FDA-approved in vitro diagnostic tests for detection of CRC
      in a blood sample. As such, a high through-put blood-based test with performance
      characteristics similar to fecal testing could satisfy this clinical need.

      This study is designed to prospectively collect matched blood and stool specimens and
      clinical data from screening guideline-eligible subjects found to have invasive colorectal
      cancer (CRC) at colonoscopy, i.e. AJCC/UICC stages I, II, III, and IV, with collection of
      specimens and testing after colonoscopy and from screening guideline-eligible subjects with
      blood and stool specimens collected before colonoscopy. A completed subject will have a FIT
      result, an Epi proColon result, and a medical diagnosis/colonoscopy determined clinical
      status (CRC, non-CRC). Demographic and baseline covariates will be reported for each
      individual.
