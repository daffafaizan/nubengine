    
      Previously untreated subjects with stage 4 RCC and unresected primary tumor or metastasis
      amenable to embolization will undergo two cycles of combination immune checkpoint inhibition
      (ICI) therapy, embolization of the target tumor, then resume ICI therapy. Study ends with
      safety and efficacy assessment at 6 months. Correlative blood and tissue specimens will be
      obtained.
