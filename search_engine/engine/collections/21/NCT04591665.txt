      pharyngeal sinusitis or pharyngeal torsion. In addition, although previous conventional
      manometry was used to estimate pharyngeal swallowing, the bolus flow transmission was still
      not evaluated, which still depended on the videofluoscopic swallowing studies. High
      resolution impedance manometry could help us to measure the bolus flow according to the
      impedance changes. However, the comparison between two approach methods of postoperative
      recovery of swallowing function is still inconclusive.

      Objectives: The objective of the current study was to examine the correlation between
      high-resolution manometric and videofluoroscopic measurements of the swallowing function.

      Patients and methods: Consecutive patients who will fulfill the criteria of postoperative
      cervical spine surgery patients aged >= 20 will be enrolled and the dysphagia questionnaire
      score (EAT-10) was higher than 3, including 3. After got the inform consent, these patients
      receive the swallowing function by videofluroscopy and HRIM.

      Expected result: The investigator will evaluate the swallowing changes of these postoperative
      cervical spine patients with suspected dysphagia. The investigator expected that the highly
      correlation between the HRIM and VFSS.
