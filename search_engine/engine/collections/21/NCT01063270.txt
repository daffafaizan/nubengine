      as a secondary event. The investigators have identified in a previous study that the Nd Yag
      laser is highly effective for decreasing the inflammation, pain, suppuration and frequency of
      recurrence of HS. Oral antibiotic therapy with Clindamycin and Rifampin has also been
      reported in previous studies to be a highly effective treatment regimen for HS and is
      commonly used by physicians in medical management of HS. The investigators would like to
      compare the efficacy of NdYag laser treatment combined with antibiotics versus treatment with
      antibiotics alone. The goal is to evaluate the success of these two treatment regimens on
      existent HS lesions as well as prevention of recurrence. There will be approximately 18
      people in this research study at Henry Ford Health System (HFHS).
