    
      LEAD is a patient and assessor masked, multi-centre randomized controlled exploratory medical
      device clinical investigation of 240 participants (1:1 active to shame laser procedure)
      designed to assess the effectiveness of nanosecond laser treatment of patients with early
      high-risk AMD.

      No less than 240 participants will be randomized into either active laser treatment or sham
      laser procedure groups at a ratio of 1:1. Patient eligibility based on ocular inclusion
      criteria will be evaluated using measures of vision, fundus photography, OCT imaging, and
      macular integrity (MAIA) performed during the qualifying period. Fundus images and MAIA
      results will be sent to a coordinating centre where these will be reviewed to confirm
      eligibility based on lesion attributes and the criteria specified in the protocol. Following
      confirmation of eligibility by the coordinating centre, participants whom satisfy all the
      inclusion and exclusion criteria can be randomized. Allocation to treatment group will be
      stratified by smoking status. All participants will receive either active laser treatment or
      sham laser procedure at the treatment visit and be assessed for retreatment on a semi-annual
      basis. All participants will be contacted by telephone at 1 week and present for clinical
      examination visits at 1, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30 and 36 months.
