      associated with PF-06838435 (formerly SPK-9001), assessment of the durability of the
      transgene expression, and determination of the effects of PF-06838435 on clinical outcomes in
      individuals who have previously received a single administration of PF-06838435 in the
      C0371005 study. Amendment 2 of this study incorporates a dose-escalation substudy to evaluate
      the safety, tolerability, and kinetics of a single IV infusion of PF-06838435 at a higher
      dose than that used in the C0371005 study. The dose-escalation participants will also be
      followed for long-term safety and efficacy.
