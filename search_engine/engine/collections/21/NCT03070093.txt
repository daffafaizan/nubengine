    
      The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour
      and Welfare (MHLW) and Health Canada have approved ASP2215/Gilteritinib (XOSPATAÂ®) for the
      treatment of adult patients who have relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with
      a FLT3 mutation.

      This treatment protocol is being conducted while phase 3 ASP2215 studies are ongoing in
      FLT3-mutated AML subjects.

      Subjects will complete visits on cycle 1 - days 1, 4, 8, 15; cycle 2 - days 1, 15; cycles 3
      to 6 - day 1; and day 1 of every 2 cycles thereafter (i.e., cycle 8 day 1, cycle 10 day 1,
      etc.) until discontinued from the study.

      Subjects will be provided with study medication until the investigator determines the subject
      is no longer receiving clinical benefit.

      An end of treatment visit will be performed within 7 days after last dose of investigational
      product (ASP2215), or prior to initiation of another anticancer therapy, whichever occurs
      earlier, followed by a 30-day follow-up. [Specific to investigational sites in Japan: Study
      population does not include subjects with FLT3-mutated AML in CRc (CR, CRi, CRp) with MRD.
      Hence, efficacy (MRD response rate and duration of response) data will not be collected for
      subjects enrolled in Japan.]
