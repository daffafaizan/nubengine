      a drug (Fredrickson et al., 1995; Drummond, 2001). When drug abusers see drug-related cues,
      cue-elicited drug craving is induced (Drummond, 2001). The main goal of this investigation is
      to ascertain the neural basis of cue-elicited drug (e.g. cigarette) craving and its control
      in smokers.

      Study population: The experimental population for this investigation is nicotine-dependent
      adults aged 18-50 years old.

      Design: Participants will see the smoking-related cue or neutral cue and complete cognitive
      tasks (e.g. to report or regulate their craving, etc). At same time, we will employ
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging
      (rtfMRI), and electroencephalography (EEG) to measure brain activity.

      Outcome measures: There is no direct benefit to the participant by joining this study. Data
      from this study are expected to contribute to a better understanding of the neural processes
      of cigarette craving. Thus, the results may benefit the health of society. MRI-related risks
      (e.g., injury from metal implants, claustrophobia, and temporary hearing threshold
      alterations due to the loud banging noises) and nicotine-patch-related risks (e.g.,
      dizziness, headache, upset stomach, vomiting, diarrhea, redness or swelling at the patch
      site) to participants are minimized by careful prescreening and standard protection.
