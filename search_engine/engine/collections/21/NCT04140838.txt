      standard care of patients with chronic pain and mild to moderate major depression a group
      programme based on ACT or a group programme based on BATD and analyse the cost-utility of
      these psychological treatments from a health and social perspective. Likewise, both in
      chronic pain and in other usually associated psychiatric diseases, there is a ubiquitous lack
      of knowledge about what specific psychological and physiological mechanisms are modified by
      these third generation psychotherapies and how they relate to the observed clinical results.
      The potential predictors of response to these treatments are also unknown. In chronic
      musculoskeletal pain where central sensitization plays an important role, alterations have
      been found in different markers associated with an increased experience of pain. Some of
      these alterations in markers (e.g. high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines) would also
      appear to be shared with other psychiatric diseases (major depression), a fact that would
      suggest a possible common mechanism involved in the etiopathogenesis of these diseases. Third
      generation psychotherapies have proven effective for pain management and regulation of the
      immune response. The IMPACT Multicentre Project (Improving Pain and Depression with ACT and
      BATD) will significantly expand the limited knowledge available about how ACT and BATD
      therapies exert their effects on relevant clinical improvement variables and will try to
      identify response predictive factors to these treatments.
