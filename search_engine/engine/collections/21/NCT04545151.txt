    
      The study is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in volunteers
      with newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus type 1 (within 6 weeks after diagnosis).

      The purpose of the clinical trial is to confirm the effect of 360mg Verapamil sustained
      release (SR) administered orally once daily (titrated over the first 3 months from 120 mg to
      360 mg) on the preservation of beta-cell function measured as stimulated C-peptide after 12
      months compared to placebo.

      The study has a cross-over design and a duration of approximately 24 months, consisting of 3
      telephone visits and 7 visits at the trial site. The duration of the treatment phase with
      verapamil is 12 months, and an additional (optional) follow-up visit will be carried out 12
      months after completion of the study. The study procedures are identical in all 20 clinical
      centres across Europe and the UK.
