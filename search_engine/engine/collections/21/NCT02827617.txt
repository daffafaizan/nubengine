      lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients in whom allogeneic stem cell transplantation had to be
      strongly considered. As a result of the accumulating favorable outcome data reported for new
      biological drugs, including ibrutinib, in high risk CLL harboring TP53 mutations, there is
      concern about whether these patients should continue to be offered allogeneic stem cell
      transplantation. Despite their improved outcome, a proportion of high risk CLL harboring TP53
      mutations is going to develop ibrutinib resistance, which in turns translate in a very poor
      survival. On these bases, in the setting of ibrutinib treatment, novel biomarkers are
      required to re-define high risk CLL patients candidate for consolidation strategies including
      allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Our working hypotheses are that: i) clearance of high
      risk TP53 mutated clones upon treatment with ibrutinib may associate with long progression
      free survival (PFS), while conversely, the persistence or increase of high risk TP53 mutated
      subclones under ibrutinib may associate with acquisition of resistance and disease
      progression; and ii) plasma cell free DNA represents an accessible source of tumor DNA for
      the early and sensitive identification of mutations causing resistance to ibrutinib. By using
      highly sensitive ultra-deep next generation sequencing strategies to monitor molecular
      biomarkers potentially relevant for ibrutinib in DNA coming from both cellular and the plasma
      fractions of peripheral blood, the project has the chance of identifying new dynamic
      molecular markers that can help the early and real time prediction of sustained benefit from
      ibrutinib treatment vs imminent progression in TP53 mutated CLL patients. In the end, the
      results of this study will provide the bases to refine the current approach for treatment
      tailoring in TP53 mutated patients by allowing the identification of cases who, though being
      in clinical response under ibrutinib, will conceivably benefit from immediate switch to
      alternative options (i.e. novel drugs, allogeneic stem cell transplantation, or CART).
