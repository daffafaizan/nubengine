    
      Over a three-year period, a total of 7,200 patients undergoing percutaneous coronary
      intervention (PCI) in whom dual anti-platelet therapy is indicated for at least one year and
      meet the eligibility criteria, will be recruited from five or more clinical sites. Patients
      presenting to the cardiac clinics, emergency departments, catheterization laboratories, and
      other acute care units (e.g. CCU) who will have coronary angiography or have had angiography
      and PCI will be offered participation. Following informed consent, patients will have
      baseline data and specimens collected, and eligibility confirmed. Patients will be randomized
      in equal numbers to the G-D arm or SOC arm. Immediately following randomization, a blood
      sample from patients assigned to the G-D arm will be sent for CYP2C19 genotype analysis. Upon
      receipt of CYP2C19 genotype results, patients randomized to the G-D arm with the CYP2C19
      *1/*1 genotype (extensive metabolizers) and *1/*17, and *17/*17 genotypes (ultrarapid
      metabolizers) will receive clopidogrel 75 mg/day plus aspirin 81-162 mg/day (group a). Those
      with *1/*2, *1/*3, *2/*17, and *3/*17 genotypes (intermediate metabolizers) and those with
      *2/*2, *2/*3, and *3/*3 genotypes (poor metabolizers) will receive prasugrel 5-10 mg/day plus
      aspirin 81-162 mg/day (group b). Patients randomized to the SOC arm will not be genotyped
      prospectively. They will receive dual anti-platelet therapy guided by the judgment of their
      treating physician according to standard medical practice irrespective of genotype (group c).
      Optionally, a subgroup of patients will return at 10 days after the randomization visit for
      platelet aggregation studies.

      If our hypothesis is correct, i.e., that in intermediate and poor metabolizers, G-D
      anti-platelet therapy results in fewer cardiovascular events and has less or equivalent
      bleeding complications compared to SOC therapy, and is cost effective, this prospective
      randomized clinical trial will provide the evidence base to implement genotype-directed
      anti-platelet treatment algorithms broadly into clinical practice.
