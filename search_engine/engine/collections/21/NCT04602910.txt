      of the general population. Future infertility is a significant concern for patients with
      breast cancer and is associated with a poor quality of life. Reproductive- age patients with
      breast cancer have safe options when choosing the type of fertility preservation method to be
      applied. Better information and support resources aimed at women to support their decision
      making are needed.

      Objective: The objective of this study was to develop a web-based, shared decision-making
      (SDM) tool for helping patients with breast cancer make decisions on fertility preservation.

      Methods: We used the action research cycle of observing, reflecting, planning, and acting to
      develop a web-based SDM tool. The following four phrases were applied: (1) Observe and
      reflect: Collect and analyze the decision-making experiences of patients and health care
      providers; (2) Reflect and plan: Apply the initial results to create a paper design and
      modify the content; (3) Plan and act: Brainstorm about the web pages, and modify the content;
      (4) Act and observe: Evaluate the effectiveness, and refine the website SDM. Interviews,
      group meetings, and constant dialogue were conducted between the various participants at each
      step. The effectiveness was evaluated using the Preparation for Decision-Making (prepDM)
      scale.
