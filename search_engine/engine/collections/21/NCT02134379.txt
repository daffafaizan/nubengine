      Medtronic devices may provide more sensitive indicators of the state of compensation for
      heart failure patients. Quantification of specific data may provide new information that can
      improve quality of life for patients and offer vital information to clinicians regarding the
      adequacy of inpatient and outpatient assessment and management of acute decompensated heart
      failure.
