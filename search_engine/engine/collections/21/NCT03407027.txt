      guided infiltration in the quadratus lumborum syndrome, aiming to determine if there are
      benefits with the use of corticosteroids and if they exist, if this improvement comes only
      from the systemic effects of corticosteroid administration.

      It is an interventional study, double-blinded and randomized, in a sample of patients
      followed in the Chronic Pain Unit (Hospital of Braga, Portugal), proposed for ultrasound
      infiltration of the quadratus lumborum muscle.

      The selection of the patients will take into account the inclusion and exclusion criteria,
      until reach the required sample size (66 patients). The confirmation of the inclusion
      criteria will be done by a physiatrist blind to randomization.

      Different protocols will be randomly applied to patients after obtaining written informed
      consent.

      The techniques will be performed by two anesthetists. The data will be obtained through
      questionnaires filled out on the day of the technique and in the course of 1, 3 and 6 months
      in chronic pain consultation and by telephone call 72 hours after the procedure. It will be a
      psychologist, blind to randomization, to fill the questionnaires.

      Patients will be also evaluated in consultation, at the same time, the course of 1, 3 and 6
      months.

      After the data collection it will be performed a statistical analysis.
