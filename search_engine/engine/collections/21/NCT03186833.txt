    
      The study will be a pathophysiological, single-centre, observational study, in which all 4
      groups, including the parallel-group will be investigated in terms of qualitative-,
      echocardiographic-, arterial resistance, exercise testing (CPEX and 6-MWT), endothelial
      dysfunction assessment by Laser Doppler and vascular biomarker measurements. We intend to
      investigate if there is increasing arterial resistance from group "A" to group "D" and a
      significant difference in arterial resistance between groups "D" and "E" by measuring the
      PWV.

      Primary Outcome Our primary outcome will be a difference in arterial resistance between the
      groups and the parallel group, as measured by aortic PWV.

      Secondary Outcomes

      The secondary outcomes are to assess and compare endothelial function and cardiovascular
      performance in all groups as measured by the following:

        -  Blood tests: NTproBNP, Galectin-3

        -  Urinalysis: Albumin, Creatinine and Metabolite profiles ("metabolomics"), related to
           cardiovascular risk and insulin resistance

        -  Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) indices of LV diastolic function, tissue Doppler
           imaging and strain rate imaging

        -  Exercise tolerance: 6-minute walk test and a Cardiopulmonary Exercise Test (CPEX)

        -  Microvascular function: Laser Doppler
