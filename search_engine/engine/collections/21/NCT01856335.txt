    
      Objective:

      To see what keeps people with seizures from exercising and see how they can increase their
      belief that they can exercise and that exercise will help them.

      Study Population:

      50 adults with seizures

      Design:

      In this protocol, we will pilot the use of an educational intervention to provide people with
      seizure disorders an opportunity to learn about the benefits of exercise and learn
      specifically what types of exercise to incorporate into their daily lives.

      Outcome Measures:

      To assess the effectiveness of the educational intervention, we will use pre and post
      intervention measures including seizure specific measures of self-efficacy (belief that they
      can exercise) and outcome expectations (belief that exercise will help them) for exercise. To
      assess changes in physical activity, seizure frequency, and mood, we will monitor physical
      activity and seizure calendars, activity monitor recordings, and mood rating scales.
