    
      Stroke is a leading cause of serious long-term disability in the United States with 795,000
      individuals suffering a new or recurrent stroke each year. In most cases, disability is
      associated with incomplete motor recovery of the paretic limb. Even with intensive therapy,
      full recovery is often not achieved. Thus, there is a need for mechanistic approaches that
      drive the impaired neuronal targets of retraining to fully harness the corticospinal system's
      adaptive capacity.

      This study will attempt to induce bi-directional STDP in corticospinal-motoneuronal synapses
      serving an intrinsic hand muscle of the hemiparetic limb. Control experiments will be
      completed to provide evidence of the neurophysiological mechanism(s) mediating the effect and
      to examine behavioral effects.

      Individuals who are at least 6 months post first-ever subcortical stroke and have at least
      partial range of motion of the paretic index finger will be invited to participate.
