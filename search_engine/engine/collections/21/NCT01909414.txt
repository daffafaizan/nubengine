      multigene DNA HIV-1 vaccine that also expresses GM-CSF (GEO-D03) and a MVA HIV-1 (MVA/HIV62B)
      vaccine. HIV-1-infected young adults who have suppressed viral levels, have likely acquired
      (Clade B) HIV-1 infection from sexual contact, and are on highly active antiretroviral
      therapy (HAART) will be randomly assigned to one of two study arms. Arm A participants will
      receive the GEO-D03 vaccine at entry and Week 8 and the MVA/HIV62B vaccine at Weeks 16 and
      24. Arm B participants will receive placebo vaccines at entry and at Weeks 8, 16, and 24.

      Study duration will be 120 weeks (24 weeks for vaccinations plus 96 weeks of follow-up).
      Study participants will remain on HAART throughout the study. Study visits will occur at
      screening, entry, and at Weeks 1, 8, 9, 16, 17, 24, 25, 36, 48, 72, 96, and 120. At each
      study visit, participants will undergo blood collection, a physical exam, and an adherence
      assessment. At screening, participants will also undergo an electrocardiogram (ECG) and urine
      collection. Some blood samples will be stored for future use.
