      prevention intervention designed to address mood and weight concerns during the postpartum
      period will decrease the rate of postpartum relapse to smoking. We propose a two-group,
      randomized controlled trial. Women who quit smoking as a result of pregnancy, have been quit
      for at least one month prior to delivery and are motivated to remain abstinent postpartum
      will complete baseline assessments and be randomly assigned during the third trimester of
      pregnancy to either a cognitive behavioral relapse prevention intervention specifically
      designed for women who quit smoking during pregnancy, Strategies to Avoid Returning To
      Smoking (STARTS), or a nonspecific, supportive condition (SUPPORT). Both conditions will
      receive written information on the dangers of postpartum smoking and an equivalent number and
      amount of sessions immediately prior to delivery and during the first six months postpartum.
      Women will be treated for the first six months postpartum because substantial evidence has
      shown the risk of relapse to be greatest during the six months immediately following delivery
      (McBride et al., 1990; Mullen et al., 1990). All women will complete assessments at baseline
      (during pregnancy) and 3, 6 and 12 months postpartum.
