      Part 1: Based on already existed large samples of epilepsy clinical cases, choose 2,0000
      non-acquired epilepsy patients for clinical general phenotype and middle phenotype(EEG and
      MRI) data collection to further multi-dimensional standardization measure and evaluate.
      Through metabolic detection to define micro-phenotype. Establish a standardized clinical and
      biological samples database.

      Part 2: By NGS technology to sequence for all cases, including family members, then require
      genotype. To test brain tissue DNA somatic mutation, which MRI negative and had an operation.
      To verify the newly discovered pathogenic candidate genes and carry on functional studies.
      Finally, to draw epileptic genetic mutations mapping in Chinese people.

      Part 3: Integrated clinical and genetic epilepsy phenotypic data, combined with neural EEG
      and image bitmap data points for bio-markers analysis, included early warning, classification
      of diagnosis, curative effect prediction and epilepsy con-morbidity disease.
