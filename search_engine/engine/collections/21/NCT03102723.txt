      Cangrelor (single intravenous bolus followed by a 120-minute infusion) or matching
      normal/saline placebo, initiated prior to PPCI on top of conventional oral dual antiplatelet
      therapy (Aspirin + Ticagrelor).

      The primary endpoint will be acute MI size by cardiac MRI at day 2-7. Secondary endpoints
      will include incidence and extent of MVO by cardiac MRI; and chronic MI size, left
      ventricular size and ejection fraction by cardiac MRI at 6 months.
