      The grades of immunostaining are categorized as 0 (0%), 1 (<50%), and 2 (>=50%). According to
      the grade, patients with grade 0 or 1 will be treated with 5-FU and those with grade 2 will
      be treated with gemcitabine. After the study, investigators will calculate the overall
      survival and recurrence free survival of the patients and investigate the role of hENT1 as a
      predictive biomarker for adjuvant gemcitabine chemotherapy.
