      participants under Cohort 1 were to visit the clinical site at weeks 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12
      when on treatment (Step 1), then visit the clinical site again at 2, 4, 8, 12 and 24 weeks
      during follow-up after discontinuing study treatment (Step 2).

      The second cohort opened for an 8-week treatment of LDV/SOF and included at least 27
      subjects. All participants under Cohort 2 were to visit the clinical site at weeks 0, 1, 2,
      4, and 8 when on treatment (Step 1), then visit the clinical site again at 2, 4, 8, 12 and 24
      weeks during follow-up after discontinuing study treatment (Step 2).

      Both cohorts were monitored for safety and HCV viral load response while the participants
      were on treatment.

      The primary objective did not compare the cohorts together; instead, each study cohort was
      formally assessed for efficacy with sustained virologic response 12 weeks after treatment
      based on non-inferiority criteria compared to a historical SVR rate of 60% separately.
