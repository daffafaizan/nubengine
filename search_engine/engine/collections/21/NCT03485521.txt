      profession and nurses use this mode of learning in initial training to improve the students
      skills The report of Pr Granry allowed an inventory of the simulation in France with as
      Leitmotiv "never the first time for the patient". It has also put in place priorities for the
      coming years, one of which is to develop simulation in initial and in-service training. This
      learning technique is interesting according to several parameters. First,is the safety of
      care. A novice who has already practiced on a mannequin or in the context of the simulation
      will be able to better understand the situation of care in the clinical field. The quality of
      care is also improved by the practice of simulation including communication skills,
      psychomotor skills, respect for procedures and theoretical knowledge. This more or less
      faithful reproduction is all the more necessary as the duration of clinical placements is
      decreasing. Simulation is a way to mitigate this lack is allows a faithful immersion in the
      care environment. Despite all these positive points, physiotherapy is not yet very affected
      by the simulation as shown in the literature Gordon's review (2015). Initial training,
      continuing education has not to this day largely developed this teaching method . Some timid
      uses have taken place and for the most part in Anglo-Saxon countries with various modes of
      simulation. In France, certainly linked to the specificity of the profession, its
      implementation is delicate, even complicated. It remains anecdotal to this day.
