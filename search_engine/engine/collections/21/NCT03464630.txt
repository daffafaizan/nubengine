      and integrated interventions that target both maternal depression and specific nurturing
      parent behaviors demonstrated to improve infant social-emotional communication outcomes are
      needed. In prior programmatic research, two separate web-based, remote coaching interventions
      for: (a) parent nurturing behaviors that improve infant outcomes (Baby-Net R34; R01) [13],
      and (b) maternal depression (Mom-Net R34; R01) [14] were developed. Compared to controls, the
      Baby-Net program demonstrated medium to large effects on observed nurturing parent behavior
      and on infant social-emotional competencies in the context of play [13] and in the context of
      book activities [15]. Mom-Net demonstrated low attrition and high levels of feasibility,
      program use, and satisfaction [14]. Compared to controls, Mom-Net participants demonstrated
      significant reductions in depression and improved preschool parenting behavior [14]. A
      substantial advantage of the mobile, remote coaching approach is that it overcomes multiple
      logistical barriers that often prevent low-income mothers from participating in
      community/home visiting treatment programs [2]. Thus, this prior research on web-based
      maternal depression and specific nurturing parenting behavior in infancy, provides a strong
      empirical basis for the Mom & Baby Net program. Investigators will rigorously test the merged
      Mom & Baby Net intervention effects with 180 low-income mothers with depression and their
      infants via a 2-arm, intent-to-treat, randomized controlled trial.
