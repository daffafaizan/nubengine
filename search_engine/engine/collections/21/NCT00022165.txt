      total cancer incidence and site-specific cancer incidence in the general population. II.
      Determine whether this regimen has a beneficial effect on mood.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study.
      Participants are stratified according to age (60-64 vs 65-69 vs 70-74). Participants are
      randomized to one of four arms. Arm I: Participants receive oral placebo once daily. Arm II:
      Participants receive low-dose oral selenium once daily. Arm III: Participants receive
      moderate-dose oral selenium once daily. Arm IV: Participants receive high-dose oral selenium
      once daily. Treatment in all arms continues for up to 2 years in the absence of unacceptable
      side effects or diagnosis of cancer.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 510 patients (170 per stratum) will be accrued for this study
      within 9-12 months.
