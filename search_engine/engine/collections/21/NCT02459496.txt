      Nevertheless, in early and late stage of T2DM, lifestyle intervention is mostly substituted
      by pharmacological intervention, although lifestyle modification and dietary treatment would
      be favourable.

      The researchers therefore investigate dietary strategies such as low-carb diets and very-low
      calory diets regarding their potential to improve metabolism and body weight in (mostly)
      long-term T2DM patients.

      An intensive intervention of 3 weeks is followed by an 11-month maintenance phase to
      consolidate metabolic improvements.
