      supplementation with 2 eggs or 4 ounces of egg substitute a day on cognitive function in
      older adults. Subjects will be randomly assigned to one of the two groups. Secondary analyses
      will determine whether baseline macular pigment density (a non invasive measure of lutein and
      zeaxanthin in neural tissue) or choline status predicts relative effectiveness of the
      intervention on cognitive function. Secondary outcomes include plasma biomarkers of oxidative
      stress and inflammation, choline bioavailability, and genetic variants related to endogenous
      choline production. Participants will be recruited from community-dwelling men and women aged
      > 50 yr, and potential participants will be screened to meet cognitive and functional
      criteria. Participants will be pre-screened by telephone; those who appear to meet criteria
      will undergo further screening. The study will include baseline (0 month), 3 and 6 month
      visits for study procedures, and monthly telephone calls. Given that there is a visible
      difference between the two interventions (eggs, egg substitute), a blinded study is not
      possible.
