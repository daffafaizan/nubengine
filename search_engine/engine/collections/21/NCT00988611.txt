    
      To test our hypotheses, we will enroll 120 healthy women undergoing ART cycles at OU
      Physicians Reproductive Health.

      Patients undergoing an ART treatment cycle at the OU Physicians Reproductive Health clinic
      will be approached regarding enrollment.

        -  informed consent

        -  collection of baseline demographic data (height, weight, ethnicity, age)

        -  cycle-day 3 measurements of FSH, estradiol, inhibin B, AMH, white-blood cells for
           telomere length assay, and measurement of hemoglobin A1C to control for blood glucose
           levels

        -  AFC as determined by transvaginal ultrasound exam

        -  skin autofluorescence measurement

        -  subjects then undergo IVF as directed by their physician

        -  outcome measures include number of oocytes recovered, peak estradiol, quantity of
           gonadotropins utilized during the course of treatment, and assessment of oocyte quality
           by morphology assessment with light microscopy.
