    
      Human chorionic gonadotrophin is a two subunits (alpha and beta) glycoprotein hormone
      secreted by blastocyst trophoblastic cells.

      It plays a role in progesterone secretion by corpus luteum, endometrium invasion and fusion
      by trophoectoderm, angiogenesis, and induction of trophoblast differentiation Shortly after
      embryo implantation, trophoblastic hCG is detectable in maternal blood, and its concetration
      depends on the number and functionality of trophoectoderm cells. Therefore, hCG concentration
      in maternal blood is measured as an early pregnancy marker.

      However, hCG concentration in several women showed high variability, and embryo implantation
      also depends on endometrial receptivity, what means that in early stages, everything
      affecting endometrial receptivity, may affect hCG concentration.

      Early high hCG concentration has been related with higher pregnancy rate and it has been
      proposed that hCG concentration may be related to the time of embryo implantation and the
      viable trophoectoderm cell number.
