      electromagnetic perineal stimulation for the treatment of SUI. Eligible subjects will be
      randomized to receive active treatment or sham in a 1:1 ratio. Eight treatments (2 treatments
      each week) for 4 weeks will be completed with the Emsella chair to the pelvic floor muscles.

      Electromagnetic stimulation of the pelvic floor is a FDA approved therapy whereby a coil
      generates pulsed electromagnetic fields that penetrate deep into the pelvic floor muscles
      inducing stimulation and providing rehabilitation of weak pelvic muscles.The Emsella Chair is
      a novel high-intensity focused electromagnetic (HIFEM) technology for the treatment of SUI,
      in addition to other pelvic floor related disorders. HIFEM technology induces deep pelvic
      floor muscle contractions designed to deliver the equivalent of 11,200 Kegel exercises over
      28 minutes.This technology is typically not covered by insurance, is minimally invasive, and
      safe, but has limited data available.

      Currently, there is no data available from sham controlled studies evaluating efficacy of
      this technology. The purpose of this study is to compare the Emsella Chair to sham and to
      determine whether electromagnetic technology is effective in the treatment of SUI.
