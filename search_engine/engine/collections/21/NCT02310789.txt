    
      Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease caused by malfunctioning of a protein called CFTR.

      CF affects various organs including the sweat glands and the lungs. An FDA approved drug
      called ivacaftor helps some people with CF, and laboratory tests show that it produces
      further improvement when combined with an investigational drug called lumacaftor. However,
      results from clinical tests of the two drugs used together gave mixed results: lung function
      improved but sweat gland function did not improve. This study will measure CFTR-dependent
      sweat rate to test the hypothesis that CFTR in the normal sweat glands might be functioning
      at peak efficiency, and so can't be improved further with ivacaftor, thus accounting for the
      apparent discrepancy between lung function and sweat gland results. CFTR-dependent sweat rate
      is important to understanding CF because it is a very accurate measure of CFTR function.
