      investigation that will study the effect of a palliative care implementation during the
      preoperative, perioperative, and postoperative phase for adults undergoing cancer surgery for
      selected gastrointestinal and genitourinary malignancies. SCOPE will be a single-blind,
      single-institution randomized controlled trial of 236 patients. Intervention arm patients
      will receive a preoperative outpatient specialty palliative care consultation from a
      palliative care provider (physician or nurse practitioner) in addition to inpatient and
      outpatient palliative care follow-up postoperatively. Control arm patients will receive usual
      care with palliative care available at the discretion of the primary treatment team
      (currently these patients rarely get palliative care and usually only in the last weeks of
      life). The central hypothesis of the SCOPE Trial is that preoperative, perioperative, and
      postoperative specialty palliative care will improve patient functioning and quality of life
      in patients undergoing resection of selected GI and GU malignancies.
