      Bologna and San Giovanni Battista Hospital in Torino).

      Participants will be patients recovering from a first episode of acute myocardial infarction
      or unstable angina. Myocardial infarction will be documented by cardiac symptoms (presence of
      acute chest, epigastric, neck, jaw, or arm pain or discomfort or pressure without apparent
      non- cardiac source) and signs (acute congestive heart failure or cardiogenic shock in the
      absence of non-CHD causes) associated with ECG findings (characteristic evolutionary ST-T
      changes or new Q waves) and/or cardiac biomarkers (blood measures of myocardial necrosis,
      specifically CK, CK-MB, CK-MBm, or troponin, cTn). Instable angina will be documented by
      cardiac symptoms (chest pain lasting less than 20 minutes) with likely ECG findings
      (ST-segment depression and abnormal T-wave) in absence of myocardial necrosis biomarkers.

      Medically eligible patients involved in the study have to meet, when screened 30 days after
      their index event, the inclusion criteria
