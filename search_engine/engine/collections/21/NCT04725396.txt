      mandibular resection and fibula free-flap conformation and of the preformed plates for flap
      osteosynthesis (for all patients, PVP will be done by the same laboratory: Materialise
      laboratory).

      PVP-assisted MR includes the production of :

        -  surgical cutting guides required for mandibular resection and fibula free-flap
           conformation

      Patients will be selected after the multidisciplinary decision of oncological surgery
      including segmental mandibulectomy and immediate MR. Patients will be randomized in 2 groups
      (ratio 1:1, stratified on center and tumor N status [0-1 vs 2-3]).
