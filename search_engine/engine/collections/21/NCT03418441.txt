    
      The investigators include data on diagnosis at admission, symptoms and signs on admission,
      character and timing of diagnostic work-up and treatment and outcome assessed by the Glasgow
      Outcome Score (GOS).

      Diagnostic work-up and treatment is left at the discretion of the local physician and
      therefore not standardised

      In general any symptoms/deficits should only be listed if they are 'new' to the patient, e.g.
      a known palsy of the facial nerve should not be listed as a new relevant finding at
      admission. On the other hand, worsening of a known neurological deficit should be listed
      under signs in the given instrument (bacterial meningitis, encephalitis, neuroborreliosis
      etc). Likewise, for outcome only changes in pre-morbid conditions should be listed including
      place of residence, functional status, neurological deficits etc.

      Time of admission is obtained in prioritized order from the ambulance charts or notifications
      of arrival by secretaries or nurses in the emergency departments. Timing of lumbar puncture
      and cranial imaging is extracted from the electronic records at the departments of
      biochemistry or radiology while timing of antibiotic therapy for meningitis is identified in
      electronic medication systems. Time to lumbar puncture, cranial imaging and antibiotic
      therapy is calculated as time from arrival at hospital to each of the above events.

      Quality control of case enrollment is ensured by ad hoc case-to-case discussions and at study
      group meetings 2-3 times a year

      To ensure completeness of reported CNS infections annual searches of selected International
      Classification of Diseases version 10 (ICD-10) codes are performed in local administrative
      databases at each department:

      A17 A32.1 A32.7 A39.0 A52.1-52.3 A69.2 (neuroborreliosis) A83 A84 A85 A87 A89 B00.3-00.4
      B01.0-01.1 B02.0-02.0 B582 B451 B375 G00 G01 G02 G03 G04 G05 G06 G07
