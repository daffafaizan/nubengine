      Meal boluses will be semi-automated, with manual meal announcement by the physician/nurse,
      automated bolus recommendation by the system, and automated delivery of the bolus following
      confirmation of the recommendation. Between-meal insulin dosing will be fully automated;
      bolus confirmation by the physician/nurse will be requested by the closed-loop controller
      only when it determines that carbohydrates may be necessary to avoid hypoglycemia following
      the bolus.
