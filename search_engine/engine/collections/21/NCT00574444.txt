      vast majority of women with endometriosis, chronic pelvic pain and absence of ovarian
      endometriomata determined by ultrasound will have revised ASRM Stage I or II (peritoneal)
      disease with preservation of the posterior cul-de-sac. This sparing of the posterior
      cul-de-sac may offer a preferable route of entry for endoscopic surgery compared to the
      current standard of care.

      Despite all the advantages of laparoscopic surgery, it is not free of risks and pain, and
      creates scars, which themselves are associated with complications such as abdominal wall
      hernias and adhesions.

      Within this scenario, a new surgical procedure has emerged, called natural orifice
      transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES). This technique uses existing orifices of the body
      for introducing optical systems and surgical instruments into the peritoneal cavity by
      avoiding penetration of the abdominal wall. The expectations are no postoperative pain,
      optimal cosmesis without any visable scars and shorter recovery similar to therapeutic
      endoscopy.
