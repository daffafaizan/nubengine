      This research will explore how people with cancer use fat in their body through the use of
      tracers and measures in the blood. A stable isotope of hydrogen called 'deuterium' is used to
      trace the production of different fats by the liver. Other methods will determine how much
      and what types of fat are transported around the body. Body composition will be determined by
      CT scan and related to fat measures.
