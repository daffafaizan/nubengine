    
      An evaluation of the tolerance, compliance, acceptability and safety of a nutritionally
      complete liquid feed for use as part of the ketogenic diet (KD) in children 8+ years,
      adolescents and adults with intractable epilepsy or other disorders where the KD is
      indicated.

      Study is conducted over 59 days:

      3 day baseline period - Patient continues on whatever dietary regimen they were on before
      joining the study (this may be a ketogenic diet for existing patients).

      28 day control period - Patient begins ketogenic diet (if they are not already on one), and
      continues this for 28 days WITHOUT the study product. Patients already on a ketogenic diet
      continue this as normal.

      28 day intervention period - A set amount of the study product is incorporated into the
      patient's ketogenic diet.

      Data is captured by the HCP in the case report form at baseline, mid study and end of
      intervention, and by the patient daily throughout in a patient questionnaire.
