      customized to apply higher energy at the apex of the cone, relatively lower to the cone area
      and none to healthy cornea. Thus CuRV promises to halt keratoconus progression,
      simultaneously offering potential for relatively good visual rehabilitation.Our primary
      outcomes involve spectacle-corrected distance visual acuity and changes in corneal
      topography/tomography and OCT parameters. These parameters include Kmax, thinnest corneal
      pachymetry, maximal anterior and posterior elevation, the Fourier analysis-derived
      irregularity index, and demarcation line depth.
