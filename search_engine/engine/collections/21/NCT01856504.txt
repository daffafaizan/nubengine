      algorithm (SnapShot Freeze [SSF]) will be superior to CCTA without an intracycle motion
      compensation algorithm ("conventional" CCTA) for diagnostic accuracy and image quality.

      Scientific Basis: Preliminary study (Leipsic, Min, Journal of Cardiovascular Computed
      Tomography [in press]) of coronary CT angiograms in individuals undergoing pre-procedural
      assessment for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (n=36) demonstrate improved image
      quality of CCTA using SSF compared to CCTA not using SSF. Importantly, individuals in this
      study did not receive heart rate slowing agents (e.g., beta blockers), and diagnostic image
      quality was substantially improved. While not statistically powered on a per-patient basis,
      per-segment diagnostic accuracy of CCTA using SSF was superior to conventional CCTA. These
      results are complementary to those derived from internal testing at GE Healthcare wherein
      phantom work has demonstrated improved diagnostic performance using SSF compared to
      conventional image acquisitions.

      Long-term Goal/Purpose: To demonstrate the incremental utility of SSF for individuals
      undergoing CCTA, with expected improvements in image quality and diagnostic accuracy. If the
      aims of this study are achieved, the use of SSF for effective temporal resolution improvement
      may obviate (or reduce) the need for CT hardware for improved temporal resolution.
