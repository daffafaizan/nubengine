      intraoperative radiation therapy(IORT) for ultra-low rectal cancer,and to broaden the
      surgical indications of Intersphincteric Resection（ISR）.

      Methods: Patients, who were diagnosed with ultra-low rectal cancer and had strong desire of
      preserving anal function, will take part in the research,whose tumor invading the levator ani
      muscle or above, the diameter less than 6cm, the lower tumor margin away from the anal verge
      by less than 5cm and away from the dentate line by less than 3cm.They will undergo total
      mesorectal excision(TME) and ISR combined with IORT and prophylactic ileostomy.

      Outcomes Measures:The evaluation of short term effects includes complications such as
      anastomotic leakage, acute radiation injury ,urinary dysfunction ,dysfunction of anal
      sphincter ,sexual dysfunction ,local recurrence , total life expectancy and expectancy
      without metastasis. The postoperative pathological examination reported to be moderately
      differentiated adenocarcinoma .We wili assess their postoperative acute complications and
      short-term efficacy .Their time of follow up visit wil be 1 year or more.
