      Clinical Trial Registry (Identifier 0119U000002). Writing informed consent is obtained from
      all subjects participating in the study.

      The study will enroll 300 participants (250 CKD patients at stage 1-5 and 50 healthy
      subjects). Routine biochemical parameters including blood and daily dialysate concentration
      of urea and creatinine, serum albumin, C-reactive protein (CRP), glucose, electrolytes, and
      lipid profile parameters will carry out. Total oxalate-degrading activity in fecal samples,
      as well as plasma oxalic acid concentration, daily urinary oxalate excretion and peritoneal
      dialysis effluent oxalate concentration (if any) will determine. Uric acid will also measure
      in serum, urine and dialysate of peritoneal dialysis patients.

      The study will be followed up for 3 years. The primary endpoint is cardiovascular events,
      secondary endpoints are dialysis adequacy and all-cause mortality. All the endpoints will be
      collected, as well as other outcomes, such as chronic inflammation, dyslipidemia and dialysis
      dose, and so on. The outcomes will be analyzed using statistical software.
