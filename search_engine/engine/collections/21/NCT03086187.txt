        1. Primary objective: Assessment and evaluation of bone adaptation.

        2. Secondary objective: Assessment and evaluation of functional and structural muscular
           adaptations.

        3. Third objective: Assessment and evaluation of functional and structural vascular
           adaptations.

        4. Fourth objective: Assessment and evaluation if the present findings deviate from
           findings observed in established unloading models.
