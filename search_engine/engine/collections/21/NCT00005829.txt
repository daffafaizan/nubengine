      with recurrent B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia treated with gemcitabine. II. Assess the
      toxicities of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats
      every 4 weeks for a minimum of 3 courses. Patients achieving clinical complete remission,
      complete remission, nodular partial remission, or partial remission following 3 courses of
      therapy, receive 2 additional courses of therapy. Patients achieving complete remission or
      further improvement following the 2 additional courses of therapy, receive another 2 courses
      of therapy. Patients are followed every 3 months until disease progression or relapse.
      Patients achieving complete remission are followed every 6 months for 1 year.
