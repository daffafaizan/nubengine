      Until today, there are no interventions that have proved effective for enhancing the
      cartilage regeneration of these patients. The use of Low Intensity Ultrasound (LIUS) therapy
      has demonstrated promising effects on cartilage regeneration in vitro and in vivo. The aim of
      this study was to assess the effects of 24 sessions of LIUS on the cartilage volume and
      thickness of patients with grades 1 and 2 (medial joint space narrowing OARSI atlas 2007)
      knee osteoarthritis (OA).
