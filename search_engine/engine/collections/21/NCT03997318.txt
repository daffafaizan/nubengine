    
      Stress urinary incontinence (SUI) is the accidental loss of urine due to physical activity,
      such as laughing, coughing, or sneezing. Autologous Muscle Derived Cells for Urinary
      Sphincter Repair (AMDC-USR) involves a medical procedure in which a participant's own muscle
      cells are collected, processed, and then injected into the tissues of the urinary passage.

      This is a double-blind randomized study, which means neither the participant, nor the study
      doctor will know which treatment group the participant will be in. Participants who are
      randomly chosen to receive injection with placebo will have the option to receive an
      injection with their cells after completion of the blinded portion of their study
      participation (12 months).

      This trial was designed as a confirmatory Phase III study to bridge efficacy and safety data
      from the Japanese population to the current Phase III global trial for AMDC-USR (CELLBRATE,
      NCT03104517).
