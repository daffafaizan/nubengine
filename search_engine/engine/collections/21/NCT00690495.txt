      propofol for induction of anesthesia. Various measures have been taken to reduce the pain on
      injection, e.g. administration of lidocaine or fentanyl prior to propofol administration,
      mixture of lidocaine and propofol as well as cooling of the emulsion. Although pain on
      injection had been reduced with some of the above mentioned methods, they may not be regarded
      as a satisfactory solution of the problem.
