      radiotherapy together for their head and neck cancer experience mucositis, which is severe
      pain in the mouth and throat caused by radiation treatment. Patients often enter a cycle of
      pain, difficulty swallowing, malnourishment, and reduced quality of life. This may translate
      into decreased oral intake requiring a feeding tube, and radiation or chemotherapy treatment
      breaks, which reduce the chance of tumour control and cure.

      Currently, opioid therapy is the cornerstone of head and neck cancer pain management.
      Although effective for pain relief, opioids can have side effects.

      As an alternative to opioid treatments, "multimodal analgesia" is a treatment using
      medications from different classes with different mechanisms of action. Examples of analgesic
      medications used for multimodal analgesia include medications similar to acetaminophen or
      ibuprofen, and others.

      The primary purpose of this study is to compare pain level scores of patients taking opioids
      versus patients taking multimodal analgesia.
