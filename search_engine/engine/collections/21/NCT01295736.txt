    
      This is a multicenter, prospective, longitudinal, randomized, comparative, double-blind,
      2-parallel-arm, placebo-controlled study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of sildenafil 20 mg
      TID study on time to healing of DUs in SSc patients with ischaemic DUs.

      Approximately 120 patients aged from 18 years and above will be allocated to receive either
      placebo or sildenafil 20mg TID during 90 days. All potential subjects will present with
      ischaemic digital ulcers complicating scleroderma. An eligible digital ulcer must be beyond
      the proximal interphalangeal joint, on finger surface (included periungual ulcers), of
      ischemic origin according to the physician, and not over subcutaneous calcifications or bone
      relief.
