      (MPC) patients and promising results obtained. The modification resulted in a significantly
      reduced prevalence of severe adverse events in MPC patients, whereas the OS and PFS were
      extended to 10.3m and 7.0m, respectively, which is similar to that for patients on a
      full-dose regimen. Therefore, the investigators further evaluated the efficacy of mFOLFIRINOX
      in LAPC patients. Here, investigators want to prospectively enroll LAPC patients who
      underwent preoperative therapy with mFOLFIRINOX from April 2014 and compared the surgical
      resectability and surgical morbidity/surgical mortality among patients with surgically
      resectable pancreatic cancer (RPC) or LAPC who underwent surgery alone retrospectively. For
      patients with LAPC, mFOLFIRINOX was administrated for several cycles until the optimal
      response was obtained and then patients were evaluated for surgery. Moreover, survival data,
      including OS and PFS, were determined.
