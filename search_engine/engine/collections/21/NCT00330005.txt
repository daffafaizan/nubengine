      impact on the clinical course and outcome for bipolar disorder (Swartz & Frank, 2001). Very
      few outcome studies have been conducted in group psychotherapy for bipolar disorder, and
      there are no preliminary studies conducted using the Integrative Outpatient Model, developed
      specifically for bipolar disorder. Given the lack of preliminary data, a pilot study with a
      matched-control design is indicated to obtain preliminary data regarding this treatment
      modality and approach. The IOM is a weekly, long term psychotherapy.

      Comparison: Individuals who participate in group psychotherapy will be compared to a control
      group on mood and symptom ratings, up to 1 year post intervention.
