      the intra-peritoneal cavity compared to placebo. Our hypothesis is that the injection of
      local LAs intra-peritoneally would reduce post-operative pain and the inflammatory process
      caused by the massive release of cytokines during extensive cytoreductive surgery. The study
      is a controlled, parallel group, double blind, prospective, randomized and performed at
      Sahlgrenska University Hospital in Goteborg, Sweden . Twenty mL of ropivacaine or saline
      would be injected every hour by an automatic pump via the intra-peritoneal catheter into the
      abdomen according to group randomization in order to double blind patients and all personnel
      involved in the study.

      The parameters that would be evaluated are inflammatory markers, postoperative morbidity,
      pain intensity, consumption of morphine, cognitive function and progression-free survival.
