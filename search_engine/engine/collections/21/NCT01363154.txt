      importance, given the potential side effects as well as lack of complete seizure control with
      such treatments. Based on previous studies demonstrating an anti-convulsant and
      anti-epileptiform effect achieved in subjects by music exposure, it is proposed that specific
      musical stimuli may causally result in widely distributed cortical activation in such a
      fashion as to effectively prevent or terminate epileptiform abnormalities in subjects with
      photosensitive epilepsy. We will investigate the effect of specific musical stimulation
      (Mozart K448) to reduce or prevent photoparoxysmal abnormalities in subjects.

      Primary outcome will be evaluated in 3 groups, assessing alteration/cessation of
      photic-induced abnormalities during:

        1. Treatment: music exposure to Mozart K448, vs.

        2. Placebo: music exposure to Beethoven's FÃ¼r Elise for piano, vs.

        3. Control: no music exposure.
