      The TME technique for rectal cancer surgery was introduced in our department in summer 1995.
      TME is known to reduce the rate of local recurrences. However, its influence on long-term
      survival in unclear.

      All patients with rectal cancer from 1993 to 2001 are reviewed. The patients charts are
      reviewed and the following main characteristics are retrieved: age, gender, time of
      operation, operation technique, tumor stage, tumor localisation, tumor size, neoadjuvant or
      adjuvant treatment, complications, follow-up with respect to the appearance of local
      recurrences and distant metastases.

      Comparison of two groups of patients. Group 1: patients operated before summer 1995, that is
      before the introduction of TME. Group 2: patients operated after summer 1995, that is after
      the introduction of TME.

      Objective

      Study the influence of a new operation method (TME) on outcome (local recurrence, survival).
