      standard therapy exists. Catumaxomab (trifunctional anti-EpCAM x anti-CD3
      antibody)Catumaxomab will be administered i.v. once weekly (qwk) with each infusion lasting
      for 6 hours. The starting dose for catumaxomab will be 2 µg. The dose escalation schedule is
      based on a Modified Fibonacci Schedule with the following dose cohorts: 2 µg, 4 µg, 7 µg, 10
      µg, 14 µg and 19 µg qwk corresponding to dose increments of 100%, 75%, 43%, 40% and 36%
      respectively of the previous dose. Subsequent dose levels will correspond to dosing
      increments of about 30%, e.g. 25, 33, 43, 56 µg. After completion of the DLT period, all
      patients will be offered continuation of catumaxomab treatment at the same dose until disease
      progression or death, whichever occurs first. The maximum length of treatment, however, will
      be restricted to an additional 12 weeks after the DLT period - resulting in a maximum
      treatment duration of 16 weeks total.
