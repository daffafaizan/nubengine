    
      Objectives: To develop the Integral Rehabilitation Program (FR + CCT) and to demonstrate its
      efficacy in cognitive and functional remission (i.e. global remission) of patients with MDD
      in clinical remission.

      Methodology: The project will consist of two stages:

        1. - Development and adaptation of the Integral Rehabilitation program for MD, based on the
           program developed for bipolar disorder, and including a computerized cognitive training
           adjusted to the neuropsychological profile of each patient;

        2. - A clinical trial, randomized, blind evaluator, with three intervention arms: INTEGRAL
           REHABILITATION (FR + CCT); PSYCHOEDUCATION + online games; and TREATMENT AS USUAL.

      Sample size will be a total of 90 patients with MDD in remission (full or partial).
