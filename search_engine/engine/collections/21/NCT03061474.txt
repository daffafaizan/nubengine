    
      Nicotinamide, the amide of nicotinic acid (vitamin B3/niacin), is an oral therapy with a
      wealth of clinical data in a variety of therapeutic areas, including preliminary data
      supporting its safety in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Preclinical work in a mouse model that
      develops both plaques and tangles supports the hypothesis that nicotinamide can act as a
      histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor to reduce phosphorylation of tau.

      The study will implement a group sequential design, incorporating a futility analysis with a
      go/no-go decision conditional on cerebral spinal fluid CSF biomarker outcomes at 12-months.
      The primary outcome for the trial is change in p-tau231.

      This study timeline includes a screening phase of up to 60 days and treatment phase which is
      expected to last about 48 weeks and will include 4 study visits.

      An additional 12-month treatment and follow-up period is planned, contingent upon a "go"
      decision based on the primary outcome (CSF p-tau231) or one planned secondary outcome (CSF
      p-tau181)
