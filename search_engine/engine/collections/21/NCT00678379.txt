      to pain, which is worsened with swallowing. Previous studies in the pediatric population have
      demonstrated a significant decrease in post-operative pain/morbidity when administering pain
      reduction medications into the tonsillar fossa prior to removal. While these studies have
      shown great promise, no large randomized trial of the most promising medications has been
      conducted. Because of this, many otolaryngologists do not administer intra-operative
      medications aimed at reducing post-operative pain. The objective of the current study is to
      conduct a prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial using a
      pre-tonsillectomy infiltration of the tonsillar fossa comparing three treatment regimens in
      reducing post-tonsillectomy morbidity (i.e. pain, poor oral intake): 1) Placebo (saline
      injection) 2) bupivacaine (0.5%) + lidocaine (1%), 3) bupivacaine (0.5%) + lidocaine (1%) +
      clonidine (25 Âµg).
