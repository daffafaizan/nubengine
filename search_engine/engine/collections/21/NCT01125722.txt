      physicians and researchers accept the theory that a problem in the communication between the
      central nervous system and the bladder is a factor.

      Research has shown that a process called neuromodulation of the nerves controlling the
      bladder can overcome this communication problem. In patients who have symptoms caused by the
      communication problem, neuromodulation has been clinically proven to eliminate or
      significantly reduce those symptoms. While neuromodulation has been previously achieved by
      implanting an electrode near the sacral nerve in the spine, the new concept under
      investigation within this protocol is believed to achieve a similar effect from adhesive
      electrodes placed on the skin over spinal nerves in the lower back.
