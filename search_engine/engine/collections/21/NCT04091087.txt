    
      Study C3291038 is a Phase 2a, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, parallel-group,
      proof of concept study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and local tolerability of 6 weeks of
      treatment with crisaborole in adult participants with SD without active skin ulceration.
      Approximately 92 eligible participants will be randomized into the double blind treatment
      period in a 1:1 ratio to receive crisaborole ointment, 2% or vehicle twice daily for 6 weeks.

      The study will recruit male and female participants aged â‰¥ 45 years with a clinical diagnosis
      of SD.

      The total duration of participation in the study will be up to 14 weeks, including up to 4
      weeks for screening, a 6 week double blind treatment period, and a follow-up period of 4
      weeks after treatment completion.

      Study enrollment and management will be de centralized, where participants do not visit an
      investigator or a clinic for clinical assessment. The participants will participate in the
      study at home. The sponsor (or designee) will provide home visits by qualified home visit
      practitioners (HVP), remote contact by telemedicine (or telephone), and clinical database
      electronic case report forms (eCRFs), eDiary, and other electronic data entries from 3rd
      party vendors for study data collection.
