      communicate large amounts of information rapidly in understandable and compelling ways
      (Healey and Enns 2012). A systematic review demonstrates that there are some interventions
      available for conveying the concept of community immunity, and very few evaluate
      interventions for their effects on vaccine intentions and uptake as well as their precursors,
      such as knowledge, attitudes, knowledge and none on emotions (Hakim et al. 2018).

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of visualization conveying the concept
      of community immunity on risk perception (to individual, family, community and vulnerable
      people in communities) (primary outcome) and on emotions, attitudes, knowledge, and
      behavioural intentions (secondary outcomes).
