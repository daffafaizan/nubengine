      cognitive-behavioral techniques in a sample of 50 panic disorder patients with agoraphobia
      treated at the Psychiatric Institute of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro/Brazil.
      Objective: To test a specific model of cognitive-behavioral therapy through instruments
      applied in the beginning and end of the procedures. Two groups of 25 patients were formed,
      the first one with medication and therapy and the second one with medication and without
      therapy, as the control group. Methods: The cognitive-behavioral therapy sessions were held
      weekly and individually, with one-hour sessions. The work focused on physiological, cognitive
      and behavioral aspects with techniques of cognitive reorganization, exercises of induction of
      symptoms, "in vivo" exposure, breathing and relaxation exercises. The prescribed medication
      consists of tricyclic antidepressants (TCA) or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors
      (SSRI). Results: There was a significant difference between the initial and final evaluation
      of the group with the specific therapy, such as, reduction in panic attacks, anticipatory
      anxiety, agoraphobia avoidance, and fear of body sensations. In the global assessment
      functioning scale, global well-being increased from 60.8% to 72.5% among patients in the
      first group with therapy, differently from the group without therapy. We observed that 77.6%
      of the sample in both groups presented the respiratory subtype and 22.4% the non-respiratory
      subtype. Conclusion: The association of specific cognitive-behavioral therapy focusing on
      somatic complaints associated with pharmacologic treatment in the first group was effective
      in this sample, in comparison to pharmacological treatment alone in panic disorder patients
      with agoraphobia.
