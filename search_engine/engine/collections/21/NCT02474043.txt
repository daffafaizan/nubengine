      share contaminated injection equipment with others. Many are infected but are unaware of it,
      making it likely they will transmit the virus to others if they share contaminated injecting
      equipment. Problems related to hepatitis C can be avoided if people know their status by
      getting tested and referred to treatment.

      In this study, the investigators will recruit eligible PWID in several cities in Wisconsin
      using a social networks strategy, in which clients who receive services at a syringe exchange
      program are asked to refer peers who also inject drugs to participate in the study. All
      participants will undergo a baseline computerized risk assessment that elicits information
      about hepatitis C status, previous testing, transmission risk behaviors, and overdose risk.
      Participants will then be randomly-assigned to receive either standard risk reduction
      counseling from a prevention specialist, or computerized tailored risk reduction messages
      that are specific to their reported risk behaviors, attitudes and beliefs. A follow-up
      assessment will be completed after 3 months to evaluate changes in behavioral risk and
      intention to undergo HCV screening. A database will be searched to determine which
      participants returned for HCV screening within 12 months of enrollment, and of those, which
      ones tested positive for HCV.
