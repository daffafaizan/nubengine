      compared with sex and age-matched control subjects. Color vision was tested with the
      desaturated LANTHONY 15-Hue test. Contrast sensitivity was assessed with the Pelli-Robson
      contrast sensitivity test. Pattern-electroretinogram, Ganzfeld full-field electroretinogram
      and multifocal electroretinogram were recorded according to the International Society for
      Clinical Electrophysiology of Vision (ISCEV). Flicker-induced vasodilatation in retinal
      arteries and veins was assessed using the Dynamic Vessel Analyzer.
