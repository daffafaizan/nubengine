    
      Single pretest-post clinical trial to find immediate effects of functional dry needling to
      increase the length of the shortened hamstring. This study will be carried on single group
      which will include male subjects only. The data will be recorded before and immediately after
      the treatment. A monofilament stainless steel needle will be inserted on three points on
      hamstring muscle which will include semitendinosus, semimembranosus and bicep femoris.
      Treatment session will consist of 1 minute 20 seconds for each point on the hamstring and the
      manipulation will be performed by "Pistoning technique" in which the needle will be drawn out
      (not fully out of skin) after inserted and then again pushed in and data will be recorded
      after the treatment session on the basis of increase in length of hamstring which will be
      measure through 90-90 SLR (AKE) and on the lower extremity functional scale (LEFS)
