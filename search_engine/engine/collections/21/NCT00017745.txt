      evaluate disease manifestations to establish an accurate clinical diagnosis by using newest
      technological advances and investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms. Studies of
      inherited myopathies in large families with good genealogical records are especially
      valuable. Patients with diseases of known molecular basis will be genotyped to conduct
      analysis of phenotype/genotype correlation. Patients with diseases of unknown or incomplete
      genetic characterization will be studied with a hope of contributing to the identification of
      specific disease-causing genes and to genetic mechanisms responsible for a specific disorder.
