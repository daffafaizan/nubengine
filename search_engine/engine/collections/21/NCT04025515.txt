      cancer specimens in order to determine the prevalence of each genetic subtype. These
      mutations are screened using the Oncomine Focus Assay, where 52 genetic alterations -
      including hotspots, single nucleotide variants, indels, CNVs, and gene fusions - may be
      detected in a single workflow. In addition, relevant baseline clinical characteristics are
      collated e.g. patient demographics, smoking history, number of lines of therapy, as well as
      outcomes including access to targeted therapies, immune checkpoint inhibitors and overall
      survival. Through comprehensive annotation of clinical-pathological-molecular
      characteristics, this study will provide a means to rationalize the application of diagnostic
      tests, as well as identify prognostic and predictive factors in the treatment of Asian lung
      cancers.
