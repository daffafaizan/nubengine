      be performed twice per subject: once at rest, and once after administration of a
      pharmacologic stress agent. There will be a >15 minute delay between the two scans. A
      gadolinium-based contrast agent will be administered during each scan to allow measurement of
      myocardial blood flow. Once myocardial blood flow is quantified, the measurements will be
      compared to previous reference measurements (when available) from PET myocardial perfusion
      imaging in the CAD patient cohort and coronary reactivity testing (CRT) in the CMD patient
      cohort.
