      surgery will be enrolled in this study. They will be randomized into two groups (thiopentone
      and etomidate groups). Apart from different in two inductive drugs, other anesthetics will be
      the same. We record hemodynamic changes during inductions, inotropic use (dose and duration),
      blood glucose levels, total insulin requirement to keep blood glucose 140-180 mg% in
      perioperative period, duration of mechanical ventilation, length of stay in ICU and total
      hospital length of stay. The changes in cortisol levels will be recorded at time 0 (before
      induction), 2, 4, 8, 24 hours in 26 patients (13 patients in each group and only patients who
      are the first in the operating list (morning list)).The 26 patients is needed from sample
      size equation for the changes in cortisol level and the 92 patients is calculated from the
      differences in inotropic use.
