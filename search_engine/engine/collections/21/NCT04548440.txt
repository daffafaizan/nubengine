    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      To determine the R0 resection rate of Borderline Resectable Esophageal Squamous Cell
      Carcinoma patients who used preoperative Sintilimab Plus Nab-paclitaxel and Cisplatin

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      To evaluate the Pathological Complete Response (pCR) rate, Progression Free Survival (PFS),
      Relapse Rate, Tumor Regression Grading (TRG) post preoperative chemotherapy, Overall Survival
      (OS), safety and toxicity of chemotherapy regimen and surgery.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      Exploring the benefits of this treatment strategy in Borderline Resectable Esophageal
      Squamous Cell Carcinoma patients at a molecular level

      OUTLINE:

      Eligible patients receive Sintilimab and cisplatin intravenously on day 1 and albumin-bound
      paclitaxel intravenously on days 1 and 8. This cycle is repeated every 3 weeks in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Radiological and multidisciplinary
      assessment is performed after every 2-4 cycles.
