      which is an exceptional situation for the study of the influence of genetic factors on the
      regulation of sleep / wake rhythm. Recently, point mutations of the RAI1 gene (Retinoic Acid
      Induced 1) have been identified in individuals with the clinical features of SMS with a
      reversal of the secretion rate of melatonin ,highlighting the role of RAI1 in SMS sleep
      disorders.

      Daytime secretion of melatonin is associated with significant drowsiness and plays a major
      role in diurnal behavior disorders, especially in younger people. Conversely, the absence of
      nocturnal melatonin is a causal factor in the shortening and fragmentation of nocturnal sleep
      .

      Basically, little is known about the mechanisms that explain the inversion of the secretion
      rate of melatonin in SMS.

      These aspects, and in particular the nycthemeral reversal of the melatonin cycle, have been
      described in a population of children and we do not know how these disturbances evolve in
      adulthood
