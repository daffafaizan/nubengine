      assess how it moves throughout the body in people with severe hepatic impairment compared to
      people with normal hepatic function. This study looked at lab results in people who took
      vortioxetine.

      The study enrolled 12 participants. Participants were assigned to one of the two treatment
      groups based on their hepatic function (severe hepatic impairment vs. normal hepatic
      function). All participants in both groups will receive one vortioxetine 5-mg tablet.

      This single-center trial was conducted in the United States. The overall time to participate
      in this study was up to 58 days. Participants made 2 visits to the clinic, including one
      12-day period of confinement to the clinic, and were contacted by telephone 30 days after
      last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.
