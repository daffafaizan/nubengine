      largest risk factor for vascular diseases. Both male and female adults have increased risk
      for CVD as they age. For postmenopausal women, this risk is particularly elevated due to the
      loss of the protective effect of estrogen. It is evident that nutrition plays a crucial role
      in prevention of chronic diseases such as heart disease, stroke and cancer. Scientific
      evidence shows that high intake of plant-based food lowers the risk of CVD and many other
      chronic diseases.

      Polyphenolic compounds in fruits and nuts have been the focus of extensive research regarding
      their potential to reduce risk for a number of chronic diseases. However, fruits and nuts
      vary largely in the type and amounts of phytonutrients they provide. Mango (Mangifera Idica
      L.), a commonly cultivated fruit worldwide, is rich in polyphenolic compounds such as gallic
      acid, mangiferin, quercetin glycosides, ferulic acid, and hydroxybenzoic acid. Many of those
      bioactive compounds have been found to have anti-diabetic and anti-inflammatory effects in
      cell models. For instance, mangiferin has been proved to effectively reducing glucose-induced
      endoplasmic reticulum stress by inhibiting IREÎ± phosphorylation and ROS production in
      endothelial cells. However, it is unknown if the phytonutrients in mango will demonstrate a
      similar impact in humans. Therefore, the overall objective of this study is to investigate
      the effects of acute mango intake on blood pressure and blood glucose.
