      serious neurological complications during transforaminal epidural steroid injections. There
      is the notion that a smaller gauge needle may lead to less intravascular uptake and less
      pain. The aim of the study was to quantify the difference between a 22-gauge needle and
      25-gauge needle during lumbosacral transforaminal epidural steroid injection in regards to
      intravascular uptake and pain perception.
