    
      The Sponsor aims to describe the incidence of positivity for fungal specific pathogens on NGS
      analysis in a high-risk immunocompromised pediatric population.

      Secondarily, the Sponsor will correlate results of the NGS analysis to other approved fungal
      tests if performed at the discretion of the treating provider (e.g. blood culture results,
      radiographic findings, biopsy results, bronchoalveolar lavage findings, galactomannan results
      or b-D-glucan (BG) results as evaluated via FDA-approved "Fungitell" assay). The Sponsor will
      use these other fungal tests, in addition to clinical criterion, to classify subjects as
      having possible, probable and proven IFD according to established criteria, and compare these
      categories against results from NGS analysis.

      Lastly, to quantitatively evaluate follow-up test results to determine fungal DNA genomic
      load in subjects with positive results.
