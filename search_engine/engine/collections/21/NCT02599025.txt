      cerebral palsy. The autonomous immediate response for these children is defective. In recent
      years it has been shown that there is an association between bone density and autonomic
      function .

      In this paper the investigators will examine how the addition of movement to standing
      subjects contribute to changes in heart rate and blood pressure.

      The hypothesis is that the integration of movement while standing presents a change in the
      autonomic response and thus may improve bone density.
