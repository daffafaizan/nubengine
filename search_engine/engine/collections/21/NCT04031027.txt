      departments and recruitment is expected to take approximately 20 months. Participants must
      have started apremilast treatment 6 (Â±1) months prior enrollment in order to be considered
      eligible. The decision to prescribe apremilast falls within current practice according to the
      current decision-making process in the Italian routine clinical practice and according to
      AIFA prescribing information. No extra-procedures (diagnostic or monitoring) will be
      implemented and the assessment schedule reflects the routine clinical practice for psoriatic
      patients treated with apremilast. Patients will be consecutively enrolled in the study and
      information will be collected as recorded in the medical chart before starting apremilast (as
      close as possible to the apremilast start date/index date), and/or directly observed during
      the enrolment visit. The study variables will describe patient disease and characteristics,
      apremilast utilization patterns, psoriasis severity a, extent and impact on patient
      wellbeing, apremilast safety profile and apremilast satisfaction.
