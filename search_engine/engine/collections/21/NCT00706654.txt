    
      This will be a randomized, double-blind, active-controlled study consisting of a screening
      phase and 3 treatment phases. Eligibility will be determined during a screening phase of 2 to
      42 days. Subjects currently receiving oral treatment with an anti-psychotic other than
      non-generic aripiprazole will enter Phase 1, and subjects with a lapse in aripiprazole or
      other anti-psychotic treatment at the time of study entry ("lapse" defined as > 3 consecutive
      days without medication) will enter directly into Phase 2.

      During Phase 1 (oral conversion), subjects will be cross-titrated during weekly visits from
      other anti-psychotics to oral non-generic aripiprazole monotherapy over a minimum of 4 weeks
      and a maximum of 6 weeks. During Phase 2 (that will be a minimum of 8 weeks and a maximum of
      28 weeks in duration), subjects will be assessed bi-weekly and stabilized on an oral dose of
      aripiprazole ranging from 10 mg to 30 mg daily. After stability criteria are met at Phase 2,
      subjects are eligible to be randomized into the double-blind IM depot maintenance phase,
      Phase 3. Subjects will be randomized with a 2:2:1 (aripiprazole IM depot 300-400 mg monthly,
      oral aripiprazole 10-30 mg daily, aripiprazole IM depot 25-50 mg monthly). During Phase 3
      subjects will be assessed for impending relapse/exacerbation of psychotic symptoms. If a
      subject is identified with impending relapse/exacerbation of psychotic symptoms, they will be
      withdrawn from the trial and given the opportunity to enroll into an open-label aripiprazole
      IM depot trial, 31-08-248 (NCT00731549). Alternatively, any subject that discontinues in
      Phase 3 (up to and including Week 38) will have the option to enroll into an open-label
      aripiprazole IM depot trial, 31-08-248 (NCT00731549).

      The enrollment figure includes re-screened patients.
