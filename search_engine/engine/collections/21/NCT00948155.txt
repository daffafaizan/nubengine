      using varenicline. Behavioral responses may help to better understand its mechanisms which in
      turn could improve treatment outcomes. The primary hypothesis for the study is to observe
      decreases in smoking topography, an objective measure of smoking behavior or puffing, on
      varenicline, relative to placebo; and decreases on day 21 relative to day 7 during
      varenicline treatment. We will also examine puffing and nicotine cigarette choices during lab
      visits at baseline, and Days 7 and 21. We also propose to examine if extended duration of
      treatment has clinical significance in decreasing smoking behaviors, thus potentially
      increasing the efficacy of varenicline.
