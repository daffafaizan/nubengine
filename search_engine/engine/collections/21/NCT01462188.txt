      PCI, stenting often results in distal micro and macro-embolisation which hampers coronary
      flow and microvascular recovery. Interestingly in some of these studies comparing BMS versus
      balloon angioplasty an early hazard associated to the use of stent has been reported.

      Thus, investigators hypothesize in this protocol that refraining from stenting during the
      acute phase of ST segment myocardial infarction is safe and associated to improved myocardial
      recovery as compared to acute stenting.
