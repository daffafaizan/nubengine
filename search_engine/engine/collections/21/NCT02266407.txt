      Advanced Energy, LLC, Portsmouth, NH, USA) represents a modern approach to reducing
      perioperative blood loss in patients undergoing total joint arthroplasty. Unlike standard
      electrocautery, which use monopolar radiofrequency energy, this technology uses bipolar
      radiofrequency energy combined with a continuous-flow saline at the electrode tip to prevent
      tissue temperatures from exceeding 100 °C thus minimizing tissue charring. This eliminates
      the smoke and eschar formation seen with standard electrocautery. The temperature achieved is
      sufficient to induce a process called Transcollation(TM) which shrinks the collagen fibers in
      the walls of blood vessels, effectively sealing the blood vessels up to 1mm in diameter,
      resulting in the reduction of bleeding from soft tissue.

      Suction is used to remove the saline from the surgical field with the treated tissue turning
      a light tan color. With normal use, the depth of penetration of this effect is typically less
      than 2mm. The technology is cleared by the US FDA (510(k)) and EU (CE Mark) for use on soft
      tissue & bone and will be used according to its intended packaging indications for use. The
      current assessment proposes a technique in which a disposable Aquamantys® hand piece is used
      to treat targeted areas which are bleeding or expected to bleed during surgery.

      This postmarket study will assess the surgical and economic effectiveness of Aquamantys®
      System in managing intra-operative blood loss and transfusion rates in patients undergoing
      septic and aseptic revision TKA.
