        -  Clinical efficacy evaluation of different treatment's strategies, including
           periprocedural and long-term endpoints defined as: death, myocardial infarction, brain
           stroke, necessity of repeated revascularization

        -  Evaluation of intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) as an optimisation method for direct and
           long-term revascularization effects

        -  Evaluation of optical coherence tomography as an optimisation method for direct and
           long-term revascularization effects

        -  Evaluation of late lumen loss and neointimal hyperplasia in stent in long-term follow-up

        -  Analysis of direct and indirect medical costs of alternative treatment strategies

      Study group:

      200 patients with symptomatic restenosis evidenced angiographically in bare metal stent
      implanted in native coronary artery. Patients will be randomised to 2 therapeutic groups:

        -  Patients treated with rapamycin eluting stent (n=100)

        -  Patients treated with paclitaxel eluting balloon catheter (n=100)
