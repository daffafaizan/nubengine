      ranibizumab in subjects with persistent diabetic macular edema. Persistent diabetic macular
      edema is defined as subjects who still have central subfield thickness on SD-OCT of greater
      than 320 microns after having received at least 3 previous doses of AntiVEGF therapy in the
      past 5 months. Consented, enrolled subjects will be randomized into two subgroups: (1)
      standard dosing of monthly 0.3mg ranibizumab or (2) 0.3mg ranibizumab given 2 weeks apart for
      5 doses followed by monthly dosing.
