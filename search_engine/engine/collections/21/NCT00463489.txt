      centrally delivered individualized, telephone-based lifestyle intervention focusing on weight
      management to a mailed educational intervention on Disease Free Survival in post-menopausal
      women with early stage breast cancer (hormone receptor positive), BMI â‰¥24-<40 kg/m2, who are
      receiving standard letrozole adjuvant therapy. The telephone intervention will involve 19
      phone calls, as well as mailings and a participant manual; women will be asked to lose up to
      10% of their weight by reducing their caloric and fat intake (by 500-1000 kcal/day, 20%
      calories fat) and increasing their moderate physical activity (to 150-200 minutes/week).
      Secondary outcomes include overall survival, distant disease-free survival, weight change,
      health-related quality of life (HRQOL), selected non-cancer medical events and biologic
      factors (notably insulin). Approximately 2,150 women will be enrolled; follow-up will
      continue until target event rates have been met (anticipated 4-6 years after completion of
      the intervention). This sample size will provide 80% power (type 1 error 0.05 2-tailed) to
      detect a hazard ratio (HR) for DFS of 0.74-0.76 in the weight loss intervention arm.
