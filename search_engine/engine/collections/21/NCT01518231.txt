      lack of efficient therapy. Stem sell transplantation provides a functional improvement after
      cerebral ischemia in rat models. Our study will recruit 40 ischemic stroke patients which
      will be divided into 2 groups (20 patients each): treatment group and control group. The
      former will be implanted with peripheral blood stem cell through anterior cerebral artery or
      middle cerebral artery (determined by the section of infarction) and receive convention
      stroke therapy. The latter only receive convention stroke therapy. The investigators expect
      that transplantation of the peripheral hematopoietic stem cell is safe and efficient to
      neurological recovery.
