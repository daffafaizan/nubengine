      difficulties in returning to work after treatment, leading to socio-economic spill-over
      effects.

      A specific 16 questions questionnaire had been developed for this study, the "Health and
      Employment After Gastro Intestinal Surgery Dialogical Questionnaire" (HEADS-DQ). It
      investigate peculiar patient competences involved after surgery: future forethought; context
      evaluation; consequences of own actions forethought; use of available resources, each
      relevant to four areas: clinical; familiar; working; daily-activities.

      Through this questionnaire participants ability in dealing with after surgery consequences
      will be evaluated in order to describe their development during the post surgery period.
