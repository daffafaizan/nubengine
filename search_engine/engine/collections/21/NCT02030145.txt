      different manipulation techniques on pulmonary function parameters in persons with COPD.
      Thirty-six (36) subjects will be enrolled in the study in order to complete the study with at
      least 30 subjects. Pulmonary function measures will include spirometry and lung volume. The
      pulmonary function testing will be done baseline, 30 minutes post-treatment, and 3 hours
      post-treatment. The study protocol treatment consists of a five-minute treatment session of
      one of the two studied treatment techniques given in a random order. After a washout period
      of at least four weeks, the subject will return for a second treatment session using the
      other technique.
