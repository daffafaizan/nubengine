      the Netherlands. The investigators will evaluate the implementation by enrolling patients in
      a database to evaluate healthcare experiences and to register EOC diagnosis and vital status
      through yearly PALGA (the nationwide network and registry of histopathology and cytopathology
      in the Netherlands) and municipal administration searches. In addition, the investigators
      will perform medical record check to assess which percentage of eligible women have been
      offered OS.

      The investigators expect that a decision aid will be a necessary tool for the decision
      whether women opt for an OS or not, based on their personal values. After development of the
      tool(s), the investigators will evaluate the implementation process.
