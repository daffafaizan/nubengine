      resistance associated with obesity. Circulating uric acid (UA) is the body's major endogenous
      plasma antioxidant. Therefore, the investigators evaluated whether alterations in serum UA
      concentration affect: 1) systemic and skeletal muscle oxidative stress, 2) total antioxidant
      capacity, and 4) skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity during a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic
      clamp.
