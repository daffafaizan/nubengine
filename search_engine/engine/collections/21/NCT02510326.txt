      suboptimal salvage operations and wrist fusions. These are surgeries, which greatly limit
      function. This study is designed to evaluate arthritis of the STT joint and its affect on
      arthritis in other parts of the wrist. This may improve the understanding of wrist mechanics
      enabling us to develop better treatment of wrist arthritis. STT joint arthrodesis is an
      accepted surgery whose indications may be influenced by information obtained in this study.

      Five patients being treated by the PI that have a diagnosis or a finding of STT joint
      arthritis stage 3 on X-ray will be included in the study. The radiographs are standard of
      care for various hand and wrist conditions and patients will be sent for radiographs only as
      part of their care. The patients will be eligible for the study following informed consent.
      The CT scan will be performed at 5-7 wrist positions: neutral, maximum extension, flexion,
      radial deviation, ulnar deviation (plus radial extension and ulnar flexion for 7 positions).
      Slice thickness will be less than 1 mm. The slices will be located between distal radioulnar
      joint (DRUJ) and the 2nd carpometacarpal (CMC) joint. The CT scans will then be sent for
      evaluation by the computer based kinematic program. No identifiable information will be
      collected or recorded. The program will develop a kinematic model of the STT joint in the
      presence of arthritis.

      The model (kinematic data) will be compared to an existent "normal" model, based on 7 CT
      scans of normal STT joints. This data is already in existence and therefore no normal wrists
      are accrued.
