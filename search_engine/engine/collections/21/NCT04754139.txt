      for PrEP making it the first HIV prevention medicine available in China. While this is a
      significant step in addressing the country's rising rates of new HIV diagnoses,
      implementation and scale-up of this resource will be the next challenge.

      Three thousand two hundred at-risk youth and young adults will be engaged by word of mouth
      and social media. Individuals will be asked to complete a survey of risk and PrEP interest,
      to download the study mobile mini-application onto their cell phone, and will be offered an
      HIV and syphilis screen. One thousand two hundred of these subjects who are eligible and
      willing to start PrEP will be enrolled in the study.

      Enrolled participants will undergo baseline laboratory testing before brought to a
      collaborating hospital where an established physician will provide TDF/FTC and arrange
      follow-up. All subjects will be encouraged to keep using the mini-application for receiving
      constant health education and counseling support on HIV/STI prevention, PrEP initiation
      and/or adherence management. Subjects on PrEP will be contacted every three months over the
      course of two years to answer questions on adherence, adverse effect, and utilization of the
      mini-application.

      In addition, a PrEP messaging open contest will be organized to assess the best images and
      videos to enhance PrEP adherence among those who start PrEP. New content will be developed
      using crowdsourcing and introduced into the mini-application at staggered times. The effect
      of this content will be evaluated through a stepped wedge approach nested within this single
      arm study.
