      stable posture, and have reduced motion and touch sensation in the lower extremities. This
      study will examine whether vestibular sensation is also affected by diabetes.

      This study is observational because measurements will be made without the application of an
      intervention. The same measurement protocol was applied to a large group of normal subjects,
      and this published data will serve as normative controls.
