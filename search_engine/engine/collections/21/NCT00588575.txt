      as a candidate with high potential. Optical spectroscopic techniques measure specific
      light-tissue interactions, such as fluorescence, elastic scattering, and Raman (inelastic)
      scattering, which provide objective and quantitative diagnostic information about the
      molecular and/or structural status of tissue. Moreover, optical spectroscopy has the capacity
      to identify tissue pathology in situ in a rapid and non-destructive fashion. Among the
      optical spectroscopic techniques, near-infrared Raman spectroscopy (NIRS) is particularly
      promising because of the wealth of molecular-specific information contained in its spectra
