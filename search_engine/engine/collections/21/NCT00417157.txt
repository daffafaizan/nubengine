      these patients pregnancy rates remain disappointingly low and usually oocyte donation is
      their only viable option. The need for lengthy ovarian stimulation regimes can be avoided by
      performing IVF during a natural menstrual cycle. However, the main problem with a natural
      cycle is that successful IVF outcome can be compromised by a premature LH surge. This problem
      can be solved by the administration of GnRH antagonists that suppress endogenous gonadotropin
      levels, comprising a modified natural cycle (MNC). Previous studies have shown that MNC
      offers no realistic chances of pregnancy prior to oocyte donation. In this study we will
      re-assess this view by showing that MNC offers some, albeit small, chances of positive IVF
      outcome in patients with known previous poor response prior to oocyte donation.
