      I. To determine the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended phase 2 dose of the
      combination of abemaciclib and niraparib tosylate monohydrate (niraparib).

      II. To assess safety and tolerability of the combination of abemaciclib and niraparib in
      early stage HR+ breast cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine clinical response to treatment. II. To determine pathologic response to
      treatment. III. To determine feasibility of combination as determined by no delay to standard
      of care breast surgery.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To assess occurrence of secondary myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)/acute myeloid leukemia
      (AML) malignancy.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase 1 dose-escalation study of abemaciclib in combination with niraparib
      followed by a dose-expansion study.

      Patients receive abemaciclib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) and niraparib PO once daily (QD).
      Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 2-4 cycles in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients who complete 4 cycles undergo standard of care mastectomy or
      lumpectomy. Patients demonstrating progressive disease after only 2 cycles are switched to
      receive standard of care chemotherapy prior to undergoing mastectomy or lumpectomy.

      Patients are followed up at 30 days after date of surgery, every 3 months for the first 6
      months, every 6 months for 2 years, then annually for up to 5 years from date of surgery.
