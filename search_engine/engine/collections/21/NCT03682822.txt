      with cephalic lie and a medical indication for induction of labor will be approached for this
      study. The patient/provider must be attempting induction with the goal of vaginal delivery.
      Women with ruptured membranes, suspected intrauterine infection, prior uterine scar, fetal
      demise, or a fetal anomaly will be excluded. Women that agree to the study will be randomized
      to 2 groups: the "early amniotomy" group and the "late amniotomy" group.

      Women in the early amniotomy group will undergo artificial rupture of membranes (AROM) prior
      to reaching cervical dilation of 4 cm. Women in the late amniotomy group may not undergo AROM
      until they reach cervical dilation of greater than 4 cm or they have been on an oxytocin drip
      for greater than 10 hours with no cervical change. It is possible that a woman in the late
      amniotomy group will not undergo AROM at all.

      The primary outcome under consideration is time in labor. Secondary outcomes include rates of
      chorioamnionitis, postpartum endometritis, mode of delivery, and neonatal outcomes.
