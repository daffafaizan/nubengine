      affect pain experience and the need and type of pain control medication after a total knee
      replacement. People experience pain differently. The type and amount of medication required
      to control pain varies. Post-operative pain often requires narcotics to keep patients
      comfortable. It has been shown that there is a genetic difference in how people respond to
      pain and how they respond to the medications used for the relief of pain. Opioids are often
      used to relieve pain after surgery. These medications can be abused and have had a role in
      the current opioid crisis.

      Pharmacogenomics is the study of how patients respond to and metabolize drugs and medications
      based on their genetic profiles. This study will collect data on the pain experienced by
      participants and the narcotics used after total knee replacements. This will be correlated
      with the participants' pharmacogenomic profiles obtained though DNA testing. There are no
      treatment interventions in this study. Although a pharmacogenomic profile will be obtained at
      the first post-operative visit and reported approximately 3 weeks later, the subject will
      have completed the need for pain relief. The study is expected to last 2 years with 300
      subjects enrolled.
