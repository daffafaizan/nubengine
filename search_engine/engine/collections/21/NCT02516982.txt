    
      As part of our first aim, we will assess the psychometric properties of the Whooley
      questions, by comparing the answers given to these questions against the scores obtained on
      the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, and we will manipulate the survey questionnaire
      layout of the Whooley Questions and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale in order to
      ensure that this survey design choice does not affect data quality. As part of our second
      aim, we will compare two prospective sampling protocols on patient compliance and engagement
      with the app.

      We will use a parallel, randomised control trial study design. Participation in each part of
      the study (i.e., iPads in antenatal clinics, or app running on own handset) will be
      independent from each other. Those participants consenting to get involved in the part of the
      study assessing the use of iPads in antenatal clinics will be randomly assigned to complete
      (i) an app version of the Whooley questions and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale in
      which the questionnaires are presented using a scrolling layout (i.e., App screening -
      Scrolling), or (ii) an app version of the Whooley questions and the Edinburgh Postnatal
      Depression Scale in which the questionnaires are presented using a paging layout (i.e., App
      screening - Paging).

      Participants consenting to get involved in the part of the study assessing the use of an app
      running on participants' own devices will be randomly allocated to one of two sampling
      protocols: (i) a prospective sampling protocol of 6 months consisting of the Edinburgh
      Postnatal Depression Scale and 5 momentary questions related to mood; or (ii) a prospective
      sampling protocol of 6 months consisting of the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale.

      We will utilise a block randomisation procedure (with blocks of 4) to generate our allocation
      sequence. Random numbers will be generated using Stata 13.0. Researchers conducting
      participant recruitment will not be involved in this randomisation procedure in order to
      avoid recruitment bias.
