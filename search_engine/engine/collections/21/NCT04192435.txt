      antifibrinolytic drug routinely used to reduce bleeding in cardiac and some orthopaedic
      surgery, in 3,300 patients undergoing major gastrointestinal (GI) surgery. Our specific aims
      are to investigate whether TxA:

      Aim 1: Reduces surgical site infection ("wound infection"), and other healthcare-associated
      infections (pneumonia and sepsis).

      Aim 2: Reduces red cell transfusion in GI surgery. Aim 3: Reduces a pooled composite of any
      serious postoperative complications, and so increases "days alive and at home up to 30 days
      after surgery" (DAH30).

      Aim 4: To evaluate the temporal effect of TxA on perioperative immune and inflammatory
      responses.

      Study Hypothesis Prophylactic TxA administration in patients undergoing major GI surgery
      reduces the incidence of surgical site infection (SSI) after surgery when compared with
      placebo.
