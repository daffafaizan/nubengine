    
      This is a multicenter, active-controlled, cross-over, evaluator-blind, Phase I study in
      patients with chronic renal failure requiring hemodialysis. The study comprises a 4-week
      Screening Period, a 1-week Pre-Treatment Period, a 1-week Treatment Period 1, a 1-week
      Treatment Period 2 and a Follow-up visit at Week 7.

      Subject eligibility will be determined during the 4-week Screening Period. All subjects must
      be optimally titrated and stable to qualify for entry into Pre-Treatment Period.

      During the 1-week Pre-treatment period the patients will continue on the same stable dose as
      they received during the Screening Period. Blood samples will be collected during the
      Pre-Treatment Period to assess pharmacokinetics of Epogen. Eligible subjects will be
      randomized at Day 1 of Treatment Period 1 to receive either Epoetin Hospira or Epogen (Amgen)
      by intravenous (IV) bolus injections administered three times a week for 1 week.

      Subjects will then be switched to receive the alternate study drug for three times a week for
      1 week in Treatment Period 2. Blood samples will be collected during Treatment periods 1 and
      2 to assess pharmacokinetics of Epoetin Hospira and Epogen.

      Primary endpoint, i.e. pharmacokinetics concentrations, will be evaluator blinded. After
      completing Treatment Period 2, all subjects will receive standard of care treatment and will
      undergo a Follow-up Visit at Week 7 (i.e., 28 days after Treatment Period 2).
