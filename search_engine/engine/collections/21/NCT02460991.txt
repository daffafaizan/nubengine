      multicenter Phase III trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ONCOZENE™ Microspheres
      loaded with doxorubicin (ONCO-DOX) in comparison with orally administered sorafenib in
      patients with unresectable, locally-advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

      Patients will be stratified by ECOG Performance Status 0 versus 1, portal vein invasion (yes
      vs. no), and alpha feto protein <400 versus ≥400. They will then be randomized at each site
      within each stratum.

      The study will be conducted at up to 40 centers in the United States, Europe & Asia. Enrolled
      patients will be randomized with equal allocation by study site.

      Patients will be followed for two years after the onset of treatment.

      The study will assess prospectively the efficacy and safety of DEB-TACE (ONCO-DOX) in
      patients with unresectable, locally-advanced HCC. The primary objective of this study is to
      compare the overall survival between DEB-TACE (ONCO-DOX) and sorafenib treatment groups.
