      severe rehabilitation is of great significance for patients, which can help patients withdraw
      from mechanical ventilation as soon as possible, improve pulmonary ventilation, and promote
      early walking.However, patients on mechanical ventilation are more prone to delirium, muscle
      weakness, ventilator dependence and other problems. Early standing training can significantly
      improve patients' lower limb muscle strength, improve diaphragm function, improve the
      prognosis of patients, and reduce the length of hospital stay.Methods: selecting stable
      hemodynamics in ICU patients with mechanical ventilation, randomly divided into two groups, a
      group of routine rehabilitation training, another group stand for regular rehabilitation and
      early training, with the aid of electric beds, on the first day of patients, to evaluate the
      seventh day, the 14th day, and collect the basic information for patients and strength
      assessment, blood gas analysis, the diaphragm of the bed and ultrasound and muscle
      ultrasound, and record the patient's mortality within 28 days, the incidence of delirium,
      decannulation rate, etc., recorded in patients with mechanical ventilation time and the time
      required to walk independently and ICU stay time.
