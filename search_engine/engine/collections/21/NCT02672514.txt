      inflammatory reaction after cardiac surgery which can cause acute kidney injury (AKI).
      Miniaturized extracorporeal circulation (MECC) attempts to reduce the adverse effects of
      conventional extracorporeal circulation bypass. Finally, AKI after CPB is a significant
      clinical problem that increasingly complicates the course of hospitalization and clinical
      outcome.
