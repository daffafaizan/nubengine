      thus preventing the synthesis of thromboxane, which causes vasoconstriction and platelet
      aggregation. By this mechanism low-dose aspirin may enhance ovarian and uterine blood flow
      and tissue perfusion and thus improve ovarian responsiveness for gonadotrophins and
      endometrial receptivity for implantation. Randomized controlled studies and meta-analyses on
      the low-dose aspirin therapy to improve IVF/ICSI outcome or uterine hemodynamics have
      revealed conflicting results.
