    
      OUTLINE: This is a multi-center study.

      EXPERIMENTAL ARM A:

        -  Oxaliplatin 85 mg/m^2 over 2-4 hours

        -  Irinotecan 165 mg/m^2 over 90 minutes

        -  5-FU 2,400 mg/m^2 as a 46-hour continuous infusion without the 5-FU bolus to decrease
           the risk of neutropenia.

        -  Arm A will receive ramucirumab (RAM) administered as an intravenous infusion over 60
           minutes (infusion rate should not exceed 25 mg/min), at a fixed dose of 8 mg/kg every 2
           weeks.

      CONTROL ARM B :

        -  Oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2 over 2-4 hours

        -  Irinotecan 165 mg/m2 over 90 minutes

        -  5-FU 2,400 mg/m2 as a 46-hour continuous infusion without the 5-FU bolus to decrease the
           risk of neutropenia.

        -  Arm B will receive a placebo infusion every 2 weeks. Due to the double-blinded nature of
           this study, the volume of placebo will be calculated as if it were RAM.

      In order to demonstrate adequate organ function, all screening labs must be obtained within 7
      days prior to registration:

      Hematological:

        -  Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL

        -  Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) ≥ 1,500/mm^3

        -  Platelet Count (PLT) ≥ 100,000/mm^3

      Renal:

        -  Creatinine ≤ 1.5 mg/dL or Creatinine clearance^1 ≥ 40 mL/min

        -  Albumin ≥ 2.5 g/dL

      Hepatic:

        -  Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 mg/dL

        -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤ 3 × ULN or < 5 xULN in the setting of liver
           metastases

        -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 3 × ULN or < 5 xULN in the setting of liver metastases

      Coagulation:

        -  International Normalized Ratio (INR) (Patients receiving warfarin must be switched to
           low molecular weight heparin and have achieved stable coagulation profile prior to first
           dose of protocol therapy) ≤1.5 and a partial thromboplastin time (PTT) (PTT/aPTT) < 1.5
           x ULN
