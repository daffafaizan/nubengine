    
      This was a phase II, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, comparative trial to
      investigate the optimal dose of a single administration of Org 36286 to induce monofollicular
      ovulation in women with WHO Group II anovulatory infertility.

      Treatment injection was given on Day 1-3 after the onset of a spontaneous or progestagen
      induced withdrawal bleeding. After injection, ultrasound monitoring and sampling for serum
      hormones were done on treatment Days 3, 5, and daily from Day 7 to 21 or until a urinary
      luteinizing hormone (LH) peak was detected. From treatment Day 7 the urinary LH response was
      assessed to detect the preovulatory LH peak. In case of hyperstimulation, production of
      endogenous gonadotropins could be suppressed by giving daily injections of GnRH antagonist.

      Post-treatment assessments were done in the third week after the urinary LH peak. If no LH
      peak was detected, posttreatment assessments were performed four to five weeks after Org
      36286 or placebo injection.
