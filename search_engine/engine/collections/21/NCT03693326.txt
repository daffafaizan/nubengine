    
      This clinical study is targeted for the patients who harbor KRAS/NRAS mutation or no
      actionable genetic abnormalities detected using NGS platform and all patients will be treated
      with PDR001. The treatment period begins on Day 1 of Cycle 1 and 1 cycle consists of 21 days.

      Patients will be continued to receive study drug until the end of study unless the patients
      in disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawn consent, or by the investigator's
      judgment.

      The progression of the disease in most patients is defined radiographically and determined
      according to RECIST criteria ver. 1.1. If there are patients those who need to be provided
      investigational drug beyond predefined end of treatment, additional extended providing of
      PDR001 needs the mutual agreement of the investigators and Novartis followed by amendment of
      study protocol and contract.

      At the investigator's discretion, patients who have the initial RECIST PD may continue
      PDR001. At any time, if assessed by the investigator that the patient is no longer benefiting
      from PDR001, or the patient experiences a second PD by RECIST, then the patient shall come
      off study medication.
