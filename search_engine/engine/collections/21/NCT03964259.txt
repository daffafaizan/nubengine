      nor clinicians are blinded to the standard versus reduced intravenous fluids (IVF) regimen.
      Patients are randomized to begin with standard volume or reduced volume IVF. Over the course
      of 4 cycles of High Dose Methotrexate (HDMTX), patients alternate between standard and
      reduced volume post hydration fluids protocols.
