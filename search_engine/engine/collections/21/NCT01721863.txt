      exercise training combined with resistance training on endothelial function, heart rate
      variability (HRV), exercise capacity, and quality of life (QoL); (2) the influential factors
      related to exercise capacity, and the relationship between exercise capacity and quality of
      life in patients with permanent atrial fibrillation (AF).
