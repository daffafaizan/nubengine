      Sleeve Gastrectomy would reduce the incidence of complications (gastric fistula,
      intra-abdominal hemorrhage and intra-abdominal locoregional collection).

      The aim is to investigate whether the use of fibrin glue (Tissucol®) during Laparoscopic
      Sleeve Gastrectomy reduces the incidence of postoperative complications (gastric fistula,
      intra-abdominal hemorrhage and intra-abdominal locoregional collection)
