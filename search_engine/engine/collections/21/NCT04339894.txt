    
      Venous thrombosis of the upper limb is one of the manifestations of venous thromboembolic
      disease.

      The epidemiology and management of upper limb venous thrombosis is much less well documented
      than that of lower limb venous thrombosis.

      The investigators wished to provide epidemiological data concerning upper limb venous
      thrombosis in the hospital setting.

      The researchers would like to know the prevalence of this pathology among patients
      hospitalized in a university hospital center. In order to obtain this prevalence, the
      investigators wish to carry out a monocentric cross-sectional descriptive study.

      The main objective of the study is to define the prevalence of upper limb venous thrombosis
      in patients hospitalized at Nantes University Hospital.

      The secondary objectives are to describe the epidemiology according to the patient's
      hospitalization sector or the endovenous medical devices used. Another secondary objective is
      to describe the clinical signs associated with thromboses and their characteristics.

      The investigators wish to include major patients hospitalized at the Nantes University
      Hospital in different sectors (medical, surgical, intensive care units). After collecting the
      patient's non-opposition, reseachers will carry out a venous duplex ultrasonography of the
      upper limbs.

      Data concerning the hospitalization unit, the patient's comorbidities, the presence of venous
      tracts or other endo-venous devices, clinical signs and duplex ultrasonography data will be
      collected using a standardized collection grid.
