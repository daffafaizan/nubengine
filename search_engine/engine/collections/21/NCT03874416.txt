      simultaneous informations, but is often altered after a moderate to severe TBI. This
      alteration results in disabilities and social integration difficulties in the post TBI
      patients. The study team had developped a standardized and hierarchized rehabilitation
      program of working memory. Several experiments have shown the efficacy of the program which
      is now used in routine care by speech-language pathologists and neuropsychologists. However
      it is necessary to provide a robust demonstration of its efficacy in improving function in
      daily life.

      This randomized multicenter study will be performed in 6 centers in the area of
      ÃŽle-de-France. 54 patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive either specific rehabilitation
      of working memory or non-specific rehabilitation. A 10-month follow-up is planned for
      patients of the two arms.
