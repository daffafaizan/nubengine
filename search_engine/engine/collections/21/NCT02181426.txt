      fusion surgery and found that 7.5 mg every 6 hours was as effective as 15 or 30 mg every 6
      hours in decreasing postoperative pain and patient opiate consumption. Since ketorolac side
      effects such as gastrointestinal and surgical site bleeding seem to be dose related,
      utilizing a lower dose of ketorolac may be more efficacious.
