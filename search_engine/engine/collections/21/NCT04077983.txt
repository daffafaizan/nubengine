      distant metastases and lose the opportunity for surgical resection. Surgical resection is the
      only effective means for long-term survival of patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.
      However, multiple tumors, lymph node metastasis, and vascular invasion significantly reduced
      postoperative survival. Most patients will relapse due to less clinical data. The best
      adjuvant treatment strategy and standard protocol for patients with intrahepatic
      cholangiocarcinoma has not been determined. Current treatment options include chemotherapy
      based on fluoropyrimidine or gemcitabine. Albumin-bound paclitaxel(nab-paclitaxel) has been
      used to treat a variety of malignancies such as non-small cell lung cancer, pancreatic
      cancer, breast cancer, melanoma, ovarian cancer and the like. In the field of pancreatic
      cancer, studies have confirmed that albumin-bound paclitaxel has synergistic effects with
      gemcitabine. The combination of gemcitabine alone significantly increased the intratumoral
      concentration of gemcitabine. Albumin-bound paclitaxel plus gemcitabine is the first choice
      for first-line treatment of pancreatic cancer, but clinical studies in the field of
      cholangiocarcinoma are very limited. Based on the same origin of pancreatic and biliary
      embryos, biological behavior and pathological similarities. Therefore, in this second phase
      of the study, our aim was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of chemotherapy with
      nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine in the prevention of postoperative recurrence in patients with
      intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.
