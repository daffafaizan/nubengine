    
      Our proposed clinical study will:

        -  Provide an exploratory yet reliable and validated cadre of imaging studies done in
           patients that yield a mechanistically-based understanding of: 1) predictive assays for
           clinical benefit from standard sunitinib therapy, 2) measurement of efficacy during
           standard sunitinib therapy, and 3) prognosis or other long term outcomes.

        -  Reveal a more detailed understanding of the in vivo mechanism of standard sunitinib
           therapy in patient tumors, mechanistic information on why particular functional imaging
           patterns are seen in treated patients, and clinical measures that are useful to
           physicians for decision making and for explanation of efficacy or outcomes for patients.

        -  Predict which patients may benefit from standard sunitinib therapy.

        -  Determine early in the course of treatment whether standard sunitinib therapy will be
           efficacious and whether this can be used in future comparable patients.

        -  Show the outcome of patients with standard sunitinib treatment.

        -  Shed further information on the biological mechanism for the rapid decrease of FDG
           uptake on FDG-PET imaging with standard sunitinib treatment.

      It is our hypothesis that a set of biologically relevant imaging biomarkers (tumor metabolism
      assessed with dynamic FDG-PET; tumor proliferation assessed with dynamic FLT-PET; tumor blood
      flow assessed with H215O-PET and DCE MRI); tumor perfusion assessed with DCE-MRI; and tumor
      blood volume/volume of distribution assessed with H215O-PET and DCE MRI) in the same patient
      at baseline and then in the same patient at one of the post therapy time points (1 week, 2
      weeks, 3 weeks or 4 weeks) will provide either alone or more likely in combination
      information that will predict which patients will most likely benefit from standard sunitinib
      therapy and that an early response assessment is possible that is predictive of a durable
      response to the therapeutic drug.
