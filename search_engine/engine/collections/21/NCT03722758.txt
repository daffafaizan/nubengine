      hybrid resin composite and resin-modified glass ionomer cement in root caries lesions.

      Thirty-three patients with at least two root caries lesions participated in this study. A
      total of 110 restorations were randomly placed, half using resin composite (Spectrum TPH3)
      and the other half using the resin-modified glass ionomer cement (Riva Light Cure).
      Restorations were evaluated at the baseline, 6, 12, 18, 24 and 36 months. The data were
      analyzed with Pearson's Chi-square, Cochran's Q, Friedman tests and Logistic Regression
      Analysis (p=0.05).
