      which reconstructive surgery is indicated. Patients will be randomly stratified into two
      groups.

      The first group will receive autologous MSCs transplantation included in a collagen type I
      membrane (OrthADAPT) and the second group will serve as cell-free controls.

      The surgical procedure will be performed by arthroscopic and/or combined technique:
      arthroscopic subacromial decompression and mini-open rotator cuff repair. The OrthADAPT-cells
      composite will be put on the sutured area. The radiograms and function will be assessed by
      independently observers, who will no have knowledge of the study group from which they will
      have been obtained.
