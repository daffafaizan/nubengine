      problem. Many children with poor asthma control experience gastroesophageal reflux (GERD).
      The effect of mild GERD on asthma remains controversial despite studies involving proton-pump
      inhibitors (PPIs) assessing their effect on asthma. Past inconsistent findings regarding the
      effect of PPIs on asthma control may have resulted from ineffective dosing strategies of
      proton-pump inhibitors employed in these studies. Drug levels and efficacy vary widely in the
      population and depend on genetics. Dosing in children which adjusts for the gene CYP2C19 may
      improve efficacy and reduce side-effects leading to improved asthma control.

      HYPOTHESIS: #1: The investigators hypothesize that genotype-tailored lansoprazole dosing will
      reduce asthma symptoms in children with mild symptoms of GERD compared to placebo. #2:
      CYP2C19 and ABCB1 genetic variants influence the pharmacokinetics (drug levels) of
      lansoprazole as determined by population pharmacokinetic modeling.

      METHODS: The investigators will conduct a 6-month randomized controlled trial comparing
      genotype-tailored lansoprazole dosing versus matched placebo in the control of asthma
      symptoms in 6-17 year olds with asthma and mild reflux. All participants will have baseline
      pharmacokinetics analysis following a single genotype-tailored dose to assess the effects of
      CYP2C19 and ABCB1.

      IMPACT: These results would be a major advance in the science of safe dosing of proton-pump
      inhibitors in children and for the management of the millions of children struggling with
      reflux and asthma.
