      Primary

        -  Determine the antitumor activity of docetaxel and cisplatin, as measured by tumor
           response rate, in patients with chemotherapy-na√Øve stage IIIB or IV non-small cell lung
           cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the duration of response in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine time to disease progression in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the 1-year survival rate in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the median survival time in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Correlate aneuploidy (as determined by DNA histograms) and immunohistochemical
           expression of stathmin, Aurora-A, and survivin with response in patients treated with
           this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, nonrandomized, multicenter study.

      Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour and cisplatin IV over 1 hour once on days 1, 8, and
      15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 6 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 76 patients will be accrued for this study within 13-19 months.
