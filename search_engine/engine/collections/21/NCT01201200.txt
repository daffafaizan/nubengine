      the development of cardiac disease. However, there is no substantial that about the influence
      of Obstructive Sleep Apnea on the right ventricular function. Objective: to analyse the right
      ventricular function in patients with Obstructive Sleep Apnea by means of Real-Time Three
      dimensional Echocardiography.
