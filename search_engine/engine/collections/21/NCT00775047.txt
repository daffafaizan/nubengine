      randomized to receive their next two injections either back at the Planned Parenthood clinic
      or at a local pharmacy where pharmacists are trained to give injections. After each
      injection, women will be asked to complete a questionnaire to assess their attitudes about
      the method of birth control, their providers, and the location where they received the
      injection.
