      whose post-transplant status is being monitored according to local standard of care. Each
      subject will receive up to 20 liters of PFP/oxygen gas mixtures as a contrast agent to
      visualize the airway and alveolar spaces in their lungs using 19F magnetic resonance imaging
      of inert gas/oxygen mixtures.

      The goal of this study is to evaluate the utilization of conventional 'thermally' polarized
      perfluorinated gases mixed with oxygen as an exogenous inert contrast agent to image the
      airway spaces in subjects with transplanted lungs. This is an open label proof of concept
      study expanding on work here at Duke.

      The central hypothesis and current observation is that PFx gases, when used as contrast
      agents, provide functional images of the lung airways including important regional
      ventilation information such as ventilation defect severity and gas trapping. We will test
      the central hypothesis and accomplish the overall objective by addressing the following
      specific aims:

      Primary Study Aims/Secondary Aims Aim 1: Determine qualitative and quantitative measures of
      lung ventilation performance in terms of ventilation efficiency during wash-in evaluation of
      the 19F images of lung airspaces.

      Aim 2: Determine qualitative and quantitative measures of lung ventilation performance in
      terms of direct measures of gas trapping measured during washout of the perfluorinated gas
      mixture.

      The outcomes of the work proposed in the aims is expected to demonstrate a non-invasive novel
      quantitative approach for evaluation of regional lung function in subjects with lung
      transplants that would allow repeated evaluation of lung function post-transplant to monitor
      for chronic allograft rejection.
