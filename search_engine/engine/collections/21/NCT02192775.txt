      children. The virus has been altered by having an extra gene (piece of DNA) added to it to
      allow a protein called NIS to be inserted into it. NIS is normally found in the thyroid gland
      ( a small gland in the neck) and helps the body concentrate iodine. Having this additional
      gene will make it possible to track where the virus goes in the body.
