    
      Rationale:

      Critically ill patients with trauma or sepsis exhibit a high degree of vitamin C deficiency
      at ICU admission and vitamin C plasma concentrations decrease even more during the first
      three days of admission. Vitamin C is a natural anti-oxidant and crucial for endothelial and
      organ protection

      Objective:

      To determine the pharmacokinetics of two high dose regimens of intravenous vitamin C in
      critically ill patients, in particular the attained plasma concentration and the fraction
      retained in the body and excreted in urine.

      Study design:

      Prospective randomized controlled pharmacokinetic intervention study

      Study population:

      Adult critically ill patients admitted to the ICU of the VU University Medical Center,
      Amsterdam, with sepsis or SIRS after major surgery or trauma with a non-neurological
      sequential organ failure (SOFA) score >6 and an expected length of ICU stay of >96 hours.

      Intervention (if applicable):

      Patients will receive either 2 or 10 gram/day vitamin C intravenously twice daily for two
      days in bolus or continuous infusion.
