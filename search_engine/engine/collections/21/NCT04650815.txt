      improved assays are needed to measure the efficacy of vaccines. Transmission-blocking
      vaccines (TBVs) work by inducing antibodies in vaccines that inhibit parasite development in
      the mosquito interrupting transmission. Efficacy of vaccines may be estimated by in vitro
      membrane feeding assays using immune sera and laboratory mosquitoes, but qualified assays
      that measure transmission in the field are needed to assess transmission-blocking
      interventions in natura. Clinical trials of TBV have started elsewhere on the continent in
      Mali, and we expect to expand TBV studies here in Burkina Faso in the future. This protocol
      will use a longitudinal cohort to gather information on the rates of blood smear positive
      individuals by month, season and year at Sabou Health district area, Burkina Faso.
      Individuals in the villages will be approached first for participation, including permission
      to contact their household and neighbors of their compound for participation. Households will
      be identified using census data and individuals will be consented for participation. Malaria
      smears will be obtained at monthly visits, in conjunction with mosquito collections in/around
      village residences. Parasite rates in locally caught mosquitoes will be assessed
      longitudinally for differences by season and year.

      A total of 600 volunteers from Sabou area will be enrolled. Participants aged 0.5-65 years
      will have monthly blood sampling and mosquito collection at their household. Participants
      will be followed for up to 1 year, to collect data that will guide the design of future
      community-based trials of TBV.
