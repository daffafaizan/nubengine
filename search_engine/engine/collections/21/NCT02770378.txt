    
      A proof-of-concept clinical trial assessing the safety of the coordinated undermining of
      survival paths by 9 repurposed drugs (aprepitant, auranofin, captopril, celecoxib,
      disulfiram, itraconazole, minocycline, ritonavir and sertraline) combined with metronomic
      temozolomide (CUSP9v3 treatment protocol) for recurrent glioblastoma. This is a phase I study
      for subjects of 18 years and older with glioblastoma that has relapsed after radiation and
      chemotherapy, as confirmed by histology and MRI.

      A total of 10 patients will be treated with the CUSP9v3 treatment protocol. This is a
      monocentric trial: all patients will be treated at Ulm University Hospital.
