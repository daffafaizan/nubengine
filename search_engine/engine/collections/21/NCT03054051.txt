      via inexpensive Android smart phones. The game is informed by socio-behavioral and
      pedagogical theories, evidence-based practice, and formative research on youth sexual culture
      in sub-Saharan Africa. It is designed to: educate young players, ages 11-14, about sexual
      health and HIV/AIDS; build risk-reduction skills and related self-efficacy for prevention of
      HIV, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and unintended pregnancy; challenge harmful
      gender norms and HIV stigma; and foster dialogue with parents and caregivers.

      The proposed feasibility test will be conducted in Western Kenya. Sixty preadolescents will
      be enrolled in the trial, 30 in the study arm and 30 in the control arm. The Kenya Medical
      Research Institute (KEMRI) has established community advisory boards (CABs) in Kisumu, which
      will be available to the proposed study.

      Data collection will take place at KEMRI offices, health clinics, or in the meeting room of a
      local community-based organization (CBO). In addition, data on game-play will be
      automatically collected on mobile phones given to preadolescent study participants.
