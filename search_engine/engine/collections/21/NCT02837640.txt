    
      Retinitis pigmentosa is a group of progressive hereditary diseases that diffusely affects the
      functioning of photoreceptors and the pigment epithelium. It may be speculated that a
      protective effect on the pigment epithelium, as it is supposed for L-Dopa, can slow the
      progression of the disease or even lead to an, at least transient, improvement of visual
      functions. To evaluate the effect of L-Dopa on retinitis pigmentosa progression, visual
      acuity, electroretinogram and visual field will be preformed regularly.
