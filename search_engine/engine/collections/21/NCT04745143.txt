      oxidative stress may play a role. Cognitive deficits are core symptoms of accelerated aging
      in patients with schizophrenia and the most difficult domain to treat. Current antipsychotics
      have limited, if any, efficacy for cognitive function. Previous studies found that some
      NMDA-enhancing agent was able to augment antioxidant activity and its adjunctive therapy was
      better than placebo in reducing not only clinical symptoms but also cognitive deficits and
      revealed favorable safety in patients with chronic schizophrenia. Of note, a substantial
      portion of schizophrenia patients refuse or cannot tolerate antipsychotics due to poor
      response or severe side effects. This study aims to examine the efficacy and safety of NMDAE
      monotherapy for the treatment of schizophrenia. The investigators enroll patients with
      schizophrenia who refuse or are unable to tolerate antipsychotics due to poor response or
      adverse effects into a 6-week randomized, double-blind trial to receive monotherapy of NMDAE
      or placebo. The investigators biweekly measure clinical performances and side effects.
      Cognitive functions are assessed at baseline and at endpoint of treatment by a battery of
      tests. The efficacies of NMDAE and placebo will be compared.

      Chi-square (or Fisher's exact test) will be used to compare differences of categorical
      variables and t-test (or Mann-Whitney test if the distribution is not normal) for continuous
      variables between treatment groups. Mean changes from baseline in repeated-measure
      assessments will be assessed using the generalized estimating equation (GEE). All p values
      for clinical measures will be based on two-tailed tests with a significance level of 0.05.
