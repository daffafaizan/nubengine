    
      You are being asked to take part in this research study which is conducted at The University
      of Texas MD Anderson ("MD Anderson") and the Harris Health System because you (or someone you
      act as a caregiver for) are undergoing follow-up after curative resection of colorectal
      cancer.

      The goal of this study is to find out the key priorities for patients and their caregivers
      when it comes to surveillance after curative resection of colorectal cancer. Your responses
      will help develop decision aids to help future colorectal cancer patients make more informed
      decisions about surveillance.

      If you agree to participate in this study, you will take part in an interview or focus group
      in person at MD Anderson, the Harris Health System, or the Alliance. The interview or focus
      group is expected to take between 30 minutes and 1 hour. The interview or focus group will be
      audiorecorded. Your name or other identifying information will not appear in the transcript.
      Adept Word Management, a transcription service that has been approved by the institution, may
      transcribe the interviews.

      You will be asked questions about:

        -  your priorities and concerns about colorectal cancer surveillance

        -  what you know about colorectal cancer and surveillance,

        -  your cancer and treatment (or the patients'),

        -  the impact or inconvenience that surveillance causes,

        -  who you think should make decisions about surveillance,

        -  your thoughts about different surveillance scenarios,

        -  and general questions about your age, race, sex, education, and income level.

      Information about you will be collected from the medical records and existing data in a
      database of colorectal patients that is used to organize existing information about
      colorectal patients to better understand the disease. Information collected will include
      things like age, gender, marital status, information about the tumor, type of surgery, and
      what treatment was done before and after surgery. There are no other plans to share your
      information with others outside the study.

      Your participation will be over when the interview is complete. If you are undergoing
      follow-up for colorectal cancer, research staff will look at your medical record after the
      interview for information about your cancer including tumor characteristics.

      Your participation is completely voluntary. Whether you say yes or no will not change your
      medical care.

      Up to 220 patients and their caregivers will participate in this multicenter study. Up to 190
      patients and their caregivers will be enrolled at MD Anderson. Up to 10 patients and their
      caregivers will be enrolled at the Harris Health System.
