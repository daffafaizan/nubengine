      solid tumors. The recommended single-agent dose of Oxaliplatin in adult cancer patients with
      normal renal function is 130 mg/m(2) given intravenously over 2 hours every 3 weeks. Renal
      excretion is thought to be the major route of drug elimination, but precise dosing guidelines
      in patients with abnormal renal function have not been determined. This phase I and
      pharmacologic study of single agent Oxaliplatin is being conducted in adult cancer patients
      with impaired renal function. Patients will be stratified into four groups based upon their
      degree of renal impairment as assessed by a 24 hour creatinine clearance. Group A will
      consist of 12 patients with normal renal function who will serve as pharmacologic controls.
      The remaining 3 groups will start at different doses of Oxaliplatin based upon their degree
      of renal dysfunction and dose escalation in these groups will proceed in a manner in
      accordance with standard phase I trials with 3 patients per dose level until dose limiting
      toxicity is observed. Pharmacokinetic monitoring will be performed in all patients on study.
      The goals of this trial are to define the toxicities and pharmacokinetics of single agent
      Oxaliplatin in this patient population and to determine recommended doses of Oxaliplatin in
      patient with different degrees of renal dysfunction.
