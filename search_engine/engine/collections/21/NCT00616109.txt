      cancer treated with standard chemotherapy will develop disease progression, usually within
      one year of initial treatment. Therefore, prolonging progression-free survival in this
      disease is meaningful for clinical trials exploring agents such as sunitinib. Sunitinib is a
      drug that inhibits the biological pathway responsible for the growth and spread of cancer
      cells. For this reason, we believe that sunitinib maintenance therapy will delay or prevent
      recurrence and prolong survival.

      The goal of this study is to determine the progression-free survival rate in patients with
      extensive-stage small cell lung cancer who had achieved complete response, partial response,
      or stable disease with their previous platinum chemotherapy regimen, such as cisplatin or
      carboplatin in combination with etoposide or irinotecan. In addition, the safety and
      effectiveness of sunitinib will also be evaluated.
