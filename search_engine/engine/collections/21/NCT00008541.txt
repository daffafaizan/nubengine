      identify, follow and provide "standard of care" treatment to patients with various corneal
      and external disease and anterior segment disorders. By providing long-term follow-up and
      treatment for a variety of corneal and external diseases, the corneal specialists at NEI will
      be better able to identify research hypotheses about these diseases in addition to
      maintaining their clinical skills. Another purpose of the protocol is to accumulate a cohort
      of patients with corneal diseases for possible participation in new NEI clinical trials and
      epidemiological protocols. The availability of cohorts of patients with a spectrum of
      anterior segment diseases will be valuable for the training of fellows, an important
      component of the mission of the NEI. The ability to provide follow-up and care will also
      facilitate referral efforts for NEI protocols.

      The cornea specialists at the National Eye Institute will be free to choose those conditions
      that interest them. However, the total number of patients that can be enrolled in the
      protocol will be restricted. This protocol is not designed to test any new treatments. Any
      evaluations or treatment under this protocol will be based on the current standard of care as
      appropriate for the relevant ocular disease.

      Participants in this evaluation and treatment protocol will be evaluated for potential
      eligibility in other NEI clinical trials or epidemiologic protocols as they are developed. If
      eligible, they may be asked to participate in the new protocol; however, they will not be
      required to enter any protocol and their decision to participate will be entirely voluntary.
