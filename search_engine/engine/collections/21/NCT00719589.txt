    
      InterStim is a bladder pacemaker device that has been in use for over 10 years for patients
      with voiding dysfunction. Although standard of care is to place the lead at the sacral nerve,
      in some patients a better response is obtained by placing the lead at the pudendal nerve.

      Data will be collected from the subjects medical records and a questionnaire will be mailed
      one time to assess patients perception of improvement and treatment satisfaction after
      pudendal Interstim.
