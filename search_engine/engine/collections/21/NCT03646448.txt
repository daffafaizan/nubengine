      population-based study revealed elevated prevalences in adolescents and young adults. The
      present study aims to provide an intervention for this vulnerable group to change the
      problematic Internet use. This is suggested to prevent the development of more severe forms
      of dependence. Brief interventions using MI and elements of CBT have shown to be an adequate
      method to change addictive behaviors.

      For the recruitment, students of vocational schools in the states of Schleswig-Holstein and
      Hamburg in Northern Germany are screened proactively in classes. Participants fulfilling at
      least 21 points on the Compulsive Internet Use Scale (CIUS) receive a diagnostic telephone
      interview. If fulfilling at least 2 DSM-5 criteria, participants will be randomly allocated
      to two conditions: (1) Intervention group with up to three telephone counseling sessions
      based on MI, (2) Control group receiving a booklet on problematic Internet use. Outcome
      measures are a reduction of DSM-5 criteria for Internet use disorders, a reduction of time
      spent on the Internet, and a reduction of negative consequences caused by the problematic
      Internet use. The efficacy of the intervention will be examined after 6 and 12 months in
      follow-up interviews.
