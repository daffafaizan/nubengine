      it for a few minutes. This exposure is repeated several times.

      In the experimental group a ball appears during the exposure, that moves horizontally across
      the room. The probands are supposed to follow this movement with their eyes.

      EDA, EKG and respiration are being recorded. Furthermore the subjective and behavioral spider
      phobia is measured before, during and after the exposure to determine occurring changes.
