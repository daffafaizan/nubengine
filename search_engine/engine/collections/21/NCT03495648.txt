      Tanglewood Trail Walking Program to the Whitesburg farmers market. Each Saturday,
      participants reported whether or not they walked the 1 mile trail to the farmers market and
      they reported which fruits and vegetables they purchased. The Walking Program was held June -
      Sept 2017. Participants completed questionnaires about fruit and vegetable consumption and
      physical activity. Participants also provided physical and biological measurements.
      Recruiting for the 2018 Walking Program will begin in May.
