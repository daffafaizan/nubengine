      plus exercise and group-B received Dry Needle alone. Baseline assessment was taken before and
      after treatment; treatment was given for four weeks twice a week. Outcome indicators were
      measured by Visual analog scale, Neck Disability Index and Cervical Range Of Motion.

      The study findings indicate that both groups improve the symptoms of a headache. Clinically
      better improvement was indicated by Dry Needle plus exercise group than Dry Needle alone
      group. As per our results, Dry Needle plus exercise should be preferred for the management of
      cervicogenic headache over Dry Needle alone.
