    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES; I. To determine the feasibility and toxicities of incorporating surgical
      resection and intra-operative Photofrin (porfimer sodium)-mediated photodynamic therapy in
      patients (pts) with malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) or non-small cell lung cancer
      (NSCLC) with pleural spread.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the overall survival rate of pts with NSCLC and pleural spread treated with
      standard frontline chemotherapy followed by surgical resection and intra-operative
      Photofrin-mediated photodynamic therapy.

      II. To determine the overall survival rate of pts with MPM after radical pleurectomy and
      intraoperative Photofrin-mediated photodynamic therapy (PDT).

      III. To determine the progression-free survival and pleural progression-free survival in the
      above mentioned pts.

      IV. To determine the absolute Photofrin levels in tumor and normal tissues resected from pts
      using spectrofluorometric assay. Photofrin levels in tumor to normal tissue ratios will be
      determined.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive porfimer sodium intravenously (IV) over 3-5 minutes. Beginning 24 hours
      later, patients undergo tumor resection and/or radical pleurectomy followed by intraoperative
      PDT to the pleural space.

      After completion of treatment, patients are followed up at 3, 6, 9, 12 and 24 months.
