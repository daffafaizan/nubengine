    
      The Blood Culture QI Program has four components: (1) education: content knowledge and
      standardized experiential training on sterile technique designed for ED nurses; (2) process
      redesign: change in patient safety attitude and conversion of blood culture collection from a
      clean to a sterile technique; (3) checklist use: reinforcement of optimal blood culture
      collection technique at the point of care; (4) feedback: systematic charting and reporting of
      contamination rates to the ED nurses who collect cultures. In order to convert blood culture
      collection into a fully sterile procedure, the investigators developed the Sterile Blood
      Culture Collection Kit, a novel materials kit that contains the equipment needed to collect a
      culture using sterile technique, including: (1) a 3ml solution of 2% chlorhexidine gluconate
      - 70% isopropyl alcohol (Chloraprep, CareFusion) skin prep device; (2) a sterile drape; (3) a
      sterile needle; and (4) gauze.

      The investigators will evaluate the effectiveness of the Blood Culture QI Program after
      implementing it in six community hospital EDs. Our study will compromise six replications of
      an interrupted time series study wherein each replication will be powered for internal
      validity to test the hypothesis of decreasing the contamination rate by 50% at each site. A
      stepped wedge (also called multiple baseline) design will be used to implement the program
      across hospitals to evaluate the generalizability (external validity) of program
      effectiveness. The primary analysis will be an interrupted time series analysis at each site
      comparing the proportion of ED blood cultures contaminated during a post-implementation
      intervention period with a pre-intervention baseline period.
