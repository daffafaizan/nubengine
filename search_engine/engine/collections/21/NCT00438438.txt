      nocturnal sleep episodes each 24 hours. This is followed by a forced desynchrony regimen
      spanning 21 calendar days and consisting of 12 cycles ("days") of a 42.85-hour wake:bedrest
      schedule. In each 42.85 hour cycle, there are 32.85 hours of scheduled wakefulness and 10
      hour sleep opportunities. This will allow assessment of the independent contributions of
      circadian phase and homeostatic sleep pressure on sleep and neurobehavioral performance. This
      forced desynchrony regimen is followed by 10 recovery days consisting of 14 hours of
      wakefulness and 10 hour nocturnal sleep episodes each 24 hours.
