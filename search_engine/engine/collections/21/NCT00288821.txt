      5-year survival rate. Lymph node involvement is an important factor in the choice of adjuvant
      treatment in gynaecological malignancies. Surgical lymphadenectomy is the gold standard for
      the diagnosis of lymph node metastases. This is a highly specialized procedure with increase
      in operative time and cost, and risk of surgery-related morbidity. Therefore, a non-invasive
      technique that accurately identifies lymph node metastasis would be beneficial. Diffusion
      Weighted whole body Imaging with Background Signal suppression (DWIBS) is a new imaging
      technique, which lightens lymph nodes and possibly differentiates normal and hyperplastic
      from metastatic lymph nodes. Cancer metastases in lymph nodes may be associated with
      alterations in water diffusivity and microcirculation within the node. It is also likely that
      cell density might play an important role. So far, no feasibility studies have will be
      evaluated for its accuracy, effectiveness, and feasibility in detecting lymph node metastases
      in gynaecological malignancies, as a possible alternative for the surgical staging method.
      The accuracy of a pelvic lymph node dissection (reference test) will also be evaluated by
      performing a post-operative DWIBS scan.
