      sickle cell disease (SCD) have improved. Graft versus host disease (GVHD), however, remains a
      barrier to success. GVHD accounts for most of the transplant related mortality and much of
      the morbidity in this setting-in part through the injury it directly causes and in part
      through the deleterious effects of steroids and the other immunosuppressive agents used to
      prevent and treat it. The results of pre-clinical studies and a phase I clinical study in
      patients with hematologic malignancies suggest that the costimulation blocking agent CTLA4-Ig
      may hold promise an agent for GVHD prophylaxis. In the present trial, the investigators are
      assessing the tolerability of adding abatacept to standard GVHD prophylaxis-a calcineurin
      inhibitor and methotrexate-in pediatric SCD patients receiving early alemtuzumab (completed
      by day -18) followed by fludarabine, thiotepa, and melphalan for conditioning. This trial
      will provide the foundation for subsequent trials designed to test the long-term hypothesis
      that abatacept is a safe, steroid-sparing effective adjunct to standard GVHD prophylaxis in
      this setting.
