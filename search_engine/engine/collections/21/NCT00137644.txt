      Live Movement and Sound (PALMS) group-level intervention for high-risk, incarcerated or
      adjudicated youth. PALMS uses three theater-based sessions to increase knowledge about
      HIV/AIDS, increase HIV testing, and reduce risky sexual behavior through increased
      self-efficacy. The intervention is delivered by peers, and peers work with the intervention
      team to use evaluation results to improve the program. The evaluation will recruit male
      adolescents, aged 12 to 18 years, who are residing in juvenile justice or drug treatment
      facilities in Philadelphia. The evaluation design uses concurrent intervention (N=132) and
      comparison (N=132) groups. Data will be collected at baseline, immediate post-intervention,
      and at a 6-month post-intervention follow-up. The intent of this program is to support the
      evaluation of an existing intervention and provide feedback to the implementing organization
      for improved program effectiveness, not to conduct research.
