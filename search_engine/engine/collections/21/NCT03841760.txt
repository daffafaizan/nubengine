    
      Prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is a unique membrane bound glycoprotein, which is
      over-expressed many fold on prostate cancer cells and other types of cancer. Since PSMA is a
      new target for molecular therapy, PSMA PET/CT allows assessment for therapy in addition to
      characterization of tumors and staging. Given the success of PSMA PET/CT for prostate cancer
      and the increasing number of case reports on PSMA uptake in non-prostate cancer, the aim of
      this project is to fill this literature gap by documenting the avidity of tumors (by means of
      SUVmax) based on their PSMA immunostaining (by the pathologist) or based on literature report
      (peer-reviewed article confirming PSMA expression in a tumor type).
