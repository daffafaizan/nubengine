    
      This is a Phase 1b/2a, open-label, multi-center, non-randomized, dose-escalation study of
      PT-112 in combination with the anti-PD-L1 antibody, avelumab, in selected advanced solid
      tumors. The study is to be conducted in two parts: the Dose Escalation Phase of PT-112 within
      the combination and the Dose Confirmation Phase. The Dose Escalation Phase will determine the
      Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of PT-112 in the combination
      with avelumab, and will evaluate the PK, safety and tolerability, and efficacy. The Dose
      Confirmation Phase will evaluate patients with non-small cell lung cancer who will be treated
      at the RP2D.
