        -  Determine the overall response rate of patients with locally advanced or metastatic
           adenocarcinoma of the stomach or gastroesophageal junction treated with erlotinib.
           (Gastric stratum temporarily closed to accrual as of 03/01/2003.)

        -  Determine the frequency and severity of toxic effects of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the overall survival and time to treatment failure in patients treated with
           this drug.

        -  Determine the value of intratumoral expression of epidermal growth factor receptor in
           predicting patient response to this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to cancer site
      (stomach vs gastroesophageal junction). (The gastric stratum is temporarily closed to accrual
      as of 03-01-2003.)

      Patients receive oral erlotinib once daily. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 6 months for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40-80 patients (20-40 per stratum) will be accrued for this
      study within 14-40 months. (The gastric stratum is temporarily closed to accrual as of
      03-01-2003.)
