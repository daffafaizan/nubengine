      intention of better characterising prostate cancer. A panel of serum and urine biomarkers
      will also be analysed, which we hope will predict those patients who go on have a positive
      MRI.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To establish a fluidic marker - prostate MRI paradigm which: (i) utilises fluidic
           markers to rationalise selection of patients with significant prostate cancer; and (ii)
           improves the diagnostic accuracy of imaging over and above standard multiparametric (mp)
           MRI

        -  Enable a pathway for rapid clinical evaluation of emerging fluidic markers and exosomes

        -  Assess the repeatability of VERDICT MRI

        -  Ascertain whether VERDICT derived quantitative parameters correlate with quantitative
           histological parameters

        -  Develop a database of fluidic marker and VERDICT characterised, mp-MRI, histologically
           validated patients for subsequent exploratory and longitudinal outcome analysis
