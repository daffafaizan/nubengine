      Primary

        -  Determine the objective response rate (complete and partial response) in patients with
           recurrent or progressive stage IIIA-IV non-small cell lung cancer treated with
           irinotecan and gemcitabine.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the median time to progression in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This a non-randomized, open-label, multicenter study.

      Patients receive irinotecan IV over 90 minutes on days 1 and 8 and gemcitabine IV over 30
      minutes on days 2 and 9. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 1 month and then every 8 weeks
      thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study within 16 months.
