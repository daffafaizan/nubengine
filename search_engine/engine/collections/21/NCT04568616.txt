      by estrogens and typically drives cancer cell growth. Adjuvant therapy with anti-estrogens
      such as tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors (AIs) is commonly used to inhibit ER to prevent
      cancer (re)growth after early-stage breast tumors are surgically removed. However, ~33% of
      such patients (~300,000 new cases per year worldwide) will eventually develop
      anti-estrogen-resistant breast cancer that is metastatic or locally advanced; at this stage,
      the disease is almost never cured using available therapies and is uniformly fatal.
      Therefore, more effective treatment early in the course of disease (i.e., in the adjuvant
      setting, shortly after surgical removal of a tumor) has huge potential to prevent cancer
      regrowth.

      Most often, ER+ breast cancers re-emerge in the years after the end of the standard five-year
      anti-estrogen treatment regimen (called 'late recurrence'). Recent data indicate that
      continued anti-estrogen therapy in patients who remain "disease-free" after five years of
      anti-estrogen therapy modestly prevents cancer recurrence. However, tumor cells are
      detectable in bone marrow of patients who are "disease-free." Thus, anti-estrogen therapy in
      "disease-free" patients likely suppresses the growth of undetectable tumor cells, keeping
      them in a "clinically dormant" state (i.e., undetectable by standard clinical methods).
      Little is known about how such dormant cancer cells survive. This clinical study will help
      identify the signaling pathways essential for the survival of clinically dormant ER+ breast
      cancer cells to enable the development of more effective therapies to eradicate such cells
      and prevent cancer recurrence.
