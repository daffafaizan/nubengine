    
      This is a study involving the use of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) contrast agents called
      Dotarem®. The purpose of this study is to look at the safety (what are the side effects) and
      efficacy (how well does it work) of Dotarem® when used for taking images of the brain and
      spine. The results of the MRI will be compared to the results of images taken without
      Dotarem®.
