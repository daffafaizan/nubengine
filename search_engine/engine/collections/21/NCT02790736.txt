      study. Participants will complete baseline assessments of fear and avoidance of public
      speaking. Participants will be randomly assigned to a single dose of propranolol 40mg or
      placebo, administered immediately after a fear activation procedure. Primary outcome
      assessment will be self-reported fear of public speaking and avoidance behavior in a
      behavioral avoidance task 2 weeks after the intervention.
