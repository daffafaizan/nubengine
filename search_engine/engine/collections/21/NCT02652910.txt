    
      Primary Objectives

        1. To determine the safety and feasibility of CD19.CAR-T cells manufactured through
           IL-7/IL-15-mediated expansion or IL-2-mediated expansion

        2. To determine in vivo dynamics and persistency of IL-7/IL-15 programmed CD19.CAR-T cells.

        3. To determine the efficacy of IL-7/IL-15 programmed CD19.CAR-T cells in treating patients
           with CD19-positive lymphoma

      Secondary Objectives

        1. To determine whether the IL-7/IL-15 programmed CD19.CAR-T cells are superior to the IL-2
           programmed cells as measured by their in vivo persistence post infusion

        2. To determine whether the IL-7/IL-15 programmed CD19.CAR-T cells are superior to the IL-2
           programmed cells as measured by their efficacy in lymphoma therapy

        3. To assess the dynamics of intratumoral infiltration of CD19.CAR-T cells.

        4. To correlate the subsets and differentiation of CD19.CAR-T cells to observed anti-tumor
           efficacy
