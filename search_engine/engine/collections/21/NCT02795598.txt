      the two methods of supraclavicular block (single and double injection), and the resultant
      incidence of temporary diaphragm dysfunction, or hemi-diaphragmatic paresis (HDP) will be
      measured with ultrasound. Patients having forearm or hand surgery will be asked by the
      attending anesthesiologist if they will agree to be approached by someone from the research
      team for consent and possible inclusion in the study. This will be done in the anesthesia
      preoperative assessment clinic, or in the pre-op area on the day of surgery (if a patient was
      not seen in clinic).

      Once consented, all patients in the study will have baseline measurements of their sensation
      and movement of the arm for surgery, as well as an ultrasound examination of the movement of
      the diaphragm.

      Patients will then be randomized to either the single or double injection supraclavicular
      nerve block. The blocks will be performed by attending anesthesiologists with experience in
      regional anesthesia, or by residents and fellows under the direct supervision of such
      anesthesiologists.
