      of 3 sequential periods: Screening, Treatment, and Follow-Up. The OMT group had the same
      schedule of visits/procedures throughout the study as the LCIG treatment group, except for
      visits related to nasojejunal (NJ)/percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) procedures,
      titration of LCIG, and follow-up period.
