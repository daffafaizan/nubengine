    
      Objective: To measure CNS GABA receptors and GABA levels in patients with succinic
      semialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSADH) deficiency, a severe pediatric neurotransmitter disease.

      Study Population: The study will include children and young adult patients with the disorder,
      as well as parents of patients (obligate heterozygotes), and adult normal volunteers.

      Design: this is a natural history study using neuroimaging techniques. We will perform
      11C-flumazenil PET scans, and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). We will perform
      neurological examinations to obtain data on clinical manifestations of the condition.

      Outcome measures: The outcome measures will be the distribution of CNS binding of
      11C-flumazenil, and brain GABA levels measured by MRS, and their relation to clinical
      manifestations such as motor, speech, and language impairment, hypotonia, hyporreflexia, and
      seizures. We expect to show that patients with SSADH deficiency will have multifocal
      reductions in FMZ binding and increased brain GABA levels in a similar pattern.
