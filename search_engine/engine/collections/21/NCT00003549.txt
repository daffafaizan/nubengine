      enroll patients with unresectable Merkel cell carcinoma that is local-regional or metastatic.
      II. Determine the overall survival rate and objective response rate of these patients after
      treatment with cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to local-regional disease versus metastatic
      disease. Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV, methotrexate IV, and fluorouracil IV on day 1.
      Courses repeat every 21 days for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicities. Patients are followed every 6 months for 2 years, then annually
      thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 80 patients (40 patients per stratum) will be accrued for this
      study.
