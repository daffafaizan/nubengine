      association between DNA damage and cognitive functioning in breast cancer survivors.
      Specifically, we predict that:

        1. Breast cancer survivors treated with chemotherapy and hormonal therapy will have higher
           levels of DNA damage as measured by the Comet assay as compared to age and education
           matched survivors treated with hormonal therapy only and healthy controls.

        2. Survivors who meet criteria for cognitive impairment will have higher levels of DNA
           damage as compared to cancer survivors who do not meet criteria for cognitive impairment
           and healthy controls.
