      20mls of 0.75% ropivacaine was found to be similar to that of 20mls of 0.5% bupivacaine1.
      However it was also found to be more efficacious at preventing 'breakthrough' pain and
      therefore had a lower intra-operative supplementation rate. Unfortunately the study was
      probably not powered adequately to confirm this finding. Bupivacaine has now largely been
      replaced in the this field by the less cardio-toxic stereoisomer levobupivacaine. A trial
      comparing 0.75% ropivacaine to 0.5% levobupivacaine and a lignocaine/adrenaline/fentanyl
      mixture was conducted in Singapore in 20082. It did not show a clinical difference between
      any of the agents. Whether the population studied is comparable to that in the UK is doubtful
      and it was not adequately powered to detect a difference in intra-operative supplementation
      rate. Local experience has shown ropivacaine 0.75% to provide a block with a rapid onset that
      has little requirement for supplementation intra-operatively. The need to supplement a local
      anaesthetic block during surgery means that the mother is experiencing a degree of pain that
      is unacceptable and we view this as a major consideration in choice of local anaesthetic for
      an epidural top-up. Whilst speed of onset is important, in that it influences the decision to
      delivery time of the baby, the evaluation of intraoperative supplementation will be a major
      focus of this trial.
