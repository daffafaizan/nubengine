      perioperative complications. The approach aims to optimize the intravascular fluid volume by
      use of minimally invasive devices which calculate flow-directed variables such as stroke
      volume (SV) and stroke volume variation (SVV). The investigators aim to show the feasibility
      of routinely implementing such hemodynamic monitoring during major abdominal surgery, and to
      evaluate its effects in terms of perioperative fluid management and postoperative outcomes.
