    
      To assess the maximum tolerated dose and overall safety and tolerability of sunitinib
      administered in combination with bevacizumab for the treatment of patients with metastatic
      renal cell carcinoma.

      To assess antitumor activity of the combination of sunitinib and bevacizumab. To evaluate
      serum levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in patients treated with sunitinib
      and bevacizumab.

      Study Design: This is a single center, open-label, Phase 1 study of sunitinib in combination
      with bevacizumab in patients with advanced metastatic renal cell carcinoma. This study is
      designed to confirm that the two agents can be administered safely in combination. Patients
      will begin treatment with bevacizumab on Day 0 and sunitinib on Day 1. Bevacizumab will be
      administered intravenously every two weeks. Sunitinib will be given orally on a 4 weeks on, 2
      weeks off schedule. DLT determination will be based on toxicities observed in Cycles 1 - a
      cycle is defined by sunitinib dosing (6 weeks). Once the MTD for the combination has been
      identified, 10 additional patients will be enrolled at the MTD to further assess safety and
      efficacy. Patients will be treated with bevacizumab and sunitinib until there is disease
      progression, significant toxicity or withdrawal of patient consent. The maximum treatment
      duration is 24 months.
