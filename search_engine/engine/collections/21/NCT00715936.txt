      maternal and child health and nutrition services in rural and remote areas of Pakistan
      through community-based Lady Health Workers. The strengths of the programme include provision
      of services at grassroots levels, reinforcement of health and basic nutrition messages and
      community acceptability. Given, the growing recognition that optimal early child development
      (ECD) also requires the integration of psychosocial care; the PEDS-Trial has been proposed to
      evaluate the benefits of the addition of 'stimulation and care for development' interventions
      and the feasibility of scaling up an ECD strategy within the community healthcare system of
      Pakistan.
