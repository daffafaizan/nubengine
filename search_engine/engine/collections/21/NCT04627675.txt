    
      This is a Phase 1, open-label study to evaluate the safety profile of CORVax +/- pIL-12,
      (electroporated SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein plasmid DNA vaccine with or without the
      combination of electroporated IL-12p70 plasmid), given as prime & boost doses, four weeks
      apart, in healthy volunteers, divided into age groups of 18-50 versus > 50 years old.
      IL-12p70 plasmid DNA electroporation (tavokinogene telseplasmid) has been extensively studied
      in over 209 subjects across 11 trials including later stage human cancer trials with more
      than 1000 administrations. The IGEA CLINIPORATORÂ® system is approved for clinical use in
      Europe, but remains investigational in this study.

      One participant will initially be enrolled to each of four cohorts and monitored over a 7-day
      DLT window:

      1A. Age 18-50; CORVax.

        1. B. Age 18-50; CORVax + pIL-12.

        2. A. Age > 50; CORVax.

      2B. Age > 50; CORVax + pIL-12.

      If after 7 days, no DLT are observed, the cohort may proceed to enroll a second participant.
      If after monitoring the second participant for 7 days, no DLT are observed, the cohort may
      proceed to enroll a third participant. If after monitoring the third participant for 7 days,
      no DLT are observed, the cohort may proceed to enroll six additional participants, for a
      total of nine participants per cohort using a (1+1+1, +6) design.
