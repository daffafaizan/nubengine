    
      Lung disease progression is variable among cystic fibrosis (CF) patients and depends on DNA
      mutations in the CFTR gene, polymorphic variations in disease-modifier genes and
      environmental exposure. The contribution of genetic factors has been extensively
      investigated, whereas the mechanism whereby environmental factors modulate the lung disease
      is unknown. Because these factors can affect the epigenome, investigators hypothesized that
      DNA methylation variations at disease-modifier genes modulate the lung function in CF
      patients.

      The investigators analyzed DNA methylation levels in the promoter of fourteen lung
      disease-modifier genes and showed that DNA methylation levels are altered in nasal epithelial
      and blood cell samples from CF patients. This study disclosed slightly, but significantly
      differentially methylated regions that collectively may modulate lung disease severity. It
      also highlighted that complex relationships between genetic and epigenetic factors contribute
      to the phenotypic variability of CF patients.
