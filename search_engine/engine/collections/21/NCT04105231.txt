      cannabis use worsens psychotic symptoms and increases the risk that a first-episode psychosis
      will progress to schizophrenia. It is the THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) content in cannabis that
      aggravates psychotic symptoms whereas the CBD content has potential therapeutic effects. This
      trial investigates treatment with CBD (without THC) versus risperidone (an antipsychotic
      agent) in people with psychosis and comorbid cannabis use. We hypothesize that CBD will
      ameliorate psychotic symptoms and increase the probability of cannabis cessation to a larger
      extent than risperidone. Sleep disturbances are often a limiting factor in the treatment of
      psychosis, and it is also examined how CBD affects objective and subjective sleep quality as
      well as circadian rest-activity cycles. Based on previous studies investigating CBD as
      monotherapy in patients with schizophrenia, it is expected that CBD will be associated with
      fewer adverse events than risperidone.
