      either early during treatment or up to two months after the cessation of the treatment. The
      frequency differs according to the definition of diarrhea, the inciting antimicrobial agent
      and the host factors such geriatric age, immunosuppression, prolonged hospitalization. Almost
      all agents, especially the the ones acting on anaerobes may cause diarrhea. Clinical
      presentations range from mild diarrhea to fulminant pseudomembranous enterocolitis. In Turkey
      still data about antibiotic associated diarrhea is not enough. Incidence and the factors that
      effect severity are not known.
