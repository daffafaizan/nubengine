      recurrent or advanced uterine sarcoma. II. Determine the nature and degree of toxicity of
      this drug in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive doxorubicin HCl liposome IV over 1 hour. Treatment continues every
      4 weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Patients are followed
      every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 1-1.5
      years.
