        1. Overall Cardiovascular Study:

           The time to first occurrence of the composite endpoint of MACE: cardiovascular death,
           non-fatal myocardial infarction [MI] or non-fatal stroke in participants treated with
           ertugliflozin is non-inferior compared to that in participants treated with placebo.

        2. The 3 Glycemic Sub-studies:

             1. The mean reduction from baseline in hemoglobin A1c (A1C) for 15 mg ertugliflozin is
                greater than that for placebo.

             2. The mean reduction from baseline in A1C for 5 mg ertugliflozin is greater than that
                for placebo.
