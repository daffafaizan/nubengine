      paravertebral muscles for reducing pain and disability in subjects suffering from acute low
      back pain (duration 3 to 6 weeks) arising from an identifiable muscle strain injury or back
      trauma. The treatment modality and techniques used are based upon three successful prior
      open-labeled pilot studies done by this research group investigating the effect of Botulinum
      Toxin A (BOTOX速) on relief of chronic low back pain. This study, however, will employ a
      prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled trial to control for any placebo or
      mechanical trigger-point injection effects. Subjects will also be assessed for 3 months to
      define the duration of efficacy of Myobloc速. Sixty subjects will be randomly assigned to one
      of two groups and will then receive either Myobloc速 or placebo injection into the lumbar
      paravertebral muscles. The subjects will be assessed using validated scales for pain and
      disability prior to injection and weekly to monthly thereafter for three months. All subjects
      will continue to receive any medication or physiotherapy per standard of care but those
      treatments will be recorded and controlled for in the data analysis.
