      monophasic type of estrogen-progestin oral treatment of second generation versus the
      establishment of an etonogestrel contraceptive implant type.

      Are excluded from this study certain absolute surgical indications. Patients, by consenting
      to participate in the study, choose a medical care, which means not to be operated
      immediately. They are clearly informed about the various possible treatment alternatives. The
      benefits and risks of surgery and medical treatment they are explicitly presented. At any
      time during the study, patients who wish may discuss again a surgical treatment with their
      physician and stop the study drug if the decision of an intervention is taken.
