      biases for social anxiety disorders have often been reported, specific data for fear of
      blushing are still missing. In this study, dysfunctional attention processes are examined by
      the use of various questionnaire measures and attention tests (e.g. Stroop test, task
      switching paradigm) comparing fear of blushers, other social phobia patients, healthy
      volunteers who report to blush seldomly respectively often. The second goal of the study is
      to examine if these attention processes can be changed by training and therapy. Therefore,
      individuals who fulfill DSM-IV criteria for social anxiety disorder and report fear of
      blushing as main problem, are treated with attention training and with CBT for social anxiety
      disorder. Therapy will be held in the form of intensive weekend group therapy. Differences in
      outcomes for both therapy types and in changeability of attention processes on objective test
      data are examined. Stability of results are tested up to 6-month and 12-month after
      post-assessment.
