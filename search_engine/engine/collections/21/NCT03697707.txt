    
      International, multicentre, open-label proof of concept study exploring two different dose
      groups of the allogeneic dendritic cell vaccine, DCP-001. Cohort 1 consists of 10 patients
      that will receive 25E6 DCP-001 cells per vaccination and Cohort 2 consists of 10 patients who
      will receive 50E6 DCP-001 cells per vaccination. All patients will be given two additional
      booster vaccinations of 10E6 cells. Each patient will be followed up for 12 months after the
      4th vaccination. Safety will be monitored throughout the study. Sera and cell samples (blood
      and bone marrow) will be collected for assessment of efficacy (MRD evaluation) and immune
      response monitoring.
