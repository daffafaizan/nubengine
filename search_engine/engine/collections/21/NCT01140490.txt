      an increased morbidity and mortality mainly due to cardiovascular disease. The precise
      mechanism of cardiovascular disease in PHPT is not well understood . The excess in
      cardiovascular mortality is significantly and independently related to serum calcium, the
      connection between the biochemical disturbances and the cardiovascular disorders in PHPT
      patients is not necessarily a cause-and-effect relationship. Indeed, the impact of surgical
      cure of hyperparathyroidism on cardiovascular risk factors and mortality is controversial.
      Some studies suggest that cardiovascular risk markers remained unaltered after Sub-total
      Parathyroidectomy.
