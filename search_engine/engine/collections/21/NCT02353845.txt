      stage of dementia. Patients with aMCI have heavy risk to convert to AD, so in this study, the
      investigators focus on the construction of the diagnosis system for early AD based on
      multi-modality MRI characteristics of aMCI patients. Every patient underwent Î²-Amyloid PET,
      fluorodeoxyglucose-PET(FDG-PET), structural MRI, diffusion tensor imaging and functional MRI.
      Then investigators further study the patients who convert to AD and explore their MRI and
      metabolism characteristics on baseline, in order to construct the predictable classifier from
      aMCI to AD. The investigators want to achieve the early diagnosis of AD and help clinicians
      interfere with the progress of this disease.
