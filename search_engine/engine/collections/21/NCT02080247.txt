      randomized controlled trial of two topical zinc oxide based diaper rash products used as part
      of a structured care regimen. All patients recruited to either arm of the trial received a
      structured care regimen for treatment of IAD for six days following study entry. At least
      twice daily and as required by incontinence episodes, treatment and care was provided by
      nurses and nursing aids trained in the study regimen to ensure its consistent implementation.
      Wet or soiled diapers were removed and the affected area was gently cleansed. Vigorous
      cleaning was avoided. A thin layer of the study topical ointment was applied prior to putting
      on a new diaper. Packs containing all the materials required were prepared for each patient
      daily, including the same brand of diapers for all patients, skin cleansing products and
      materials, and the assigned study ointment. Data were collected each day relating to their
      IAD using the Kennedy Skin Condition Assessment Scale.
