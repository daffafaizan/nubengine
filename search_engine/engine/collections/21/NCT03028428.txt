      in which the material that cushions the joints, called cartilage, breaks down. This causes
      the bones to rub against each other, causing inflammation, stiffness, pain and loss of joint
      movement. Currently, there are few effective treatments available for patients suffering from
      OA.

      Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are cells that have the ability to self-regenerate, which means
      they have the ability to make copies of themselves and to turn into other kinds of cells
      (e.g. cartilage cells). Stem cell science shows much promise for the future treatment of
      osteoarthritis, but much of the research is still in the early stages. In this study,
      researchers want to determine the safety of MSCs that a patient can tolerate without causing
      side effects. Moreover researchers will also be looking at the function of the knee over
      time, which may give them some insight on the usefulness of MSCs as a treatment option.
