      (continuous basal infusion vs. repeated bolus doses) but providing an equal total dose of
      Ropivacaine has no impact on quadriceps muscle strength. These results will help define the
      optimal delivery method of local anesthetic used for continuous peripheral nerve blocks and
      help guide future research in this clinically relevant area.
