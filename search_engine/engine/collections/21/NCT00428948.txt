      adequate safety profile, by reducing the rate of total kidney volume increase, while
      impacting the onset, severity, and progression of other important consequences of ADPKD.

      During the 3-week titration phase, tolvaptan or placebo was titrated in weekly intervals from
      lowest to highest tolerated levels given in split-dose regimens of 45/15 mg, 60/30 mg and
      90/30 mg orally upon awakening and approximately 9 hours later. As soon as a subject could
      not tolerate a given dose, the titration phase was over and the maintenance phase began at
      the dose level tolerated. The maintenance phase lasted to Month 36. Subjects were able to
      titrate down at any point during the study. Subjects were able to titrate up during the
      maintenance phase with Medical Monitor approval.
