      multimodal cortical regions during conceptual retrieval using electrocorticography.
      Participants will be patients undergoing awake temporal lobe craniotomies. During the surgery
      patients will have multiple high-density grids placed to simultaneously record activity in
      multiple areas while the patient is performing language tasks. Activity in each of these
      regions will be tested for timing differences and informational directionality to determine
      the temporal dynamics.
