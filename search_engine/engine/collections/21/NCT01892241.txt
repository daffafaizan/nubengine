      of pegasys treatment in chronic hepatitis B patients with spontaneous HBVDNA decline after
      acute exacerbation.Patients with spontaneous decline of HBV DNA(a decrease of HBV DNA levels
      of more than 2 log(10) IU/mL as compared to baseline before antiviral treatment) after acute
      exacerbation (ALT was 10-30ULN，TBIL was 2-20mg/ml，PTA>60%)were non-randomly divided into 3
      groups: group A, B and C. Before treatment, the patients were counselled on the advantages
      and disadvantages of taking peginterferon or nucleos(t)ide analogue, and the subsequential
      treatment were decided by themselves. Cases in group A receive 180µg of peginterferon alfa-2a
      (Pegasys,Roche) once weekly for 48 weeks. Group B and C were control group, cases in group B
      received an continual entecavir therapy(0.5 mg orally once daily) and those in group C didn't
      accept any antiviral regiment.
