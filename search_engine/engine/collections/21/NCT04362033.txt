      (volume-controlled mode with tidal volume = 8mL/Kg of PBW, PEEP = 8cmH2O and FiO2 = 60%,
      respiratory rate to maintain PaCO2 = 35 - 45 mmHg); hemodynamically monitored with VolumeView
      set in combination with EV1000 clinical platform and the display of volumetric parameters
      (Edwards Lifesciences, California, USA). Electrical impedance tomography monitoring (Enlight,
      Timpel, SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil) is performed with a pair of electrodes belt attached around the
      thorax at 4Th - 6Th intercostal space, and a flow sensor attached between the orotracheal
      tube and the Y connector from the ventilator.

      Before initiate the protocol, patients are submitted to a bolus of usual care doses of
      sedation and muscular blockage (Fentanyl, Midazolam and Cisatracurium).

      To assess fluid responsiveness patients will be submitted to two different maneuvers applied
      in a random way: Passive Leg Raising (PLR) ant PEEP increment (PEEP). And after these
      maneuvers patients will receive a bolus of 500 ml of Lactated Ringer's.

      Measurements are performed one minute after each of these conditions:

        -  Baseline: before both fluid responsiveness maneuvers, before and after Lactated Ringer
           infusion, patient is positioned in 450 semi-recumbent position;

        -  PLR: Fluid responsiveness maneuver which patient is positioned from 450 semi-recumbent
           position to dorsal decubitus and the legs are raised at 450;

        -  PEEP increment: Fluid responsiveness maneuver which consisted in increased the PEEP
           level 5 cmH2O above the mean airway pressure, patient is positioned in 450
           semi-recumbent position

        -  Infusion of 500 mL of Ringer's; 450 semi-recumbent position.

      Transpulmonary Thermodilution assessment are performed by the injection of 3 cold salines in
      bolus - the injection volume varied from 10 - 20mL according to the patient's actual weight
      and EIT assessment are performed by 1 injection of 10 mL of hypertonic saline at 7.5 - 10%
      according to the patient's actual weight.
