      several retrospective studies about conversion surgery have been introduced. The results of
      the studies showed around 30~40% of three-year survival rate in conversion surgery group.
      Eight institutions in Catholic University of Korea analyzed 419 stage IV GC patients, and
      they had divided into four groups: chemotherapy only, chemotherapy followed by gastrectomy,
      gastrectomy followed by chemotherapy, and best supportive care group. The group of
      gastrectomy followed by chemotherapy, which is similar with conversion surgery, showed 40% of
      three-year survival rate. However, the study included only small number of patients who were
      in conversion surgery group, and had several biases. Thus, we planned multi-national,
      multi-center phase II trial for conversion surgery in stage IV or unresectable GC.
