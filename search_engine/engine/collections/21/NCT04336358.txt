      safety, effectiveness and acceptability for women of early medical abortion performed through
      telemedicine, compared to standard care in South Africa. Standard care, in the Western Cape,
      includes face to face eligibility screening, counselling and information with a nurse or
      physician, as well as an ultrasound to confirm the gestational age of the pelvic exam. The
      intervention will include a pelvic exam and gestatonal age based on LMP assessment and
      uterine size by bimanual palpation. Eligibility screening, counselling and information will
      occur through an existing online telemedicine application, content and language-adapted to
      suit women in South Africa, and managed by a HPCSA certified doctor. The study is a
      non-inferiority study. Our hypothesis is that the intervention is not inferior to standard
      care with respect to safety, effectiveness and acceptability. The study is performed to
      provide an alternate model of abortion care to be applied in settings where abortion is in
      any way restricted and increase access to safe abortion. Importantly the study is planned for
      a context where abortion services are legal but restricted by stigma. South Africa therefore
      provides a uniquely suited setting for this study.
