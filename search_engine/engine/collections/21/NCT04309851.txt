      The case and control data sets were randomly divided into two parts, the training group (27
      case group/27 control group) and the test group (10 case group/10 control group) to prevent
      the use of the visuals in the training group for retesting. The testing data set was not seen
      by the system during the training phase.

      All 2943-by-1435 pixel images in the data set were resized to 971 by 474 pixels prior to
      training. All OPG images used include the whole dentitions. The training and test data sets
      were used to estimate and generate weight factors for the optimal CNN algorithm. An arbitrary
      sequence was generated using open-source Python programming (Python 3.6.1, Python Software
      Foundation, Wilmington, DE, USA, https://www.python.org/) language and OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas,
      and Matplotlib libraries. In this study, Tensorflow for model development was used to
      classify submerged primary molars. InceptionV3 architecture was used as transfer learning,
      and the transfer values were saved in the cache. Then, fully connected layer and softmax
      classifiers were combined to form the final model layers. The training was carried out using
      7000 steps with 16G RAM and a PC equipped with NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050.
