    
      APX005M-002 is an open-label Phase 1-2 study and comprises a dose-escalation portion (Phase
      1) followed by a Phase 2 tumor specific portion.

      Eligible subjects with non-small cell lung cancer or metastatic melanoma will receive
      intravenous APX005M in combination with nivolumab until disease progression, unacceptable
      toxicity or death, whichever occurs first.

      Study objectives include:

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose and the recommended phase 2 dose of APX005M when
           given in combination with nivolumab

        -  Evaluate safety of the APX005M and nivolumab combination

        -  Evaluate the objective response rate, duration of response and median PFS by RECIST 1.1
           in subjects with non-small cell lung cancer or metastatic melanoma receiving APX005M in
           combination with nivolumab

        -  Determine the PK of APX005M
