      fibrillation, atrial flutter, pre-excitation, ventricular tachycardia, , supraventricular
      tachycardia) and 150 control ECGs (100 sinus rhythm, 50 sinus tachycardia) using both the
      AliveCor Smartphone device and a 12-lead ECG. All 400 ECGs will then be read by 3 blinded
      reporters - a Consultant Electrophysiologist, a Consultant General Cardiologist and a General
      Practitioner. The output of the AliveCor automatic detection algorithm will also be recorded
      as a fourth reporter. The screening characteristics of all 4 reporters using the AliveCor
      device vs the definitive 12 lead ECG will be analysed and compared.
