      Hormone (GHRH) on cardiac structure and function in subjects aged 50 years and older with a
      diagnosis of congestive heart failure in a single blinded (to the subject) randomized
      treatment/placebo study design. They will receive 12 weeks of drug or placebo, 6 weeks of
      washout, and 12 weeks of placebo or drug- whichever they didn't receive in the first 12
      weeks. The hypotheses are: 1)normal aging is associated with evidence of declining
      somatotrophic activity exemplified by IGF-1 levels; 2) GHRH can raise levels of Growth
      hormone and IGF-1 in elderly individuals in a dose dependent fashion with minimal deleterious
      side effects; 3) GHRH will produce measurable increments in myocardial performance and
      structure and demonstrated growth of peripheral musculature; 4) the combination of these
      benefits will result in better quality of life due to the improvement of overall cardiac
      function.
