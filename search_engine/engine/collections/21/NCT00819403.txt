    
      1. To assess the ex vivo effects of ezetimibe/simvastatin (E/S) (Vytorin 10/40mg) and
           simvastatin (S) (Zocor 40mg) on platelet and inflammation biomarkers in patients with
           documented metabolic syndrome.

        2. To compare platelet-related effects including PAR-1 receptor inhibition of E/S with
           those of the established anti-platelet agents including aspirin, clopidogrel,
           intravenous and oral glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors.

        3. To determine whether the addition of ezetimibe will yield extra protection beyond lipid
           modulation in the reduction of inflammation and platelet activation.
