    
      This is a randomized, double-blind, two arm, parallel-group, vehicle-controlled, multi-center
      study of NB-001. The study is designed to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of NB-001 in
      subjects with RHL. Approximately 850 subjects who meet all eligibility criteria will be
      randomized in the study. Subjects will begin treatment as soon as they experience the onset
      of cold sore symptoms. Treatment will be applied 5 times daily, approximately 3-4 hours apart
      while awake. Treatment will continue until the investigator assesses the primary lesion
      complex as healed or a maximum of 4 days.

      Clinic visits will occur on a daily basis until the investigator determines that the primary
      lesion complex has healed or a maximum of 15 clinic visits. At daily clinic visits, the
      investigator will make efficacy assessments of the primary lesion complex; safety and
      tolerability assessments of NB-001 following topical administration will also be assessed
      daily. Subjects will make daily assessments of therapy.

      At the End of Study, the investigator will make a global assessment of therapy. The subject
      will make global assessments of therapy and social impact.
