      drugs which occur in different patient populations and to what extent they are consistent
      with those concentrations described in the literature.

      If the expectation is confirmed, that a significant heterogeneity in the plasma
      concentrations of these patients exists, the investigators will try to find influencing
      factors for this circumstance on the basis of routine clinical parameters (height, weight,
      renal function, concomitant medications, etc.).

      Ultimately, this project will identify substances with a high interindividual variability in
      plasma levels, where drug monitoring might be suggested.
