      good result. However, the treatment for proximal pole nonunion remains controversial. There
      are some patterns of pathoanatomy combined with scaphoid fracture, like SL ligament tears,
      which could not be easily identified or treated initially. The proximal pole nonunion was
      near SL joint. Therefore, proximal pole nonunion may result in DISI instability. Furthermore,
      proximal pole nonunion was identified as a poor prognostic factor in scaphoid nonunion.

      In the past 10 years, we have some different technique, like VBG, arthroscopic bone graft to
      achieve good results. Some studies revealed that significantly better SL stability was
      achieved with ARASL. We also used ARASL with BG to improve proximal pole union. However, it
      is not clear which method would be appropriate for proximal pole nonunion. We retrospectively
      investigated the functional outcome and radiological results after at least 2-year follow-up
      to clarify the surgical efficacy of these procedures.
