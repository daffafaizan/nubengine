        -  Determine the proportion of patients with potentially resectable mesothelioma of the
           pleura remaining operable after treatment with neoadjuvant cisplatin and gemcitabine.

        -  Determine the response rate and overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the tolerability of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the number of postoperative hospitalization days and occurrence and duration
           of surgical complications in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the quality of life of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Compare the proportion of patients who report psychological distress at 3 months after
           surgery vs at study registration.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive cisplatin IV on day 1 and gemcitabine IV on days 1, 8, and 15.
      Treatment repeats every 28 days for 3 courses. Within 6 weeks after completion of
      chemotherapy, patients undergo restaging by CT scan followed by surgical resection.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, day 1 of course 3, within 4 weeks after surgery, and
      then at 3 and 6 months.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 61 patients will be accrued for this study.
