    
      Patients undergoing pancreatic surgery for either chronic pancreatitis or known/suspected
      pancreatic cancer represent the study population for this clinical trial.

      Study subjects randomized to one of the ONS arms will be asked to consume the drink during
      the study intervention. Study visits immediately preoperative, and 1, 3, and 6 months
      following surgery will be in-person visits. If subjects are unable to return to our
      Institution for subsequent clinical care, these telephone interviews will be collected and
      acquisition of locally obtained laboratory tests will be attempted.

      Assessments performed during postoperative visits include:

        -  Vital signs and physical examination

        -  Blood samples

        -  Performance status and strength

        -  Quality of life measures

        -  Postoperative complications and hospital readmissions (if any)
