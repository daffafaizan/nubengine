      terminate all types of ventricular tachycardia (all VTs (FVT+VT)) when delivered in the right
      ventricle (RV) only versus both ventricles (BiV) resulting in a 10 % difference in favour of
      BIV ATP

      Secondary objectives:

        -  Compare efficacy of the first BiV and RV ATP (Burst, 8 pulses, 88 %) to terminate fast
           ventricular tachycardia (FVT)

        -  Compare efficacy of the first BiV and RV ATP (Burst, 8 pulses, 88 %) to terminate slow
           ventricular tachycardia (slow VT)

        -  Compare efficacy of BiV and RV ATP (all ATP therapies) to terminate slow ventricular
           tachycardia (slow VT)

        -  Determine the rate of both FVT and VT episodes which are accelerated or degenerates into
           VF
