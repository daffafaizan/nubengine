    
      We will include 25 type 1 diabetic patients from our outpatient clinic. They are already
      genotyped from another trial.

      Each patient goes through two cycles with hyperinsulinemic glucose clamp induced
      hypoglycemia. The study is double blinded, randomised and placebocontrolled so the patients
      receive both Candesartan and placebo but in different cycles.

      In each cycle patients will receive either Candesartan or placebo for 7 days. After 8 days
      patients undergo a hypoglycaemic clamp during which primary and secondary endpoints will be
      measured.

      In the hyperinsulinemic hypoglycaemic clamp the patients will undergo an adjustment period
      towards euglycaemia. A period of approximately 1 hour of euglycemia, an hour of hypoglycemia
      and a period of recovery towards euglycemia. In each of these glycemic states primary and
      secondary outcomes will be measured.
