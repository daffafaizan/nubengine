      9%-24%, and morbidity must be higher nowadays. For these women, Mild stimulation has been an
      important ovulation induction protocol. Clomiphene citrate(CC) and tamoxifen(TMX) are
      commonly used in mild stimulation protocol. It's reported that CC has adverse effect on
      growth of endrometrium and results in thin endrometrium(â‰¤7mm) which maybe affect pregnancy
      rate. However, TMX has estrogen-like effect on the endrometrium that may be helpful to
      increase endormetrial thickness. The reported results about comparing CC with TMX showed that
      they had similar ovulation rate. Prospective study is necessary to confirm whether TMX is
      superior to CC on the IVF outcome.
