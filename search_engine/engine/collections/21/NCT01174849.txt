      non-capsular H. influenzae (NCHi) and pneumococci. Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine has
      effectively reduced disease caused by the 7 serotypes. Rates of non-vaccine serotype otitis
      media (OM), particularly 19A is increasing, and NCHi continues to be a major pathogen in
      perforations. Parallels with pneumonia are highly probable in this population. Vaccines with
      expanded and early age protection are needed.

      In early 2009 GSK's pneumococcal H. influenzae protein D conjugate vaccine (PHiD-CV) was
      licensed in Australia. Compared to the current vaccine, 7PCV, this vaccine offers protection
      from pneumococcal serotypes 1, 5, 7F as well as NCHi (which is a primary pathogen of OM, and
      possibly pneumonia). However by 2010, a new generation of Wyeth's 7PCV, PCV13 will also be
      licensed in Australia. Compared to PHiD-CV this vaccine offers protection from additional
      serotypes 3, 6A and 19A, however it does not offer protection from NCHi infection. There is
      no empirical evidence to suggest that either vaccine will have superior clinical efficacy for
      otitis media or pneumonia in high-risk children. The novel combination strategy proposed for
      this trial has the potential to provide the best of both vaccines.
