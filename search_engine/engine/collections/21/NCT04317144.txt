      and physical impairments long time after the critical illness occurred. Today, nurse-led
      follow-up is used but the main focus is on patients with a ICU-stay for at least three days.
      This study evaluates ICU-survivors with a maximum ICU-stay for 72 hours.

      Participants are randomized to the web-based one year follow-up programme and no follow-up.
      Both group receive questionnaire 2, 6 and 12 month after the end of their intensive care
      stay.

      The web-based follow-up programme includes, short lectures that describes the intensive care
      e.g. hallucinations, memory loss and delirium. The programme also include short films that
      shows the medical equipment and how and why itÂ´s used. Regular contact with ICU-nurse to
      discuss any upcoming problems.
