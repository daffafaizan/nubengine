    
      The main objective of this prospective interventional pilot study is to demonstrate the
      ability of this technique to follow high intensity regimen recommendations, as mentioned
      above:

        -  3 ECP sessions (thawed or fresh) per week during 3 months for grade III to IV acute
           GVHD, then

        -  2 ECP sessions (thawed or fresh) per week during 3 months for grade II acute GVHD

        -  1 ECP session per week for chronic GVHD during 3 months

      The other objectives are:

        -  To describe the safety and efficacy of cryo ECP. Efficacy will be assessed with a
           composite criteria test, comporting 5 items, which will be compared for each patient
           with a paired cohort of historical patients treated in Nancy University Hospital since
           2010 (match will be made on type and grade of GVHD, and age under and over 18 year-old)

        -  To fully describe the biological consequences of cryopreservation of WBC before UVA
           irradiation: apoptosis rate and time, lymphocyte functional tests (lymphoblastic
           transformation test), cytokines release, number of lymphocytes, and monocytes at the
           time of reinjection, bacteriological tests, residual dim√©thylsulfoxyde (DMSO)
           quantification

        -  To demonstrate the decrease in red blood cells and platelets transfusion number, due to
           the sparing effect of cryo ECP on aphereses number.
