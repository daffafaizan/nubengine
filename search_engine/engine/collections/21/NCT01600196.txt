      more hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with portal venous thrombus (PVTT). However, the
      benefit of such surgery remains largely controversial. On one hand, many clinicians believe
      that surgical resection offers the only chance for long term survival. Many studies reported
      a median survival of 6-40 months after liver resection and thrombectomy, and some cases
      achieved long term survival.On the other hand, the strength of evidences arising from these
      studies was widely questioned because of their retrospective nature and study design. Most of
      them were single arm cohort study. A few studies used control groups consisted of patients
      with unresectable HCC and PVTT underwent transarterial chemoembolization. This led to obvious
      selection bias. Because patients with unresectable HCC and PVTT have a much poorer prognosis
      compared with resectable disease because of more widespread tumor focus and less residual
      liver, even if their baseline characters are comparable.
