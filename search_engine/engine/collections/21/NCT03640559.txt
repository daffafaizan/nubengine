      clinical study. After successful completion of screening procedures, patient underwent a
      planned laparoscopy. Randomization of patients into groups was performed on the day of
      surgery using envelops. The test drug or the placebo were used at the completion stage of
      surgery. Monitoring of patient on inpatient basis was performed for 6 days after completion
      of surgery. Discharge of patient from the hospital with no contraindications was possible on
      Day 7 of the study. In this case the follow-up of patient was performed on outpatient basis.
      Follow-up was performed for 4 weeks before Day 28 of the study. Study procedures aimed at
      evaluation of safety and tolerability of using the test drug or the placebo were identical in
      main and control groups.
