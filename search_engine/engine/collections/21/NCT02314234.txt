      preserving facial nerve during parotid surgery. In this setting, even a single dose of
      nondepolarizing muscle relaxant may lead to delayed and weakened electromyography (EMG)
      signal in facial nerve monitoring during parotid surgery. The aim of this study was to
      investigate the effectiveness of rapid reversal of rocuronium-induced neuromuscular block by
      sugammadex during IONM of facial nerve during parotid surgery
