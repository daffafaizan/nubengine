      random order, with conventional single-vision lenses and progressive addition lenses designed
      for handheld digital display devices (iPad). Basic ocular parameters were measured through a
      comprehensive eye examination at the baseline visit. Working distance and refractive shift
      were measured immediately after delivering the lenses and after one month of lens wear.
      Working distance were recorded with an automatic ultrasound sensor while the participants
      were playing a 30-minute video game. Refractive-error shift before and after playing the
      video game were measured with an open-field autorefractor in both eyes and averaged.
