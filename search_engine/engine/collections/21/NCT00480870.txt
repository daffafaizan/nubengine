      approved for Alzheimer disease, of which donepezil is the most frequently used. Multicenter
      studies have found little toxicity, and its side effects (diarrhea, nausea, vomiting,
      nightmares, among others) are mild and transient. According to the literature, cholinergic
      active drugs may be expected to affect REM (rapid eye movement) sleep. Another possible
      effect is related to respiratory parameters in patients with Alzheimer disease and
      obstructive sleep apnea. In fact, cholinergic activity influences the upper airway opening
      via central and peripheral mechanisms.

      Intervention: Patients will be administered donepezil or placebo. The study has a randomized,
      double-blind placebo-controlled design. Complete polysomnography with REM sleep EEG spectral
      analysis and ADAS-cog scoring will be performed at baseline and after 3 and 6 months.
