    
      Bass and Treble controls provide the CI recipient with access to the adjustment of low and
      high frequency sound balance, known as Bass and Treble respectively. The clinical study is
      designed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of recipient controlled Bass and Treble.

      Subjects will have access to the Bass and Treble controls during a 4 week take-home period,
      and will complete questionnaires and diaries to provide descriptive data on the Bass and
      Treble adjustments made during take home use, and the success of these adjustments.

      Pre and post intervention speech test results will be used to evaluate the effect of access
      to Bass and Treble controls on speech perception. The post intervention questionnaire will
      provide information on the overall ratings of the Bass and Treble controls.
