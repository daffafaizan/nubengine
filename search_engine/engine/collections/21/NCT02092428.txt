    
      This is a study to compare image quality between contrast and non-contrast cardiac MR and to
      evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of a cardiac MRI procedure in a patient population that
      includes both healthy volunteers and a study group of patients with known CAD who are
      scheduled for clinical coronary angiography within one month of signing informed consent.
      Both groups are eligible for a combination of imaging tests. Subjects may receive either a
      non-contrast MRI or a contrast-enhanced MRI depending upon their kidney function and study
      focus. Also based upon the focus of the study at the time of the scan and to improve image
      quality, a beta-blocker to lessen motion artifact in patients with higher heart rates may be
      administered or patients may be asked to undergo a stress test for comparison.This is a
      one-day research procedure. Studies are acquired from the approved Institutional Review Board
      #25881 Cedars-Sinai Biomedical Imaging Research Registry.
