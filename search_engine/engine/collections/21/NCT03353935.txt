      autonomic system.

      Before surgery and 3-12 months after the nerve-sparing surgical procedures, patients were
      assessed for urinary, sexual and fecal function, in order to evaluate whether sparing of the
      nerves during the intervention had a beneficial impact on post-operative pelvic function.
