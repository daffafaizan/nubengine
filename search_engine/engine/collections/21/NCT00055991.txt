        -  Determine whether bexarotene can modify immunophenotypic markers related to breast
           cancer progression in women at high genetic risk for breast cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Patients
      are stratified according to menopausal status (women with a uterus who have not had a
      menstrual period for more than 1 year vs any woman over 55 years old vs women 55 years and
      under without a uterus whose follicle-stimulating hormone is in the postmenopausal range).
      Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral bexarotene once daily on days 1-28.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo as in arm I. In both arms, treatment continues in
           the absence of unacceptable toxicity or elevation of triglycerides to greater than 800
           mg/dL. Patients undergo 2 breast biopsies in the same location on days 1 and 29.

      Patients are followed at 30 days.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 100 patients (50 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 4 years.
