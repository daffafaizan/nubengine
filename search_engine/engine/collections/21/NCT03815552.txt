      enrolling up to 15 pediatric subjects in two cohorts (5 subjects age 6-12 and 10 subjects age
      13-17) with diabetes mellitus for up to 180 days. Study will evaluate the system at home with
      comparison to SMBG with clinic check visits and downloading of stored data every 30 days.
      Subjects will have one Sensor inserted subcutaneous by trained Investigators. The System will
      be set to provide real-time glucose information, including alarms and alerts in the home
      settings. The system is for adjunctive use. All diabetes care decisions will be based on SMBG
      values rather than System CGM results.
