      trauma-informed services leading to a reduction of family violence, and a resultant increase
      in family stability, improved communication, and a healthy home environment for children in
      Latino families with co-occurring domestic violence (DV) and child abuse/neglect (CAN). The
      Administration for Children, Youth and Families (ACYF) funded project and evaluation will be
      layered onto the existing UC San Diego's NIH-funded R01 research (NIH R01 MH092950) on
      scale-up of SafeCare (SC) across the entire San Diego Child Welfare System. In the first
      phase of this project, the community and academic partners will collaborate to develop a
      detailed evaluation plan by collecting formative qualitative data via focus groups with
      active CW clients with domestic violence (DV) histories and community child welfare and DV
      service providers. The second phase of this project will begin with the implementation of
      SafeCare+ (SC+), an evidence-based training curriculum for parents referred for child
      maltreatment, coupled with the Healthy Relationships (HR) module for Latino families with
      co-occurring child maltreatment and domestic violence experiences. SafeCareÂ® (SC) has been
      shown to be widely accepted among the Latino community and the HR module has been
      specifically adapted for and successfully utilized with Latino populations. As part of the
      expansion of the original research study, 80 clients who will be recruited into the existing
      study will also be randomly assigned to receive the additional HR module.
