      at least one dose of olaparib treatment before study enrolment in real world practice in
      approved tumor types.The recruited patients will be followed up according to standard
      clinical practice. They will be tracked up to 30 days after discontinuation of olaparib
      treatment, or 8 months after enrolment if treatment continues.

      The primary objective of this study is to describe the safety and tolerability of olaparib in
      Chinese patients by assessing the incidence, seriousness, causality, severity and action
      taken (interruption/dose reduction/discontinuation) of all AEs (including adverse events of
      special interest [AESIs]).
