    
      This was a prospective, experimental, randomized, controlled study of 308 consecutive
      patients who underwent primary THA from December 2013 to March 2014. 256 volunteers remained
      in the study, 128 were treated 15 mg/kg intravenous bolus of TXA and 128 did not receive the
      medication. Participants were followed up at 3 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, and then
      annually after surgery.

      The use of TXA resulted in lesser reduction in hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, reduced
      blood loss, blood transfusion rate, volume of blood products, and stay length even in risk
      factor patients.

      TXA protects risk factor patients against intra and postoperative bleeding and reduces
      transfusion rates.
