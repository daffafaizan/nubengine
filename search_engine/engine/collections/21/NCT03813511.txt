      patients with severe valvular regurgitation and the impact of a therapy with the
      minimal-invasive Clip technique.

      Therefore, the investigators want to include consecutive patients with unknown
      sleep-associated respiratory distress syndrome and, in addition, as a study-specific
      achievement, the investigators want to obtain the quality of life and specific symptoms of
      the patients by using established questionnaires. After three month of post-interventional
      care, the patients will get a post-interventional check-up in our cardiological outpatient
      clinic, where the course of sleep-associated respiratory distress syndrome and the actual
      quality of life and specific symptoms will be documented by using a cardiorespiratory
      polygraphy and the same questionnaires.

      The entire hospital stay, including possible post-interventional complications, will be
      documented for this study from the patients' medical records. The routine examinations
      (laboratory values, ECG, 6-minute walk test, pulmonary function examinations, spiroergometry,
      transthoracic / -oesophageal echocardiography, etc.) shall also be recorded in the database
      of this study.

      The plan is to include 100 evaluable patients with complete follow-up and the associated test
      results. For this purpose, a screening of 150 patients is expected to be required.
