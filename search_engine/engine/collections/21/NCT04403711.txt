      especially in the day-case setting. It can be accompanied by moderate to severe postoperative
      pain, which can delay return to normal daily activities or lead to the development of chronic
      pain. Chronic pain after hernia repair has a reported prevalence ranging between 0% and 43%
      with both nociceptive and neuropathic features. The transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block
      is an effective regional anesthetic technique to reduce postoperative pain intensity, time to
      first rescue anesthetic administration and opioid demand after upper and lower abdominal
      surgery. Dexmedetomidine is a selective Î±2-adrenergic agonist with analgesic properties that
      has been shown to prolong local anesthetic action when used as an adjunct to local anesthetic
      solutions in neuraxial anesthesia. The aim of this prospective, double-blind placebo
      controlled randomized study will be to evaluate the analgesic efficacy of ultrasound-guided
      TAP block where local anesthetic is supplemented by dexmedetomidine in patients undergoing
      unilateral elective inguinal hernia repair with the Lichtenstein technique under general
      anesthesia.
