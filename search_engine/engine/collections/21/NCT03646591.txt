      however, there was not any large scale RCT to support it until German oncologist introduced a
      novel regimen(FLOT regimen) in 2017. FLOT regimen was prescribed for German patients and
      various questions are raised by experts from Eastern countries. As the FLOT regimen was
      officially included in NCCN 2018 guidelines, the investigator used standard protocol of FLOT
      regimen on Chinese gastric cancer patients. Safety and feasibility were assessed carefully to
      provide basic data for further large scale studies in China.
