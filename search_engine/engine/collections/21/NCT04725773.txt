      testing protocol in chronically implanted PD DBS patients. We hypothesize that apraxia
      testing in the DBS ON and OFF states will be a safe and well-tolerated testing protocol. We
      also hypothesize that DBS will affect the severity of limb-kinetic, ideomotor and ideational
      apraxia in PD patients. This will set the foundation for larger prospective trials to further
      characterize apraxia in relation to DBS and whether or not DBS programming can modulate this
      phenomenon.

      In this study, we will recruit 60 PD patients with chronic, stable DBS of either the
      subthalamic nucleus (STN) or globus pallidus interna (GPi). Both unilateral and bilateral DBS
      patients are eligible for this study. For this study, "chronic, stable DBS" will be defined
      as patients who have had at least 6 months of optimization programming at the University of
      Florida. The subjects will be recruited to the Fixel clinic for a 1-day study visit in the
      medication ON state. The patients will undergo testing for limb-kinetic, ideomotor and
      ideational apraxia of both upper extremities in the DBS ON state at home therapeutic
      settings.
