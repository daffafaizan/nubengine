      with octreotide and to octreotide alone in patients with relapsed indolent non-Hodgkin's
      lymphoma. II. Determine serum insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and IGF-1 binding protein
      levels before and after treatment in this patient population. III. Determine somatostatin
      receptor subtypes in lymphoma biopsy samples from selected patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive fludarabine IV over 10-30 minutes on days 1-5. Patients not
      currently receiving octreotide, receive a test dose of octreotide subcutaneously on day 1
      during course 1 only and then receive octreotide intramuscularly monthly on day 1. Treatment
      repeats every 28 days for 4-6 courses. Patients then receive octreotide alone for 6-8
      courses. Some patients may then receive another 12 courses of octreotide alone, for a total
      of 2 years of treatment. Patients are followed every 3 months for 5 years or until disease
      progression.
