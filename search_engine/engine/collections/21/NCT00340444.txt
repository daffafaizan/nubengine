      designed to investigate the existence of genetic regions that are believed to confer a risk
      for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which consists of two subtypes, Crohn's disease (CD)
      and ulcerative colitis (UC). The project will derive its study population, consisting of IBD
      physician confirmed affected probands with their family members, from the Johns Hopkins
      University, the University of Chicago, and the University of Pittsburgh. The project will
      consist of multiple parts. The first part is a reanalysis of existing genome wide linkage
      data from IBD families with 377 genotyped microsatellite marker data that incorporates
      covariate data into the analysis, with the goal of identifying new and refining previously
      identified regions of linkage. Eventually this may be extended to include new families typed
      for genome wide scan markers. The second part of the project consists of the fine mapping of
      the IBD3 locus (HLA region on chromosome 6p), which has been shown to have evidence of
      linkage in UC patients. Fifty-two microsatellite markers spanning the affected child trios in
      an effort to identify potential marker alleles that may be associated with UC, using the IBD3
      locus will be genotyped in a study population consisting of 240 UC father-mother-affected
      child trios in an effort to identify potential marker alleles that may be associated with UC,
      using the transmission disequilibrium test, and to identify potential haplotypes that may
      confer an increased risk of developing UC, using a likelihood-based approach where a moving
      window of adjacent markers will be tested for excessive transmission. Additional candidate
      genes within IBD3 will be examined, and polymorphisms will also be tested for potential
      significant associations. Eventually this second part may be extended to fine mapping and
      association analysis of other candidate genes and/or candidate regions.
