    
      The PROPSER pilot is a randomized, open-label pilot study comparing prophylactic low
      molecular weight heparin (LMWH) to saline placebo. The PROSPER pilot study will assess the
      feasibility of conducting a full trial as measured by the number of subjects recruited per
      center per month. In addition, clinical data will be collected to determine an estimate of
      the primary outcome event rate (symptomatic VTE or asymptomatic proximal deep vein thrombosis
      (DVT) and major bleeding event rate for the full trial in LMWH and control groups. If our
      pilot results indicate that no substantial changes are needed to the study design, we will
      include the pilot data in the primary and secondary outcome analyses for the full trial (i.e.
      a "Vanguard trial" or internal pilot trial).

      Eligible consenting women at risk of postpartum thrombosis will be randomized within 36 hours
      after delivery of the placenta and will be equally allocated to 2 trial arms, either the
      treatment group: prophylactic-dose LMWH, subcutaneously once daily for 10 days (+/-3 days),
      or the control group.

      At 10 days (+/- 3 days), all women will have a study visit to assess for study outcomes,
      including bilateral leg ultrasound screening for VTE and a D-dimer test. A final telephone
      follow-up will occur at 90 days for outcome assessment of subsequent VTE, bleeding or other
      adverse events.
