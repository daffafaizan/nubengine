    
      This study will consist of a Screening Visit, a 7-day Run-in Period, a 16-week Treatment
      Period, and a Follow-up Visit (approximately 7-10 days after the last dose of study drug).
      Informed consent will be obtained prior to performing any study-specific procedures.

      The Screening Visit will occur within 7 to 28 days prior to randomization to assess
      eligibility.

      Day 1 of the Treatment Period will be defined as the day of the administration of the first
      dose of study drug. If patients continue to meet all inclusion and no exclusion criteria at
      the end of the 7-day Run-in Period, they will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either
      placebo or CR845 tablets at a dose of 1.0 mg orally BID for 16 weeks.
