      BOTOX injected into the forehead per FDA-approved procedures. Participants will then undergo
      a second MRI scan session 2-3 weeks later, after the BOTOX has taken maximal effect.
      Examining fMRI of the brainstem and the functional connectivity of the brainstem and
      connections to cortex, may provide additional insight into the effects of BOTOX on neurologic
      and psychiatric disorders.
