      and periapical radiograph of the teeth designated for micro-osteoperforation treatment is to
      be taken. Prior to the intervention the subjects will swish 5cc of chlorhexidine for one
      minute, twice. Micro-osteoperforation, PROPELâ„¢, is conducted under local or topical
      anesthesia AFTER the subject is banded and bonded. The procedure will be randomized to either
      the left or right side in each subject. Following the procedure, Chlorhexidine rinses are to
      begin twice a day for a week.

      The subjects will be advised to take Tylenol only in case of significant pain. Subjects will
      be seen four to six weeks after completion of treatment for the first follow-up. Subjects
      will be followed up with a telephone consult 24 hours after micro-osteoperforation is
      performed. They will be asked if any pain medication was taken after being dismissed from the
      research center and if so, they will be asked the name and dose of medication taken.

      Study will conclude at the 6 month follow up visit or when space on the treating side is
      closed.
