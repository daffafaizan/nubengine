      To determine the size of the RAS tracts as measured by MRI tractography. Specifically, the
      investigators will be measuring the fiber tracts that project through the posterior thalamus.
      The RAS is involved in mediating arousal and consciousness. The size of fiber tracts will be
      measured prior to initiating treatment and near the time of discharge from the rehabilitation
      hospital or at approximately ninety-days. It is hypothesized that treatment will result in an
      increase in the size of these fiber tracts.

      As a pilot study, the investigators will be determining the feasibility of recruiting and
      retaining patients in this type of study. This will allow the clarification and understanding
      of the technical standards for MRI tractography related to the assessment of the reticular
      activating system.

      Secondary Aim:

      To determine and monitor changes in function following acquired brain injury as measured by
      the Disability Rating Scale (DRS) score. The DRS score will be obtained prior to initiating
      treatment and at termination of the study. It is hypothesized that treatment with amantadine
      in addition to standard medical treatment, will be associated with an improvement in
      function.
