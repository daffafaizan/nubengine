      hours, followed by the treatment phase of 15 ± 3 days. During the treatment phase, subjects
      will be randomized to either test, reference of placebo treatments (3:3:1) in a double-blind
      manner in an outpatient setting. Once eligibility is confirmed, randomization will occur at
      visit 2 (baseline, Day 1) i.e. initiation of treatment phase. The treatment phase will be 15
      ± 3 days in duration wherein subject will receive treatment with investigational product
      (either test, reference or placebo) on Day 1 or baseline (visit 2). Efficacy will be
      evaluated at Day 15. Safety and tolerability will be evaluated based upon AEs and patient
      self-assessments and self-assessments collected during follow-up visits.
