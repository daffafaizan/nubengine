      procedure called Heller myotomy.

      The treatment in our study, called endoscopic myotomy (also known as peroral endoscopic
      myotomy - POEM) is different from standard surgery (Heller myotomy) because it is less
      invasive, is less likely to cause reflux, and usually requires shorter operative times with
      less loss of blood during the surgery. Although POEM has been adopted worldwide and has
      proven to be successful, the experience in Canada is very limited to date.
