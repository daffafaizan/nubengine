      community in the University of Illinois Cancer Center's catchment area by conducting an
      experimental intervention to test the effectiveness of Fecal immunochemical test (FIT) tests
      dispensed by community stakeholders (community-dispensed) versus FIT tests dispensed using
      standard of care procedures by a clinic dispensed FIT test return rates. This study will
      follow American Cancer Society (ACS) guidelines for FIT testing, with the South Shore
      community area assigned to the intervention group (community-dispensed). CRC screening within
      the Mile Square Englewood Health Center, using standard of care, will serve as our control
      group to use for comparison (clinic-dispensed). The intervention will include a multifaceted
      approach to health education and community engagement focused on CRC led by a team of trusted
      health champions (community leaders, a barber, a hair salon, and community health workers) in
      the South Shore community area.
