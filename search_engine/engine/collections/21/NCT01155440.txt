      on the early postoperative physical activity recovery of patients scheduled for laparoscopic
      colorectal resection.

      The study focuses on patients with colorectal disease, which receive the laparoscopic
      (assisted) surgical approach.

      It is hypothesized that in those patients receiving perioperative and post-operative
      intravenous lidocaine, bowel function recovery will be faster, probably as a result of a
      significant opioid sparing, less pain and attenuated inflammatory response.
