      However, its impact on the soluble markers of endothelial function has not been investigated
      yet. This study was conducted to assess the effect of daily avanafil on the erectile function
      and endothelial markers' serum level. In this work we recruited males with erectile
      dysfunction and other diseases commonly associated with endothelial dysfunction. The
      investigators randomly treated patients with daily oral avanafil and the other patients with
      placebo. The investigators measured the International Index of Erectile Function -5 score
      (IIEF- 5) and the serum levels of markers of endothelial function at baseline and treatment.
