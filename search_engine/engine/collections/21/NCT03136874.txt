      a psychosocial approach with two groups: donors of gametes without children, and donors who
      have already procreated. Two questionnaires will be used in this survey. The first aims to
      study the donors' socio-personal characteristics and motivations. The latter studies donors'
      personality traits.

      The second approach is qualitative by a clinical case study. It is a psycho-dynamic approach,
      taking into consideration the donor (men and women), with all their subjectivity, their
      personal and family history and their representations.
