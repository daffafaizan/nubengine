      Salmonella, including Salmonella Paratyphi A. In the United States about 400 cases occur each
      year, and 75% of these are acquired while traveling internationally. Typhoid fever is still
      common in the developing world, where it affects about 21.5 million persons each year.Besides
      being a first step towards a possible oral paratyphoid A vaccine for the prevention of
      enteric fever, this Phase 1 trial will shed light on the suitability of the guaBA,clpX
      strategy for attenuating non-typhoidal Salmonella, also an emerging pathogens of public
      health importance. This randomized, double-blinded, Phase I study in healthy is designed to
      investigate the safety, clinical tolerability, and immunogenicity in a dose escalating
      fashion of a live, oral, attenuated S. Paratyphi A at four dose levels (10^6, 10^7, 10^8, and
      10^9 CFU). We hypothesize that S. Paratyphi A strains harboring mutations in guaBA and clpX
      will be well tolerated in the full dose range tested and that a single inoculation at the
      highest dose will elicit vigorous humoral and cell-mediated immune responses in humans.
