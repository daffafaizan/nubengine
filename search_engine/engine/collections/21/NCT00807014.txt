      characterized by the formation of comedones, papules, pustules, nodules, cysts, maculae and
      scars, generally located on the face, chest and back. Acne pathogenesis is recognized as
      multifactorial.

      Acne vulgaris is the most common dermatological disorder. It affects approximately 85%
      individuals at some point in their lives, generally between 12 and 24 years of age. Although
      acne is prevalent within this age range, it can persist for many years and its long-term
      physical and psychological implications can be significant.

      There are several medicinal products used to treat acne. However, the therapeutic challenge
      remains, therefore it is essential to continue investigating effective strategies for the
      treatment of this disease.
