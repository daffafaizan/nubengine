      children), of blood from your arm. White blood cells from the sample will be used as a source
      of DNA for genetic testing. We will use the DNA to try to identify mutations (changes) in one
      of the genes that can cause primary hyperoxaluria. This will be done by comparing it with the
      structure of these genes in normal individuals, patients with primary hyperoxaluria, and
      family members of primary hyperoxaluria patients. In family members of primary hyperoxaluria
      patients, a 24 hr urine test may also be collected.
