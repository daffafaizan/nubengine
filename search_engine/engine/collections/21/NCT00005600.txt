        -  Compare high vacuum drainage vs low vacuum drainage vs simple tube drainage in patients
           undergoing axillary surgery for stage I or II breast cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study.

      Patients undergo axillary dissection, then are randomized to one of three axillary drainage
      systems.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive high vacuum drainage.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive low vacuum drainage.

        -  Arm III: Patients receive simple tube drainage (no vacuum). All drains are removed when
           daily volumes are below 30 mL or at 5 days after surgery, regardless of drain volume.

      Patients are followed at day 10 and at 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 200 patients will be accrued for this study.
