      Post stroke aphasia. Routine speech therapy aims to improve comprehension and verbal skills
      and also develop functional communication skills through augmentative Alternative
      communication devices. Disorders of communication, including aphasia (mainly post stroke)
      caused by the left hemisphere brain damage, is a major community health issue. Aphasia is a
      language disorder occurring mainly as a result of stroke. It is an acquired impairment of
      language that weakens people's ability of comprehension and expression, it does not show any
      affect to intellect ability. The verbal expressive skills management programme (VESMP) is the
      software which developed augmented management for patients to enhance verbal expressive
      skills for patients with severe Broca's aphasia from different geographic areas.
