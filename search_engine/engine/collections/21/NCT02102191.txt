      for 5 minutes. On day 2 the subject will be ask to smoke for 5 minutes the other kind of
      cigarette.

      Exhaled Nitric Oxide will be measured in a sitting position with a nose clip using an
      analyzer equipped with a software program. The patient will be instructed to inhale as deeply
      as possible to total lung capacity through a filter mouthpiece and consecutively exhale at a
      mouth fl ow rate of 50 mL/s for 10 s. Three consecutive trials will be performed with a 30-s
      interval.

      Dynamic Lung Volumes: Flows and lung volumes will be measured in the sitting position, a
      spirometry system (heated pneumotach, with the highest FEV 1 recorded in line with pulmonary
      guidelines. Spirometry will be measured according to the recommendations of the American
      Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society task force guidelines. FEV 1, FVC, FEV 1 %,
      peak expiratory fl ow (PEF), and maximal expiratory fl ow (MEF) at 25%, 50%, and 75% of vital
      capacity will be measured. Each maneuver will be repeated for at least three technically
      acceptable forced expiratory fl ow curves.
