      currently being used in ongoing scale-up clinical trials. Current evidence suggests that the
      program can increase aspects of physical function among adults. The present study aims to
      test whether the same program can be used among adolescents with cerebral palsy. Study
      findings will be used to examine whether the videos require modifications prior to being
      implemented in a future scale-up trial for adolescents people with cerebral palsy.
