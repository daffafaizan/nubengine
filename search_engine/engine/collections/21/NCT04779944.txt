    
      Throughout the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, many HCWs have worked in high-pressure environments.
      Moreover, they may have been exposed to trauma and/or faced moral dilemmas relating to
      challenges in the delivery of high-quality care, possibly due to a lack of experience or
      equipment, or as a result of low staffing levels. These unfavorable circumstances and
      exposure risk to infection are likely to increase the risk of mental health disorders such as
      post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or depression, other anxiety disorders, substance
      misuse and suicide In the present study, This study aimed to assess the psychological state
      of HCWs who were facing challenges of SARS-CoV-2pandemic comparing them to non medical staff
      group based on use of the Hamilton Anxiety and Depression Rating Scale.
