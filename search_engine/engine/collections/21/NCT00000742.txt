      of action from nucleoside analogs such as AZT. U-87201E is a non-nucleoside reverse
      transcriptase (RT) inhibitor that has demonstrated activity against HIV-1; however, an
      emerging characteristic of non-nucleoside RT inhibitors is the development of rapid
      resistance to HIV isolates. Whether this resistance can be prevented in the presence of
      nucleoside analogs such as AZT and ddI has yet to be determined.

      Part I: Five male patients enter a pharmacokinetic concentration-controlled trial of U-87201E
      plus zidovudine at the University of Rochester site only. A target plasma concentration range
      at trough for U-87201E will be determined. Pharmacokinetic monitoring continues for 7 days or
      until the desired dose regimen has been determined. The five patients may be eligible to
      continue in Part II of the study to complete a total of 12 weeks of therapy.

      Part II: At least 10 male patients (all sites eligible) in addition to the five patients from
      Part I receive doses of U-87201E as determined by Part I and AZT at the same dose as in Part
      I. Therapy is administered for 12 weeks. Patients with no decreased viral susceptibility to
      U-87201E after 6 weeks may be offered an extension to 24 or more weeks of therapy. Patients
      are followed weekly for 8 weeks and every other week thereafter until the end of the study.

      Part III: At least eight patients who have received 24 weeks of U-87201E/AZT have ddI added
      to the regimen for 12 additional weeks.
