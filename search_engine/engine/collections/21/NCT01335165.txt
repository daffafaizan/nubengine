    
      This is an open-label, single-dose, dose-escalation study to assess the safety, tolerability,
      PK, PD, and immunogenicity of TT30 given as an IV infusion and as a SC injection in subjects
      with PNH or evidence of circulating PNH cells.

      Eligible subjects with PNH will be vaccinated with meningococcal vaccine at least two weeks
      prior to dosing (if not previously vaccinated or if revaccination is required).

      On study day 1, the subject will receive the single dose of TT30 as an IV infusion over 60
      minutes or as a SC injection, and be followed with additional study evaluations over the next
      59 days.
