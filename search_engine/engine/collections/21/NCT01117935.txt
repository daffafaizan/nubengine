      I. To demonstrate that patients can safely receive IMRT teletherapy using the proposed IMRT
      fractionation schedule without experiencing a treatment limiting toxicity.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess treatment efficacy through the surrogate measures of PSA nadir and biochemical
      failure-free survival.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo hypofractionated intensity modulated radiotherapy once daily, 5
      days a week, for 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Patients with intermediate- and high-risk disease may also receive concurrent and adjuvant or
      long-term androgen deprivation therapy for up to 36 months. After completion of study
      treatment, patients are followed at 4-6 weeks, every 4 months for 3 years, every 6 months for
      2 years, and then annually until year 5.
