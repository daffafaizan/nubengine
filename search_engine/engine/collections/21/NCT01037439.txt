      disorders (SRRD), such as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) or a specific form of central sleep
      apnea, Cheyne-Stokes breathing (CSB, periodic breathing). However there is also a significant
      incidence of complex nocturnal breathing disorders, with both obstructive and central
      components. Sleep-related breathing disorders of this kind cause decreases in arterial oxygen
      saturation through brief hypopneas and apneas. Disturbed breathing also causes the patient to
      wake frequently during the night (arousals), usually during the hyperventilatory phase of
      CSB. Repeated arousals cause fragmentation of sleep, and therefore a deep sleep deficit. This
      leads to increased sleepiness during the day and impaired cognitive performance.

      Previous studies have shown that Cheyne-Stokes breathing can be treated effectively with
      adaptive servoventilation. An enhancement to the routinely used algorithm (AutoSet CS2) has
      been created which allows the algorithm to differentiate between obstructive events and
      Cheyne-Stokes breathing, and better respond to apneas and hypopneas to eliminate the
      sleep-related breathing disorder and normalise breathing during sleep.
