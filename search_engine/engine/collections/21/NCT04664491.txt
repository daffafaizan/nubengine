      economic and disease burden. An effective and standardized condition management strategy is
      urgently needed to reduce the incidence of acute exacerbation, improve the quality of
      patients' life, and avoid premature death caused by COPD. At present, management of COPD is
      mainly conducted in community-level health institutions. Implementing standardized management
      of COPD in primary care will help improve the level of COPD prevention and treatment in
      China.

      We will carry out a multicenter, adjudicator-blinded, parallel, cluster randomized clinical
      trial, involving 96 secondary hospitals across the country. Each hospital enrolls 36 patients
      with COPD. The hospitals will be randomly allocated into standardized management (SM) group
      and control group. In SM group, standardized COPD management based-on guidelines will be
      delivered to patients, including inhaler use for initial and maintenance therapy, regular
      follow-up, long-term monitoring of lung function and respiratory symptoms, patient education,
      and favorable lifestyle changes. In control group, patients will receive routine care as
      usual. In both groups, moderate and severe exacerbations will be collected within 12 months
      follow-up after randomization. Group difference in annual exacerbation rate will be examined
      to evaluate the effect of standardized management of COPD on acute exacerbation of COPD in
      primary care.
