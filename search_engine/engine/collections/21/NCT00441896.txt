    
      Male or female, 4 to 24 months of age (inclusive) with a diagnosis of IS with a 24 hour video
      EEG (vEEG) recording confirming the diagnosis and previously treated with 3 or fewer
      antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are eligible for the study. The subject is able to continue
      treatment with concomitant AEDs (no more than 2; adrenocorticotropic hormone [ACTH],
      corticosteroids, felbamate, and vigabatrin are not allowed concomitantly). A ketogenic diet
      is permitted if it can be maintained for the duration of the study.

      There will be a total of three weekly 24-hr video EEGs (baseline, end of weeks 1 and 2 of
      treatment). Dosing titration begins the day after each video EEG during the inpatient stay.
      All subjects will be receiving ganaxolone the day after the second video EEG.

      A Data Monitoring Board (DMB) will determine whether successive cohorts of subjects can be
      dosed at an increased dose level; up to a maximum of 6 cohorts.
