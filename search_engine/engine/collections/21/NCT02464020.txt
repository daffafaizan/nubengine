      intra and extrahepatic ducts of unknown etiology that predominately occurs in people with
      Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). One hypothesis is that altered microbiome (bacteria in the
      gut) in people with IBD are responsible for the inflammation in the liver seen in PSC. Bile
      acids (BAs) represent a unique mechanism of communication between the host and intestinal
      microbiome and the liver. Synthesized in the liver, bile acids are metabolized by intestinal
      bacteria hydroxylases to secondary BAs which then re-enter the portal circulation. Altered
      metabolism of BAs has been associated with gallstones and colorectal cancer and is
      hypothesized to play a role in the inflammatory response of certain disease such as IBD and
      PSC.

      IBD has been associated with impairment of bile acid (BA) metabolism. In addition BAs play a
      role in regulating bacterial growth of the intestine and thus have an effect on the integrity
      of the intestinal mucosa, which is an essential component of IBD. Perturbations in this
      system could increase bacterial translocation into the portal system due to loss of
      protective mucosal factors or bacterial overgrowth.

      The overall goal of this study is to assess the changes in BAs metabolism following
      administration of oral vancomycin. The investigators will also describe the relationship of
      the intestinal microbiome and BA metabolism in PSC/IBD.
