      schizophrenia and preventing for its relapse; clozapine is better than some other atypical
      antipsychotics. However, in clinical uses, clozapine often could induce hypersalivation, it
      is not only influencing patient's appearance, also deteriorating sleeping quality which could
      deter patient discontinuing to take medicine.

      In previous researches, Suo Quan Wan and Wu Lin San had been proven effective for
      hypersalivation and no significant side-effects, nevertheless, it still lack of systematical
      scientific trial reports. The ingredients of Suo Quan Wan are Wu Yao, San Yao and Yi Zhi Ren;
      the ingredients of Wu Lin San are Gui Zhi, Fu Ling, Zhu Ling, Ze Xie and Bai Ju, both have
      bi-directional regulatory functions for body fluid and saliva.

      The goal of this research is hoping to combine traditional Chinese medicine medication and
      find out how to solve clozapine-induced hypersalivation, also reduce side-effect, medication
      compliance, improving life quality, improving social-function and reducing neopathy.
