      completion of the study for these subjects, pharmacokinetic and safety data were analyzed to
      determine the target dose for the remaining subjects (either 8, 10 or 12 mg/kg/day).
      Depending on the selected target dose, four additional age-based cohorts of subjects were to
      be enrolled. LCM was increased 2 mg/kg/day per week until the target dose or maximum dose
      able to be tolerated was achieved.
