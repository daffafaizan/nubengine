    
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center Phase 3 study to
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of Pyridorin 300 mg BID (twice daily, every 12 hours) in
      subjects with nephropathy due to type 2 diabetes mellitus. In this study, nephropathy is
      defined as a Serum Creatinine (SCr) >= 1.3 (≥1.25) mg/dL (111 umol/L) for female and >=1.5
      (≥1.45) mg/dL (128 umol/L) for male subjects and a 24-hour urine collection
      protein/creatinine ration (PCR) >=1200 mg/g (136 mg/mmol), and if applicable for PS Phase, at
      Visit 1S or 1.1S a 24-urine collection PCR ≥600 mg/g (68 mg/mmol). Subjects must have a
      baseline SCr < 3.0 mg/dL (265 umol/L) and must be on previously established standard of care
      at screening.
