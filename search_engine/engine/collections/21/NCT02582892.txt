      implants outcomes.

      Low serum levels of Vitamin D is considered as a risk factor, not only for low mineral bone
      density but also in other metabolic pathways such as those involved in immune response and
      chronic inflammatory diseases.

      There are few studies demonstrating the role that vitamin D deficiency in the
      etiopathogenesis of oral diseases and the consequences in Dental Implants.

      Dentists have not yet well understood the importance of a good bone metabolism response for a
      successful bone regeneration and osseointegration of implants.

      An insufficient bone response can not guarantee the necessary stability of the implants
      placed in it, has been one of the biggest problems of implantology.

      Thus, the aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of Systemic vitamin D supplementation
      in menopausal women cadidates for dental implants.
