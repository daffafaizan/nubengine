      markers on the drugs.

      During the post-operative period, the patients will be seen back in surgery clinic on
      post-operative days 3, 7 and 10. During the first two visits, the subject will receive
      routine post-operative care with no difference from patients not enrolled in the study. This
      includes routine sets of photographs. The participant will then return for a third
      post-operative visit lasting under ten minutes only for study photos using the left and right
      "three-quarters" view. Again, the subject will hold a measurement marker so length
      measurements can be made, and this marker will be held under the ear to not interfere with
      the routine cosmetic analysis of the photographs. The digital photographs will be used to
      analyze the bruising for the study. The ratio was calculated by dividing the number of pixels
      of bruised area over number of pixels of standard area.
