      to 2002. The initial presentations, systemic diseases, smoking habits, clinical stages,
      Gleason scores, pathological stages, treatments, and outcome were recorded. Post-hoc
      questionnaires were completed with OPD visits, admission visits, telephone interviews and
      mails. The questionnaires included the family histories of prostate cancer, colon cancer,
      breast cancer, hepatoma and so on. If patients is passed away, the first degree relatives
      will fill the vacant position. The prevalence of family histories of prostate cancers in
      these patients was determined. The associations of family histories and clinical
      presentations were analyzed. Besides, the characteristics of patients with and without
      responses were discussed.
