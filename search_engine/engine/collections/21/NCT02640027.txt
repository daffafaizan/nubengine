      in which children who present to the investigators institution with a non-displaced (Type 1)
      SCHF or an occult elbow injury (as determined by the presence of a posterior fat pad sign)
      will receive a long-arm soft, fiberglass cast (reinforced with a posterior slab) (3MTD
      "ScotchcastTM" Soft Cast Casting Tape) with the elbow flexed to 90-100 degrees and with
      forearm in neutral rotation and will be randomized to one of two groups: Patients in Group A
      will receive their follow-up care entirely at the investigators institution, while patients
      in Group B will receive some of the follow-up care using a telemedicine tool. Written
      informed consent will be obtained from the parents of each patient. For patients between the
      ages of seven and ten years, child assents will also be obtained.

      Randomization will be accomplished by using sealed envelopes, sequentially numbered on the
      outside, in which a random sequence of A or B will be concealed. Sample size estimation was
      based on the outcome variable of percent average total satisfaction score. The investigators
      own previous studies at OIC presented a standard deviation of the satisfaction score of 15%.
      Clinically significant differences in satisfaction scores were on the order of 10 to 15%. In
      the present study, 25 patients in each group will be included, for a total of 50 patients.
      With this sample size, the investigators will be able to detect differences of 12% in
      satisfaction score with alpha of 0.05 and 80% power.
