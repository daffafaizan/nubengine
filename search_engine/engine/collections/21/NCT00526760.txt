      administration is limited within 24 hours. However, there is a strong demand from the medical
      specialists for continued administration of dexmedetomidine in excess of 24 hours in the
      medical practice because a large number of patients require sedation for more than 24 hours
      in ICU. To meet such clinical demand, it was planned to conduct a phase III long-term
      administration study of dexmedetomidine to obtain the approval on the infusion of
      dexmedetomidine for more than 24 hours.
