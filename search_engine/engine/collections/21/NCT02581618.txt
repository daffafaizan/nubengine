      occurs showing myocardial necrosis. And it has been shown that myocardial necrosis due to
      coronary interventions has also adverse effects on long term prognosis.

      Beneficial effects of of ischemic preconditioning in elective PCI and in coronary artery
      bypass surgery has been shown in several studies. In most of the trials 3 cycles of ischemia
      was performed, but this is time consuming and it's not suitable to apply it, in ad-hoc
      interventions. The investigators found one study showing that one cycle will also be enough
      to prevent troponin elevation after elective PCI.

      The investigators aim was also to show that one cycle preconditioning performed just before
      coronary intervention will also be useful in preventing myocardial necrosis due to elective
      PCI.
