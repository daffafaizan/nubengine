      Department of Orthodontics at the University of Aleppo Dental School then subjects who meet
      the inclusion criteria will be included in this trial.

      An information sheet will be given to each possible candidate. Then consent forms will be
      obtained.

      All patients will receive both rebonding procedures by applying split-mouth design. Each
      patient will be asked to select an opaque sealed envelope from a box with 20 ones. Ten
      envelopes will Include instructions for applying sandblasting prior to acid-etching on the
      right upper premolars and acid-etching alone on the left upper premolars. In contrast, the
      other ten envelopes will include opposite instructions.

      A total sample of 80 premolars will be obtained to study the clinical failure rates of the
      two rebonding procedures.

      The 80 premolars will be randomly divided into two groups:

        -  The first group in which the enamel will be prepared using sandblasting prior to
           acid-etching.

        -  The second group in which the enamel will be prepared using acid-etching alone.
