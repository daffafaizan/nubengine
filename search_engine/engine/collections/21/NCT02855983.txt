      with chronic plantar fasciitis to improve pain, quality of life, and thickness of the fascia.

      Rationale: Perforating fat injections have been shown to improve multiple scar and fibrotic
      conditions such as burn scar contracture, breast radiation injury, and Dupuytren's
      contracture of the hand. (5-7) It is thought that the perforations allow expansion of the
      tissues, and filling them with fat allows for a regenerative healing process, rather than an
      inflammatory scar healing process.

      Hypothesis: Perforating fat injections into the chronically thickened plantar fascia is a
      safe method to improve pain, quality of life, and reduce tissue thickness.

      Aim 2: Correlate intrinsic fat properties of lipoaspirate to improvement in function and
      plantar fascia thickness.

      Rationale: Adipose tissue contains adipose derived stem cells. Various growth factors
      released from the stem cells may have a local effect on soft tissues (ie. VEGF). (8) These
      stem cells are thought to promote regenerative healing, rather than scar formation and may
      ultimately improve the thickness of the plantar fascia. (9-12) Hypothesis: Intrinsic fat
      properties of lipoaspirate (adipose stem cell characteristics) are closely correlated to the
      improvements in quality of life and thickness of the plantar fascia.
