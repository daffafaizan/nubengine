      for smokers with elevated emotional distress as an adjunct to individual smoking cessation
      counseling (SCT) and transdermal nicotine patch (NRT). In this open trial, all participants
      received the active intervention. Findings will be used to refine the protocol in advance of
      a subsequent Phase III randomized clinical trial.
