      prevention of acute allograft lung rejection when used in addition to Neoral, corticosteroids
      and azathioprine. Acute rejection episodes will be evaluated during the first 6 months
      post-transplant. Bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) will be evaluated at the end of 1
      year after transplant and at additional follow-up visits at 2 and 3 years after transplant.
