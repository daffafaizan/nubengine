           undergoing radiation therapy, participants will be randomized into one of two study
           groups. Half of the participants will receive armodafinil and the other half will
           receive pills with no medicine (placebo). Neither the participant or the study doctor
           will know what group they are in.

        -  Participants will be given a study medication-dosing calendar and will take either the
           study drug or placebo orally once a day for 8 weeks. The dose will be adjusted on days
           8,22 or 43, depending upon the level of fatigue. Treatment will begin within 10 days
           from the radiation start date.

        -  Participants will be evaluated via documented clinician telephone call and
           self-administered questionnaires on days 1, 8, 22, 43 and 57.
