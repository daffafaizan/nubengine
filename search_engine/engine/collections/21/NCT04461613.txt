    
      Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) is a condition that potentially affects daily life function
      including physical activity. Currently, there is no specific treatment. To prevent physical
      deconditioning, physical activity recommended. Furthermore, other studies have found the
      benefit of being physically active, including people with neuromuscular disorders (NMD). .

      Apart from the physical activity in a rehabilitation center, physical activity also needs to
      be maintained at the community level in people's everyday life. To measure physical activity
      level in the community, we need an instrument that is designed for doing so. A questionnaire
      can be used to collect information about type of activity, activity duration and intensity.
      The instruments available so far to measure physical activity at the community level are not
      specifically adapted to persons with CMT. Therefore, this study will focus on revising the
      questionnaire based on the inputs from persons with CMT themselves. Furthermore, the revised
      questionnaire will be compared with the original one in addition to yet another instrument.
