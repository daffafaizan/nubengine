      priority, this has proven difficult. After decades of efforts to reduce exposure, 42 million
      people in Bangladesh remain exposed to As above 10 Âµg/L, the WHO guideline for As in drinking
      water. Risk for arsenic-related health outcomes lingers for decades after exposure has been
      reduced. Innovative strategies to lower arsenic exposure and and reduce its potential adverse
      health effects of As are needed.
