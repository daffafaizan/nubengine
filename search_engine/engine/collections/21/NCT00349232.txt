      in a rising prevalence of overweight and obesity in children and adolescents. Ten per cent of
      the world's school-aged children are estimated to have excess body fat. Overweight and
      obesity during childhood and adolescence tend to continue into adulthood, increasing the
      likelihood of a range of impaired health conditions including cardiovascular diseases,
      diabetes and some cancers. School-based interventions have been proposed to prevent or treat
      obesity and have been described as a promising approach to reducing obesity among youth.
      First the extent and the characteristics of the problem have to be assessed for different
      types of education.

      Comparison(s): the prevalence of overweight and obesity in special primary education will be
      compared to the prevalence in regular primary education. In special primary education, obese
      and overweight children will be randomised into a experimentel group (6 months of lifestyle
      intervention including diet and physical activity) and a control group (6 months normal
      treatment, if any, e.g. exercises for motor skills).
