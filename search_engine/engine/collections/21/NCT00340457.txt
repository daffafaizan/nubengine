      In particular, rates among African Americans have risen more sharply than any other cancer
      site. We propose to conduct a population-based case-control study of renal cell cancer two
      areas of the U.S. with a high proportion of African American residents: Detroit, Michigan
      (Wayne State University), and Chicago, Illinois (University of Illinois at Chicago). Westat,
      Inc. is the coordinating center. Participants are being recruited over a period of four
      years. A total of 2,100 cases (1,400 Caucasian Americans and 700 African Americans) and 2,800
      controls (1,400 each of Caucasian and African Americans) will be recruited. In-person
      interviews are conducted with cases and controls to elicit information on demographic
      background and history of exposures. A 40 ml blood sample and a buccal cell sample are
      collected from cases and controls for genetic analyses. Tumor tissue blocks will be collected
      from as many cases as possible for assays of tumor mutations. Diagnostic slides will be
      collected for standardized reclassification of tumors into clear cell, papillary, and other
      histologic subtypes. Medical records for all cases will be reviewed for presenting symptoms,
      tumor stage, size and grade, and methods leading to diagnosis of renal cell cancer. Telephone
      interviews are conducted with the nest-of-kin of eligible cases who died before we could
      interview them. Permission is being sought from the next-of-kin to assess the case's medical
      records and obtain tumor tissue samples.
