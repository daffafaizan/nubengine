      intervention study to examine three specific aims:

      Aim 1: Characterize the dynamic pain experience, activity, and cognitive response after TKA
      and determine patterns of recovery in these domains

      Aim 2: Test whether gabapentin alters time course of recovery after TKA in a manner dependent
      on its interaction with pre-drug pupil diameter and preferred style in the
      catastrophizing-optimism dimension

      Aim 3: Test whether gabapentin increases pupil diameter in patients undergoing TKA who are on
      high dose opioids preoperatively and to examine whether opioid use moderates the associations
      in Aim 1

      Primary Hypothesis: Novel variance beyond established associations in recovery from pain
      following TKA surgery is accounted for by the interaction between pupil diameter and
      Cognitive-Affective (C-A) state, and this interaction predicts efficacy of gabapentin to
      speed recovery.

      Key secondary hypotheses: Disability, impulsivity, and attentional deficits recover after TKA
      surgery follow a log of time pattern, and are predicted by C-A state and its interaction with
      pupil diameter. Gabapentin increases resting pupil diameter in patients scheduled for TKA who
      are receiving high doses of opioids.
