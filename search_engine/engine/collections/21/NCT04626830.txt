      in terms of treatment adherence and symptom management.

      Objective/Hipothesis: The purpose of this study is to explore the effectiveness of a mobile
      application on treatment adherence and symptom management in patients using OAA. The
      following hypotheses (H) will teste in this study:

      H0a: A mobile application developed for patients using OAA has not increased treatment
      adherence.

      H1a: A mobile application developed for patients using OAA has increased treatment adherence.

      H0b: A mobile application developed for patients using OAA has not decreased the frequency
      and severity of symptoms.

      H1b: A mobile application developed for patients using OAA has decreased the frequency and
      severity of symptoms.

      Study Design: The investigators will recruit and randomly assign 100 patients from the two
      cancer care sites who have recently been prescribed oral anticancer agents to receive either
      the mobile app intervention or standard care. Participants will be stratified by age and
      anticancer treatment ( i.e. simple and complex) regimen. Patients will be follow 6 months.
      Medication adherence, symptom severity will serve as primary outcomes.
