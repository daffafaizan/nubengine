    
      This phase II trial is a single-arm, non-randomized and single-center clinical study.

      It is estimated that 60 patients who met the study criteria will be enrolled in PUMCH and
      treated with axitinib plus toripalimab. The investigators will follow up and collect
      subjects' data each month to evaluate the efficacy and safety of treatment, including overall
      survival and time to progression, until disease progression or death. Histopathology and
      multi-omics data analysis will be used to explore potential biomarkers of treatment response.

      Study Type: Interventional. Masking: Open Label.
