      approximately 3% of all pregnancies and is associated with one-third of all preterm births
      (Mercer, 2003). While there are multiple possible etiologies of PPROM, intra-amniotic
      infection has been implicated as a major contributor, especially at early gestational ages
      where fetal and neonatal adverse sequelae are frequent (Yoon, et al. 2000). Micro-organisms
      are recovered from the amniotic fluid obtained by trans-abdominal amniocentesis in 25-40% of
      women at the time of presentation with PPROM (Simhan and Canavan 2005).

      Significant risks to the fetus following PPROM include both complications related to
      prematurity and to infection or inflammation (ACOG Practice Bulletin 2007). Complications
      related to prematurity include respiratory distress, intraventricular hemorrhage, and
      necrotizing enterocolitis. IAI, both clinically apparent and occult, is an important and
      potentially preventable cause of cerebral white matter injury and cerebral palsy. Ideally, an
      early diagnosis of IAI in the setting of PPROM is important to allow timely treatment and
      intervention. Amniocentesis is successful from 40 - 72% of the time with PPROM (Garite, 1982,
      Blackwell and Berry, 1999). Despite the accuracy for determining infection and the
      feasibility of amniocentesis, the vast majority of clinicians are reluctant and/or unwilling
      to perform this procedure in this clinical setting (Capeless and Mead, (1987). There is
      therefore a critical need for a noninvasive test to identify patients with IAI and PPROM.
      Timely identification of these sub-clinically infected patients is critical in designing
      rationale and efficacious treatment strategies that may reduce the fetal and neonatal
      sequelae associated with PPROM.
