      patients with intensive care. Adequate spectrum and appropriate doses are the keys to
      achieving the therapeutic goal. Despite broad consensus on the spectrum and timing of
      antimicrobial therapy, antibiotic use varies according to various parameters including
      choice, dose, method of administration, duration of antibiotic therapy and de-escalation. an
      empirical attitude.

      Therapeutic de-escalation is considered essential for the use of antibiotics and is now
      clearly established by different consensus. However, routine de-escalation has recently been
      questioned in a randomized, controlled study that did not demonstrate non-inferiority of
      de-escalation with an increase in the number of days of antibiotic therapy associated with an
      increased number of days. superinfection.

      The components of the de-escalation described in the literature, are based on the reduction
      of the number of antibiotics, the strict observance of the spectrum of the antibiotic, the
      reduction of use of the antibiotic, the stopping of any inappropriate antibiotic treatment (
      lack of in vitro activity).

      De-escalation can be considered in different ways; there are significant variations between
      hospitals, countries, teams. A large European multicenter cohort is needed.

      The main objective of this study is to describe empiric antibiotic therapy in intensive care
      and the modalities of de-escalation (rate of de-escalation, incidence of mortality, length of
      stay in intensive care unit, relapse, rate of superinfection)
