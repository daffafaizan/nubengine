      neurological intensive care unit (NICU) is essential, as delayed treatment can aggravate
      their clinical situation and worsen the outcome. In this study in intensive care patients
      with severe brain injury due to malignant middle cerebral artery (MCA) infarction,
      subarachnoidal hemorrhage (SAH) or intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) with suspected status
      epilepticus in the surface EEG the hybrid catheter Dialytrode will be implanted in the
      cortical brain tissue by neurosurgeons for short time continuous bedside multimodal
      neuro-monitoring. Dialytrode combines a microdialysis catheter and depth EEG probe. Ten
      subjects will be monitored by Dialytrode and an additional (intracranial pressure (ICP)
      probe. Subjects with an clinical indication of an external ventricular drain (EVD) or
      cerebral microdialysis alone serve as control. The monitoring period with the device is
      limited to the microdialysis phase with a maximum of 28 days. Subjects will be followed up
      for 7 days after end of intracerebral monitoring.
