      province, China. In early January, a novel betacoronavirus forming another clade within the
      subgenus sarbecovirus, now named SARS-CoV-2, was identified as the culprit of this disease
      currently being identified as "Coronavirus Disease 2019" (COVID-19) by WHO.

      Coronavirus was found to not only target the patient's lungs, but also multiple organs.
      Around 2-33% of COVID-19 patients developed gastrointestinal symptoms. Studies have shown
      that SAR-CoV-2 was found in patient's feces, suggesting that the virus can spread through
      feces. In our previous study, stool samples from 15 patients with COVID-19 were analysed.
      Depleted symbionts and gut dysbiosis were noted even after patients were detected negative of
      SARS-CoV-2. A series of microbiota were correlated inversely with the disease severity and
      virus load. Gut microbiota could play a role in modulating host immune response and
      potentially influence disease severity and outcomes.

      In July 2020, there are more than 15 million confirmed cases globally with 620 thousand
      deaths. Currently, there are more than 2000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Hong Kong. The
      investigators are uncertain about the impact of synbiotic on patients with COVID-19. However,
      a therapeutic strategy aiming at investigating the gut Imicrobiota of patients with COVID-9
      who take synbiotic or not, leading to lesser progression to severe disease, less hospital
      stay and improved quality of life.
