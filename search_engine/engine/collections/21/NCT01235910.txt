      93% at 5 years post-transplant. Post-cardiac transplant hypertension is due to multiple
      factors such as use of cyclosporine, chronic kidney disease, and denervation. Hypertension in
      this population is difficult to treat, and most patients require therapy with multiple
      antihypertensive agents in order to achieve adequate blood pressure control. Aliskiren, a
      direct renin inhibitor, is a novel antihypertensive agent with a unique mechanism of action
      and potent blood pressure-lowering effects. As such, aliskiren is an attractive treatment
      option for post-cardiac transplant hypertension. This study will characterize the
      pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction profile, pharmacodynamics, and safety of aliskiren 75
      mg daily (low-dose) and 150 mg daily, when given in combination with cyclosporine, in cardiac
      transplant patients.
