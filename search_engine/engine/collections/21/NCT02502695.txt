      will help in collecting data in an organized fashion, which will help the investigators learn
      more about the details of the workup performed prior to the surgery, during the surgery,
      peri-operative management and early follow-up. The investigators hope that this database will
      help to determine a common guideline to perform VATS lobectomy or segmentectomy. By creating
      a common guideline for future treatment of VATS patients, the investigators predict the
      efficiency of the process will increase significantly without decreasing, and perhaps even
      improving, the quality of the procedure.
