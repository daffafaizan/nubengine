      and are the preferred initial treatment approach in patients with ER+, HER2- metastatic
      breast cancer. Unfortunately, resistance to endocrine therapies eventually develops in the
      metastatic setting and metastatic breast cancer remains an incurable disease. Endocrine
      resistance may develop as a result of alterations in estrogen signaling and metabolism
      pathways, which may be modulated by gut bacteria. In addition, genomic profiling of archival
      tissues and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in ER+ breast cancer has identified multiple
      somatic molecular alterations that may mediate response to endocrine therapies.

      This study is designed to identify markers of endocrine resistance in ctDNA and the gut
      microbiome in patients with ER+ HER2- metastatic breast cancer.
