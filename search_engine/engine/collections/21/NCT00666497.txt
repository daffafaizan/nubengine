    
      This randomized, 3-arm Phase 2 study will compare the safety and efficacy of single-agent
      azacitidine (currently 1 of 3 approved treatments for myelodysplastic syndrome [MDS]) to that
      of single-agent MGCD0103 and to that of combination therapy with MGCD0103 and azacitidine in
      elderly patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) or intermediate-2 (Int-2) or high-risk
      MDS, for whom no standard of care exists. The goal of the study is to determine which of the
      3 treatment arms are worthy of further investigation in a subsequent Phase 3 study of elderly
      subjects with AML or Int-2 or high-risk MDS.
