      venous obstructive disease. Deep venous obstruction can develop in cases of (iliac) vein
      compression syndromes (e.g. May-Thurner syndrome) or in cases of post-thrombotic syndrome. In
      patients with both significant complaints (objectively measured) and venous obstruction
      objectified on imaging (duplex ultrasonography, magnetic resonance venography, CT-venography)
      stenting is indicated.

      In cases of extensive post-thrombotic damage to the veins of the lower extremity
      endophlebectomy (surgical desobstruction) of the common femoral vein can be warranted. This
      operation is generally combined with the creation of an arteriovenous fistula.

      Data of patients treated in our tertiary medical centre are entered in a prospective digital
      database, and continuously updated.
