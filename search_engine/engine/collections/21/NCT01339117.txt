      children have belly discomfort frequently while others rarely have this problem. There have
      been very few studies to test treatments for recurrent stomach discomfort in children.
      Recently, studies in adults with recurrent stomach discomfort suggest that diet changes may
      help. Currently, we do not know if these same diets will work in children with the same
      problem.

      In this study, two different diets will be provided (delivered) for two days with at least 5
      days in between each provided diet. The child's symptoms will be recorded over the two days
      of each diet. Children will be asked to capture samples of their breath during the last day
      of the each two day delivered diet. Stool samples will also be collected.
