    
      This is a pilot study designed to investigate the dynamic changes in the intestinal
      microbiome that occur during the course of kidney transplantation, liver transplantation,
      allogeneic HSCs and mesenchymal stem cells transplantation. Four patient cohorts will be
      followed. Cohort A: patients receiving kidney transplantation. Cohort B: patients receiving
      hematopoietic stem cells transplantation. Cohort C: patients receiving mesenchymal stem cells
      transplantation. Cohort D: patients receiving liver transplantation. Included participants
      are defined as patients with at least three analyzable stool samples including a baseline
      sample before the transplantation.
