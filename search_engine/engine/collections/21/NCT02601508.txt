      tracheal intubation and to improve surgical conditions. In an adequately anesthetized and
      monitored patient, the presence of one or two responses in the train-of-four (TOF) pattern
      normally indicates sufficient relaxation for most surgical procedures in general practices.
      It has been called moderate neuromuscular blockade (mNMB) condition. Nowadays, laparoscopic
      surgeries have expanded impressively into various areas of surgeries, both in scope and
      volume. If any hypothetical advantages of deep neuromuscular blockade (dNMB) during
      laparoscopic surgery turned out to be realized in practice with sufficient supporting
      evidence, it would become an important anesthetic option for better patient outcomes.
