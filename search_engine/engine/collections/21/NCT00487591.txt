      (Week 0), after a 5-week diet lead-in/baseline period, subjects meeting all entry criteria
      will be randomized to one of two double-blind treatment sequences, simvastatin/Omacor first
      or simvastatin/placebo first. Each treatment period consists of 6 weeks. After randomization,
      subjects will self-administer the study drugs once a day in the evening.
