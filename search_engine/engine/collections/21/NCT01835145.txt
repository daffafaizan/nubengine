      I. Compare the progression-free survival rate at 4 months (PFS4) of patients with ocular
      melanoma treated with cabozantinib-s-malate (cabozantinib) or temozolomide (or dacarbazine).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Estimate the distribution of progression-free survival (PFS) times. II. Estimate the
      distribution of overall survival (OS) times. III. Estimate the confirmed response rate as
      determined by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria.

      IV. Assess the safety of these agents by examining the toxicity profile. V. Correlate the
      response of MET molecular status.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive cabozantinib-s-malate orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28.
      Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive temozolomide PO daily on days 1-5. Courses repeat every 28 days in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. If temozolomide is not
      available, patients receive dacarbazine intravenously (IV) over 15-60 minutes on day 1.
      Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 12 weeks for 2 years.
