      diagnostic testing among women referred for prenatal genetic counseling, and the predictors
      and decisional consequences of such ambivalence. Women seen at six different U.S. prenatal
      clinics for genetic counseling at increased risk for carrying a fetus with trisomy 21 [N=240]
      will be asked to complete a questionnaire on three occasions: prior to counseling;
      immediately after counseling, and later by telephone. These data will be used to describe the
      extent to which a sample of U.S. women referred for prenatal counseling based upon maternal
      age or results of a screening test are ambivalent about prenatal testing and might benefit
      from interventions aimed at improving the quality of decision-making.
