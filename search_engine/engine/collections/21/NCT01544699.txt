    
      tDCS will be used in chronic stroke patients to improve a variety of functions such as motor
      functions with superior or inferior limb.

      tDCS will be applied in a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomised fashion. Behavioural
      data will be collected before and after tDCS, as well as brain functional imaging data.
