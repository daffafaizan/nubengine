      post-operative hours. This pain is greatly increased by mobilization (respiratory
      physiotherapy) and leads to the consumption of morphine.

      Appropriate analgesia, along with a reduction in morphine consumption are important factors
      in reducing morbidity after cardiac surgery and allow better postoperative rehabilitation.

      Recently, the concept of multimodal analgesia has become established, which corresponds to
      ensuring optimal analgesia through the use of non-morphine drugs associated with locoregional
      analgesia.

      During cardiac surgery, Paravertebral block (TPVB) technique is the first line of reference
      in our establishment. Lately, a new approach of blocking the intercostal nerves called
      Erector Spinae Plane block (ESP) has been discovered. It is a technique that seems simpler
      and safer than TPVB.

      Until now, the analgesic efficacy of the ESP block compared to TPVB after cardiac surgery by
      sternotomy has never been studied.
