      biospecimen repository and associated clinical database to be used as a resource for dystonia
      and related disease research. Across sites, the investigators hope to enroll at least 5,000
      adult patients.

      Subjects of this study will be asked to complete a neurological exam which will be video
      recorded, complete some questionnaires, and donate a blood sample. A study visit will take
      between 45 minutes and 1 hour. All subjects will be asked to return every 1, 2, 3, or 4 years
      for a one hour follow-up visit. People may participate in this study without agreeing to
      participate in the follow-up visits.
