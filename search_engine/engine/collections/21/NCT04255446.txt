    
      Cohort A: This study is a pilot study with four study visits (Screening, Baseline, week 13
      and week 26) to generate data to characterise the tidal breathing patterns and parameters
      with Thora3Diâ„¢. Subjects will have a screening visit within 0 to 14 days prior to the first
      study visit. For each study visit, subjects will be seen in the clinical research facility
      and have two 5-minute SLP measurements (at rest and on exertion). The SLP measurement should
      be performed prior to standard lung function tests with minimal impact on clinical time and
      not change to hospital attendance. Also, each visit subjects will be asked to report
      concomitant medications and adverse events, and fill several questionnaires forms as outlined
      in the SOAs.

      Cohort B: Healthy subjects will have only one visit for this study. After signing the
      informed consent form, subjects will undergo two 5-minutes SLP measurements (at rest and on
      exertion).
