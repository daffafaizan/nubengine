      I. To determine the rate and severity of gastrointestinal (GI) graft versus host disease
      (GVHD) in patients assigned to, and compliant with, a gluten free diet (GFD) during initial
      transplant hospitalization.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the tolerance of, and compliance with, a GFD in patients undergoing
      allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (allo-SCT).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo a gluten free diet for 30 days during initial hospitalization for allo-SCT,
      from the time of admission to discharge.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months.
