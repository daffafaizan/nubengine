      /β-cell-stimulating and glucose lowering effects via bioactive peptides generated during its
      gastrointestinal digestion. These bioactive peptides stimulate the release of GLP-1, serve as
      endogenous inhibitors of DPP-4 and cause inhibitory activity against α-glucosidase activity,
      which might be an additional mechanism accounting for the glucose lowering effects of Whey.

      In the investigators previous study, the acute administration with Whey protein resulted in
      postprandial insulinotropic and glucose lowering effects in type 2 diabetic subjects. This
      was associated with increased postprandial response of the total-GLP-1 and of intact-GLP-1,
      suggesting that the peptides generated from Whey protein may have dual beneficial effects
      (increasing incretin production and decreasing incretin degradation by DPP-4) on glycemia
      regulation in subjects with type 2 diabetes.

      Addition of Whey protein to the meal, significantly decreased PPG in healthy and in type 2
      diabetic subjects and there are also clinical evidence in non-diabetics individuals, that
      acute and chronic administration of Whey protein has antihypertensive activity.

      The effect of chronic administration of Whey protein on HbA1c and PPG have not been examined
      previously in type 2 diabetics.
