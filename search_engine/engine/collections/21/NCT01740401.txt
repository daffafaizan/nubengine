      anti-tumor immunity. Efficacy of CTLA-4 blockade as a single agent has been shown in melanoma
      53. It has been hypothesized that anti-CTLA-4 antibody might deplete Treg cells 54, inducing
      autoimmunity. However, patients receiving Ipilimumab have not shown a decrease in Treg number
      or function in peripheral blood 55.

      This trial will answer the question if the combination of Anti-CTLA 4 (following a well
      established regimen of Ipilimumab) and Cyclophosphamide (given at immunomodulatory doses)
      will result in antitumor activity in patients with metastatic melanoma due to synergistic
      immunomodulating effects by overcoming tolerance.
