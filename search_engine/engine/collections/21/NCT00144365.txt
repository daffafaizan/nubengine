      delivered through health facilities by clinically qualified staff and b) home-based care in
      which lay workers, i.e. non-medically qualified people, play a major role in the ART delivery
      and clients are followed up at health facilities less frequently. The primary objective is to
      measure the effects of these strategies on plasma HIV viral load. We will also examine the
      effects on treatment failure, disease progression, survival, adherence, family member HIV
      testing, sexual behavior, and cost-effectiveness.

      The trial is conducted with The AIDS Support Organization (TASO) clinic in Jinja, Uganda.
      Randomization is conducted through geographic clusters, defined using sub-counties in the
      district, and stratified by distance from fixed health facilities, and urban/rural. Just over
      800 participants, living in 40 clusters, will be recruited over a period of 3-6 months and
      followed-up over a period of 3 years.
