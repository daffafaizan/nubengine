      either placebo (PLA) or milk protein isolate (PRO, 80% casein-20% whey) throughout recovery
      following two matches performed three days apart. On match days, players will receive a dose
      immediately after the match (PLA vs PRO: 25g of protein) and then at 3h (PLA vs PRO: 30g of
      protein) and 6h (PLA vs PRO: 25g of protein) post-match. On each day of the remaining days,
      players will consume a single dose of PLA or PRO (20g of protein) with breakfast. All players
      will participate in regular in-season training following matches. Field activity during both
      matches and daily practices will be monitored using GPS devices. Heart rate will be
      continuously recorded during each match and training session. Blood samples will be collected
      at baseline as well as 2 hours after the first match, daily for three days after the first
      match, 2 hours after the second match and daily for 3 days after the second match.
      Performance (isokinetic strength, 20-m speed, repeated sprint ability) and muscle soreness
      will be assessed at baseline daily for 3 days after both matches. Muscle biopsies from vastus
      lateralis will be collected at baseline and one day after each match.
