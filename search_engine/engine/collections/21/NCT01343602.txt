      clusters. After written consent from the patients, the therapists are randomly assigned to
      treat either the intervention or the control group. Blinded external assessors evaluate the
      patients using standardized outcome measures before and after the intervention, and six
      months later. The two coprimary endpoint assessments of arm and hand function as
      prerequisites for participation (defined as equal involvement in activities of daily living)
      are quality of arm and hand use and arm and hand function. Assessments are made four weeks
      post-treatment and relativized to baseline performance. Changes in primary outcomes are
      analyzed with mixed models, which consider the hierarchical structure of the data, adjusted
      to the baseline measurements and sex. The primary analysis compares the two randomized
      groups, with respect to the adjusted averages for each of the two coprimary endpoints. To
      keep an overall significance level of 5%, the two endpoints are tested at the significance
      level of 5% each in hierarchical order.
