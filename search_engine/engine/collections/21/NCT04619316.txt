    
      This is a prospective interventional study testing the hypothesis that the inhibition of MEK
      can restore iodine incorporation in BRAF wild type (WT) and a combined inhibition of BRAF and
      MEK can restore iodine incorporation in BRAFV600E mutant (MUT), radioiodine-refractory (RAIR)
      thyroid cancer. Patients with proven iodine negative tumor lesion(s) will be included in this
      study. Patients will then receive Trametinib (WT-group) or Dabrafenib and Trametinib
      combination-therapy (MUT-group) for approximately 3 weeks, after which a Thyrogen-stimulated
      123I SPECT imaging will be performed. For patients whose tumor(s) demonstrate sufficient
      iodine incorporation in the post drug treatment 123I SPECT imaging, a treatment according to
      guidelines for iodine positive lesions will be performed. The follow up of the patients will
      be conducted as standard of care.
