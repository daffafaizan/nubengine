      and leads to complications that are common and chronic on the one hand (such as impaired
      urinary concentrating ability), and those that are rare and uniformly fatal on the other
      (such as renal medullary carcinoma) This steady adverse renal sequelae shortens the average
      lifespan of patients with SCD.

      Proteinuria and a reduced glomerular filtration rate are risk factors associated with
      increased mortality among those patients with approximately 16-18% of overall mortality in
      this patient group is due to kidney disease.

      Once end stage renal disease is reached, the mortality of patients who are on haemodialysis
      and have SCD is increased severalfold relative to the mortality of patients who are on
      haemodialysis but do not have SCD.

      Thus,although the average lifespan of patients with SCD has increased during recent decades
      owing to improved management of complications outside the kidney,kidney disease contributes
      substantially to the still increased mortality in SCD.
