      experimental group received VR application in the preoperative period for 10 minutes. Anxiety
      level was assessed with the Anxiety Specific to Surgery Questionnaire (ASSQ) and measured
      with physiological responses of anxiety such as systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic
      blood pressure (DBP), heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR) and peripheral oxygen saturation
      (SpO2) before and after VR application.
