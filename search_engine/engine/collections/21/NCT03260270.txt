    
      High incidence of silent VTE before surgery seems attributable to the high incidence of VTE
      after surgery in ovarian cancer .

      The incidence rate of DVT is about 10% to 40% in medical or general surgical patients without
      prophylaxis .With prophylaxis, the postoperative incidence of VTE was 1.14% in women with
      gynecological disease, and 0.7% in patients undergoing laparoscopic gynecological surgery,
      0.3% in patients undergoing urogynecological surgery, and 4% in gynecological cancer
      patients, respectively. Most of published studies enrolled only symptomatic patients with
      DVT, whereas asymptomatic patients could be easily neglected under the absence of effective
      detection. In fact, approximately 50% of DVT patients are silent, so the actual incidence of
      postoperative DVT might be higher than reported . The asymptomatic DVT has been confirmed to
      increase the development of post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS).

      The essence of any surveillance strategy would be the identification of DVT in the
      expectation that anticoagulation at the presymptomatic stage would prevent fatal pulmonary
      embolism .

      A number of imaging modalities are currently available to evaluate deep venous system in a
      comprehensive manner allowing correct assessment of presence of thrombosis . Color Doppler
      ultrasound has become the primary non invasive diagnostic method for DVT.

      All patients are going to be examined by color Doppler ultrasound and by direct MDCT
      venography .
