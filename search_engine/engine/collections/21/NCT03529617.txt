    
      This phase IV, open label, non-randomized, monocenter pharmacokinetic study will be carried
      out in critically ill and non-critically ill (hematology) patients receiving multiple dose
      treatment with L-AmB.

      The pharmacokinetic exposure to liposomal amphotericin B in plasma, urine, BAL and ascitic
      fluid will be compared between the two population groups in an early and late exposure day.

      Correlating covariates will be identified to provide a rationale for optimal dosing strategy
      in critically ill patients.
