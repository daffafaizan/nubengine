      patients evaluating a novel treatment strategy in NDMM patients with high-risk disease who do
      not have a 6/6 compatible sibling donor. Participating patients will be from Hôpital
      Maisonneuve-Rosemont (HMR) or referred to HMR for this protocol. Newly diagnosed multiple
      myeloma patients will be evaluated for eligibility before or during the autologous stem cell
      transplant (ASCT) period. After a Bortezomib-based induction treatment (VTD, CyBorD, RVD or
      PAD [in patients with plasma cell leukemia]) for a minimum of 4 cycles, followed by Melphalan
      ≥ 140 mg/m2 and ASCT, eligible patients who accept to participate will undergo screening
      evaluation to receive a Reduced Intensity (RIC) allogeneic HSCT with ECT-001 expanded CB. It
      is estimated that 18 months will be necessary to enroll the targeted sample size.

      Once eligibility has been confirmed, study treatment will begin. After an ASCT, eligible
      patients will receive a conditioning regimen before receiving a RIC allogeneic HSCT with an
      ECT-001 expanded CB on day 0. Patients will be followed at least every week for the first 3
      months, then every month, in the absence of GVHD, for disease evaluation and adverse events.
      Occurrence and severity of acute GVHD will be evaluated using the modified Glucksberg176 and
      IBMTR177 criteria, while chronic GVHD will be evaluated using the NIH178 criteria.

      The trial will be terminated when all patients have been followed for 5 years after
      allogeneic HSCT.
