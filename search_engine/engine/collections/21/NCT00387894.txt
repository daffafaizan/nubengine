      Primary

        -  Determine the objective response rate in patients with recurrent epidermal growth factor
           receptor (EGFR)-positive and PTEN wild-type glioblastoma multiforme or gliosarcoma
           treated with erlotinib hydrochloride.

      Secondary

        -  Assess the response rate in patients who also EGFRVIII mutant and PTEN wild type
           glioblastoma multiforme or gliosarcoma.

        -  Determine the progression-free survival of patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label study. Patients are stratified according to concurrent use of
      enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (EIAEDs) (yes vs no).

      Patients receive oral erlotinib hydrochloride once daily on days 1-28. Treatment repeats
      every 4 weeks for up to 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Some patients may receive additional erlotinib hydrochloride after 1 year at their
      physician's discretion.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.
