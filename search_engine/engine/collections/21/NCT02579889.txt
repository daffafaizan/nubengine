      definitively assessed in Sinus Node Dysfunction (SND). Although many rate responsive (RR)
      sensors have been developed, no large clinical trials evaluated their benefits in terms of
      clinical endpoints such as clinically relevant atrial fibrillation (AF) and stroke.
      Electromechanical sensors (piezoelectric accelerometers) have been widely used for their
      simplicity and overall reliability. However there is some evidence indicating the Closed Loop
      Stimulation as one of the more efficient and physiological sensors.

      Two randomized clinical studies have been conducted so far, showing that in the Brady-Tachy
      Syndrome the CLS algorithm was associated with a significantly lower overall atrial
      arrhythmia burden as compared both with a DDDR mode based on a standard accelerometric sensor
      and an atrial overdrive approach.

      Both studies yielded consistent results, albeit with a parallel and intraindividual
      comparison designs, respectively. The atrial arrhythmic burden is an important but surrogate
      endpoint, not necessarily related to long-term clinical outcome. The CLS effects on AF (if
      any) should be investigated in terms of time to first new onset of clinically relevant AF.

      In the light of these considerations, it appears interesting to run a large randomized study
      coherently collecting data on the overall clinical benefit of CLS, primarily in terms of AF
      and stroke, in a population indicated for pacemaker or ICD and needing dual-chamber pacing
      due to SND.
