      the treatment by deactivation of MTP, after 10 sessions, in tinnitus patients by means of
      comparison with a placebo treatment in a control group. Patients with tinnitus and frequent
      regional pain for at least 3 months in the head, neck and shoulder girdle were investigated
      in the Tinnitus Research Group of University of SÃ£o Paulo Medical School. All of them
      underwent an interview with the otolaryngologist ("physician researcher"), an audiologist
      evaluation ("blind researcher"), another blind researcher evaluation for tinnitus and pain
      and a physiotherapist evaluation and randomization. Both blind researchers evaluated tinnitus
      and pain in the first, fifth and tenth session. The real treatment was made by a gradual and
      persistent digital pressure in each MTP previously diagnosed by the blind researcher (8
      possible muscles) and some home orientations that included stretch, superficial heat in each
      treated muscle and watch the correct postures during daily activities and sleeping. In the
      control group physiotherapist researcher pressed in an adjacent non-tender muscle fibers of
      the same muscle that have MTP. No other complementary orientation was done.
