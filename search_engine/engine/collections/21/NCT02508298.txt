      and the Yale Liver Clinic. Subjects between 18-85 years of age with compensated cirrhosis due
      to chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection who will be starting anti-viral therapy to treat
      HCV within the next 3 months will be eligible for this study. 33 subjects (assuming 10% loss
      to follow-up) will be recruited and their participation will last from 6-12 months. The
      expected duration of the study is 2 years.

      The primary end point of the study is to correlate the change (from baseline to after
      completing anti-HCV therapy) in ICG retention test, LS and SS as measured by ARFI with HVPG.
      After consent has been obtained, subjects will undergo ICG retention test, ARFI imaging and
      HVPG measurements before and after HCV therapy. Blood samples, demographic and clinical data
      will be collected before and after HCV therapy. Correlations between changes in HVPG and
      changes in ICG, LS and SS will be assessed. With 30 patients , we will have 80% power to
      perform a hypothesis test of the Pearson correlation assuming an observed correlation of 0.70
      and a two-sided type I error rate of 0.05.
