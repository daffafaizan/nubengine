    
      Ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) is one of the most commonly seen hospital-acquired
      infections that occurs in patients who receive mechanical ventilation. VAP usually occurs
      48-72 hours after mechanical ventilation and is related increased incidence of
      multidrug-resistant infections, increased antibiotic use, extended mechanical ventilation
      time, increased patient stay in the intensive care unit (ICU), and increased patient stay in
      the hospital. One recent intervention is the probiotic therapy which is a nonantibiotic
      strategy for maintenance of the host's aerodigestive microbial balance and VAP
      prevention.Common causative pathogens of VAP include Gram negative bacteria such as
      Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Acinetobacter species, and Gram-positive
      bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus. In this study, these Gram negative pathogens obtained
      from mechanical ventilated patients' tracheal aspiration culture and reference bacteria
      strains will be compared with Lactobacillus (LAB) members and nisin in the laboratory.
      Probiotics' antimicrobial properties and effects on these bacteria's (obtained from patients
      and reference strains) growth rate will be investigated.
