      particular, in HIV infection, this type of prophylactic treatment reduces the rate of
      infection in at-risk populations. The first studies from Chinese show that in case of
      immunosuppression or immunosuppressive treatment, whatever the causal pathology, COVID-19
      infection is more severe. The present study presents a population of patients with lupus
      (SLE) or Gougerot's disease (SGD) who are treated for a long time, with Hydroxy-Chloroquine.
      The protective effect against COVID-19 infection of Hydroxy-Chloroquine compared to
      populations not exposed to this drug requires to be assessed in patients and their control
      groups under or without immunosuppressive treatments.

      It is hypothesized that long-term treatment with Hydroxy-Chloroquine in SLE or SGD taken in
      its usual indication before the onset of the pandemic could decrease the number of COVID19
      infections and/or the intensity of the disease.
