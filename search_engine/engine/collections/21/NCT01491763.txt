           Note: The administration of imatinib be initiated as soon as the outcome of cytogenetic
           and molecular study, which will be known under normal conditions during prophase
           consolidation

      Patients should be in RC and shall be a minimum of 2 weeks of finding it. Patients did not
      discontinue treatment with imatinib during this period. Minimum counts to start the
      consolidation are: neutrophils> 1x109 / L and platelets> 100x109 / L.

        -  Mercaptopurine (MP) 50 mg/m2, p.o. days 1 to 7, 28 to 35 and 56 to 63

      During consolidation therapy is recommended in primary prophylaxis with G-CSF or found
      neutropenia (<0.5 x109 / L). This factor was administered daily until the neutrophil count is
      > 1x109 / L in two consecutive measurements. Alternatively, PEG-filgrastim can be used (eg 16
      and 44), at the discretion of each center

      Allogenic THP or Autologous TPH
