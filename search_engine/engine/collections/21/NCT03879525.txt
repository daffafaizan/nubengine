    
      This is a study among N=30 individuals with epilepsy and high or borderline anxiety or
      depression symptoms receiving usual care at the Wake Forest Comprehensive Epilepsy Center.
      Participants are randomized to one of two outcome assessment methods
      [EMR-based-interventional method vs. telephone-based-standard method] for collecting quality
      of life, anxiety and depression outcomes at 3 and 6 months, under usual care management.

      The primary aim of the study is to assess feasibility of EMR-based outcome assessment by
      measuring 6-month retention.
