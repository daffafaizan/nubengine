      Standard treatment for patients with locally advanced rectal cancer generally includes
      combined chemotherapy and radiotherapy administered either before (neoadjuvant) or after
      (adjuvant) definitive surgical resection. Published data from Germany has suggested
      advantages to a neoadjuvant strategy. Currently, the standard concurrent chemoradiotherapy
      regimen in the United States is pelvic irradiation administered concurrently with
      5-fluorouracil (5-FU) given as a protracted venous infusion. However, local recurrence
      remains a problem. Recently completed randomized trials of chemoradiotherapy have
      demonstrated local recurrence rates between 8-17% even with currently accepted standard
      chemoradiotherapy and adequate surgical management.

      Several recent trials have explored the use of radiotherapy and cetuximab with good results.

      Because of the non-overlapping toxicity profiles and the potentially diverse and
      complimentary mechanisms of action, the combination of chemotherapy plus ERBITUX given
      concurrently with pelvic radiotherapy may improve on the outcomes seen with current standards
      for patients with locally advanced adenocarcinoma of the rectum.
