      uveitis patients in order to analyze the type and character of the inflammatory response.
      Patients with a history of uveitis who require cataract surgery or vitreous surgery because
      of the clinical complications of inflammation, will be entered in this study. The lymphocyte
      subsets in the peripheral blood and ocular tissue will be compared and categorized by
      disease. The presence of soluble lymphokines in the intra-ocular fluid will be analyzed. Long
      term cell cultures of vitreal cells will be attempted to define the T-cell receptors. In
      addition, a portion of iris tissue or vitreous cells will be frozen to establish a tissue
      library of uveitis.
