      BUN and nitrogen balance in the context of hyperproteic nutrition administration. Creatinine
      clearance will also be followed to determine if there is any harmful effect to the kidney
      secondary to an elevated BUN. Secondly, to determine if there is a difference in hospital
      acquired infection rate, ventilator days, ICU days, and hospital stay between the current
      nutrition standard at Penn State Hershey Medical Center and a hyperproteic nutrition
      protocol. Thirdly, to determine the accuracy of at least three calculated creatinine
      clearance formulae when compared to a measured creatinine clearance.
