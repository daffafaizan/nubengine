      results in superior outcomes to a layered closure. Our aims are to compare outcomes using a
      split wound model, where half the wound is sutured with one technique and the other half is
      sutured with the other. This will be measured via the physician observer scar assessment
      scale, a validated scar instrument and via wound width. Our hypothesis is that wounds with a
      single layer closure will result in cosmetically superior wound outcomes.
