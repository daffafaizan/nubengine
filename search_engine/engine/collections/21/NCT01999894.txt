    
      This is a 48-week multicenter extension study comprised of a 6-week double-blind
      dose-titration period followed by a 42-week open-label maintenance period.

      In the Forest autism trials conducted in children ages 6-12, dosing with an extended release
      formulation of memantine was weight-based. These weight based dose limits were selected to
      ensure exposure in terms of area under the curve (AUC) was less than the predefined limit of
      2100 ng∙h/mL that represented a 10-fold lower exposure than observed at the NOAEL (No
      observed adverse effect level) of 15 mg/kg/day in juvenile rats.

      The weight-based dose limits in these studies were as follows:

        -  Group A: ≥ 60 kg; max 15 mg/day

        -  Group B: 40-59 kg; max 9 mg/day

        -  Group C: 20-39 kg; max 6 mg/day

        -  Group D: < 20 kg; max 3 mg/day
