      The recruitment period will be over 12-18 months to enroll all suitable patients. The total
      duration of prophylaxis will be for 1 year. After completion of the period of prophylaxis,
      the patients will be followed up as a non-study patient as clinically indicated.

      Forty subjects, undergoing allo-HSCT, will be recruited from the Singapore National Eye
      Centre upon referral from the Department of Hematology, Singapore General Hospital and
      followed up at least 5 times over a period of 12 months at the Singapore Eye Research
      Institute.

      The images of the subject eyes will be recorded and stored electronically. These images
      (corneal fluorescein staining score, Lipiview, meibography, conjunctival redness, tear
      stability assessment) will be used in the analysis of outcome measures. The Lipiview result
      is in video format.
