             -  NVP syrup 2 mg/kg every 24 hours for seven days, followed by NVP syrup 4 mg/kg
                every 24 hours for seven days. Newborns less than 2500 g will be administered
                2mg/kg NVP syrup at each intake

             -  AZT syrup 4 mg/ kg will be given every 12 hours for four weeks (preterm infants
                less than 30 weeks will be administered 2 mg/kg every 12 hours; preterm 30-35 weeks
                will receive 2 mg/kg every 12 hours for the first 2 weeks, increased to 3 mg/kg for
                the next 2 weeks).
