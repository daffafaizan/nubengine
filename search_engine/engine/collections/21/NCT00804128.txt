        -  Compare the DCIS optimized MRI to the standard clinical MRI. Using a scale of 1-5 from
           poor to excellent, images will be assessed for conspicuity of DCIS and atypical ductal
           hyperplasia (ADH) lesions, agreement of disease extent with biopsy, and overall image
           quality (artifact level, uniformity of fat suppression, contrast to noise ratio and
           signal to noise ratio).

        -  Subjects with ADH, a benign condition that can also show enhancement on MRI, will be
           enrolled to explore the utility of the DCIS optimized MRI for distinguishing DCIS and
           ADH.
