      diaphragm such as ventilator induced diaphragmatic dysfunction (VIDD). Research has shown
      that after being on mandatory mechanical ventilation and sedation the diaphragm begins to
      atrophy within as little as 18 hours. The PEPNS System consists of a console and disposable
      lead and will be used to stimulate the patient's diaphragm to contract in synchrony with the
      inspiratory cycle of the ventilator. The proprietary pdSTIM Lead incorporates multipolar
      electrodes that align with the left and right phrenic nerves in order to stimulate the nerves
      to the diaphragm. This feasibility trial will investigate the safety and performance of the
      PEPNS System as a therapy by stimulating the diaphragm over a 48 hour period to facilitate
      weaning from the mechanical ventilator. The patient population includes those need to be
      mechanically ventilated for at least 48 hours and up to 7 days in the ICU.
