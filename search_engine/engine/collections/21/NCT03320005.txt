    
      Will be measured the strength of the respiratory muscles (Mip and Mep), peak expiratory flow
      (Peak-Flow), thoracic movements and abdominal movements, distance traveled in Incremental
      Shuttle Walk Test, grip strength manual, pulmonary leukocytes, biochemical parameters and
      indicators of quality of life and physical activity through the WHOQOL-old and IPAQ-short.
      The data will be tested against the distribution of the Gauss curve, by the shapiro-wilk test
      and, if they have a normal distribution (parametric) are expressed as mean and standard
      deviation, if not submit normal (non parametric) distribution will be expressed as median or
      range interquart√≠lico. The first chance to compare the evolution of the group studied, will
      be applied to two-way ANOVA. If the distribution is abnormal, it will apply Mann-Whitney
      test. The multiple regression test will be used to compare the Mip and Mep with variables
      with the Peak-Flow, Thoracoabdominal mobility, distance traveled, immune competence, physical
      fitness and quality of life in the groups studied.
