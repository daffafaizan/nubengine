      Patients will have a minimum of 3 mm of extraction space that needs to be closed by moving
      the anterior teeth or canine distally. Patients will have standard orthodontic treatment and
      temporary anchorage devices for tooth movement and space closure. Half the patients will
      receive a functioning device and half the patients will receive a sham-device. Patients will
      use the device for 20 minutes daily; the device has a mouthpiece for the patient to lightly
      bite into plus a connected enclosure that stays outside the mouth. The enclosure provides a
      light vibration.
