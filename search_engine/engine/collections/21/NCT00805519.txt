      some controversy about efficacy. it seems that addition of other agents may improve efficacy
      and decrease the required dose and cost. common oral corticosteroids such as low dose
      prednisolone and chloroquine are candidate for such add on therapies. nevertheless, add on
      therapy may expose the patients to new side effects which should followed and addressed.

      In this investigator blinded controlled trial, 240 patients with diagnosed osteoarthritis of
      knee will be enrolled to the study. the patients will randomly be assigned to one of four
      groups of G (glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate ), P (Glucosamine and Chondroitin sulfate
      plus Prednisolone), C (Glucosamine and Chondroitin sulfate plus Chloroquine) and PC
      (Glucosamine and Chondroitin sulfate plus Prednisolone and Chloroquine). each group will
      consist 60 patients. the investigator(s) will be blind to the groups and interventions.
