      preservation of pancreatic function (exocrine and endocrine functions).

      Preoperative evaluation included abdominal CT, liver function, tumor marker CEA, CA19-9,
      preoperative ERCP were optional in selected cases (patients with high bilirubin with high
      enzymes. Patients with distant metastasis or locally advanced were excluded.

      Informed consent was obtained from all patients entered in the study Randomization: enrolled
      patients were randomized intraoperatively after PD resection to either isolated Roux PJ with
      isolated pancreatic drainage group or PG group by closed envelope which withdrawn by the
      nurse.

      Operative technique. Standard PD with regional lymphadenectomy was performed. PG was done
      between pancreatic stump and posterior surface of the stomach with 2 layer interrupted
      anastomosis,and duct to mucosa.

      Isolated Roux PJ group, reconstruction was begun using the transected jejunum and, which was
      anastomosed in end to side fashion. A separate Roux loop was performed for HJ, by dividing
      the jejunum about 40 cm beyond the pancreatic anastomosis and GJ was done in this loop (30 cm
      caudally from HJ). The PJ loop was anastomosed to the main loop (20 cm caudal to GJ).

      One intrabdominal drains in morrison space. Intraoperative data and postoperative data were
      collected. Pancreatic function assessment.

      The primary outcome was assessment the incidence of POPF after isolated Roux PJ and PG. The
      secondary outcomes were intraoperative blood loss, drain amount,day to resume oral intake
      hospital stay, operative duration, pancreatic function, postoperative complications delayed
      gastric emptying,
