    
      The study is a retrospective multi-center chart review study of short-term patient outcomes
      through 30 days after robotic-assisted cholecystectomies performed during regular hours and
      after-hours. The primary outcomes include the rate of conversion to open, rate of
      intra-operative adverse events, the rate of post-operative adverse events relating to the
      cholecystectomy within 30 days, and re-admissions and re-operations relating to the
      cholecystectomy within 30 days. In addition, operative time, the rate of use of
      intra-operative imaging, and the hospital length of stay will be collected as secondary
      outcomes.
