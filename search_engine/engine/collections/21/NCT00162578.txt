      nonsusceptible strains, it is now largely recommended to add vancomycin to the
      third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic regimen. It has also been recently shown that use
      of dexamethasone reduces mortality and unfavorable outcome in adults with pneumococcal
      meningitis. However, concern has arisen, that dexamethasone may impair penetration of
      vancomycin in cerebrospinal fluid.

      We therefore thought to measure in a purely observational study, blood and CSF vancomycin
      concentrations in adult patients with pneumococcal meningitis hospitalized in medical
      intensive care unit that received third-generation cephalosporin, vancomycin and
      dexamethasone. The aim of the study was to observe whether or not sufficient concentrations
      of vancomycin could be measured in the CSF despite the concomitant use of dexamethasone.
      Patients were cared for in a perfectly routine manner. There was no randomization. All
      patients received routine, recommended care (IDSA guidelines). There was no invasive
      procedure. Dexamethasone was administered according to the de Gans study (NEJM 2002). In
      these patients with severe meningitis, a second lumbar puncture was performed as
      recommended(IDSA Guidelines, CID 2004). At the same time, peripheral blood was taken. In both
      samples, vancomycin concentration was determined.
