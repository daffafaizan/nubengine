      recurrence rates between 45 and 70% at one year. Venous leg ulceration has been identified as
      a common source of morbidity and reduced quality of life, especially in the elderly
      population. Non-healing ulcers place the patient at a much higher risk for lower extremity
      amputation.

      Compression therapy is currently recognised as the main treatment for venous leg ulcers.
      External compression is applied as a therapy for venous leg ulcers, in an attempt to reverse
      the increased hydrostatic pressure in the veins.

      The application of negative pressure to successfully treat and aid in the healing of open
      wounds has been studied extensively for decades, demonstrating favourable clinical results.
      However, there is a lack of evidence in the literature regarding the use of VAC in venous
      ulcers.

      The combination of negative pressure therapy and compression therapy is theorized to provide
      the benefits of both individual therapies. As such, the utilization of the Bridge VAC under a
      compression dressing is expected to expedite the healing of venous ulcers.

      The investigators aim to randomise patients with venous ulcers to either be managed using
      conventional compression dressings or combined bridge vacuum assisted closure with
      compression dressings.
