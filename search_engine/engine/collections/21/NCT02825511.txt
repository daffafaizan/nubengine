      aging population. Among them, basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is a daily concern the
      dermatologist. The recommendation of good practice for the BCC of support has been
      established according to French agency methodology in 2004 : "Agence Nationale
      d'Accréditation et d'Evaluation en Santé" (ANAES). This classification is based on clinical
      and pathological use of sometimes mismatched terminology pretending to clinical reality with
      discrepancies between the clinical appearance and histology. On the other hand the simplified
      classification of recommendations has never been tested and validated on a large series of
      BCC. Probabilistic margins applied based on clinical assessment of clinical and pathological
      subtype, it seems interesting to evaluate the consistency of the initial clinical diagnosis
      and histological diagnosis and to explore its prognostic impact in terms of risk of
      recurrence.

      This study could lead to improved clinical and pathological classification and allow amending
      the current recommendations of the surgical management of the BCC.
