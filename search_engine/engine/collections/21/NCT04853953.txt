      complications (especially cerebral bleedings) in critically ill COVID-19 patients with ARDS
      requiring ECMO support. The incidences of bleeding will be compared with a historical control
      cohort of non-COVID-19 patients on ECMO support.

      The data analysis will be set up within a multicentric, retrospective study involving the
      University Hospital Zurich (Switzerland), the Medical School Hannover (Germany) and the
      University Hospital Bonn (Germany). The aim of the multicentric approach is to increase the
      case load and to improve the validity of the data, which could possibly have therapeutic
      implications in the future.

      Aside from demographic and baseline date, mortality and causes of death, comorbidities, the
      anticoagulation strategy (substance, targets of anticoagulation) and laboratory parameters of
      the anticoagulation during the bleeding events will be collected.

      Furthermore, the intensity of the ECMO treatment (blood flow, sweep gas flow, oxygen
      requirement) during the bleeding events and the catecholamine use during ECMO implantation
      will be analyzed.

      To enhance comparability, intensive care specific treatments (proning, sedation and
      analgesia, COVID-19 targeted therapy) will be collected and analyzed.
