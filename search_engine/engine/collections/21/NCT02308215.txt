      allow physicians to know when a treatment is being effective and thus not overuse it. The
      study will examine how 3-D optical coherence tomography and related image analysis can be
      used to assess changes in the macula and retina of patients' eyes. These changes can reveal
      how well a person is responding to anti-VEGF treatment and thus help doctors provide proper
      treatment timing and care.
