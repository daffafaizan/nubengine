      application as a first-aid device at the SHFs before transfer to Referral Hospitals (RHs).

      The first step will include start-up activities and formative data collection, including
      facility staff training in data collection, how to collect blood in the closed-end blood
      collection drape, and in an evidence-based standardized clinical protocol for obstetric
      hemorrhage prevention and hemorrhage and shock management. Next will be a period of baseline
      data collection at the RHs and SHFs, during which clinical and demographic data will be
      collected from women diagnosed with obstetric hemorrhage and shock. After this baseline data
      collection period, we will introduce the study intervention, initially at the RHs and then at
      SHFs.

      The intervention will include: review of study protocol differences between baseline and the
      NASG-intervention phases, provision of the NASG, detailed training on the use of NASG for
      health care providers and staff, as well as on-site support and supervision for use of the
      NASG. After the RH providers are fully trained and have become proficient in NASG use, SHFs
      will be randomized into 19 intervention and 19 control facilities. Intervention SHFs will
      receive the NASG training described above, while control SHFs will receive a refresher
      training on the topics included in the baseline training.

      The final step will be three years of NASG-intervention data collection at the RHs and the
      SHFs on women diagnosed with obstetric hemorrhage and shock on the same outcomes collected in
      the baseline period. A total of approximately 2,340 women from the SHFs will be included in
      the NASG-intervention data collection phase of the cluster randomized trial: 1,170 women in
      the intervention group and 1,170 women in the control group.
