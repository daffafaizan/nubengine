        -  To evaluate the efficacy of HLA-haploidentical familial donor hematopoietic cell
           transplantation with a reduced-intensity conditioning regimen of busulfan, fludarabine
           phosphate, and anti-thymocyte globulin in patients with hematologic malignancies or
           myelodysplastic syndromes.

      OUTLINE: Before receiving the reduced-intensity conditioning regimen, patients receive one
      dose of intrathecal (IT) methotrexate, then leucovorin calcium IV or orally 4 hours after
      methotrexate and every 6 hours for a total of 8 doses.

        -  Reduced-intensity conditioning regimen: Patients receive busulfan IV over 6 hours on
           days -7 and -6, fludarabine phosphate IV over 30 minutes on days -7 to -2,
           anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) IV over 4 hours on days -4 to -1, and methylprednisolone
           IV over 30 minutes on days -4 to -1.

        -  HLA-haploidentical familial donor hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT):
           Patients undergo allogeneic HSCT over 1 hour on days 0 and 1.

        -  Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis: Patients receive cyclosporine IV* over 2-4
           hours every 12 hours on days -1 to 30 followed by a taper until day 60 and methotrexate
           IV on days 2, 4 , 7, and 12.

      NOTE: *Cyclosporine can be given orally once oral medication can be tolerated

        -  CNS prophylaxis: When blood counts recover, patients with acute leukemia or chronic
           myelogenous leukemia in blastic crisis resume IT methotrexate once every 2 weeks for a
           total of 4 doses (including the dose given before the conditioning regimen) and
           leucovorin calcium IV or orally 4 hours after (each dose of methotrexate) and every 6
           hours for a total of 8 doses.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 3 years.
