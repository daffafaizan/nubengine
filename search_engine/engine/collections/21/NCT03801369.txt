      I. Assess overall response to treatment.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess participant benefit from treatment. II. Determine the time to disease progression
      following response to study therapy.

      III. Determine time to first disease progression or death of participants enrolled on the
      study.

      IV. Determine survival of participants enrolled on the study. V. Assess safety and
      tolerability of the proposed therapy.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Examine response rates depending on tumor characteristics. II. Identify predictive
      biomarkers of sensitivity to therapy. III. Identify emerging mechanism of resistance to
      therapy. IV. Determine changes in tumor cells induced by PARP inhibitors.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, single-arm phase II study of olaparib and durvalumab.

      Patients with biopsy proven TNBC will undergo a pre-treatment biopsy, after which they will
      receive a 28 days induction treatment of olaparib (oral, twice a day). At the 2 week mark,
      patients will then undergo a repeat on-treatment biopsy. Beginning cycle 2, durvalumab will
      be administered (intravenously [IV] over 1 hr) every 4 weeks, in addition to olaparib.
      Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 13 cycles in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients deriving clinical benefit from treatment may, at the
      investigator's discretion and in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity,
      may continue on therapy beyond the planned 13 cycles.

      At the completion of all on-study procedures, patients will be considered off-treatment and
      will be followed every 6 months for disease and survival outcomes up to 1 year. Patients will
      be asked to submit an optional tumor biopsy in the event of disease progression.
