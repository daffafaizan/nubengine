    
      30 adult patients admitted to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary ICU, requiring invasive mechanical
      ventilation and with impaired gas exchange will be recruited and the following baseline
      demographic data will be recorded: cause of respiratory failure, APACHE II score,
      cardiovascular shock (presence / absence), duration of mechanical ventilation prior to
      inclusion, duration of respiratory failure prior to inclusion. Also the following baseline
      physiological data will also be recorded: FIO2, SaO2, PEEP, arterial blood pressure, central
      venous pressure, haemoglobin, PaO2, PaCO2, arterial pH and inotrope / vasopressor infusion
      rates.

      The FIO2 will then be varied in random steps to 0.35, 0.4, 0.45, 0.5, 0.55, 0.6 and 0.65.
      After changing the FIO2 a 3-4 minute equilibration period will be allowed prior to taking an
      arterial blood gas sample for analysis. In the event of a PaO2 < 8kPa being recorded, further
      reductions in FIO2 will not be undertaken.

      The data collected will then be utilised using a slide rule computer programme to generate
      FIO2 vs. SpO2 graphs. Other indices of gas exchange, e.g. PaO2/FIO2 ratios will also be
      generated from the data. Predicted versus actual PaO2 will be plotted and a correlation
      coefficient obtained.

      Patients will then be followed for up to 5 days and depending on progression the same
      procedures will be repeated between days 3 and 5.
