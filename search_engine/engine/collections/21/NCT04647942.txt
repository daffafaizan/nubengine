           factor to the development of early osteoarthritis with complaints of pain.

        2. Trial objectives and Design 2.1 Trial objectives With this study we would like to
           investigate whether a certain, critical loss of meniscal volume, is critical to the
           development of pain.

           2.2 Primary endpoints How much volume can be resected peroperatively without developing
           postoperative pain.

           2.3 Secondary endpoints A possible correlation between the resected volume and the
           severity of the pain.

        3. Selection and withdrawal of subjects

      3.1 Inclusion criteria

        -  All patients who were treated with a partial meniscectomy for a meniscal tear and have
           postoperative MRI's.

        -  Age between 14 and 50 years old

        -  Women of child bearing age can be included: the study has no effect on their methods of
           contraception.

      3.2 Exclusion criteria

        -  A history of a tibia plateau fracture or severe deformity of the knee

        -  Rupture of the ACL/PCL/collateral ligaments of the knee

        -  Focal cartilage defects of the knee
