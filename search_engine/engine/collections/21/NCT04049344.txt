      conducted at 3 investigative centres in the Zhejiang Province, China. Eligible patients are
      18 to 75 years old with relapsed/metastatic renal cell carcinoma progressed on standard of
      care. Patients receive Decitabine 10 mg/day for 5 consecutive days (d1-5) plus Oxaliplatin
      75mg/m2 2-week-cycle (d6, d20) within 4 weeks. One cycle is defined as 4 weeks of treatment
      and total of 6 cycles are designed for patients. Patients who experienced unacceptable
      toxicities or clinical or documented progressive disease are discontinued from the study. The
      duration of any objective response is measured from the date the initial response is observed
      to the date that disease progression is observed. Patients receiving 2 cycles of treatment
      are considered evaluable for response using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
      (RECIST). Disease assessment by the investigator include response assessment and diagnostic
      imaging and measuring of target lesions. All patients receive computed tomography and/or
      magnetic resonance imaging scans for assessing disease status. All patients were followed up
      until death from any cause.
