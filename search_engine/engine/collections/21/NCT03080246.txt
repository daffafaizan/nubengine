    
      This randomized clinical trial will compare the effects of 9-months of strength training to a
      control group on: (1) injury rates in female runners during the 9 month intervention period,
      and for 9 months after completing the intervention, and (2) on the potential mechanisms of
      injury including strength, joint and tissue loading, and psychosocial factors.
