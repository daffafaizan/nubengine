    
      Objective: The aim of this study is to perform a prospective, randomized study on hemorrhagic
      moyamoya disease to confirm the effect of revascularization in China, and to establish
      specifications and standards to guide the treatment options for hemorrhagic moyamoya disease
      as well.

      Design: This study is a single-center study and plan to include 108 patients. According to a
      random number table, hemorrhagic moyamoya patients will be assigned to three groups:
      conservative treatment group, direct revascularization group and indirect revascularization
      group. A prospective, randomized study will be carried out to evaluate the effect of
      revascularization and conservative treatment on the reduction of rebleeding risk and
      improvement of ischemia in adult patients with hemorrhagic moyamoya disease.

      Observation Measures: 1.Rebleeding; 2.Cerebral infarction resulting in severe disability (mRS
      scoreâ‰¥3); 3.Severe disability or death caused by other reasons; 4. Patients in conservative
      treatment group need revascularization due to progressive ischemic stroke or progressive
      Transient ischemic attack(TIA).
