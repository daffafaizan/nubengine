    
      Cutaneous leishmaniasis is a disfiguring disease that can progress to mucosal leishmaniasis,
      a more serious and possibly fatal form of Leishmania disease. All available medical therapies
      require weeks of treatment and cause significant toxicity. It appears that Leishmania
      infections can be eliminated or prevented by T helper 1 immune responses. These findings
      argue that a vaccine that generates a T helper 1 response against the parasite will prevent
      the infection and disease. This is a phase 1, open-label study to evaluate the safety,
      tolerability and immunogenicity in Montenegro skin test (MST)-positive healthy adults of an
      investigational vaccine being developed for the prophylaxis of cutaneous leishmaniasis. The
      vaccine, identified as Leish-111f + MPL-SE, consists of a recombinant three-antigen
      Leishmania polyprotein (Leish-111f, 10 μg) together with the adjuvant MPL-SE (25 μg). The
      vaccine will be given to each study subject three times at 4 week intervals.
