    
      This study is evaluating the efficacy of cabazitaxel and hormonal treatment (LHRH analogues)
      as neoadjuvant treatment for patients with clinically operable disease suitable for surgery
      (no lymph node, visceral or bony metastases), and a high risk of relapse after surgery (5
      year risk of relapse).

      Patients will receive four cycles of neoadjuvant treatment (cabazitaxel treatment and 3
      months LHRH treatment) unless there is evidence of disease progression, unacceptable toxicity
      or patient request to withdraw consent.
