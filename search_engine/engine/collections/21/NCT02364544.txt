      management and the overall process of care in treating the chronic illness schizophrenia in
      order to reduce ER visits and hospital days while providing better care, better health and
      increased patient satisfaction. This will be done by fostering innovation in the use of
      technology and by training and deploying a new cadre of personnel in the behavioral health
      field: Mental Health/Health Technology (MH/HT) Case Managers. The specific treatments we
      propose to use are evidence based, but their dissemination has been limited because of lack
      of trained personnel and cost. The model we propose, the Health Technology Program (HTP),
      will address these problems through use of the web and mobile phone based training and
      interventions.

      The components of the HTP program that are being tested in the pilot program include: 1)
      evidence-based pharmacological treatment facilitated by a web-based prescriber decision
      support system-Prescriber Decision Assistant (PDA) 2) brief, in-person, relapse prevention
      counseling with supplemental web-based learning modules, 3) a daily support website that
      offers web- and phone-based resources to support persons with schizophrenia and their family
      members or others. The resources include a patient and family Psycho-Education Treatment
      program, which includes electronic peer groups facilitated by mental health professionals,
      providing medication reminders via web and phone, and conducting monitoring of early warning
      signs of relapse via web and phone 4) an interactive smart phone text-messaging application
      to support medication adherence, facilitate coping with symptoms and improve daily
      functioning in individuals with schizophrenia 5) a web-based, self-administered
      cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) program for the management of hallucinations. All patients
      will be provided with pharmacological treatment (PDA), brief in-person relapse prevention
      counseling, and an Android mobile phone. The other program components will be provided to
      patients using a shared decision-making approach to assess need and preference.
