    
      Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery is a principal revascularization option for
      ischemic heart disease and the principal modality for invasive treatment of coronary artery
      disease. Postoperative pulmonary complications are the most frequent and significant
      contributor to length of hospitalization, morbidity and mortality. The objective of this
      study is to search for perioperative parameters that could predict the degree of impairment
      of respiratory function after CABG with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB).
