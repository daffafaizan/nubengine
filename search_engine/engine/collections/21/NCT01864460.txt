      In this proposed study, investigators will determine if an intense, individually tailored,
      carefully monitored, Diet, Physical Activity and Balance Enhancement Program (DPAEP) can
      improve autonomic function and balance and other measures of autonomic and balance control.
      In contrast, the primary and secondary and other efficacy measures will be compared in
      standard care controls (SC) who will receive general diet and physical activity information.
      The "Improving Autonomic Function and Balance in Diabetic Neuropathy" study is a single
      blinded, randomized study to determine if an intensive diet and exercise program improves
      autonomic function and balance. Following baseline testing, participants are randomized to
      either DPAEP or SC groups. DPAEP participants will receive an intensive physical activity
      enhancement program with a focus on aerobic activity and a balance program.
