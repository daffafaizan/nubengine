      cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide, work in different ways to
      stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing. Chloroquine may help chemotherapy drugs work better by making cancer cells more
      sensitive to the drug. Giving bortezomib and cyclophosphamide together with chloroquine may
      kill more cancer cells.
