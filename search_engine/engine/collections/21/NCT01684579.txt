      Wellness Center that is equipped with state-of-the-art aerobic and resistance training
      apparati. All exercise will be performed under the supervision of the Gathering Place trained
      and certified staff. The patient group will perform a 20 week aerobic and resistance exercise
      training program to evaluate (compared to baseline) changes: in body composition (fat, lean
      tissue and bone mass); cytokines including insulin, leptin, adiponectin, IL-6, and TNFÎ±;
      oxidative stress including urine isoprostane; cardiorespiratory fitness (VO2max); upper and
      lower body strength (assessed using a dynamometer); sleep (assessed using the Pittsburgh
      Sleep Quality Index [PSQI]); fatigue and quality of life (Qol) (assessed using the SF-36,
      FACIT instruments). Patients will be evaluated before and after a 20 week intervention and a
      10 week post-intervention period. Participants also will be evaluated for motivation barriers
      and compliance. These feasibility parameters will provide the basis and guidance for an NCI
      grant application to focus on mechanisms and extend our evaluation to larger cohorts of
      African-American patients.
