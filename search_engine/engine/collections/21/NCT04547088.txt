      nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients who failed to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy.
      Anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody showed efficacy and safety in previous studies, however, the
      efficacy of immunotherapy alone was limited. Immunotherapy combined with other treatment
      regimens for recurrent or metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma is a strategy that needs to be
      urgently explored. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is an important target in the
      treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Apatinib, a small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor
      selectively inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR-2), has shown
      strong clinical utility. Previous clinical studies have confirmed that apatinib shows
      antitumor activity and tolerable toxicity in recurrent or metastatic nasopharyngeal
      carcinoma. Tumor vascular normalization and immune reprogramming interact synergistically and
      could enter a mutually reinforcing virtuous cycle by improving tumor microenvironment. The
      current national comprehensive cancer network (NCCN) guidelines also recommend Nivolumab and
      Pembrolizumab as a second-line treatment for recurrent or metastatic nasopharyngeal
      carcinoma. More and more evidence show that immunotherapy combined with anti-angiogenesis
      therapy has a synergistic effect, and Camrelizumab combined with apatinib therapy has
      achieved the initial effect in solid tumors. Based on this, this study aims to evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of Camrelizumab combined with apatinib in the patients with recurrent or
      metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma who failed to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy, to
      provide new evidence for individualized comprehensive treatment in nasopharyngeal carcinoma.
