      phobias, PTSD), its potential in helping cancer patients experience an improved mood and
      hence better quality of life has not yet been tested. In this project the investigators will
      first develop the virtual content (e.g., natural scenes) that patients will experience within
      a Head-Mounted-Display, simulating movement by manipulating a gesture controller. The
      investigators will then carry out a randomized, double blind, crossover trial with 50
      hospitalized cancer patients to test whether they can benefit psychologically and emotionally
      from their interaction with an immersive environment compared to those who will experience a
      guided imagery intervention. A positive result will open the route for the future development
      of affordable self-administered VR solutions for treating the psychological side-effects of
      cancer treatment.
