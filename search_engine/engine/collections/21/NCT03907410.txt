      with a six month follow-up period. Children will be ages 5-12, and must have two or more
      visits to any combination of the outpatient, ED or hospital setting in the past year for
      asthma exacerbations at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP).

      The study intervention will include daily automated medication reminders (either via text
      message or push reminder), an app to track daily medication use, and nominal incentives to
      promote daily controller use. Inhaled controller medication adherence and rescue medication
      use will be measured using electronic monitors affixed to the inhalers. Factors associated
      with differential adherence will be assessed using surveys administered during enrollment,
      the experiment interval (months 1 through 3), the observation interval (months 4 through 6),
      and study completion (months 12-13). Efficacy outcomes will include change in parent-reported
      asthma control and mean adherence to ICS between study arms during the experiment interval,
      as well as the observation interval.

      Patients will be considered enrolled when they fulfill the requirements of the Run-in period
      (sensor data uploaded to research platform AND text message receipt confirmed by caregiver)
      and are subsequently randomized.
