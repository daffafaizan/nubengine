      provide a comprehensive view on the effect of body mass index (BMI) on perioperative outcomes
      in orthopedic surgeries. Therefore, we aim to determine the procedure specific,
      independent-effect of BMI on 30-day perioperative outcomes in patients undergoing the first
      25 most commonly performed orthopedic surgeries.

      The study is a retrospective cohort study. The subjects will be the individuals undergoing
      one of first 25 most commonly performed orthopedic surgeries, whose information is derived
      form the de-identified patients' data collected through the American College of Surgeons
      National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) database. The primary outcome will
      be composite post-operative morbidity. Specific morbidities will also be evaluated including
      cardiovascular, vascular and renal complications, length-of-stay (LOS), and the need for
      re-intervention and readmission, as well as 30-day mortality. Descriptive statistics and
      multivariable regression models will assess the independent-effect of BMI on outcomes.

      The knowledge of the effect of BMI on orthopedic surgeries will improve the knowledge of
      surgeons about the expected morbidities. The surgeon will be able to better counsel obese
      patients and devise a better surgical plan to prevent or deal with the expected outcomes.
