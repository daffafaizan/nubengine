      lymphoma (NHL) or Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) who have primary progressive disease or who relapse
      after a chemotherapy-induced complete remission. For these patients, as for other patients
      undergoing autologous transplantation, the number of CD34+ cells collected is a reliable
      predictor of neutrophil and platelet (PLT) engraftment after transplantation.

      AMD3100 (plerixafor) is a promising new mobilizing agent that has demonstrated efficacy in
      patients with NHL, HL, and multiple myeloma (MM). Although efficacious, the subcutaneous
      dosing of AMD3100 requires that patients receive the drug in the evening prior to apheresis,
      which can present logistical problems. Intravenous dosing of AMD3100 may result in a faster
      rise in peripheral CD34+ cell count, so that the drug can be administered the same day as
      apheresis. Intravenous dosing may also increase the peak CD34+ cell count, improving the
      number of CD34+ cells collected via apheresis.

      This Phase I/II study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of intravenous AMD3100 added to
      the standard G-CSF mobilization regimen of patients undergoing autologous stem cell
      transplantation for Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphomas.
