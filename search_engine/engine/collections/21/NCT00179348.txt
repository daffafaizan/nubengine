      I. To evaluate the effects of yoga on quality of life (QOL) of breast cancer patients on
      different treatment regimens.

      II. To pilot the effects of a yoga-based rehabilitation program versus standard care on QOL
      impairment reported by newly diagnosed (a) lung and (b) colorectal patients.

      III. To evaluate program compliance and satisfaction among breast, lung and colorectal cancer
      patients as well as among the various sociocultural subgroups (e.g., ethnicity, language).

      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      GROUP I (YOGA-BASED REHABILITATION PROGRAM): Participants undergo a yoga-based rehabilitation
      program up to 5 days a week for 1.5 hours and practice at home at least once daily for 12
      weeks.

      GROUP II (STANDARD CARE/CONTROL): After a 3 month wait period, participants undergo
      yoga-based rehabilitation program as in Group I.
