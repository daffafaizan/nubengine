      Primary

        -  Determine the safety and activity of arsenic trioxide in women with locally advanced or
           metastatic breast cancer.

        -  Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxic effects of this drug in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the response, in terms of objective tumor response and response duration, in
           patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the patterns of failure and survival in patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot study.

      Patients receive arsenic trioxide IV over 1-2 hours on days 1-5 of week 1 and on days 1 and 5
      of weeks 2-8 (for course 1 only). Beginning with course 2 and for all subsequent courses,
      patients receive arsenic trioxide on days 1 and 5 of weeks 1-8. Treatment repeats every 8
      weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients who have a complete response (CR) receive an additional course beyond documentation
      of CR. Patients who have a CR due to local consolidative therapy (e.g., surgery or
      radiotherapy) receive an additional 2 courses beyond CR.

      Patients are followed for 1 month, every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years,
      and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 9-24
      months.
