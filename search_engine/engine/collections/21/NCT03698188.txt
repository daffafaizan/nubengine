      tissue that is capable of boosting the continuation of normal root development. The use of
      platelet concentrates for that purpose is a clinically relevant, minimally invasive approach
      which has a promising potential of reducing the healing period. Among which, the most
      commonly employed is the Platelet-Rich Plasma that is not entirely natural. It involves the
      use of non-autologous anticoagulants such as bovine thrombin to maintain the fluid
      consistency which prevents clot formation and thus impairs wound healing, affects the
      coagulation process and can also trigger an immune reaction, thereby, suppressing
      regeneration.

      PRP offers a short-term release of most of the growth factors unlike the Platelet-Rich Fibrin
      which allows for a more sustained release. PRF does not require any biochemical handling of
      blood and is easy to procure but due to the gel-like consistency, its adaptability within the
      root canal requires excessive removal of root dentin.

      In addition, the application of recombinant growth factors within the root canal is
      associated with high cost which hinders its applicability in the common clinical practice.

      Therefore, a new regenerative technique is required that combines the advantages of both PRP
      and PRF while overcoming their drawbacks.
