      technique in the acute hemostasis of bleeding ulcers. Currently there is no objective
      assessment of adequacy of endoscopic therapy. Endoscopic Doppler ultrasound enables
      endoscopists in detecting blood flow in a vessel beneath an ulcer. A persistent signal after
      endoscopic therapy predicts recurrent bleeding. The current study proposes to compare
      assessment of ulcer base using either Doppler ultrasound or endoscopists' interpretation of
      ulcer floors. The trial design is one of a prospective randomized controlled cross-over study
      in which patients with severe upper gastrointestinal bleeding and documented peptic ulcers at
      endoscopy are enrolled.
