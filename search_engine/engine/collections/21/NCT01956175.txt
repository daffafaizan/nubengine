      pharyngeal stimulation. In case a patient cannot be decannulated at that time point, there is
      an open-label follow-up treatment phase, in which every patient in the sham treatment arm
      gets another three days of real electrical pharyngeal stimulation to not deprive any patient
      of a potentially beneficial treatment.
