        1. To compare with contrast angiography, the ability of DSCT to detect and quantify
           coronary artery stenoses.

        2. To compare with gray-scale IVUS, the ability of DSCT to quantify plaque cross-sectional
           diameter & area measurements & plaque volume.

        3. To evaluate the ability of DSCT to assess plaque morphology and quantify plaque
           components as compared to gray-scale and IB-IVUS.

        4. To evaluate the ability of DSCT to identify & measure lesion remodeling compared to
           gray-scale IVUS.

        5. To determine if pre-PCI evaluation of coronary plaque morphology by IB-IVUS can a)
           predict procedural success as assessed by adequate stent strut apposition and expansion
           and b) peri-procedural myocardial necrosis as measured by biomarker elevation.
