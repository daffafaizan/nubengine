      centers. This proposal will determine the impact of early respiratory viral infections on
      bacterial flora and inflammatory profiles in the CF airway as well as the impact of these
      pathogens on clinical, physiologic and structural markers of disease.The proposed study is
      designed to follow infants diagnosed with CF through newborn screening to determine the
      effect of viral infections on the lower airway microbiome, clinical symptoms, pulmonary
      function and structural changes during the first year of life. The proposed study will
      measure lower airway inflammation and infection using BAL, oral swabs, and nasal swabs;
      outcomes will be assessed through infant lung function testing, computerized tomography scans
      of the chest, and pulmonary exacerbation rate.
