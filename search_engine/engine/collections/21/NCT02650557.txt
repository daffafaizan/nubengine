      in the absence of obstructive epicardial coronary artery disease, is a relatively common
      finding in patients undergoing routine coronary angiography and is often associated with
      chest pain. In some patients with CSF, blood flow may be heterogeneously distributed in the
      three coronary arteries, suggesting the heterogeneously distributed microvascular dysfunction
      in the myocardium. However, the vessel heterogeneity of Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction
      (TIMI) frame count (TFC) has not been fully elucidated.

      P-wave dispersion (PWD) is defined as the difference between the longest and the shortest
      P-wave duration recorded from multiple different surface electrocardiogram (ECG) leads, and
      it has been reported to be associated with inhomogeneous and discontinuous propagation of
      sinus impulses5, which are well known electrophysiologic characteristics of the atrium prone
      to fibrillation. Although it is plausible to hypothesize that PWD might be associated with
      the heterogeneously distributed microvascular dysfunction, and previous studies have
      demonstrated the abnormal PWD in patients with CSF, the correlation between TFC heterogeneity
      and PWD has never been evaluated.

      In this study, the investigators aimed to investigate the vessel heterogeneity of TFC in the
      three coronary arteries, and its relation to PWD, in patients with CSF and otherwise normal
      coronary arteries.
