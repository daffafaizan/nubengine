    
      This is a prospective, randomized, single-center investigation with a minimum of forty (40)
      controlled study subjects designed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Surgicel®
      absorbable Haemostat as an absorbable hemostat in the hepatic surgical patient population.

      Subjects who are undergoing hepatic surgical procedures should be considered for this
      investigation. The raw cut surface was covered with Surgicel® absorbable Haemostat or none
      but was dried by using fine sutures and an argon beam to achieve complete haemostasis.
      Subjects can be pre-screened utilizing standard of care data for the specified
      inclusion/exclusion criteria to ensure that they are eligible for treatment in the
      investigation. If the subject appears to qualify for the investigation, the subject will then
      be asked to give his/her written informed consent. All subjects will be followed through
      their hospitalization. Follow-up evaluations will include time to removal of wound drain, the
      amount of effusion, length of postoperative hospital stay, and incidence of postoperative
      morbidity.

      From baseline to the final study exam, data pertaining to the investigational objectives will
      be recorded on the appropriate case report forms at the predetermined study intervals.
