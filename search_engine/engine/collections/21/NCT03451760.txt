      symptoms present, and a score of 25 or lower on the Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE).
      Participants will also be screened for a previous diagnosis of either Vascular Dementia,
      Alzheimer's disease, or Mixed Dementia using DSM-5 criteria. The primary outcome measure will
      be a change in the total score of Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q) over
      12-weeks. The investigators expect the group receiving Feru-guard will have a greater
      improvement in total NPI score compared to the placebo group at 12-weeks.

      The investigators will also collect data on the effect of Feru-guard supplementation on
      care-giver burden using the NPI-Q subscale of caregiver distress, Zarit Burden Interview
      (ZBI) screening version, and quality of life (SF-12) over 12 weeks. The investigators will
      also collect data on changes in global cognition of participants over 12 weeks using the
      Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). The investigators will compare secondary outcomes
      between Feru-guard and control group.
