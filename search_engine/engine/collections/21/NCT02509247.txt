      pressure (CPAP) treatment in obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) patients. Patients were allocated
      either to the telemonitoring group (n=50) or the usual care group (n=61). Nursing time,
      patient satisfaction and treatment efficiency and efficacy were compared between the groups
      at baseline and after one year treatment the CPAP adherence and treatment efficacy were
      recorded.

      This study was part of our regular testing and quality assurance procedure when developing
      and revising clinical treatment protocol of sleep apnoea patients. When planning remarkable
      changes in treatment protocol we have to test whether it is feasible and cost-effective to
      change the protocol. The data was retrospectively collected from hospital records and nurses'
      notes (nursing time). According to instructions of our hospital, the Ethics Committee
      approval is not required. The approval of the hospital (Head of the Division of Medicine) for
      testing the wireless telemonitoring system of CPAP treatment was applied and received
      (Protocol Record T200/2013, diary number TO5/049/13). Written informed consent was obtained
      from those patients allocated to the telemonitoring group.
