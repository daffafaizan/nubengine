      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). COPD is a chronic airway inflammatory disorder
      characterized by a progressive loss of pulmonary function. Mononuclear phagocytes are known
      to be critically involved in both repair/remodeling and destructive events in COPD. Although
      smoking is the chief environmental risk factor for COPD, the molecular details responsible
      for the genesis and progression of smoking-mediated COPD require further investigation. In
      searching for new knowledge and research strategies for this challenging topic, we have made
      substantial progress in mononuclear phagocyte proteomics and laid the groundwork for this
      translational research of COPD.
