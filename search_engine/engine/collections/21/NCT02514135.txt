      patients and has been shown to be an independent risk-factor for mortality in this patient
      population. The quoted rates of intra-abdominal hypertension of range anywhere from 20-60%
      are dependent on the population of patient studied. The prospective observational studies
      performed to date have been underpowered, used strict inclusion/exclusion criteria or were
      performed prior to consensus guidelines on the definition and measurement of intra-abdominal
      pressure and hypertension.
