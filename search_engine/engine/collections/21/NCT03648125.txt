      the general population, and more markedly in high-level athletes. The link between dental
      occlusion and the postural stability of top athletes has been studied in several disciplines
      such as basketball, shooting, golf and running. There is currently no data in the field of
      rowing. But this sport requires optimal postural control for synchronous and symmetrical
      muscle solicitation.

      The present study aims to evaluate the influence of dental occlusion on postural stability
      and the performance of high level rowers.

      Our assumptions are as follows:

        -  Occlusal disturbance alters the muscular power developed by high level rowers

        -  occlusal disturbance alters the static postural stability of high level rowers
