      surgery.

      Studies have shown that PARP inhibitors protect cells from damage due to lack of oxygen.
      Heart-lung bypass during heart surgery can result in cells being deprived of oxygen. INO-1001
      may be able to protect these cells and reduce complications following surgery.

      A total of 162 patients will be randomly assigned to either INO-1001 or placebo (sugar
      water). Treatment will begin on the day of heart surgery and continue for 36 hours. A total
      of 4 doses of INO-1001 will be given. Patients will be followed up until 30 days after
      surgery.

      The following information will be collected: symptoms, vital signs, physical examination,
      blood and urine tests, electrocardiograms, and other information from medical charts.

      The information provided in this listing is disclosed solely to comply with regulatory
      requirements. The drug INO-1001 has not yet been approved for marketing and is only available
      to patients who participate in a clinical trial and are chosen for the treatment group.
