      SCD who are prescribed HU at Nationwide Children's Hospital in order to compare HU adherence
      prior to the study, during Mobile Dot use and after using Mobile DOT.

      Hydroxyurea (HU) is the only disease-modifying medication for patients with sickle cell
      disease (SCD). Multiple clinical trials show that HU can reduce SCD-related complications but
      only 50% of pediatric patients adhere to HU at the rates achieved in clinical trials. This
      poor adherence limits its clinical effectiveness and results in increased costs and in lower
      patient-reported quality of life.

      An innovative, practical, inexpensive, and efficient strategy is needed to improve HU
      adherence in pediatric patients with SCD. Electronic directly observed therapy (Mobile DOT)
      is a pilot-tested, multi-dimensional tool that is a feasible and acceptable strategy and can
      achieve >90% HU adherence rates in a small cohort of pediatric patients with SCD. This study
      will provide further testing to confirm if Mobile DOT can improve adherence and improve
      clinical outcomes in patients with SCD.

      Mobile DOT uses patients' smart phones and computers to provide electronic reminder alerts
      and to video-record patients' daily HU administrations. Patients are provided with text (SMS)
      messages, e-mails, and phone call communications to encourage adherence and they receive
      monetary incentives when they reach adherence goals.

      Researchers will determine if video adherence correlates with self-report, biomarker, and
      refill adherence. Also, surveys will be completed by participants to determine if their
      self-management skills improve with Mobile DOT.
