    
      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of WP1066 that
      can be given to pediatric patients with recurrent (has returned after treatment) cancerous
      brain tumors or melanoma that has gotten worse and spread to the brain. The safety of this
      drug will also be studied.

      WP1066 is designed to target the STAT3 pathway in cancer cells, which makes these cells
      divide, increases new blood vessels to the tumor, causes the cancer cells to move throughout
      the body and brain, and avoids them being detected by the immune system. Targeting this
      pathway may cause the immune system to kill the cancer cells. The investigators will
      administer five escalating doses of WP1066, starting at lowest dose currently found to be
      safe and tolerable in adults.

      WP1066 is not FDA approved or commercially available. It is currently being used for research
      purposes only.

      Up to 36 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at Children's
      Healthcare of Atlanta (CHOA).
