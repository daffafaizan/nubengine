      memory and muscle control). CPI-1189 may be able to postpone AIDS dementia or slow it down.

      Patients are randomized to receive either placebo or one of two oral doses of CPI-1189 daily.
      Patients are assessed for safety and tolerability during Weeks 2, 6, and 10. At Week 10,
      efficacy assessments are also made. For those who volunteer, a sample of cerebrospinal fluid
      is obtained at baseline and at Week 10. Blood samples for CPI-1189 pharmacokinetic trough
      measurements are taken at Weeks 2 and 10. The open-label phase starts at Week 11. At Weeks 13
      and 16, a safety evaluation is performed. At the end of the open-label phase, Week 22, a
      final set of safety and efficacy assessments and a blood sample for CPI-1189 pharmacokinetic
      trough measurement are obtained.
