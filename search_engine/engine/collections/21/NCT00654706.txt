      patients with schizophrenia who are intolerant to at least one other antipsychotic agent.
      During clinical development sertindole was found to be as effective in the treatment of
      schizophrenia as the first-generation antipsychotic haloperidol and as the second-generation
      antipsychotic risperidone.

      Sertindole is generally well tolerated and has a benign side-effect profile, including an
      absence of sedation, no effect on plasma prolactin levels, moderate weight gain, no
      anticholinergic-mediated cognitive impairment and a low rate of extrapyramidal symptoms
      (EPS). Sertindole has been shown to prolong the QT interval and is contraindicated in
      patients with prolonged QT interval and in patients receiving drugs known to significantly
      prolong the QT interval.

      The study is designed to provide data on the neurocognitive properties of sertindole versus
      quetiapine in patients with schizophrenia. Efficacy for cognitive impairment is assessed in
      patients who are in a stable phase of their illness, with a predefined maximum level of
      symptoms that will allow them to be included in the study. Prior antipsychotic medication
      will be withdrawn (down-tapered) and patients will be randomly assigned to one of the study
      drugs.

      Cognitive deficiencies are an important feature of schizophrenia and correlate strongly with
      functional impairment. Improving functional outcomes in schizophrenia has a high priority and
      has resulted in the initiation of a program called Measurement and Treatment Research to
      Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia (MATRICS) leading to the development of a
      neuropsychological test battery, the MCCB which is used in this study.
