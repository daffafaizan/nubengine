    
      This is a Phase 1b, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter
      study in adult subjects with moderately to severely active UC. Randomization will be
      stratified by Mayo score.

      Subjects will receive either PRV-300 or placebo treatment. Each group will receive study drug
      over a total of 12 weeks, followed by an 8-week safety follow-up period. The total duration
      of the study will be 20 weeks, excluding the screening period.

      The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of PRV-300 for 12 weeks in
      subjects with active UC.

      The secondary objectives are to evaluate the effect of PRV-300 for 12 weeks in subjects with
      active UC on:

        -  Pharmacodynamics: Changes in gene scores in colonic biopsies over the course of
           treatment.

        -  Pharmacokinetics: Peak (Cmax) and trough (Cmin) serum concentrations of PRV-300 in
           subjects with active UC.

        -  Immunogenicity: Immunogenicity of PRV-300 in subjects with active UC

        -  Endoscopic: Trends in endoscopic disease activity in subjects with active UC.
