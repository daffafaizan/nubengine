    
      Subjects demonstrating a successful allergen response to a common allergen received the first
      study treatment and used as instructed for 5 days, after which they entered the Environmental
      Exposure Chamber (EEC) for a 3-hour exposure to a known concentration of the allergen. After
      waiting at least 7 days, subjects received the second study treatment and used as instructed
      for 5 days, after which a 3-hour Conjunctival Allergen Provocation Test (CAPT) was performed
      with an escalating concentration of the allergen. Subjects dosed with study treatment
      approximately 15 minutes prior to each allergen provocation test.
