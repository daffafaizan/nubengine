      (~30minutes), and this kind temperature application is common in clinical neuromuscular or
      sports rehabilitation. Moreover, some studies have proved efficacy of the TS on stroke.
      However, the best parameters and application on different-stage stroke groups have not been
      clearly explored. Moreover, in order to discover the TS intervention influences on
      neuroplasticity, the brain images and the brain mapping are taken in the group A (explained
      in the below). In addition, the kinematic data was also collected in group A. However, the
      above-mentioned three examination are optional. Finally, functional recovery measurements
      (clinical scales) are measured in the three groups.

      There are three groups (90 participants in each group) and their respective TS intervention
      design. In other word, three sub-studies (A, B, C) are under this project. Group A recruited
      90 acute stroke (~ 30 days) and the independent variable is temperature of TS intervention.
      Group B is with sub-acute stroke (3-12 months), undergoing different frequency of TS
      intervention. Group C targets on participants with chronic stroke (> 1 y/o) and this
      variation in TS is intensity of TS application (30 mins vs 60 mins/each session).
