      into four equal groups to receive open flap procedure, 1.2% SMV gel and covering the defect
      with OM (Group I), open flap procedure, 1.2% SMV gel and covering the defect with MPM (Group
      II), open flap procedure, 24% EDTA root surface etching,1.2% SMV gel and then coverage of the
      defect by OM (Goup III), or open flap procedure, 24% EDTA root surface etching, 1.2% SMV gel
      and then coverage of the defect by MPM (Group IV). Plaque index, gingival index,probing
      pocket depth, clinical attachment level, defect base level, crestal bone level, and
      radiodensitometric measurements were measured at baseline and reassessed at 6 and 9 months
      after therapy. Additionally, GCF was collected from group I, II, III and IV at 1,7,14, 21,
      and 30 days in order to evaluate SMV availability and the effect of EDTA root surface etching
      on its availability using High-performance liquid chromatography(HPLC).
