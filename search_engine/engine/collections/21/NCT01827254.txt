      around 1.8 months (based on data from Rini et al.) This retrospective and prospective study
      is designed to estimate the effect of Sutent rechallenge.

      The PFS (estimated from Kaplan-Meier estimate) will be the primary endpoints. In addition,
      the effects of sunitinib at the 2 periods of treatment (i.e. first line sunitinib vs.
      rechallenge) will be compared by Wilcoxon signed-rank test for PFS values and by McNemar test
      for overall response rate (ORR).
