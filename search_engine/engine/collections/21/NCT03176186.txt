      Primary Objective:

      To evaluate whether there is a difference in functional outcome with xenon 50% and oxygen
      during targeted temperature management (TTM) compared with similar oxygen content in air
      during TTM in comatose subjects with sustained restoration of spontaneous circulation (ROSC)
      within 30 minutes after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA).

      Secondary Objective:

      To evaluate whether there is a difference in survival with xenon 50% and oxygen during
      targeted temperature management (TTM) compared with similar oxygen content in air during TTM
      in comatose subjects with sustained restoration of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) within 30
      minutes after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA).
