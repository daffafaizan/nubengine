      their age and health status. Life expectancy estimates for prostate and kidney cancer
      patients will be estimated by age and Charlson comorbidity score cutoffs, and life expectancy
      for bladder cancer patients will be determined using definitions as noted by Cho et al.
      Talking points will be provided to counseling physicians on how to meaningfully communicate
      life expectancy data. Subjects will also complete a computer-based conjoint analysis exercise
      prior to the counseling visit; results will be used to help physicians understand how the
      subject values life expectancy compared with other decision attributes. The control arm will
      consist of the current standard of care for treatment counseling.

      The intervention will be randomized at the level of the patient after stratification by type
      of cancer.

      All participants will be asked to fill out a validated questionnaire to measure decisional
      conflict at the conclusion of their counseling visit. Investigators will audiotape treatment
      counseling visits to allow for qualitative analysis of the quality of communication of life
      expectancy information. Treatment choice will be documented to assess rates of aggressive
      versus non-aggressive treatment among patients with limited life expectancy.
