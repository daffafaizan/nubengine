    
      A Functional Neurological Disorder (FND) is when the brain has difficulties sending and
      receiving signals . As a result people can experience problems in how their body and senses
      work, but there is no physical problem to treat.

      Currently there is little treatment to offer after diagnosis, this study will investigate the
      feasibility and potential benefit to offering a group intervention to people with FND. This
      group intervention will offer chance to access information and the opportunity to meet others
      with the similar difficulties. Eligible participants will be those currently attending
      neurology clinics within NHS Grampian. Participants will complete prior to, during and at 3
      months after the group is completed. These measures include health care use of participants,
      reported physical symptoms, subjective quality of ife and mood we will also take a brief
      measure of attention and concentration. Reported physical symptoms, subjective quality of
      life and mood will also be collected before the first group and at the last group.
