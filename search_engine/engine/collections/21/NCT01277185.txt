      adolescents has been found. Other minority groups have increased calcium absorption
      efficiency at low calcium intakes in contrast to white adolescents. Since Hispanics and
      specifically Mexican Americans will soon comprise an increasing proportion of our population.
      We propose to identify calcium metabolism characteristics in this group. We predict that
      calcium requirements to maximize bone health in this population will be lower than for white
      youth but higher than their current intakes.

      Thus the specific aims of this project include:

        -  to establish calcium requirements

        -  to establish the relationship between calcium intake and calcium absorption

        -  to identify the major physiological parameters(kidney, intestine, bone) that contribute
           to calcium retention in Mexican-American adolescents

      During this two-phase metabolic camp participants will consume either a higher calcium
      diet(1100-2300mg/d) or a lower calcium diet (600-1200mg/d) during the first 3-week phase and
      switch to the opposite regime during the second 3-week phase, with a 2-week washout period in
      between. Subjects will collect all excreta during both phases. Calcium absorption, height,
      weight, and bone density will evaluated throughout the 6-week period of the study.
