      risk for cervical cancer, vaccination rates remain inadequate. This study explored the
      utility of an Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills intervention in promoting HPV
      vaccination knowledge, motivation, and behavioral skills among college aged women.

      Methods: Participants were randomly assigned to a single-session intervention or
      attention-control arm and were assessed at pre-intervention, post-intervention, and at
      1-month follow-up.
