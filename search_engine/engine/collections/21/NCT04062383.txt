      Participants will meet with a member of the study staff (the study "trainer") and complete
      self-report questionnaires assessing health behavior adherence and mental and physical
      health. Then, a study interventionist will provide a treatment manual for the positive
      psychology + motivational interviewing intervention, review the rationale for the initial
      exercise, and assign the first exercise. If the participant is in the positive psychology +
      motivational interviewing condition, the trainer will explain the rationale for both the
      positive psychology and goal-setting and motivational interviewing portions of the program,
      and will be assigned the first exercise. Participants will then be given an accelerometer,
      which they will be asked to wear for 7 days to ensure that they are comfortable with the
      device and that useable data can be obtained from the participant. Participants will then
      complete twelve 30-minute weekly phone sessions with a study trainer. The phone sessions
      primarily will include a review of the prior week's session content and a discussion of the
      rationale and assignment of the next week's exercise/assignment. Upon the completion of these
      calls, a blinded member of the study staff will call participants to administer self-report
      outcome measures. Participants will also be asked to wear an accelerometer at the follow-up
      timepoint as an objective measure of physical activity, which they will return by mail to the
      study staff.
