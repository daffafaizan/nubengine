      Primary

        -  To compare the 5-year overall survival of patients with locally advanced nasopharyngeal
           cancer treated with concurrent cisplatin and radiotherapy with vs without induction
           chemotherapy comprising gemcitabine hydrochloride, carboplatin, and paclitaxel.

      Secondary

        -  To assess and compare the disease-free survival, distant metastases rate, toxicities,
           and quality of life of patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified by N-stage (N0-1 vs N2-3) and are randomized to 1 of 2
      treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive cisplatin IV over 2 hours once weekly on weeks 1-8 and undergo
           intensity-modulated radiotherapy once daily, 5 days a week, on weeks 1-7 (6Â½ weeks for a
           total of 33 fractions).

        -  Arm II: Patients receive induction chemotherapy comprising gemcitabine hydrochloride IV
           over 30 minutes, carboplatin IV over 1 hour, and paclitaxel IV over 1 hour on days 1 and
           8. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 3 courses. Beginning at least 3 weeks after the
           last dose of induction chemotherapy, patients receive cisplatin and undergo radiotherapy
           as in arm I.

      Quality of life is assessed periodically.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 2 months for 1 year, every 4
      months for 1 year, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.
