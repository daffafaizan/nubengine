      early adulthood in about half of patients. Information is needed to clarify the mechanism of
      tic remission in order to guide development of better treatments for this disabling
      condition. For this cross-sectional study, 10 individuals with tic remission and 10
      individuals with persistent Tourette syndrome are being recruited for a one-time study visit.
      10 neurologically normal (non-TS) controls have also been recruited to obtain control
      neuroimaging data. All participants will complete a study questionnaire and a 60-minute MRI
      procedure. Sequences used to compare the groups will be volumetric, diffusion tensor, resting
      state functional connectivity MRI and MR spectroscopy. Our primary hypothesis is that the
      pattern of functional connectivity in individuals with tic remission will be more mature than
      that of those with persistent tics. Secondary hypotheses tested will explore whether the
      other modalities can be used to differentiate tic remission from persistent TS.
