      Therapy (IVET) for phobia of heights (acrophobia) will be tested using a randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Eighty participants will be randomly assigned to one
      of the four treatment conditions: one-session VRET (3 hours) and 50 mg D-Cycloserine (VR-OST
      + DCS, N1=20); one-session VRET (3 hours) and placebo (VR-OST + Pl, N2=20); one-session IVET
      (3 hours) and placebo (IV + Pl, N3=20); or one-session IVET (3 hours) and 50 mg
      D-Cycloserine, (IV + DCS, N4=20). For twenty participants (5 from each group) the treatment
      will be delayed for three weeks and an additional assessment will be conducted as they will
      comprise a Wait List (WL) control group. Behavioral, cognitive and physiological changes in
      acrophobia will be assessed at pre-treatment, post-waitlist, post-treatment and 3 months
      follow-up.
