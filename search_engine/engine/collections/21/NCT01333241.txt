      death from cardiovascular (heart) disease (CVD) in Latina adults. These risk factors may be
      reduced or eliminated through prevention efforts that focus on heart-healthy diets, weight
      reduction, and PA. The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of a 6-month
      community-based lifestyle behavior intervention (LSBI) conducted by lay health advisors and a
      control condition (disaster preparedness and home safety program) on lifestyle behaviors
      -dietary habits and physical activity(primary outcome) and selected physiologic outcomes
      (secondary outcomes) i.e., BMI, waist circumference, blood pressure, measures of
      cholesterol,and fasting blood sugar of Latinas who are overweight/obese. The LSBI includes
      group education (8 classes) and individual teaching and coaching (8 contacts by home visits
      and telephone calls) delivered over a 6-month period. Acceptability and feasibility of the
      intervention is evaluated through examination of women's retention rates and participation in
      classes and home visits.
