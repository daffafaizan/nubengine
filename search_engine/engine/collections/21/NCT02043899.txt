      of cases are high risk and despite extensive treatments outcome is very poor. More than 60%
      of high risk patients suffer relapse or further spread of their disease and long-term
      survival is below 10%. Existing imaging techniques are not sensitive enough to accurately
      assess the level of risk which is critical in determining the best choice of treatment. This
      study will compare a new type of imaging against the existing imaging techniques. The new
      scans use a new tracer called [124I]mIBG which is taken up by the cancer tissue much more
      than by normal tissues. This tracer can be used with a 3D imaging technique called PET/CT to
      pinpoint where the disease has spread and quantify the amount of disease. Patients will be
      those scheduled to have an [123I]mIBG scan for routine care during a planned break in
      treatment.
