      linked to HIV, which can also be sexually transmitted, because both occur in the same
      populations and because STIs and HIV interact biologically. Having an STI other than HIV can
      increase the risk of HIV acquisition and transmission as well as negatively impact HIV
      progression. The population of people who go to clinics specializing in STIs are particularly
      at risk of engaging in risky sexual behaviors and having poor health outcomes-like infection
      with an STI. This study will test the effectiveness of using an educational DVD to reduce
      incidence of risky sexual behaviors and STI acquisition, including risk of HIV, and to
      improve overall health.

      Participation in this study will involve two phases. In Phase 1, participants will complete
      both computerized and paper surveys and watch an educational DVD. The educational DVD may
      include information on diet, physical activity, sleep, smoking, STIs, and stress.
      Participants will be recruited from among people who are already going to the clinic, and
      participation will add approximately 1.5 hours to their visits. In Phase 2, participants will
      be asked to complete four follow-up visits occurring 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after Phase 1.
      During these follow-up visits, participants will complete a 45-minute computerized survey
      similar to that in Phase 1 and provide urine and throat samples for STI testing. All surveys
      will assess health-related thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, including sexual behaviors.
      Participants will be compensated for completing Phase 1 and each visit in Phase 2.
