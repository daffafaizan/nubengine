      in the United States. It is also among the most expensive condition to treat when joint
      replacement surgery is required. Future projections of the prevalence of OA predict an
      increase in prevalence, mainly due to the aging of the population and obesity.

      Total knee replacement (TKR) is the end-stage solution for patients with knee OA. The total
      annual cost of arthritis in the U.S. in 2013 reached over $300 billion. Expenditure is
      expected to grow significantly in response to the increase in prevalence and the projected
      number of TKRs.

      Successful and beneficial non-invasive treatment options for knee OA are limited. More
      specifically, although biomechanics plays an important role in OA disease, the non-surgical
      treatment options addressing biomechanics are scarce with limited effect. AposTherapy is the
      fist biomechanical treatment that was shown to have a significant short-term effect on
      patients with knee OA.

      The main objectives of this study are:

        1. To assess AposTherapy, a non-invasive home-based biomechanical treatment, as an
           alternative treatment for patients who are eligible for TKR.

        2. To assess AposTherapy as a new post-operative rehabilitation tool for patients post TKR.
