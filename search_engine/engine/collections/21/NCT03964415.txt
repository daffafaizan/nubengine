      progress to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), a condition in which the immune system
      is severely compromised, leading to life-threatening conditions. Ad26.Mos4.HIV is a
      tetravalent vaccine composed of Ad26.Mos1.Gag-Pol, Ad26.Mos2.Gag-Pol, Ad26.Mos1.Env, and
      Ad26.Mos2S.Env. Clade C and Mosaic gp140 HIV bivalent vaccine contains: Clade C gp140, HIV-1
      Env gp140 of Clade C, Mosaic gp140, HIV-1 Env gp140, and aluminum phosphate adjuvant.
      Evidences showed that a combination of vaccination with Ad26.Mos.HIV followed by Ad26.Mos.HIV
      together with Clade C gp140 protein in aluminum phosphate adjuvant led to highest level of
      protection observed so far with this vaccine concept. Study comprises of a screening period
      of 45 days, a 12-month vaccination period and a follow-up period of at least 18 months after
      fourth vaccination (until Month 30) in participants who remain HIV-1 negative or up to 6
      months after diagnosis of HIV-1 infection in participants who become HIV-1 infected.
      Participants who completed their Month 30 visit will be followed for HIV infection,
      medically-attended adverse event (MAAEs) and serious adverse events until the end of study
      (Month 30). Primary analysis of vaccine efficacy will evaluate the number of HIV-1 infections
      in the vaccine group compared to number of HIV-1 infections in the placebo group between
      Month 7 and Month X (with 24<=X<=30) in per-protocol population.
