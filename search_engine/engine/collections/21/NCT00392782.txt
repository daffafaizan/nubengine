      Primary

        -  Determine the incidence of disease-free survival at 1 year in patients with acute or
           chronic myeloid leukemias undergoing T-cell-depleted hematopoietic stem cell
           transplantation from HLA-C mismatched, unrelated donors.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the incidence of disease relapse at 1 year in patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Determine the incidence and severity of acute graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) at 100 days
           and chronic GVHD at 1 year in these patients.

        -  Determine the incidence of graft failure at day 100.

        -  Determine the transplant-related mortality of these patients at 1 year.

        -  Determine the overall survival of these patients at 1 year.

      OUTLINE: This is a prospective, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR) epitope mismatch (yes [experimental] vs no
      [control]).

        -  Myeloablative preparative regimen: Patients undergo total body irradiation twice daily
           on days -10 and -9 and receive thiotepa intravenously (IV) over 4 hours on days -8 and
           -7, fludarabine phosphate IV over 30-60 minutes on days -7 to -3, and antithymocyte
           globulin IV over 4-6 hours on days -5 to -2.

        -  Allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) transplantation: Patients undergo
           filgrastim (G-CSF)-mobilized, T-cell-depleted, CD34+-selected allogeneic PBSC
           transplantation on day 0.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for at least 1 year.
