      of partial of total obstruction of the upper airway during sleep. It affects 3.2% of adults
      in Mexico City. These patients have a higher risk of suffering traffic accidents,
      cardiovascular diseases, a lower quality of life and premature death. The association between
      OSAS and heart failure is complex, but it is known that they have a higher risk of myocardial
      dysfunction with OR 2.4 (IC 95% 1.2 - 4.6), with higher mortality against controls. Type 2
      diabetes mellitus (DM2) is a chronic metabolic disease that leads to macro and micro vascular
      damage, and is the first cause of mortality in Mexico (13.8% of all deaths in people older
      than 20 years). Its general prevalence in adults is of 7%. There is a strong association
      between OSAS, insulin resistance and DM2, with studies with 86% of patients with DM2 having
      some degree of sleep apnea reported, with 22.6% having severe OSAS. The presence of DM2
      doubles the risk of cardiovascular disease in men and triples it in women, with coronary
      cardiac disease being the main cause of death. Patients with OSAS have altered myocardial
      function even in asymptomatic state, also patients with DM2 have been shown to have
      abnormalities in myocardial function, myocardial performance and myocardial elongation in
      comparison with a control group. There is no current information about the effect of
      treatment with CPAP on myocardial performance of patients with OSAS, DM2 and obesity.
