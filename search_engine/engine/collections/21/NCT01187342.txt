      posttraumatic stress symptoms as well as to cognitive decline due to stress-related
      hypercortisolemia in the early phase after stroke. Extended MRI studies including a
      functional connectivity (fc-MRI) paradigm have been incorporated to study on subacute
      midbrain neurodegeneration as a possible morphological correlate of functional and clinical
      findings.
