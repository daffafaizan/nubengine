    
      CHR-2845 is a novel type of histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) for use in cancer that, in
      addition to having broad ranging anti-proliferative activity against transformed cells, is
      designed to have an increased therapeutic window against diseases which involve cells of the
      monocyte-macrophage lineage. There are several HDACi's in clinical development and one, SAHA
      (Vorinostat, ZolinzaÂ®), has recently been approved for use in the treatment of cutaneous
      T-cell lymphoma. CHR-2845 is a cell-permeant ester that is metabolised to give an active
      acid, CHR-2847, which selectively accumulates in monocytes and macrophages. This results in a
      20-100 fold increase in anti-proliferative potency of CHR-2845 for monocytic over
      non-monocytic tumour cells. This selectivity should lead to an increased therapeutic window
      in haematological malignancies involving cells of the monocyte lineage (AML M4, AML M5 and
      CMML). In addition, there is increasing evidence that monocytes and macrophages associated
      with some haematological tumours (tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs)) are involved in
      supporting the growth and spread of the tumour. This clinical trial will focus on
      haematological and lymphoid malignancies with the intention of evaluating the safety and
      tolerability of CHR-2845. Additionally it will compare response in patients where
      monocytes/macrophages are important disease drivers, with the response in other patients.
      This will allow an early determination of the potential improvement in therapeutic window
      afforded by the monocyte/macrophage directed HDACi activity.
