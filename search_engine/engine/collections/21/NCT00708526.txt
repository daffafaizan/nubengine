      responsiveness after inhaled anesthesia. In our first clinical study with isoflurane we
      confirmed that the time from turning off the vaporizer to opening of eyes was shortened by an
      average of 62% when the minute ventilation was elevated and the end tidal carbon dioxide
      concentration was kept at 52 mmHg rather than 28 mmHg during emergence. In our second study
      we found that hypercapnia and hyperpnoea accelerated recovery proportionately for sevoflurane
      and desflurane. The benefits of accelerating subject recovery in the operating room may
      extend to the entire recovery period if the subject is more alert and easier to care for when
      they arrive in the post anesthesia care unit.
