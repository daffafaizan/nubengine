      research staff that was centrally trained and certified by the study neuropsychologist to
      conduct the assessments before study commencement. All research staff and patients were
      native Chinese speakers. Neuropsychological assessment was conducted individually in a
      separate room on the day after a dialysis session and required on average approximately 90
      minutes. Global cognitive function was screened by the Chinese Beijing version of the
      Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA-BJ).10 The comprehensive battery of neuropsychological
      tests was designed to assess five cognitive domains: (1) attention/processing speed, using
      Symbol Digit Modalities Test and the Chinese modified version of the Trail Making Test
      A,11,12(2) executive function, using the Chinese modified version of the Trail Making Tests B
      , and a modified version of the Stroop Color-Word Test;13 (3) verbal memory, using the
      Chinese version of the Auditory Verbal Learning Test for short-delay and long-delay free
      recall14 and Complex Figure for visual memory (delayed recall test; Chinese version);12 (4)
      language, using the Chinese modified versions of Boston Naming Test (the 30-item version) and
      Animal Fluency Test;15,16and (5) visuospatial function, using the Rey-Osterrieth Complex
      Figure (copy test).17,18 Depression was assessed using the Hamilton Depression Scale, with
      scores ranging from 0 to 63 and a score of 7 or above suggested as the optimal cutoff for
      suspected depression.
