    
      Study and subjects will be divided into two phases: a pharmacokinetic (PK) and a
      postpharmacokinetic phase. The pharmacokinetic phase will follow a randomized, 2 period, 2
      sequence single dose crossover design. Each period will be 5 days in duration. Within the
      sequence, both an ASP8273 tablet and ASP8273 capsule will be administered under fasted
      condition. The postpharmacokinetic phase will consist of up to 1 cycle (28 days) of
      continuous once daily dosing in post PK phase with ASP8273 capsules. Dose modifications are
      allowed if necessary in post PK phase and they follow a step-wise dose reduction. Subject is
      able to re-escalate dose level if reaction is stable.
