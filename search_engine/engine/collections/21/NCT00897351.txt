        -  To determine the association between polymorphisms in drug metabolizing enzymes and
           lapatinib ditosylate-associated toxicity in patients with hormone-sensitive recurrent
           prostate cancer receiving lapatinib ditosylate on clinical trial ECOG-E5803.

        -  To determine the association between mutations in EGFR, HER-2 and Kras; protein
           expression of HER2, EGFR, MAPK and AKT; polymorphism controlling androgen synthesis; and
           progression-free survival.

      OUTLINE: Tissue and blood samples collected from patients enrolled on clinical trial
      ECOG-E5803 are analyzed for correlative studies. Samples are assessed for HER2, EGFR, MAPK,
      and Akt; EGFR mutations and polymorphisms in CYP3A4; Ras mutations; recently identified
      mutations in HER2-neu and Kras; and additional polymorphisms in the lapatinib ditosylate
      metabolic pathway by automated quantitative IHC. Predictors of efficacy and toxicity are
      analyzed, including markers in the EGFR pathway as predictors of progression-free survival.
