      gestation util delivery. Participants will be randomly assigned to the control group
      (standard care) or the intervention group (intensive lifestyle intervention). The
      intervention will focus on restricting energy intake combined with behavioral lifestyle
      modification through participation in group sessions and individual counseling. The primary
      outcome will be GWG and secondary outcome will be the incidence of GDM.

      Our hypothesis is that intensive lifestyle intervention in overweight/obese pregnant women
      with PCOS will decrease GWG and reduce the incidence of GDM.
