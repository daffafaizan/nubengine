        -  Determine the role of peak delivery time on the tolerability of irinotecan when
           administered with chronomodulated fluorouracil, leucovorin calcium, and oxaliplatin as
           first- or second-line therapy in patients with locoregional or metastatic colorectal
           cancer.

        -  Determine the antitumor activity of this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      participating center, WHO performance status (0-1 vs 2), and line of treatment (first vs
      second). Patients are randomized to receive irinotecan at 1 of 6 different times of the day.

      Patients receive irinotecan IV over 6 hours on day 1 and fluorouracil IV and leucovorin
      calcium IV over 11 hours followed by oxaliplatin IV over 11 hours on days 2-5. Courses repeat
      every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 4 weeks until disease progression and then every 8 weeks
      thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 186 patients (31 per irinotecan administration time) will be
      accrued for this study within 2 years.
