    
      BH4 is an essential cofactor for phenylalanine hydroxylase, tyrosine hydroxylase, tryptophan
      hydroxylase, fatty acid glycerylether oxygenase, and nitric oxide (NO) synthase. Primary
      tetrahydrobiopterin deficiency (PBD) is caused by deficiency of GTP cyclohydrolase I
      (GTP-CH), 6-pyruvoyl-tetrahydropterin synthase (PTPS), or sepiapterin reductase (SR) that
      impairs the biosynthesis of BH4 or by defects in BH4 recycling (pterin-4a-carbinolamine
      dehydratase [PCD] or dihydropteridine reductase [DHPR] deficiency).

      Participants will be randomized into one of 2 cohorts, with each cohort assessing 2 dose
      levels of CNSA-001 via intra-patient escalation.

      Initially, only adult participant(s) (≥18 years) will be enrolled. After the first adult
      participant(s) have completed the study, a Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will review
      safety and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) data, including preliminary efficacy, for
      the adult participant(s). If the data display no safety issues and provide for the prospect
      of clinical benefit in participants ≥12 months to <18 years old, then the eligibility
      criterion for age at time of enrollment will be expanded to include children (≥12 months).
