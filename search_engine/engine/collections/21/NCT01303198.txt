      pressure titration and therapy with the Autoset T device.

      Part 1: After a baseline polysomnography (PSG) a selected group of patients with obstructive
      sleep apnea will be titrated in two more nights in a sleep lab under APAP mode and CPAP mode.
      We compare the sleep quality and the AHI, oxygen saturation, leakage.

      Part 2: Over a time range of 12 weeks the patients got two kinds of therapy modes at home:
      CPAP and APAP (each six weeks. We compare the objective and subjective therapy by compliance,
      device data, Epworth sleepiness scale, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI, german version).
