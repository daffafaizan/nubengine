    
      In this LTFU study, the below objectives will be assessed 36 and 48 weeks after the first
      injection of IMCY-0098 in the study IMCY-T1D-001, in patients treated with IMCY-0098 at three
      doses or placebo:

      Primary Objective The primary objective of this study is to assess the long-term safety.
      Secondary Objective The secondary objective of this study is to evaluate the clinical
      response to IMCY-0098 by assessing disease activity.

      Exploratory Objectives

        -  To evaluate the proinsulin-specific cytolytic CD4+ T cells induced by IMCY-0098

        -  To evaluate the impact of IMCY-0098 on autoreactive T-cell responses specific for
           autoantigens expressed by islet Î²-cells (proinsulin, GAD65, IGRP) on the longer-term.

        -  To evaluate the impact of IMCY-0098 on autoantibodies against GAD65, IA 2, ZnT8 and
           insulin

        -  Transcriptomic analysis on mRNA extracted from samples collected for Immunogenicity
