      treatment with acyclovir for a clinical recurrence of genital herpes and to compare it with
      the pattern of viral shedding during an untreated clinical recurrence of genital herpes.

      Participants are asked to visit the University of Washington Virology Research Clinic for an
      initial screening appointment in which the clinician will ensure eligibility and informed
      consent will be obtained.

      Participants who experience an outbreak during the next year will be asked to call the clinic
      at the beginning of their next outbreak. The clinician will arrange to admit the participant
      to the UW General Clinical Research Center (GCRC) for a 5-day hospitalization stay. During
      hospitalization, participants will take acyclovir (400mg 3 times daily) and genital swabs
      will be collected every 2 hours during the day and every 4 hours at night for 5 days. After
      the last swab has been taken, the study nurse at the GCRC will do a final genital exam and
      the participant will be discharged. Some participants will also be asked to enroll in a
      control arm during which the same procedures will be followed except they will not take
      acyclovir during the recurrence.
