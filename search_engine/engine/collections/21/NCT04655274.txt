      vision impairment and blindness. Cataract surgery is an effective method for restoring visual
      acuity (VA). With the advancement of cataract surgery technique and intraocular lenses (IOL)
      technologies, expectations of patients from cataract surgery have good vision at distance and
      near ranges without using spectacles. The standard IOLs design were monofocal, which offered
      only fixed focal distance. One of the main factors for dissatisfaction after monofocal
      pseudophakic eyes is lack of accommodation. Previous studies demonstrated that this problem
      can be resolved by using diffractive trifocal IOLs. Diffractive trifocal IOLs provide
      effective near, intermediate and distance visual restoration, and has been widely used in
      patients who want to achieve spectacle independence after surgery. However, some possible
      optical side effects of trifocal IOLs have been reported, including halos and other
      dysphotopsias, reduced contrast sensitivity (CS), glare disability, which can significantly
      affect visual quality and patient satisfaction. The purpose of the present study was to
      compare the clinical outcomes such as visual function, refraction errors and visual quality
      of patients undergoing cataract surgery with implantation of two different models of
      diffractive trifocal IOLs: RayOne Trifocal (Rayner IOL, Ltd.) and AcrySof IQ PanOptix (Alcon
      Laboratories, Inc.) IOL.
