    
      This study will be undertaken to compare the efficacy of two closure techniques for excised
      keloids. (1) Clozex, a non-latex, hypoallergenic adhesive polymeric interlaced film designed
      to adhere to proximal wound edges for 7-10 days, will be used after the punch biopsy or
      excision of a keloid and (2) sutures to close a similar second keloid after the punch biopsy
      or excision of a keloid.

      On day 12, the investigator and subject will assess the keloid site(s) with the use of a
      visual analog scale.

      There is an optional follow-up at 3 months and 6 months to assess the recurrence of the
      keloid and the effectiveness of the treatments with a visual analog scale.

      The subject will assess the keloid site(s) with the use of the following visual analog scale:

        1. Cosmetic appearance

        2. Pain

        3. Tenderness

        4. Itching

        5. Oozing

        6. Redness

        7. Warmth

      The investigator will assess the keloid site(s) with the use of this visual analog scale:

        1. Global appearance

        2. Color

        3. Matte/Shiny

        4. Contour

        5. Distortion

        6. Texture

        7. Oozing

        8. Redness

        9. Warmth

       10. Firmness
