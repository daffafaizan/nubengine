      assessing medication compliance post-discharge. Patients are identified on the units and from
      a Beaumont Troy discharge planning master list. Prior to discharge the patients are consented
      and informed they will be contacted to schedule a home visit. During the home visit, the
      medications the patient is currently taking are recorded. Discharge medications are recorded
      from the medical record following the home visit. The Investigator performing the visit is
      blinded to the discharge medications as the intent of the visit is only to collect data and
      not to ensure compliance or make clinical judgment regarding the appropriateness of the
      medication regimen. Anyone 65 or older can be included, who are discharged with medications
      and can consent. Those excluded are patients who do not live in close proximity and those
      discharged to extended or long-term care facilities.
