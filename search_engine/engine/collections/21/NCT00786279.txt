      uncertain. One approach that could minimize the size and duration of such a randomized trial
      would be to assess the effect of alcohol on progression of radiologically-defined
      atherosclerosis.

      We propose a proof-of-principle pilot study of the effect of longer-term alcohol intake on
      atherosclerosis. We will recruit and randomize 40 participants aged 55 and older at high risk
      for CHD to a six-month period of consumption of a single 150 ml glass per day of either 10%
      ethanol (approximating wine) or water. At baseline and after 6 months, we will assess aortic
      atherosclerosis using magnetic resonance imaging. We will determine adherence in several
      ways, including serum markers, dietary recalls, and measurement of unused beverage. The
      primary outcomes in this feasibility study will be compliance with alcohol intake and the two
      MRI examinations. As secondary outcomes, we will measure standard and novel cardiovascular
      risk markers, including inflammatory markers and measures of glucose metabolism. We will
      assess safety on a continual basis, including repeated testing of liver enzymes and blood
      counts.

      If successful, this pilot study will form the basis for a more definitive trial to determine
      the effect of alcohol intake on progression of atherosclerosis, which could itself establish
      the feasibility of even larger, longer-term studies of alcohol intake and occurrence of
      cardiovascular events.
