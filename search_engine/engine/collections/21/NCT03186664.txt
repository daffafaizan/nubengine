      enrolled: 20 out of them in treatment with Sativex (Group A) considered as responders and 20
      treated only with the most common antispastic used in MS (Group B). All the 40 subjects,
      divided into two groups (A: Sativex+Lokomat Training and B: other antispastic+Lokomat
      Training), will perform a neurorobotic-assisted gait training (RAGT, each session will last
      at least 45', 3 times per week, for a total amount of 20 treatment's sessions). All patients
      will undergo a complete blind physical and neurological examination, including evaluation of
      disability by means of the Expanded Disability Scale (EDDS) and assessment of spasticity
      using the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) and the numerical rating scale (NRS). To clarify the
      role of SativexÂ® in improving spasticity gait-related symptoms the following scales will be
      also administered: ten meters walking test (10wt), Ambulation Index (AI). Quality of life
      will be evaluated by means of MSQOL 54. The skilled clinician will be blind to the drug
      treatment.Moreover, some electrophysiological parameters to test cortical excitability will
      be also evaluated: motor evoked potentials (MEP) amplitude, short intracortical inhibition
      (SICI) and facilitation (ICF) from the abductor pollicis brevis muscle (APB) of the most
      affected side. The same assessment will be applied in baseline, at the end of the robotic
      training (T1) and 30 days after the end of the nerehabilitation training (T2).
