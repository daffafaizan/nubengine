    
      This study uses transcranial magnetic stimulation (magnetic pulses delivered through a
      specially designed cap worn on the head aimed at specific motor areas of the brain (brain
      areas responsible for the body's physical movements) to test whether upper-body motor
      function can be improved.

      This is a double-blind study where half of participants will receive active transcranial
      stimulation and the other half of the participants will receive no transcranial magnetic
      stimulation; all participants will wear the cap. Participants and some members of the
      research team will not know who received active magnetic brain stimulation.
