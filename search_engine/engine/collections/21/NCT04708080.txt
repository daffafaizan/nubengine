      systemic methods in the postoperative period reduces mortality and morbidity in many types of
      surgery. Especially the physiological changes that occur with aging, comorbid diseases and
      the drugs used in the treatment of these diseases, the type of surgery performed, the
      postoperative pain treatment and the anesthesia method chosen affect mortality and morbidity
      Thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA) has provided similar benefits in open heart surgery by
      suppressing stress response and increasing functional residual capacity with positive effects
      on the diaphragm, as well as providing good analgesia with thoracic sympathetic block.TEA has
      positive effects on postoperative pulmonary and circulatory system in selected eligible
      patients; It allows earlier extubation and provides excellent analgesia. It has been reported
      that TEA combined with general anesthesia in elective cardiac surgery offers a significant
      advantage compared to general anesthesia in terms of intensive care and hospital stay,
      improvement or morbidity. Studies have shown that TEA reduces surgical stress response,
      improves hemodynamic stability, and reduces the incidence of myocardial ischemia after
      coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) as well as supraventricular arrhythmias in the
      postoperative period .

      Based on these studies, the investigators determined the effects of TEA combined with general
      anesthesia on postoperative respiratory mechanics, analgesia levels, extubation times, length
      of stay in intensive care, arterial blood gases, effects on organ functions, morbidity and
      mortality in geriatric patients with open heart surgery in our hospital. the investigators
      aimed to contribute to the literature by reviewing it retrospectively.
