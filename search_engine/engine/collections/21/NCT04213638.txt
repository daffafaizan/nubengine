      for moderate-to-severe acne vulgaris, through treating moderate-to-severe acne vulgaris
      patient for 1 month, using photodynamic therapy as controlled group, and try to provide
      clinical evidence for the hypothesis that "whether Single Microneedle Radiofrequency therapy
      could be an alternative to photodynamic therapy for moderate to severe acne vulgaris."
