      However, few studies compare the reliability differences among age in postural sway
      measurements even though many studies find significantly greater postural sway in the elder
      population than compared to the younger cohort. Investigation of this age difference is
      important for choosing variables to represent their postural sway improvement in order to
      determine the intervention outcome.
