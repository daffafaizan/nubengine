    
      This is a single site, prospective, non-blinded, non-randomized, noninterventional study
      designed to evaluate the effect of changes in alveolar minute ventilation on the measurement
      of respiratory heat loss (enthalpy). Each patient will serve as their own control. The study
      will enroll adult patients without cardiac or respiratory illness. It is designed to evaluate
      the effect of the ventilatory pattern (tidal volume, rate) on respiratory heat loss measured
      using the VQmâ„¢ monitor during standard intra-operative clinical care that requires positive
      pressure ventilation (PPV)
