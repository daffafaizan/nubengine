      between January 2008 and September 2012. The patients have been operated based on the
      indications and contraindications listed in the Instructions For Use (IFUs) of the implant.

      This study is an extension of the surgeons' data collection as an attempt from Zimmer-Biomet
      to fulfill its post-market surveillance obligations by recovering clinical data
      retrospectively and prospectively.

      Study Procedure Flowchart - retrospective data collection: most patients had clinical
      follow-ups at pre-op, operative, immediate post-op, 3 Months, 1 year, 2, 3, 5, 7 years
      post-surgery during which their surgeons collected clinical data. This data will therefore
      only be collected by Zimmer-Biomet after the patients specifically consent to it.

      Study Procedure Flowchart - prospective data collection: The informed consent signed by the
      patient for this study also allow Zimmer Biomet to collect the data of the standard clinical
      follow-up that will be conducted by the investigators at least 10 years post-surgery.
