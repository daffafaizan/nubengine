      Depression syndromes are commonly associated with chronic, disabling, and fatal diseases. Due
      to the relentless course of HIV infection, there is a certain reluctance to treat the
      associated depression. In other illness, it has been proven that treating the depression
      often results in improvement of overall health status.

      This is a placebo controlled trial. Half of the patients are given imipramine hydrochloride
      every day for 6 weeks. Assessment is done by self reports and the Hamilton Depression Rating
      Scale. Prior to entry all patients are given a psychiatric evaluation. There is a cross over
      phase in which placebo non responders are entered into an open-label study and given
      imipramine hydrochloride.
