      However, many tumors demonstrate a resistance to platinum drugs. Results from preclinical
      studies indicate that picoplatin (previously called AMD473 or ZD0473) may be able to overcome
      or partially overcome platinum resistance. More than 500 patients have received picoplatin in
      previous Phase I or Phase II clinical trials.
