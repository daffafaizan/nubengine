      one of the most important therapeutic methods in patients with glioblastoma. But since
      malignant glioma is a highly invasive tumor, the rate of surgery failure is . So the
      postoperative therapy shall be accompanied by radiotherapy. Since 1998, the clinical
      application of Temozolomide(TMZ) has brought hope for malignant glioma patients with its
      definite curative effect. According to the results of several clinical studies, TMZ
      synchronous plus radiotherapy and subsequent as adjuvant therapy can significantly improve
      the survival rate of newly diagnosed GBM patients and break the survival limit of malignant
      glioma patients. Besides, antiangiogenic therapy is also a choice for the treatment of
      glioblastoma patients. Vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFRs) inhibitors block
      the new formation around the tumor and cut down the supply of oxygen, nutrients and metabolic
      waste, so that the tumor is hard to proliferate and metastases.
