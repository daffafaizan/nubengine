    
      A Randomized controlled clinical trial (RCT) of immediate vs delayed switch from TDF/FTC to
      TAF/FTC to define the impact of switching ARV on BMD in different stages of the aging
      trajectory in HIV infected women. Included is a geriatric assessment based on the
      conceptualization of health transition across menopause.

      Study Hypothesis: The primary hypothesis is that switching from TDF/FTC will improve BMD to a
      degree that correlates with a lower fracture risk in aging HIV+ women. We will further
      explore our theory that the impact is greater in those in the early stages of menopause and
      in those who also receive a protease inhibitor (PI) as the third antiretroviral agent (ARV).

      Primary objectives: To determine if: 1. Switching HIV+ women on TDF/FTC to TAF/FTC increases
      BMD at the spine at 48 weeks relative to those who continue TDF/FTC 2. To determine if any
      observed improvements continue or stabilize in the year after switch.

      Hypothesis generating objectives: To determine if the effect of switching from TDF/FTC to
      TAF/FTC on BMD varies by stage of menopause and by third ARV.

      Study design: This study is double blind placebo controlled randomised, 1:1, multicentre
      strategic trial. Patients will be randomised to immediate vs delayed switch, with
      randomization allocation arranged to minimize differences between treatment group with
      respect to stage of menopause (peri- menopause vs early post menopause) and site. Study
      population: HIV positive women who are in the peri-menopausal period or those within 10 years
      post menopause to capture those with greatest risk of BMD loss. As menopause typically occurs
      earlier in HIV + women we include those aged 45-55 years. They must be on a cART regimen
      containing TDF/FTC with HIV RNA <50 c/ml for at least 6 months.

      Intervention:

        1. Immediate switch of TDF/FTC to TAF/FTC while maintaining the third ARV agent.

        2. Delayed switch of TDF/FTC to TAF/FTC at 48 weeks while maintaining the third ARV agent.

      Randomization: A computer-generated randomization list will be prepared prior to study onset
      by a statistician unassociated with the study. Randomization will be stratified by study
      centre.

      Primary endpoint: Comparison of the immediate vs delayed group in the % change from baseline
      in BMD at the lumbar spine at week 48 and 96.

      Secondary endpoints: Will compare changes between the immediate and delayed group from data
      collected at screening or baseline and weeks 48 and 96.
