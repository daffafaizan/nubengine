      effect. It allows rapid anesthetic emergence even after a prolonged infusion, and decreases
      the at-risk time during extubation. In addition, cough suppression of remifentanil enables
      smooth extubation with reduced complications. However, the infusion of remifentanil
      suppresses the emergence cough effectively in clinical practice, whereas it still delays the
      awakening from anesthesia, resulting in prolonged emergence time. Reduced Ce of remifentanil
      during emergence would decrease the adverse events that are associated with remifentanil
      infusion.
