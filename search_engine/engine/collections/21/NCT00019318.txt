    
      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the toxic effects and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of
      depsipeptide in patients with incurable solid tumors (per 3/29/00 notification, only patients
      with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma are being accrued). II. Determine antineoplastic activity of
      depsipeptide in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation, multicenter study. Patients receive depsipeptide IV over
      4 hours on days 1 and 5. Treatment continues every 21 days in the absences of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of
      depsipeptide. If 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity at a given dose level,
      escalation ceases and the maximum tolerated dose is defined as the previous dose level .

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 48 patients will be accrued for this study within 18-24
      months.
