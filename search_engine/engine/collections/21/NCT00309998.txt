      Primary

        -  Estimate the median time to disease progression in older patients with non-squamous
           stage IIIB or stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with vinorelbine
           ditartate and bevacizumab.

      Secondary

        -  Estimate the response rate in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Estimate the median survival in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Evaluate the safety of the combination of vinorelbine ditartate and bevacizumab in older
           patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.

      Patients receive vinorelbine ditartate IV over 6 to 10 minutes on days 1 and 8 and
      bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days in the absence of
      unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study.
