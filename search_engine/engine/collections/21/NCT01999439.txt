    
      Eosinophilic esophagitis(EoE) is a form of chronic inflammation affecting the esophagus which
      often results in wall thickening and esophageal stiffening and is associated with
      complications, such as esophageal tears and strictures (narrowings). Chronic dysphagia and
      acute food impaction (swallowed food stuck in the esophagus) are common symptoms of EoE and
      are associated with esophageal wall thickening and stiffness.

      Current diagnostic techniques such as endoscopy with biopsy give only limited information
      about changes in the esophageal wall in eosinophilic esophagitis(EoE). In routine clinical
      practice, repeat endoscopic evaluation with biopsy is commonly performed about 3-6 months
      after initial therapy for eosinophilic esophagitis(EoE). However, follow-up endoscopy with
      biopsy has drawbacks as it is invasive, costly and typically requires deep sedation or
      general anesthesia.

      We propose to evaluate quantitative MRI as a potential non-invasive diagnostic option for
      evaluating esophageal wall remodeling in patients with eosinophilic esophagitis(EoE).
