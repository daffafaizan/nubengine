    
      -  Asymptomatic women who undergo breast screening with ultrasound and has breast masses of
           Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) category 3 or higher will be examined
           with conventional B-mode US as well as combined elasto-doppler US by breast
           radiologists.

        -  The likelihood of malignancy and BI-RADS category of the breast masses are assessed for
           each dataset of B-mode US alone and B-mode US with elasto-doppler US, respectively.

        -  Reference standard: Biopsy or 1 year of follow-up examination.

        -  The positive-predictive value, sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy
           (assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) are evaluated
           and compared between B-mode US alone and B-mode US with elasto-doppler US.
