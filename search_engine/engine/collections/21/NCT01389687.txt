    
      Study participants will receive three doses of inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) (at each visit
      and given 3-8 weeks apart) as a three-dose primary vaccination starting at 3-68 months of age
      and followed by a single dose of IPV as a booster vaccination 6-18 months after completion of
      the three-dose primary vaccination.

      Subjects will be observed by the Investigator or sub-Investigator for 30 minutes following
      the vaccine injection.

      The duration of each participant's participation in the trial will be approximately 1 year.
