      using varied, multiple-joint movements, with less-intense active recovery periods, may offer
      an attractive, time efficient alternative to traditional aerobic exercise. Variations of HIFT
      such as Cross Fit, home workout videos (ie.P90x and Insanity), and boot-camp style group
      exercise classes have become increasingly popular.

      The cardiovascular benefits of HIFT have been demonstrated; however, by doing this study
      researchers hope to get more information regarding the potential effectiveness of HIFT for
      weight management, such as the actual level of energy expenditure and exercise intensity
      elicited by a HIFT session.
