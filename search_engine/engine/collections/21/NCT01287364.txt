    
      This is an open-label, randomized, multicenter, 2-way crossover study in subjects 12 years or
      older with perennial allergic rhinitis (PAR) to evaluate the psychometric properties of a
      novel-patient administered assessment of treatment satisfaction with and preference of an
      INCS. Subjects will be randomized to 1 of 2 treatment sequences:

      Sequence 1: Treatment Period 1 = ciclesonide hydrofluoroalkane (HFA) nasal aerosol 80 μg once
      daily; Treatment Period 2 = mometasone nasal inhalation 200 μg once daily

      Sequence 2: Treatment Period 1 = mometasone nasal inhalation 200 μg once daily; Treatment
      Period 2 = ciclesonide HFA nasal aerosol 80 μg once daily

      Total study participation will be approximately 8 weeks including a 3-week screening/baseline
      phase, a 1-week treatment period, a 1- to 2- week washout phase between treatments, a second
      1-week treatment period consisting of the alternate treatment, and an additional 1-week
      follow up period after the last dose of study drug to assess safety. Subjects are required to
      continue to meet eligibility criteria for the second treatment period.

      Nasal symptoms will be evaluated daily from 7 days prior to the first dose of study drug in
      Treatment Period 1 through the last dose of study drug in Treatment Period 2. The Allergic
      Rhinitis Satisfaction and Preference (ARTSP) and other Modules from the Phase V® e-Health
      Outcomes Information System (Phase V Technologies, Wellesley MA) will be completed two times
      during each treatment period (before the first dose and on the day after the last dose) via
      the internet at the clinical site. Patient preference will be evaluated at the day after last
      dose only.
