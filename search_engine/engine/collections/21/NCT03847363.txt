      healing time of normal tissue (usually 3 months), that was, a status that the damage caused
      by noxious stimulus had been healed, but the pain that cannot be explained by disease and
      inflammation were still existed. Due to the location of the incision and the necessity of
      indwelling the chest tube, the thoracic lung surgery was considered to be one of the most
      painful surgical operations. Studies have found that the incidences of CPSP in patients with
      thoracotomy were 57% (95% CI, 51-64%) and 47% (95% CI, 39-56%) at postoperative 3 and 6
      months, respectively. With the development of minimally invasive techniques, thoracic surgery
      had gradually become less traumatic, and the number of surgical incisions was gradually
      developed into single port.Through ages, epidural analgesia with a combination of local
      anesthetics and opioids had long been considered the "gold standard" for postoperative
      analgesia in thoracic surgery. However, with the development of clinical anesthetics and the
      widespread use of nerve block techniques, it had been found that in open radical gastrectomy,
      there was no significant difference in the inhibition of intraoperative stress response
      between dexmedetomidine combined with general anesthesia and a combined general-epidural
      anesthesia. So, which anesthesia and analgesia method was "perfect" for a specific type of
      surgery procedure? This study would compare acute and chronic postsurgical pain in patients
      underwent different thoracic surgery procedure with different anesthesia and analgesia
      methods, and explore the influencing factors.
