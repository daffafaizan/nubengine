      application effect of the existing prediction model. The clinical data of the acute ischemic
      stroke intravenous thrombolytic population is collected retrospectively, mainly including
      baseline indicators and 7 days after thrombolysis Internal bleeding, based on the existing
      prediction models (HAT, SIT-sICH, THRIVE), calculate the prediction probability, and compare
      it with the actual bleeding situation, evaluate the clinical application effect of the
      prediction model, use ROC curve, calibration curve, sensitivity and Evaluation of indicators
      such as specificity. Using retrospective data, using multivariate logistic regression to
      analyze the predictive value of baseline clinical indicators, screening risk factors, and
      optimizing the HAT, SIT-sICH, and THRIVE prediction models. The logistic regression model is
      used to construct an improved HT prediction model based on the AIC principle; the method of
      model comparison is used to combine the clinical significance of the indicators to complete
      the construction of the prediction model. The second part is to evaluate the clinical
      application effect of the improved prediction model, and prospectively collect clinical data
      of AIS patients undergoing intravenous thrombolysis in Shenzhen Second People's Hospital,
      Shenzhen Longhua District People's Hospital, including general demographic data and
      laboratory tests Baseline indicators such as imaging examinations, bleeding within 7 days
      after thrombolysis, etc., were used to verify the improved HT prediction model using ROC
      curve, calibration curve, sensitivity and specificity, and external verification was
      performed to evaluate the prediction effect of the model.
