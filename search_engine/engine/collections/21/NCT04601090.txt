      Norwegian ICUS' has two different aims. The first aim is to synthesis data from a National
      register (Norwegian Intensive care register-NIR) on all COVID-19 patients in Norway admitted
      to an ICU. These results are of great public interest for many reasons. First of all, it will
      give us information on the severity of this novel virus, but also how the health care system
      has coped in treating the severe cases that was admitted to an ICU. The results will
      potentially be compared to other patient populations with viral pneumonia, but most
      interestingly to survival rates from other countries. In addition, the data will give us a
      description on how the distribution of severe cases of COVID-19 have been within Norway
      (e.g., gender, age, health regions etc.) The second aim of this study is to measure and
      describe health related challenges COVID-19 patients may experience during their first year
      from ICU admission. The health-related domains that will be investigated will capture both
      mental, physical and cognitive health. Knowledge from other patient population admitted to an
      ICU with acute respiratory failure, indicates that these are the main domains that negatively
      affect the activity of daily living. Physical, mental and cognitive health challenges will be
      investigated for the Norwegian COVID -19 population admitted to ICU, and will give important
      insight to the impact COVID-19 can have on survivors of severe cases, as well as the need for
      rehabilitation.
