      used to it for many years but the effect is not well because of continuous pain caused by the
      dislocation of broken rib. Surgical stabiliazation of rib fractures can relieve the pain
      rapidly and help patient recover to work early. This kind of surgery is constantly conducted
      with tracheal intubation and general anesthesia. However,adverse effects such as sore throat,
      pain, hoarseness, and respiratory complications are common after that. So we think perform
      surgical stabiliazation of rib fractures under awake or appropriate sedation without
      endotracheal intubation keeping spontaneous respiration to investigate its safety and
      feasibility.
