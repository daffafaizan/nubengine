      obtain hemodynamic steady state. A blood pressure cuff (Hokanson) will be placed around the
      forearm (distal to the Doppler transducer) and rapidly inflated to 250 mmHg for 5 minutes
      (circulatory arrest). Simultaneous ultrasound images of the vessel (B-mode) and Doppler
      waveforms will be collected 10 seconds prior to and for 2 minutes following deflation of the
      cuff. All B-mode images will be analyzed using automated edge detection software (Medical
      Imaging Applications), while intensity weighted velocity spectra segments will be saved to
      the GE Logiq 7 hard drive for off-line blood velocity waveform analysis. P.I. has utilized
      the traditional method of brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD) induced by reactive
      hyperemia to assess vascular endothelial function in populations ranging from young healthy
      adults to older adults with pathological conditions.

      Spygmocor - Pulse Wave Velocity (PWV) - A SpygmocorÂ® device will be used at baseline and
      following each protocol to assess PWV. PWV analysis provides a non-invasive assessment of
      arterial stiffness. Increased arterial stiffness is known to be associated with
      cardiovascular disease. The participant is required to lie in a resting position for
      approximately 30-45 minutes. The research assistant will place ECG electrode sensors at the
      carotid, femoral, radial and distal artery locations. A highly sensitive pen-like device,
      called a tonometer, is then gently applied to record the velocity of the blood flow between
      each of the points.
