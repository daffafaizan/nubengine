      I. To assess overall survival from the date of diagnosis in subjects with stage IV gastric or
      gastroesophageal cancer and positive cytology or carcinomatosis after cytoreduction,
      gastrectomy, and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy administration.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the safety of cytoreduction, gastrectomy, and hyperthermic intraperitoneal
      chemotherapy administration for subjects with gastric or gastroesophageal cancer and positive
      cytology or carcinomatosis.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) comprised of mitomycin and
      cisplatin given intraperitoneally over 60 minutes during standard of care cytoreduction and
      gastrectomy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up within 4 weeks, and then every
      6 months for 5 years.
