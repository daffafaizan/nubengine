      the hypothesis that, compared to placebo, 7-10 days' administration of tofacitinib 5mg twice
      daily has positive effects on emotional and reward processing in patients with
      treatment-resistant depression (TRD) and elevated C-reactive protein (hs-CRP; a marker of
      inflammation). Patients will have been diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder using the
      Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 and will have shown non-response to at least 2
      adequate antidepressant trials.They will also have a plasma hs-CRP of 1mg/L or greater.
      During the study patients will continue their antidepressant treatment. Participants will be
      randomised to receive 7-10 days treatment with either tofacitinib 5 mg twice daily or a
      matched placebo. This study includes three visits in total: a screening visit; research visit
      1 (includes cognitive tests) and research visit 2 (to include an MRI scan as well as
      cognitive tests).
