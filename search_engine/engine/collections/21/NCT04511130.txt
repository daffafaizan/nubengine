    
      This study is in patients aged ≥18 years old undergoing or having relapsed after their first
      allogeneic HSCT (matched sibling, matched unrelated donor, or haploidentical transplants) for
      AML.

      Potential patients for the study may be screened/enrolled:

      • Prior to their first allogeneic HSCT.

      or

      • Patients experiencing their first relapse post-allogeneic transplant.

      Patients eligible for the study will be placed into one of two groups:

        -  Adjuvant (Group 1): Patients screened prior to their HSCT with CR without minimal
           residual disease (CRMRD-) at 90 days post transplant will be randomized (1:1) in an
           unblinded fashion to:

             -  MT-401 (Arm A)

             -  SOC (Arm B)

        -  Active Disease: (Group 2): Patients meeting the following criteria will be assigned to
           Group 2 and will receive MT 401:

             -  Patients who experience relapse (patients with MRD [MRD+] or frank relapse) at or
                prior to post-transplant Day 90

             -  Patients in Arm B of Group 1 (SOC) who develop relapse (MRD+ or frank relapse)
                post-HSCT (crossover patients)

             -  Patients who do not consent prior to HSCT but are experiencing their first relapse
                (MRD+ or frank relapse) and have the same donor available for manufacturing
