      (NHL) and present with more adverse prognostic features than aggressive histology B-cell NHL
      . Correspondingly, they have an overall poorer prognosis than B-cell lymphomas, achieving
      lower complete response rates, freedom from progression and overall survival with
      conventional anthracycline-based CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and
      prednisone) chemotherapy. Fewer than 30% of patients are cured with therapy. New treatments
      that replicate the improved survivals with chemo-immunotherapy for B-cell lymphomas are
      needed. Alemtuzumab is a humanized murine antibody that binds to a ubiquitous lymphoid marker
      CD52 and is efficacious (as monotherapy) in related lymphoproliferative diseases. Combining
      alemtuzumab with CHOP chemotherapy may improve the response rates and outcomes of patients
      with this sub-type of NHL. The combination must be first tested in a dose escalation fashion
      to establish the dosage of the doublet because of the potential for overlapping or
      exaggerated toxicities.

      This prospective, multi-center, open label Phase I-II study will enroll 22-84 patients with
      newly diagnosed previously untreated aggressive histology peripheral T-cell lymphomas. In the
      Phase I component, patients will be sequentially enrolled in cohorts of three patients and
      treated with increasing doses of alemtuzumab administered in combination with standard CHOP
      chemotherapy. When the maximal tolerated dose is determined, this dose and schedule will then
      be tested in up to 46 patients using a Simon two stage Phase II design.
