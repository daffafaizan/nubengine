      Group one receives a modified PECS 2 (thoracic wall) block above the second intercostal space
      with injection between the Musculus serratus anterior and Musculus pectoralis minor.

      Group 2 receives a subpectoral block under the pectoralis major muscle at the medial boarder
      of the axillary triangle.
