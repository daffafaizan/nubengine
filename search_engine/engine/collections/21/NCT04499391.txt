      across the United States through collaborations with our stakeholders. Nursing homes will be
      randomized to one of two arms: 1) AHRQ-funded COVID-19 ECHO that includes 16 weekly
      telehealth sessions addressing COVID-19 guidelines and best practices or 2) AHRQ-funded
      COVID-19 ECHO plus an additional 9 sessions with a focus on CDC infection control training.
      Randomization will be stratified by characteristics of nursing homes to ensure balance among
      the two trial groups, including size (number of beds),geographic location, and current
      COVID-19 infection rate. Patient-centered outcomes (nursing home residents with COVID-19
      infections, hospitalizations, deaths, and QOL) will be assessed at baseline, 4, 6, 12, and 18
      months. Our study is guided by the RE-AIM framework to critically evaluate both effectiveness
      and implementation outcomes of the proposed intervention. The RE-AIM framework is frequently
      utilized to improve sustainable adoption and implementation of effective, generalizable,
      evidence-based interventions like Project ECHO.
