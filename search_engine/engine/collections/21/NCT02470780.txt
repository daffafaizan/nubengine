      of Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO) using two hydrogen breath tests.
      SIBO-positive individuals will be eligible to enroll, and randomized to receive either
      rifaximin or placebo. This study includes two treatment regimens (including a placebo
      control), designed so that all patients will receive the active drug at some point during the
      trial. Motor outcomes will be followed for 3 or 6 months following enrollment, depending on
      the treatment arm to which the subject has been assigned. The primary endpoint is to assess
      the effect of rifaximin treatment to decrease "off" time in SIBO-positive PD patients.

      This pilot study will support the design of a larger, randomized controlled trial
      investigating the effect of SIBO eradication on reducing motor complications in PD patients
      with motor fluctuations. The current proposal is designed to demonstrate our ability to
      detect and treat SIBO in PD patients with motor fluctuations, to inform selection of the best
      SIBO detection method, to determine the optimal timeline for assessing motor endpoints, and
      to estimate the duration of benefits after treatment.
