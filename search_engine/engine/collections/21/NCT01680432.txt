      randomized and controlled trial.

      Population and study sample:

      The study population comprised of individuals who will use the Unified Service Health System,
      the Family Health Strategy,Brazil, participating groups of Nutritional Education. This
      population is comprised of approximately seventy individuals, but this number is quite
      relative, it depends on the participation. The approach of research subjects will be done
      through an invitation, conducted orally through the Community Health Agents (CHA), during
      home visits monthly. During the period of one month, the CHA invite to attend a lecture given
      by the student Diane Favretto, who will speak constipation on the subject and propose the

      questions to assess the lifestyle (dietary habits, intake of net) associated diseases and
      medications will be made to collect these data.

      The weight of the participant will be measured using portable scale brand and the individual
      is placed standing bare foot in the center of scale with light clothing, with arms out
      stretched to the side, with out moving. To measure the height measuring tape will be set at
      flat wall with no baseboard and individuals will be placed in an upright position, standing
      with bare feet parallel and heels, shoulders and buttocks touching the wall. The Body Mass
      Index is calculated from data on weight and height (kg / mÂ²) and classified according to the
