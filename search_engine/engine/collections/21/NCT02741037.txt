      78% are overweight or obese. Compared to women in all other ethnic groups, Mexican-American
      women have the highest lifetime risk of type 2 diabetes. The development of culturally
      appropriate lifestyle interventions for this population is an urgent priority, and the
      proposed study accordingly will investigate a novel dyadic intervention designed to improve
      health behaviors and promote weight loss in two at-risk members of the same family: mothers
      with type 2 diabetes and their overweight/obese adult daughters who are at risk for
      developing diabetes. The intervention, Unidas por la Vida (United for Life), capitalizes on
      the importance of the family in Latino culture to mobilize an existing family dyad as a
      source of mutual support that is likely to foster greater and longer-lasting health behavior
      change. The study builds on a successful pilot study (R34 DK083500) that established the
      feasibility and acceptability of this dyadic behavioral lifestyle intervention in a high-risk
      sample of Mexican-American family members who share a risk for diabetes and its
      complications. The 16-week intervention was modeled after the Diabetes Prevention Program
      (DPP), but was adapted for use with mother daughter pairs and to be community-based and,
      thus, more easily accessible to low-income Latinas. Preliminary data from the Unidas pilot
      study indicated that the dyadic intervention promoted significant weight loss. The proposed
      study extends the successful pilot study to: 1) target weight loss > 5% of baseline body
      weight and to foster maintenance using a tapered intervention, 2) add comparison groups that
      permit evaluation of the improvement uniquely associated with the partner intervention, and
      3) assess theoretically derived mediators of the intervention. Participants (N=460
      mother-adult daughter dyads) will be randomized into one of three conditions: 1) dyadic
      (mother-daughter) participation in a Unidas partner intervention (Arm 1); 2) individual
      participation (mothers alone; unrelated daughters alone) in a Unidas individual intervention
      (Arm 2); and 3) mother-daughter dyad in a usual care only condition (Arm 3).
