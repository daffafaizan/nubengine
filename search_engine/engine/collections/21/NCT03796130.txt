      The participants will be randomly allocated into two groups.

      In group (1): myomectomy will be performed before ART

      In group (2):women will have their trial of ART without myomectomy

      In group A, ART will be performed 3 months after myomectomy if the uterine cavity is not
      opened and 6 months after myomectomy upon inadvertent opening of the uterine cavity during
      surgery
