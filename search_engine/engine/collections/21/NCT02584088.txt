      intervention is sought when medical management fails. Endometrial ablation or desiccation of
      the endometrium using minimally invasive instruments has been utilized in this scenario. The
      current mainstay intervention is non-resectoscopic radio frequency ablation. These procedures
      have high satisfaction rates (81 to 93%) similar to hysterectomy and leave up to 47% of
      patients amenorrheic. Post operative complications, both short and long term, and failure
      rates have been well studied. A limited number of studies have been performed to assess the
      histologic state of the post ablative endometrium and fewer assessing the radiographic
      appearance of the endometrium. Therefore, this current study aims to describe the
      ultrasonographic appearance of the post ablative endometrium and uterus.
