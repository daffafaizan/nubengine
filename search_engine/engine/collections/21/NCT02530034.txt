      I. To determine the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and minimum safe and biologically-effective
      dose of Hu8F4 when administered intravenously in patients with leukemia or myelodysplastic
      syndrome (MDS).

      II. To determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) of Hu8F4 following study drug administration.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To observe the anti-leukemia effects of Hu8F4 in patients with leukemias and MDS.

      II. To measure the overall survival, disease-free survival and event-free survival of
      patients with leukemias or MDS treated with Hu8F4.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive anti-PR1/HLA-A2 monoclonal antibody Hu8F4 intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes
      on days 1 and 15. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.
