    
      DantonicÂ® (T89) is a botanical drug consists of extracts of Danshen (Radix Salviae
      Miltiorrhizae) and Sanqi (Radix Notoginseng) with borneol in a capsule form. The drug is
      currently approved in 26 countries outside the USA for the treatment and prevention of
      chronic stable angina pectoris and other cardiovascular disease related conditions. This
      pivotal confirmative Phase III clinical trial is to confirm the efficacy and safety of the
      drug at 150mg and 225mg doses in the prevention and treatment of angina pectoris in patients
      with Chronic Stable Angina. The contribution of the main herb Danshen to, and the difference
      of various production batches in, the overall efficacy and safety profiles will also be
      explored. Patients will take a morning and an evening dose orally (every 12 hours) for 6
      weeks while stop taking any long-acting nitroglycerin, ranolazine, and/or multiple
      beta-blockers or beta blocker(s) with calcium channel blocker during the trial. Single
      beta-blocker and/or on-demand short acting nitroglycerin to relief angina pectoris is allowed
      during the trial. After physical exams and if eligible to participation, patients will stop
      taking other drugs, and undergo two baseline screen Exercise Treadmill Tests (ETT) on
      Standard Bruce Protocol in the clinic one week before and right before starting the drug
      treatment. Patients will perform three more ETTs before the morning dose at the end of week
      2, 4 and 6 after receiving the drug treatment. The primary efficiency endpoint is the change
      of symptom-limited Total Exercise Duration of the ETT at the end of the 4th week of treatment
      from the average of the two screening baselines compared with that of placebo treatment.
