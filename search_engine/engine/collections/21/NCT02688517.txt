      I. To obtain blood and tumor tissue for next-generation sequencing and determine the
      frequency of finding genomic alterations for which there are clinically available
      (commercially or research based) targeted therapies. Treating clinicians will be provided
      with relevant validated mutation data for treatment or referral of the patient to pertinent
      studies.

      II. To collect clinical outcomes of patients with actionable mutations for which sequencing
      has been performed.

      III. To obtain whole tumor genome data for data storage and future computational analysis and
      correlation with clinical data.

      IV. To obtain tumor tissue for development of future in vitro and in vivo cancer models.

      OUTLINE:

      Previously collected tissue samples are analyzed for the presence of mutations via next
      generation sequencing. Patients may also undergo collection of blood samples for analysis of
      circulating cell-free deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and circulating tumor cells.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and then every
      6 months for 3 years.
