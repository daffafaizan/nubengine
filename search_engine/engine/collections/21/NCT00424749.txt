      eosinophilia that causes glomerulonephritis in about 25% of patients. Rituximab is a chimeric
      anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody that depletes B cells and is effective in numerous autoimmune
      disease including antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis. The aim
      of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Rituximab in inducing remission of
      renal disease activity in patients with CSS.
