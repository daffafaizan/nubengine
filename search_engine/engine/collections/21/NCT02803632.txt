      reflected by the > 100% occupation rate of the Amiens University Hospital Adolescent Medicine
      Unit. New approaches have been proposed to these problems that have led us to reorganize our
      diagnostic practices: 1) more precise characterization of suicidal behaviour by using
      standardized instruments such as the French version of the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating
      Scale developed by Posner (C-SSRS); 2) new clinical entities, such as disruptive mood
      dysregulation disorder, are now proposed in international classifications (DSM 5 field
      trial); 3) investigations such as recording of the circadian rhythm of motor activity by
      actigraphy are being studied as a laboratory complement to psychiatric diagnosis.
