      and urethra in outpatient clinic.1 Although a UDS is a reliable tool for accurate diagnosis,
      the process itself can be accompanied by discomfort and pain as it includes the positioning
      the catheters urethral and rectally, and the bladder filling. Reports of having such invasive
      outpatient process whilst awake may demonstrate pain and disquiet that result in incomplete
      examinations and patient noncompliance2,3.

      Various pharmacologic options including lidocaine gel and catheter tip lubrication for
      urethral catheterization were used to relieve pain and anxiety during UDS. Besides, there are
      some non-pharmalogical methods such as patient education, heating pad, music, distraction and
      relaxation4-6.

      Music has been considered complementary treatment modality as cheap, safe and effective. In
      various urological procedures including cystoscopy, transrectal prostate biopsy and
      extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) music has been proven helpful on pain and
      anxiety levels 7-10. However, current literature presents limited and controversial data
      evaluating the influence of music on pain and anxiety perspective of the patient during UDS.
      We, therefore, aimed to assess the effect of music on patient satisfaction in a analgesic and
      anxiolytic way during UDS.
