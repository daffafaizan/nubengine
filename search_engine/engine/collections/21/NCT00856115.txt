        -  Identify and examine the factors that influence appraisal and diagnostic delay by
           focusing on recognition, perception, communication, and response to pre-diagnosis cancer
           symptoms in African American and Caucasian patients with newly diagnosed colorectal
           cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to race
      (African-American vs Caucasian) and gender (male vs female).

      Patients undergo a 45-60 minute interview to obtain information on variations in symptom
      perception, assessment, and patient-physician communication process. Patients are assessed by
      sociodemographic characteristics (i.e, education, gender, age, insurance status, employment
      status, income, race/ethnicity, and religiosity), information of close confidants (i.e.,
      relationship, family history of cancer, and caregiver/decision-making status), and physician
      characteristics. Patients are also assessed by the Trust in the Health Care System, DMPQ,
      RCS, Brief COPE scale, Lukwago Religiosity scale, and RAND Social Support Survey
      questionnaires.

      Patient charts are reviewed to obtain medical data.
