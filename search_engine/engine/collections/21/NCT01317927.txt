      with solid tumor or hematological malignancies. Upon providing informed consent and
      satisfying screening procedures, eligible subjects will report to the clinic for Part I of
      the study 14 days before the first dose of belinostat (Day -14) for clinical laboratory
      tests, warfarin (5mg) single dose and a series PK collections. On days 1-5 of each 21-day
      cycle patients will receive belinostat 1000mg/m*2 and will have a series of subsequent PK
      samples collected. On day 3 of cycle 1 only, the patient will also receive warfarin 5mg
      single dose prior to belinostat infusion. PK samples, urine samples, electrocardiogram (ECG)
      and safety measurements will be collected from Day 1 through Day 10 of cycle one. If it is in
      the interest of the patient, belinostat can be continued during Part II- extension phase for
      5 additional cycles of belinostat treatment on days 1-5 of each subsequent cycle, or until
      disease progression, patient withdraws consent or if unacceptable toxicity occurs. During the
      extension phase routine physical exams, laboratory tests and safety and efficacy assessments
      will be performed. Disease evaluations will be conducted per standard of care. Patients who
      discontinue for reasons other than disease progression will be followed until new anti-cancer
      treatment is initiated or death.
