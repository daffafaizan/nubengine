      Depression is known to be associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease (CHD),
      and with adverse outcomes among older adults with CHD. Recent evidence suggests that
      depression is also associated with an increased risk of congestive heart failure, and with
      adverse outcomes among older adults with congestive heart failure. However, the mechanisms by
      which depression leads to congestive heart failure are not known

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      To determine the mechanisms of association between depression and CHF, the investigators will
      use an existing cohort of 1024 older adults (mean age 67) with CHD (including 680 with no
      heart failure and 344 with clinical or subclinical heart failure) who were recruited between
      September 2000 and December 2002 for "The Heart and Soul Study." The Heart and Soul Study was
      originally designed to understand the mechanism of association between depression and CHD.
      Since patients with CHD are at high risk for CHF, this well-characterized cohort will provide
      a unique opportunity to examine the relation between depression and CHF. At baseline,
      participants completed a depression interview (Diagnostic Interview Schedule); full exercise
      treadmill testing with stress echocardiography; 24-hour Holter monitoring for heart rate
      variability; 24-hour urine collection for cortisol and norepinephrine; venous blood
      measurements for lipids, platelet reactivity, and C-reactive protein; and an extensive
      questionnaire. Participants have been followed annually by telephone. The investigators will
      invite all participants to return for a 5-year examination, and will follow them for an
      additional 3 years thereafter, to determine (a) the independent association between baseline
      depression and CHF, and (b) the extent to which 5-vear changes in biological and behavioral
      factors associated with depression explain the relation between depression and CHF. By
      identifying the mechanisms that explain the relation between depression and CHF, this study
      will enable them to target specific areas for improving the treatment of these patients.
