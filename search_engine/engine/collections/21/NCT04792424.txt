      CRRT. In RCA circuit, there was a monitoring of pre-filter (systemic) ionized calcium and
      post-filter (circuit) ionized calcium. Pre-filter ionized calcium was monitored for observe
      the adverse effect of citrate such as hypocalcemia, citrate intoxication. However,
      post-filter ionized calcium was monitored for adjustment the citrate dose. We find many
      problem with frequently monitoring of post-ionized calcium such as confusion from markedly
      abnormal result, how to adjustment the citrate dose ,and increase workload for nurses. We
      hypothesis that if we can monitoring of post-filter ionized calcium?
