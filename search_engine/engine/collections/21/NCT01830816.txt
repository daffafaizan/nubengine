      participants with cancer and either normal renal function or severe renal impairment,
      including end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring hemodialysis. This study characterized the
      PK, safety and efficacy of ixazomib.

      The study enrolled 41 participants (37 multiple myeloma and 4 advanced solid tumor). The
      study was conducted in 2 parts, Part A and Part B. Participants were enrolled to receive:

        -  Ixazomib 3.0 mg

      In Part A, all participants were asked to take one 3 mg ixazomib capsule, orally on Day 1.
      Participants who tolerated ixazomib in Part A had the option of continuing the study by
      participating in Part B. In Part B, participants received ixazomib (4, 3, or 2.3 mg per
      protocol) on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day cycle until participants experienced disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      This multicenter trial was conducted at 6 study sites in the United States and Canada. The
      overall time to participate in this study was 435 days. Participants made multiple scheduled
      visits to the clinic.
