      real-time, remote, telefluoroscopic evaluation of oropharyngeal swallowing function. The
      investigators will achieve this goal by testing the hypothesis that oropharyngeal swallowing
      function evaluated by an experienced speech-language pathologist (SLP) using a remote,
      interactive, real-time, dynamic Internet telefluoroscopic procedure, which was developed in
      the PI's laboratory, has an acceptable level of agreement with the evaluations performed by
      an experienced SLP who is present in the fluoroscopy suite and using the traditional
      videofluoroscopic methodology. In other words, the primary aim of this investigation is to
      determine whether the telemedicine approach to evaluation of swallowing function is reliable
      relative to the traditional method by which a clinician is in direct contact with a patient
      for a pre-examination interview, clinical examination, and videofluoroscopic evaluation of
      swallowing function. Confirmation of the reliability of the telefluoroscopic evaluation of
      oropharyngeal dysphagia (hereafter referred to as dysphagia) can result in equity of access
      for underserved groups for whom SLPs with expertise in evaluating swallowing function are
      locally unavailable. Ultimately, the success of this project could translate specialty
      services into routine clinical practice across the United States and globally.
