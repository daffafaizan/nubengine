      randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover study. Since the goal of the open label study is to
      inform the double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study, the investigators are citing
      the hypothesis of the latter solely for providing context. The investigators hypothesize that
      the administration of DMT will result in neuroplastic changes in healthy and depressed
      subjects. These changes in neuroplasticity will be indexed using electroencephalographic
      (EEG) measures and tasks. These neuronal changes may in parallel cause changes in mood
      measured both in healthy and depressed subjects, which will be captured using appropriate
      psychometric measures of mood.
