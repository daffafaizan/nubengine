      outcomes including increased likelihood that clinicians and families understand and comply
      with a patient's wishes, reduces hospitalization at the end of life, results in less
      intensive treatments at the end of life (according to patients' wishes) and increases use of
      hospice services. Trials have not been done in primary care. The aim of this study is to
      determine the efficacy of a care pathway designed to increase the quality and quantity of ACP
      in patients and their substitute decision-makers in primary care. The study is a multi-site,
      patient-based, unblinded, randomized trial conducted in family practices in Canada.
      Participants will be patients who are determined by their physician to be able to benefit
      from ACP, and the patient's substitute decision-maker. Participant pairs will be randomized
      to immediate intervention (care pathway) or delayed (8-12 weeks). The intervention is guided
      use of tools and decision aids to clarify values and preferences for treatments in the event
      of serious illness or near end of life. The outcomes will be presence of a goals of care form
      in the chart, substitute decision-maker engagement in ACP (including self-efficacy for
      enacting the role), patient engagement in ACP, and decisional conflict.
