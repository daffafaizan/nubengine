      diftitox therapy to induce peripheral immune tolerance in participants presenting with
      non-infectious intermediate and posterior uveitis. This will be performed using a Phase I/II
      pilot study. Subjects whose disease is controlled on daclizumab therapy will have their
      daclizumab-dosing interval progressively increased by one-week increments. If and when they
      experience signs or symptoms of an ocular flare, they will be treated with denileukin
      diftitox, 24 hours after which they will receive their usual dose of daclizumab. Participants
      may receive up to 12 such cycles of daclizumab/denileukin diftitox therapy. When the
      daclizumab-dosing interval is 10 weeks long or less than 10% of their CD4 T cell CD25 is
      occupied by daclizumab, therapy will be discontinued. Following discontinuation of daclizumab
      patients will be followed for recurrence of ocular disease. Failure to reach this study point
      after 12 cycles or disease recurrence following discontinuation of therapy will constitute a
      study failure. The primary outcome will be the ability of the participant to be successfully
      tapered off daclizumab while their disease remains quiet (vitreous haze less than or equal to
      Trace) at week 104 while receiving no concomitant systemic immunosuppressive medications.
