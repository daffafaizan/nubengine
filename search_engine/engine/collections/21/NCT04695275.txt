      studies have shown that although the incidence of community-acquired pneumonia in children
      has decreased with the application of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, the incidence of
      empyema has increased, which raises the difficulty to disease treatment, and aggravates the
      financial burden on medical care.

      Streptococcus is one of the most common pathogens causing children's empyema. In recent
      years, although more and more researches are reported on children's community- acquired
      pneumonia or pleural effusion, the clinical studies on streptococcus pneumoniae empyema are
      rarely mentioned. Therefore, a multicenter observational study is needed to better understand
      the clinical characteristics and reversion of children with empyema, observe the effect of
      streptococcus vaccine application on serotype of streptococcus, and explore the
      susceptibility factors of streptococcus empyema in children in China. The study mentioned
      above will contribute to optimize the treatment strategy of streptococcus empyema for the
      future, and reduce the incidence of children's empyema.

      The trial will be completed in 3 years with 100 participants taken from hospitals in
      partnership with clinical research collaboration of National Clinical Research Center for
      Respiratory Diseases, China.
