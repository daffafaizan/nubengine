      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of veliparib (ABT-888) in combination with
      capecitabine and temozolomide in patients with advanced well-differentiated neuroendocrine
      tumors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      2. To determine the safety profile of the combination of capecitabine, temozolomide and
      veliparib in patients with advanced well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors (NET).

      3. To evaluate the antitumor activity of the combination of capecitabine, temozolomide and
      veliparib in advanced well-differentiated NET patients

      4. To determine progression-free survival (PFS) of the combination of capecitabine,
      temozolomide, and veliparib in advanced well-differentiated NET patients IV. To evaluate the
      association between pharmacodynamic biomarkers and response in patients with advanced
      well-differentiated NET patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of veliparib.

      Patients receive capecitabine orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-14, temozolomide PO BID
      on days 10-14 and veliparib PO BID on days 10-14. Courses repeat every 28 days for up to 12
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks.
