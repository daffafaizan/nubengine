      ejection fraction (HFpEF syndrome). Current therapy for systolic heart failure is targeted at
      inducing vasodilation and counteracting neuro-endocrine activation. There is a lack of a
      corresponding evidence base for the treatment of HEpEF. We have previously shown that
      perhexiline, an agent that increases the efficiency of energy production by shifting
      substrate utilization from free fatty acids towards glucose, was highly effective in
      improving exercise capacity, symptoms and cardiac function in patients with systolic heart
      failure. We have also recently shown that energy deficiency plays a major role in the
      pathophysiology of HFpEF. In this proposal we therefore aim to investigate the effectiveness
      of perhexiline in 70 HFpEF patients, in a 3 month randomised, double-blind, controlled trial.
      An interim analysis is planned after 20 patients.
