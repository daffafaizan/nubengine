      of 8 cycles of induction treatment with anti-HER2 therapy. Arm A subjects will receive the
      experimental therapy, palbociclib, in addition to their current anti-HER2 therapy and
      endocrine therapy. Arm B subjects will continue to receive the anti-HER2 therapy. It is
      expected that the addition of palbociclib to the first-line treatment of HER2 disease will
      delay the onset of therapeutic resistance and ultimately prolong the survival of patients
      with metastatic breast cancer. The study is designed to treat the subset of patients with
      HER2+ disease who are also hormone receptor positive (HR+). It is also expected that
      palbociclib will modulate the endocrine resistance in HER2+/HR+ disease and potentiate the
      benefits of anti-HER2 therapy. Lastly, the current study includes a comprehensive molecular
      characterization of the disease at study entrance which will allow us to investigate the
      benefits of palbociclib in subsets of HER2+/HR+ disease such as PIK3CA mutant.
