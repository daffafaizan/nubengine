      blood, it is often necessary to obtain larger quantities of plasma or leukocytes than can be
      safely obtained by simple phlebotomy. These components can be easily and safely obtained
      using apheresis procedures performed in the Apheresis Clinic of the Department of Transfusion
      Medicine, Clinical Center. This protocol is specifically designed to conform to the
      requirements of the Apheresis Clinic for donors to have apheresis procedures, but the
      protocol in itself is not a research protocol. Patients must first be admitted to another
      approved clinical research protocol of the NIAID before they may have the apheresis
      procedures described in this protocol. Family members and healthy volunteers may undergo
      apheresis using only this protocol, without the necessity for entry into any other protocol.
