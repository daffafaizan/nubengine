    
      Only patients presenting with non-metastatic MIBC on conventional CT scan are eligible for
      the trial.

      Additionally, 2 18F FDG-PET-CT scans per patient will be performed, prior and after
      neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. All patients will have a radical treatment to the bladder either
      by radical cystectomy or trimodality therapy.

      In case of diagnosis of oligometastatic disease on 1 of both FDG-PET-CT's, a metastasis
      directed therapy to the oligometastatic sites will be added.

      In case of polymetastatic disease on FDG-PET-CT, additional immunotherapy will be
      administered (this is standard of care after chemotherapy failure)
