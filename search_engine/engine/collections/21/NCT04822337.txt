      arm phase II expansion in high risk, NDMM. The phase I portion of the protocol will utilize a
      standard 3+3 dose escalation design to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and RP2D of
      the KRd-belantamab mafodotin combination. The phase II portion of the trial is a two-stage
      design that will assess the efficacy and safety of the combination in newly diagnosed,
      high-risk MM patients.
