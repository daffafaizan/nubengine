      many challenges. The frequent presence of confounding factors such as illicit drug use,
      depression, and cirrhosis has the potential to produce cognitive impairment and therefore
      obscuring the role of HCV infection as a major actor in the development of cognitive
      impairment.

      The presence of brain dysfunction in patients with liver cirrhosis is well known. Zeegen et
      al. described in 1970, through the use of neuropsychological tests, the occurrence of
      cognitive changes involving mainly psychomotor speed, attention, and executive function in
      cirrhotics who did not have clinical criteria for hepatic encephalopathy. This condition is
      currently called minimal hepatic encephalopathy.
