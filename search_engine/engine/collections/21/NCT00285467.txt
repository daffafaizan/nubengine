      cholecalciferol (4000 U per day for one month then 2000 IU daily thereafter) or
      doxercalciferol (2.5 mcg po daily. Assessments for blood endpoints (primary end point PTH;
      secondary calcium, phosphorus) were done monthly. Other assessments (blood pressure) were
      done at baseline and at 3 months.
