      Primary

        -  Determine the time to progression and time to death from progression in patients with
           recurrent or refractory metastatic unresectable colorectal cancer treated with
           fluorouracil, leucovorin calcium, and irinotecan.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the objective response and stabilization rate in patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Determine the time to treatment failure in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the duration of response in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine overall survival rate in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the incidence of grade 3 or 4 toxicity in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study.

      Patients receive leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours on day 1, irinotecan IV over 1 hour on
      days 1 and 3, and fluorouracil IV continuously over 46 hours beginning on day 1. Courses
      repeat every 2 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 78 patients will be accrued for this study within 18 months.
