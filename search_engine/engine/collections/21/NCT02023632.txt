      they tend to sustain their involvement to a greater extent than when they exercise on their
      own. Despite the potential for groups to sustain long-term physical activity behaviours,
      there appears to be an important caveat that comes with exercising with others: if people
      perceive themselves to be similar to other members of a given group, in terms of salient
      underlying qualities, this corresponds positively with their attraction to, and level of
      involvement within, that group. If, however, people perceive themselves to be distinctly
      different from others within their social group, this is likely to undermine their attraction
      to, and involvement in that group. Recent research by Dr. Beauchamp and his team suggests
      that across the adult age spectrum people report a positive preference for exercising within
      groups that are comprised of others their own age, and when they participate in such classes
      they display higher levels of adherence to the group. In a similar regard, people report
      comparable positive preferences for same-gender rather than mixed-gender physical activity
      group settings. However, to date, research has yet to examine these effects using an
      experimental (RCT) design. This constitutes the purpose of this present trial.
