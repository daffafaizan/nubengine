      of patients with cancer. Apart from the studies that in an indirect way demonstrated an
      increase in the survival of oncological patients who, because of presenting a venous
      thromboembolism episode, were treated with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) in comparison
      with those treated with non-fractionated heparin; direct actions were also demonstrated from
      the use of heparin in the survival and tumour progression. The administration of LMWH
      together with Chemotherapy has been proved to increase the survival of patients diagnosed of
      cancer of the pancreas in relation to those only treated with chemotherapy. An increase in
      the global survival of advanced solid tumours, with no thromboembolic disease,has also been
      showed.

      All this suggests that an improvement in the survival of patients is observed when heparin is
      added to the usual anti-tumour treatment, especially to those without spread disease, and
      this effect seems to be independent of the protection against the thromboembolic
      complications.
