      in English and Dutch: "The Arm Function in Multiple Sclerosis Questionnaire (AMSQ)". The
      questionnaire groups 31 items and was created from questionnaires developed for other
      pathologies. The Dutch team that developed this questionnaire combines biostatisticians and
      neurologists, experts in the development and validation of disability measurement tools.

      This study aims to validate the French version of AMSQ questionnaire. This study is carried
      out in collaboration with the Amsterdam team, which has carried out the methodology and will
      conduct the statistical analysis.
