      block of standard high-risk consolidation chemotherapy. Blinatumomab is administered as a
      continuous intravenous infusion (CIVI). One cycle of blinatumomab treatment includes 4 weeks
      of CIVI of blinatumomab. After completing consolidation therapy, the patients should undergo
      alloHSCT depending on their bone marrow status. The patients will be followed up until the
      last subject on study is 36 months following alloHSCT or has died, whichever is first.
