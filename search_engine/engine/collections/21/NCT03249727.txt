      of cancer based on imaging, sigmoidoscopy or clinical exam. Subjects in categories P3 and P4
      are scheduled for colonoscopy for one of the following reasons: suspicion of having an
      inflammatory bowel condition, rectal bleeding, presence of occult blood in stool, unexplained
      iron deficiency anemia, recent change in bowel habits, family history of CRC or adenomatous
      polyps or other hereditary colorectal diseases. Often, colonoscopy is not performed within
      the government-prescribed recommended delays, leading to waiting lists for the procedure.
      Analysis of NK cell activity may help identify those at risk for the presence of CRC and
      therefore help prioritize subjects on these waiting lists, help manage resources and help
      convince subjects to have a colonoscopy. Furthermore, all subjects will undergo a FIT,
      allowing a determination of the ability of each test alone, as well as a combination of NK
      Vue and FIT, to predict outcome on colonoscopy.
