      the age of 18. The chronic course of this disease means that approximately one quarter of all
      IBD patients will need to transition from being cared for by a pediatric gastroenterologist
      to an adult gastroenterologist. Studies in other chronic disease states have identified
      several problems with the current means of transitioning care from a pediatrician to the
      adult caregiver including lack of adherence with the proposed treatment, lack of knowledge
      about the disease, and limited self-care skills. Even without IBD, this can be a time of
      tremendous turmoil for the adolescent patient. For the chronically ill IBD patient, this
      stress is further intensified by the underlying illness. Several studies have shown that the
      risk of flare is increased by non-adherence with medical treatment. The main factors
      associated with poor adherence include young age and either being under the doctor's care for
      less than one year or being a new patient for that doctor. Therefore, young adults
      transferring care from a pediatric gastroenterologist to an adult gastroenterologist are at
      the highest risk for a bad outcome.

      Several recommendations have been published on how to best transition the adolescent IBD
      patient from pediatric to adult care. The general consensus is that there should be a gradual
      age specific increase in patient autonomy and involvement in their care prior to being
      transitioned to an adult gastroenterologist. No study however has incorporated combined
      clinic visits for the patient with both the pediatric and adult IBD specialist. Furthermore,
      although these recommendations make logical sense, they have not been assessed objectively.
