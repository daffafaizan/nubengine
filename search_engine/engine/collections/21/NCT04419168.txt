      tailored specifically for the target population through a user-centered approach that has
      engaged stakeholders at each stage of the process.

        1. Computerized cognitive behavioral therapy (cCBT) for pain. The cCBT program will teach
           users how to recognize negative thoughts and emotions, use cognitive skills and
           problem-solving, and apply coping behaviors such as distraction, activity scheduling,
           and relaxation. The cCBT arm emphasizes skills acquisition and learning through
           practice; this intervention is consistent with the tailored behavioral services patients
           would receive individually or as a group when working with a psychologist or behavioral
           pain specialist.

        2. Mobile-delivered pain and sickle cell disease education (m-Education). The m-Education
           program will teach users about chronic pain, healthy lifestyle tips (e.g., nutrition and
           exercise), and facts about SCD. This program is consistent with the education patients
           and families would receive with a patient educator.
