    
      This is a prospective, randomized, controlled and international multicenter study. The
      investigators aim to analyze the accuracy of LAT annotation using a novel algorithmic method
      (Wavefront, CARTO, Biosense Webster, Diamond Bar, California, USA) (WF), based on automatic
      annotation of the maximal negative slope of the unipolar electrogram (U-EGM) within the
      window demarcated by the B-EGM, by comparison with conventional, manual annotation in a
      multicenter cohort of patients referred for PVC ablation. Further on, the automatic
      annotation of LAT will be aided by an ECG recognition pattern algorithm (included in the last
      version of CARTO), which is intended to avoid wrong annotation of ventricular complexes other
      than the clinical PVC. The investigators hypothesize that automatic LAT annotation (using WF
      and the ECG recognition algorithm) could be superior to conventional, manual annotation in
      terms of mapping success and could reduce both procedure time and radiofrequency time.
