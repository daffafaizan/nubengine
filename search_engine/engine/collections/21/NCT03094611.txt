      I. To evaluate the objective response rate of low dose of inotuzumab ozogamicin as measured
      by the hematologic remission rate (complete remission [CR] + CR with incomplete platelet
      recovery [CRp] + CR with incomplete bone marrow recovery [CRi]) in patients in first, second
      or later salvage setting.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the overall safety profile and the efficacy; the efficacy is measured by the
      hematologic response rate (CR + CRi + PR), durations of response (DoR) and remission (DoR1),
      progression free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive inotuzumab ozogamicin intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 1, 8 and 15 of
      cycle 1 and on days 1 and 8 beginning cycle 2. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6
      cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients whose disease
      gets worse after responding for 3 months, may be retreated for up to 6 additional cycles.
      Patients whose disease responds to treatment may receive up to 5 additional cycles.
