      chronic-relapsing nature. In a phase III study alitretinoin was clinically effective for
      patients with severe chronic hand eczema refractory to topical treatment. This study
      investigates the safety and efficacy of alitretinoin who previously have participated in a
      clinical trial involving alitretinoin.
