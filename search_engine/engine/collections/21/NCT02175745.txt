      18F-FDOPA) positron emission tomography (PET) with standard magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
      in measuring tumors in patients with glioma that is newly diagnosed or recurrent (has
      returned). 18F-FDOPA is a radioactive drug that binds to tumor cells and is captured in
      images by PET. Computed tomography (CT) and MRI are used with PET to describe information
      regarding the function, location, and size of the tumor. PET/CT or PET/MRI may be more
      accurate than standard MRI in helping doctors find and measure brain tumors.
