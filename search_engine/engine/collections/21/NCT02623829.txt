      in post-excisional repairs for the purpose of preventing excess scar formation. The end
      points will be the evaluation of each scar using the Manchester Scar Scale.

      All MSS and mMSS assessments will be performed in a standardized fashion. The mMSS
      assessments will be blinded and performed by board-certified dermatologists in the Department
      of Dermatology, Faculty Practice Associates, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New
      York City.
