      aneurysm in the Department of Cardiac surgery of the University Hospital Ghent, Belgium, and
      with gradients at rest across the aortic valve of <20mmHg, a graded exercise test on a
      bicycle (stepwise increase of afterload) will be performed, and the gradient across the
      aortic valve will be monitored by transthoracic echocardiography at each exercise level.
      Patients with tricuspid and bicuspid valves will be compared. An age matched, unoperated, and
      asymptomatic control group with normal functioning tricuspid and bicuspid valves will be
      examined with the same exercise protocol.

      The purpose of the study is the description of the gradients across the aortic valve during
      exercise, and the discrimination of risk factors that may induce increased gradients.

      The hypothesis is that patients with bicuspid valves will demonstrate higher gradients than
      patients with tricuspid valves, in operated and unoperated individuals.
