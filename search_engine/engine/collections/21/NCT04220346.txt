      been several randomized controlled trials using video and game techniques, which are
      distractions to reduce pain and anxiety during painful procedures, no randomized controlled
      trials using playing the game with Tablet to reduce pain and anxiety during circumcision have
      been found. Non-pharmacological studies, such as play therapy, are needed to reduce pain and
      anxiety in school-age children undergoing circumcision under local anesthesia. The aim of
      this study is to provide evidence about the effectiveness of playing the game with Tablet
      used to reduce pain and anxiety during circumcision, and to contribute to nursing care in
      pain management.
