    
      The goal of the registry was to collect clinical data of TREOVANCE® device in subjects with
      infrarenal aortic aneurysms, specifically to evaluate if the diseased pathology is treated
      with an acceptable technical success rate, an acceptable complication rate and that the
      device performs as expected.

      The following endovascular measures/parameters were assessed for preliminary performance at
      the follow-up intervals: delivery/deployment, stent-graft migration, stent-graft patency,
      stent-graft integrity, endoleak, aneurysm sac size changes, limb ischemia, and vascular
      access complications.

      This registry was a prospective, multi-center, post-market non-randomized study. The goal was
      to gather safety and performance data on the device. Subjects diagnosed with infrarenal
      aortic aneurysms enrolled into the registry were treated with the TREOVANCE® Stent-Graft with
      Navitel® Delivery System. Pre-procedure baseline data was gathered as well as post-procedure
      assessments prior to hospital discharge and 1, 6, and 12 months post-implantation.
