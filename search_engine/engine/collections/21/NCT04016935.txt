      of endocrine therapy in women with estrogen receptor-positive (ER+), human epidermal growth
      factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-) early stage breast cancer, with or without treatment with
      adjuvant chemotherapy. The test provides an individualized EPclin score based on the tumor
      gene expression, tumor size and nodal status, and categorizes patients as High or Low risk of
      distant recurrence.

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the distant recurrence-free survival
      (DRFS) at 5-10 years in patients with ER+/HER2- early stage breast cancer with EPclin Low
      scores that did not extend endocrine therapy.

      Data collection is prospective and patient enrollment is expected to occur over 24 months.
      The study will enroll patients who are near the 5-year post-diagnosis time point when
      decisions on extending endocrine therapy are being made. Patient breast cancer tumors, stored
      from surgical collection after initial diagnosis, will be tested with EndoPredict and a
      report generated. The provider will convey the report results to the patient and establish a
      treatment plan to continue or forgo endocrine therapy. Patients will then be followed for 6
      years with data collection every year, and outcomes (distant and local disease recurrence,
      second primary breast cancer, etc.) recorded.

      The associations between outcomes and treatment, EPclin score and risk category, EP molecular
      score, and clinicopathologic features will be investigated in all patients and in
      subpopulations (node negative, node positive, treated with or without chemotherapy, etc.).
