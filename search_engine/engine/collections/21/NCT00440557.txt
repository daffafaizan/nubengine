    
      This is a open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), randomized (the
      study medication is assigned by chance), multicenter study designed to show that 2
      alternative dosing regimens, once weekly and once every-2-weeks (given at doses equivalent to
      50 IU/kg 3 times a week) are not inferior to the 3-times-weekly dosing regimen. Approximately
      375 patients with anemia will be enrolled in this study. Patients will be randomly assigned
      to receive epoetin alfa by subcutaneous (SC) injection according to one of the following 3
      regimens: 3 times weekly (Group 1), once weekly (Group 2), or once every 2 weeks (Group 3)
      for 22 weeks. Thereafter, patients in Group 1 will be switched to the once-weekly dosing
      regimen for an additional 22 weeks, and patients in Groups 2 and 3 will continue their
      current treatment for an additional 22 weeks. The total duration of the open-label treatment
      phase is 44 weeks which will include initiation and maintenance treatment periods (with the
      goal of increasing, then maintaining, the hemoglobin level between 11.0 and 11.9 g/dL
      inclusive) and a safety period (to assess longer exposure to epoetin alfa treatment and any
      period of hemoglobin instability during the transition from 3-times-weekly to once-weekly
      dosing). Starting doses of epoetin alfa in the 3-times-weekly, once-weekly, and every-2-weeks
      groups will be 50 IU/kg, 10,000 IU, and 20,000 IU, respectively; thereafter adjusted
      according to weekly hemoglobin concentrations. Safety evaluations will include assessment of
      adverse events, laboratory tests, physical examinations, and vital signs.
