      blocks the formation of estrogens and androgenic precursors in the body. Toremifene blocks
      circulating and intracellular estrogens from stimulating estrogen receptors in breast cancer
      cells. The goal of therapy with atamestane, an aromatase inhibitor, in combination with the
      estrogen receptor antagonist, toremifene, is to achieve maximal suppression of estrogen
      stimulation of breast cancer cells. This study is designed to determine whether combination
      therapy will lengthen the time to disease progression and the rate of objective response
      compared to single agent aromatase inhibitor therapy with letrozole.
