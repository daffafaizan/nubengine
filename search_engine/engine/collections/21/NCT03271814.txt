      cognitive impairment, psychosis and other symptoms, and high comorbidity. Unfortunately,
      current therapies have limited effectiveness in treating some of the symptoms and most of the
      cognitive deficits. Alternative biological models of the disease are needed for developing
      new and more effective treatment. Neuroinflammation has increasingly been implicated in the
      pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Patients with schizophrenia have signs of low-grade,
      chronic inflammation, including elevated blood levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and other
      immune markers. Administration of LPS is the standard immune challenge to investigate the
      body's immune response in a wide range of disorders. Our goal is to use LPS to investigate
      whether schizophrenia patients have abnormal immune response to LPS and whether the
      abnormality is associated with specific brain imaging biomarkers.
