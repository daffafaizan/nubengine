      at risk for, or have, mobility impairment, as measured by slow gait speed and self-reported
      mobility difficulty and self-reported sedentary lifestyle. All participants will receive the
      time restricted feeding intervention, which will consist of limiting the time in which food
      is consumed to 8 hours per day and fasting for 16 hours per day. The study will also assess
      the variance of inflammatory markers, walking speed, physical and cognitive function, grip
      strength, body measurements, perceived fatigability, health related quality of life and
      activity level. This allows the refinement of the design, recruitment yields, target
      population, adherence, retention, and tolerability of a larger scale study.
