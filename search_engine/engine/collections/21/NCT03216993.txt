      with poor outcome in critical patients. To reach an adequate amount of energy and protein is
      critical in patients with respiratory failure and with mechanical ventilation, as it prevents
      muscle dystrophy and thus prevents ICU acquired weakness, leading to a better outcome in the
      end. Enteral Nutrition is preferred as it prevents gut dysfunction in respiratory failure
      patients, and may prevent further infection. But there are many challenge in implement a good
      enteral nutrition therapy, and energy or protein deficiency is common in patient with
      respiratory failure. There have been many protocols aiming at reaching enough enteral
      nutrition for ICU patients, most of which are based on a background of western and developed
      countries. The investigators developped a enteral nutrition protocol based on an unique
      cultural background of eastern developing country, trying to help the ICU patients reaching
      nutrition target, so that the patients may have better outcome.
