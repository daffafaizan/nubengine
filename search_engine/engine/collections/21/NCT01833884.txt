    
      To evaluate the decrease of cytokines concentration with a prognostic value as markers of
      response, the dosage of TARC, IL-6, IL1-RA, sCD30 and TNFR1 will be performed during
      treatment at :diagnosis, cycle 1 day 15, cycle 2 Day 1, cycle 3 Day 1, Day 1 of consolidation

      an early follow-up with a dosage of cytokines will be performed 3 months after the end of
      treatment.

      An evaluation for Event Free Survival will be done at 3 years from diagnosis.
