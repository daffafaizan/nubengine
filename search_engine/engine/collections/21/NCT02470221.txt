      gynecological malignancies or elective major orthopaedic surgery under prone position in
      Peking Union Medical College Hospital. The study included two stages.

      In the first stage, one cohort of 300 participants with conventional fluid therapy will be
      involved, in which 150 patients will be selected with laparotomy of gynecological
      malignancies and150 patients will be selected with orthopedic surgery. All the participants
      in this stage will follow conventional fluid therapy to direct the amount of intraoperative
      fluid. Specifically, the fluid will be administered based on the principle crystalloid
      solution (colloid solution =2-3:1). The total volume of fluid will be adjusted in accordance
      with blood pressure, heart rate and urine output of each patient. It is a standard procedure
      in Peking Union Medical College Hospital. Then, the incidence of postoperative complications
      of each group will be recorded. In addition, sample size will be estimated based on above
      study's results (estimated 100 participants).

      In the second stage, goal-directed therapy will be applied to another cohort of 300
      participants, in which 150 patients undergoing laparotomy of gynecological malignancies and
      150 patients undergoing orthopedic surgery. Specifically, the fluid will be administered
      based upon real-time monitoring stroke volume variation and cardiac output achieved by the
      Flo-Trac monitoring system. The incidence of postoperative complications of each group will
      be recorded.
