      cycles of IPGDP (ifosfamide 1.2g/m2 iv on days 3-5; pegaspargase 2000U/m2 im on day 1;
      gemcitabine 800mg/m2 iv on days 3,8; cisplatin 25 mg/m2 iv on days 3-5; dexamethasone 20mg/m2
      iv on days 3-6) chemotherapy. Then patients undergo radiotherapy. If the disease is
      considered to progress or as stable during chemotherapy, the patient will directly receive
      radiotherapy. Patients in another arm receive radiotherapy followed by IPGDP regimen
      chemotherapy. IPGDP regimen for both arms are 3 cycles, which is repeated every 3 weeks.

      The second Part: Patients receive 6 cycles of ifosfamide 1.2g/m2 iv on days 3-5; pegaspargase
      2000U/m2 im on day 1; gemcitabine 800mg/m2 iv on days 3,8; cisplatin 25 mg/m2 iv on days 3-5;
      dexamethasone 20mg/m2 iv on days 3-6. IPGDP regimen is repeated every 3 weeks. If the disease
      is considered to progress or as stable after 2 cycles or 4 cycles of chemotherapy, the
      patient will withdraw from this study.
