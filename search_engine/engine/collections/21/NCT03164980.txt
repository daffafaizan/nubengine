    
      This is a multicenter, randomized, controlled, open-label study including patients with
      recurrent, platinum-sensitive, ovarian, peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer.

      The main scope of the trial is to evaluate QoL during chemotherapy comparing trabectedin/PLD
      with other standard platinum-based chemotherapy in platinum-sensitive disease.

      Patients with recurrent, platinum-sensitive, ovarian, fallopian tube and peritoneal cancer
      will be stratified according to surgery for relapse (R0 vs. R1/2 resection) vs. no surgery in
      the same setting and age (< 75 years vs. â‰¥ 75 years), and randomized 1:1 to receive either
      trabectedin/PLD (Arm A) or one of 3 platinum-based standard therapies without bevacizumab
      (Arm B, "other standard therapy"). In case of randomization to "other standard therapy", the
      investigator has the choice between carboplatin/PLD, carboplatin/gemcitabine and
      carboplatin/paclitaxel. Patients in both treatment arms will receive chemotherapy up for 6
      cycles or until disease progression (PD), unacceptable toxicities or patient's wish to stop
      therapy, whichever occurs first.
