    
      1. Establish in an open label clinical trial the tolerability and safety of various doses
           of l-histidine and lodosyn that may increase levels of l-histidine and histamine in the
           serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).

        2. Perform pharmacokinetic studies in serum and CSF of study subjects the levels of
           l-histidine and histamine after treatment with various combination of l-histidine and
           lodosyn.

        3. Preliminary information will also be collected on the effects of this intervention on
           alleviation of fatigue.

      The findings from this study go beyond the effects of histamine on fatigue. If central
      histamine can be increased by the strategy outlined above, a number of other vegetative
      hypothalamic functions intricately associated with fatigue including sleep, cognition and
      satiety need to be examined in MS patients in future studies.
