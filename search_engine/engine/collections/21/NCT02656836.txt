      with visual field tests. When a patient is diagnosed with glaucoma an optimum level of IOP
      (or target IOP) is determined based on patient's characteristics, such as severity of disease
      and life expectancy. In current models of care patients have their IOP measured at the clinic
      at different intervals. If the IOP is noted to be high, or above the patient's target,
      additional treatment is recommended. Accurate and frequent IOP measurements at different
      points in time are thus imperative.

      Tonometry is usually conducted by clinicians in an eye clinic. Some tonometers (e.g., Icare)
      have the potential to be used by the individual for home monitoring of IOP for patients with
      suspected glaucoma/glaucoma. Self-monitoring of IOP via home tonometry will allow patients to
      undergo IOP measurements at different points in time (e.g., early morning and night-time, and
      it can help determine diurnal changes and spikes).

      The overall objective of the current study is to conduct a feasibility pilot study on the
      home tonometer (Icare), acquiring initial experience with the Icare tonometer. For this
      purpose investigators will train up to 20 individuals on how to use the device. Investigators
      will ask them to record in a diary their IOP twice a day for a period of 2 weeks.
      Investigators will then compare IOP outcomes with the measurement taken at the clinic.
      Patients and clinicians will be masked to the IOP data.
