      indication for antifungal therapy, ahead of candidemia. These infections are clearly
      associated with increased morbidity and mortality in both community-acquired and
      healthcare-associated infections. So far,prospective randomized trials of antifungal therapy
      have almost exclusively concerned patients with candidemia and did not include patients with
      intra-abdominal infections. No prospective randomized trial has been conducted on
      intra-abdominal candidiasis and most retrospective analyses have reported very conflicting
      results concerning the impact of treatment on outcome. The aim of this study is therefore to
      demonstrate that caspofungin antifungal therapy for intra-abdominal candidiasis in ICU
      patients is associated with lower failure rate compared to placebo.
