      risk of developing type 2 diabetes in adults of the Yaqui ethnic group with overweight /
      obesity and with risk of diabetes of the state of Sonora, through the loss of body weight and
      the promotion of physical activity, in this way to improve obesity parameters and
      cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors.

      The primary hypothesis is that the implementation of a program promoting the healthy
      lifestyle aimed at adults of the Yaqui ethnic group of Sonora with a diagnosis of overweight
      or obesity and a Finnish Diabetes Risk Score (FINDRISC) ≥12 will significantly improve in the
      medium term (12 months) the body weight, triglycerides, fasting glucose and interleukin-6
      (IL-6).

      The secondary hypotheses will be as follows: the implementation of a program to promote a
      healthy lifestyle aimed at adults of the Yaqui ethnic group of Sonora with a diagnosis of
      overweight or obesity, and FINDRISC score ≥12 will improve significantly in the short term (6
      months) obesity parameters, blood glucose levels, insulin, lipid profile, blood pressure and
      physical activity.

      The implementation of a healthy lifestyle promotion program aimed at adults of the Sonoran
      Yaqui ethnic group with a diagnosis of overweight or obesity and a FINDRISC score ≥12 will
      significantly improve medium-term (12 months) obesity parameters, blood levels of insulin,
      lipid profile, inflammation markers, blood pressure and physical activity.

      The implementation of a healthy lifestyle promotion program aimed at adults of the Sonoran
      Yaqui ethnic group with a diagnosis of overweight or obesity and a FINDRISC score ≥12 will
      significantly improve long-term (18 months) obesity parameters, blood levels, lipid profile,
      blood pressure and physical activity.
