        1. Basic protocol: Azacitidine is administered subcutaneously at 32 mg/m2/d for 5
           consecutive days; α-interferon treatment started on day 8 for 3 weeks; 4-6
           weeks/treatment with long-acting interferon Gebin). 1-1.5 million U / kg, once a week;
           or ordinary alpha-interferon, 200 acres / square meter / d (total ≥ 300MU / d), 5-7 days
           a week;

        2. Start time of medication:

      1 In the absence of immunosuppressive agents such as cyclosporine, the chimeric rate is
      decreased and/or MRD-positive: or in the case of immunosuppressive agents such as
      cyclosporine, the chimeric rate is fully chimeric and MRD-positive: A-interferon is first
      administered. Single-agent intervention, if there was no significant decrease in MRD for 2
      consecutive courses (MRD decreased ≤ 50%), azacitidine combined with interferon intervention
      was started; 2 In the case of calmodulin immunosuppressant (cyclosporine or tacrolimus), the
      chimeric rate decreased and the MRD was negative, the immunosuppressant was rapidly reduced
      or discontinued, and the bone marrow was reviewed 2 weeks, if the chimeric rate did not rise.
      (decreased or stable), or after two consecutive immunosuppressive adjustments did not reach
      complete chimerism, start azacitidine combined with interferon intervention; (3) If
      cyclosporine or other immunosuppressive agents are applied before the start of the study,
      rapid reduction; dose reduction 1 / 4-1 / 2; if the chimeric rate increases or GVHD occurs,
      continue the immunosuppressant adjustment strategy; (4) Stop treatment: acute GVHD above II
      degree; patients are intolerant to the study protocol; basic regimen is ineffective after 2
      courses of treatment (chimeric rate continues to decline or MRD continues to increase) or
      disease recurrence; transplant.
