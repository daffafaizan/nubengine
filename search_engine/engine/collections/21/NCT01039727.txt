      forward. Only patients with chronic pain for which present research suspects a substantial
      degree of psychosomatic causality are withheld. A randomization of these into three groups is
      performed by the appropriate department of the VUB. The three groups are: a control group
      (receiving 'care as usual'), a group receiving additionally to care as usual, 5
      autosuggestion CDs (containing +/- 25 different sessions of autosuggestion) and a group
      receiving additionally to care as usual, email assistance (through a specific internet
      module), including downloadable CDs as appropriate and access to 'AurelisOnLine' (an internet
      application with > 900 different sessions of autosuggestion). Three of the CDs contain
      pre-recorded sessions of relaxation + autosuggestion aimed at diminishing pain. Other CDs are
      about relaxation, general wellness, etc. Each arm of investigation contains 30 subjects.
      Assessments are made at 3 points in time: at the start, at 1 month from the start and at 3
      months from the start. The following will be measured: quality of life (through a Dutch
      version of the West Haven-Yale Multidimensional Pain Inventory (WHYMPI)), levels of pain
      intensity and quality (through a Dutch version of the McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ)) and
      use of painkillers. In addition to this, the acceptance/satisfaction of physicians and
      patients of this kind of treatment will also be the subject of this investigation.
