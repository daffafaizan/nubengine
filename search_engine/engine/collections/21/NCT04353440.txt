      knee arthroplasty will be enrolled. Anterior femoral offset, femoral diameter and patellar
      offset will be measured by orthopaedic surgeons. In addition, Visual Analogue Scale Score,
      Oxford Knee Score, WOMAC, SF12 and SF36 will be evaluated postoperative in patients long-term
      follow up to see if there is a relationship between anterior femoral offset and anterior knee
      pain.In the direct lateral knee joint radiograph, the distance between the two parallel axis
      extending from both cortices of the femur is measured as "femoral diameter".The remaining
      length between the anterior axis and the maximum peak at the anterior of the prosthesis is
      considered as an "anterior femoral offset"[1]. Sagittal patellar offset defined by us as the
      ratio of the anterior femoral offset to the remaining distance between the maximum anterior
      point of the patella and the posterior vertex in the direct lateral knee joint radiography.
