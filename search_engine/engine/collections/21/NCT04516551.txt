      auto-CAR(chimeric antigen receptor)-T cell therapy brings hope to patients with relapsed or
      refractory B-cell hematologic malignancies. However, for B-ALL patients suffered from relapse
      after allo-HSCT (hematopoietic stem cell transplant), the T cells derived from healthy donor
      seems like a better origin for CAR-T cells producing because T cells derived from healthy
      matched sibling or unrelated donors have not been restrained by tumor micro-environment and
      retain anti-leukemia ability. So after we designed a clinical trial to manifest the safety
      and efficacy of anti-CD19 CAR-T cells for patients with relapsed B cell ALL.
