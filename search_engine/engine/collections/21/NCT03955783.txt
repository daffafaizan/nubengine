    
      Primary:

        -  Escalation: Identify the maximum tolerated dose(s) (MTD) and recommended phase 2 dose(s)
           (RP2D) of SEL-VEN combination therapy in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma
           (DLBCL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

        -  Expansion: Determine the overall response rate of SEL-VEN combination therapy in
           patients with relapsed/refractory hematologic malignancies.

      Exploratory Objectives:

        -  To explore biomarkers of response to SEL-VEN therapy.

        -  To determine the progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of SEL-VEN
           combination therapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive venetoclax orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Patients with DLBCL
      receive selinexor PO on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of each cycle. Patients with venetoclax-naive
      AML are treated with selinexor on days 8, 15, and 22 of cycle 1, followed by days 1, 8, 15,
      and 22 of subsequent cycles. Venetoclax-refractory AML patients begin both drugs on cycle 1
      day 1. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 28 days and every 3 months
      for 2 years.
