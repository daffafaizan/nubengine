      years old or older, scheduled for an echocardiography at Tulane University's outpatient
      cardiology clinic can be included. After consenting participants, information on their
      demographics, personal health habits, medications, and medical history will be collected via
      reviewing, their electronic medical health records. All participants will undergo an
      echocardiography as part of their routine medical care by their treating physician. Important
      echocardiographic findings will be noted such as, EF, valvular heart disease, pericardial
      disease, cardiomyopathies and structural heart disease. Additionally, PPG recordings will be
      collected simultaneously while performing echography using the Biostrap wristband.

      The investigators will analyze the association between each echographic imaging feature, and
      the PPG waveform obtained. PPG waveform features will be used to develop a predictive model
      capable of calculating an estimate of ventricular ejection fraction without echocardiography.
      All echocardiograms will be performed by experienced operators at Tulane Medical Center
      facilities. The study will occur at a single study site Tulane Medical Center and clinics,
      with appropriate facilities and equipment to conduct the study accurately and safely.

      An experienced echocardiogram technician or cardiology fellow will collect the PPG recordings
      using the Biostrap application. De-identified echocardiogram reports, including information
      on LVEF will be matched with the participant's pulse report.
