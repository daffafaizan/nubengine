    
      Screening Visit (research-related):

        -  Obtain and document signed Informed Consent document and HIPAA Authorization.

        -  Review past medical history in Armed Forces Health Longitudinal Technology Application
           (AHLTA) to verify the inclusion/exclusion criteria including previous encounter, vital
           signs review, co-morbidities, demographics, and problems list.

        -  Record: Date of birth, age, gender, race, ethnicity, DoD ID number, name of standard of
           care medications (over-the-counter and prescription), current email address (to be used
           for scheduling), height (in inches), weight (in pounds),history of prior injury to the
           injured leg, and note any prior acupuncture received for Achilles tendinopathy.

        -  If the subject is an active duty member, the investigators will ask: Have you or are you
           currently on a fitness restriction for Achilles tendinopathy.

      If so, what are/were the dates of the restriction?

      â€¢ There are several standard of care treatments for Achilles tendinopathy which include
      physical therapy as well as a prescribed home exercise program. The investigators will
      standardize what patients in this study are receiving by having all subjects follow a
      standard home exercise program defined as the Insertional Achilles Tendinopathy Eccentric
      Training Protocol and have them discontinue any formal physical therapy or other therapies
      when entering this study. Regular physical activity such as exercise is allowed.

      Randomization: Subjects will be randomized into 1 of 2 research treatment groups using block
      randomization with repeated measures:

        -  Group 1: Acupuncture (needles will be placed at BL 60, BL 61, KI 3, KI 4 with needles
           directed into the Achilles tendon. Needles inserted until a firm catch of the needle
           entering the tendon was appreciated. Energy (a small electrical current) is placed from
           KI 3(-) KI 4(+) and BL 61 (-) BL 60(+) at 30 Hz for 15min) plus the prescribed home
           exercise program
