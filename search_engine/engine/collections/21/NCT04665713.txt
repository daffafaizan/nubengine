      Chinese children and adolescents (girls age in 2-18). Compared with children of the same age
      and sex, overweight group includes those BMI in the range of P85-P95, obese group includes
      those BMI greater than (or equal to) P95, and the girls whose BMI in the range of P5-P85 are
      assigned to the normal group. Chinese herbs for ZiYinXieHuo were used to treat girls with
      precocious puberty, only given by hospital preparation, drug dose: 30ml/once, 3 times a day.
