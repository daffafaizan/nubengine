      Sparkle respiratory effort signal amplitude and esophageal manometry is non-inferior to the
      agreement between the thoracic belt respiratory effort signal amplitude and esophageal
      manometry. Data collection will be completed within a single visit, in which participants
      will undergo simultaneous measurement using the Sparkle device, respiratory belts, and
      esophageal manometry. Data collection will be completed during wakefulness, while
      participants undergo a series of breathing maneuvers.
