    
      This is an open-label, single-centre, two-period, randomised, cross over study. The study
      involves a screening visit to assess participant eligibility and two 24 hour in-patient stays
      at the clinical research facility during which day and night glucose levels will be
      controlled by the closed-loop system with either faster-acting insulin aspart or insulin
      aspart.

      Up to 22 adults with type 1 diabetes and treated with continuous subcutaneous insulin
      infusion will be recruited, aiming for 16 completed participants. Recruitment will take place
      at Manchester Diabetes Centre, Manchester Royal Infirmary, Manchester, UK. Participants will
      attend the Manchester Clinical Research Facility (MCRF), Manchester, on two occasions. In
      random order, they will undergo two closed-loop study days using either faster-acting insulin
      aspart or insulin aspart. During the study days, the closed-loop control algorithm will
      automatically modulate d insulin infusion rate based on real-time subcutaneous glucose sensor
      measurements. Participants will receive standardised meals with half usual meal bolus for the
      evening meal and no meal bolus for lunch time meal during each study day.
