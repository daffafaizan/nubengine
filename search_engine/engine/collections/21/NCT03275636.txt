      challenge. 20% of patients who need an allograft have an HLA-identical sibling available, and
      for approximately 70% of the remaining patients, a suitable, HLA-well-matched (10/10),
      unrelated volunteer can be found. For the remaining patients, partially matched (single
      mismatch) unrelated donors or haploidentical donors are alternative options.

      Recently published retrospective single center and registry studies suggest comparable
      outcomes for HCT from unrelated donors matched at HLA -A, -B, -C, and -DRB1 and
      haploidentical donors. The number of haploidentical HCT evaluated in these studies was still
      relatively small and a selection bias for the retrospective comparisons cannot be excluded.

      The goal of this trial is to evaluate overall survival of patients with high-risk AML, ALL or
      MDS after partially matched unrelated or haploidentical donor transplantation..
