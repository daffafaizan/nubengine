      Primary

        -  Determine the overall response rate, response duration, and frequency of
           progression-free survival at 6 months in patients with stage IV melanoma treated with
           erlotinib hydrochloride and bevacizumab.

        -  Determine objective responses in patients treated with this regimen.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the overall safety and tolerability of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Evaluate tissue blocks for EGFR by monoclonal antibody H11 (DAKO) or fluorescence in
           situ hybridization(FISH)7p12-specific probe-overexpression or amplification in patients
           treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral erlotinib hydrochloride once daily on days 1-28 and bevacizumab IV over
      30-90 minutes on days 1 and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients undergo tissue collection to analyze EGFR by monoclonal antibody H11 (DAKO) or
      fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) 7p12-specific probe-overexpression or
      amplification. Biological markers AKT, MAPK, p27, p21, CD13, CD34, and factor VIII are also
      measured.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.
