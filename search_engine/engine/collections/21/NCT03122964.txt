      panel for the detection of bladder cancer in patients with gross or microscopic hematuria.

      The secondary objective is to evaluate the predictive accuracy of a risk model including
      clinical factors such as age, gender, smoking history, and presence of gross versus
      microscopic hematuria compared to a model incorporating the same risk factors along with the
      methylation marker panel.
