      The blood sera are collected and prepared at the Allergy Units at the University Hospital
      Zurich (USZ) or Centre for Rhinology and Allergology Wiesbaden (AZW). The AZW serum samples
      will be transferred to USZ for serological analysis. The AIT patients will be allocated to
      three arms based on their scheduled AIT. Two arms will be allocated to patients at the USZ
      Allergy Unit, while the last arm is allocated to patients at AZW.

      Sixteen study subjects will be recruited from allergy patients that visit the Allergy Unit at
      USZ to receive AIT as part of standard of care treatment for their allergy. If the patients
      receive AIT, they can be included in the study. The decision on performing AIT is done by the
      USZ allergologist, and the therapy itself is not part of the current research project. The 16
      USZ patients are split in two study arms. One arm of study subject is scheduled for
      grass/tree AIT with aluminium-containing "Allergovit", and the second arm is scheduled to
      receive grass/tree AIT with MCT-containing Polvac.

      Eight study subjects will be recruited from allergy patients that visit the AZW to receive
      AIT as part of standard of care treatment for their allergy. If the patients receive AIT,
      they can be included in the study. The decision on performing AIT is done by the AZW
      allergologist, and the therapy itself is not part of the current research project. The 8
      patients comprise the third arm of the overall study, and they receive grass/tree AIT with
      MCT- and MPLA-containing Pollinex Quattro.
