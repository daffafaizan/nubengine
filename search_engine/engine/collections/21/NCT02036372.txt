      in hospitalised patients is up to 40%, meaning that the anaesthesiologist will encounter a
      diabetes patient in the operating room on a daily basis. Multiple protocols for perioperative
      glucose regulation have been developed, ranging from intravenous glucose-insulin-potassium
      infusion to subcutaneous bolus regimens. Despite this abundance of published glucose lowering
      protocols and the proven negative effects of intraoperative hyperglycaemia in diabetes, there
      is no evidence regarding the optimal intraoperative glucose lowering treatment. Recently,
      incretins have been introduced to lower blood glucose. The main hormone of the incretin
      system is glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). GLP-1 increases insulin and decreases glucagon
      secretion in a glucose-dependent manner, resulting in low incidence of hypoglycaemia. This
      study investigates for the first time the optimal intraoperative treatment algorithm to lower
      glucose in patients with diabetes mellitus undergoing non-cardiac surgery.

      Objective:

      This study investigates the optimal intraoperative treatment algorithm to lower glucose in
      patients with diabetes mellitus type 2 undergoing non-cardiac surgery, comparing
      intraoperative glucose-insulin-potassium infusion (GIK), insulin bolus regimen (BR) and GLP-1
      (liraglutide, LG) treatment.
