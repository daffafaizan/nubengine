      increase comfort and decrease perceived weight of the prosthesis. There have been no
      scientific studies to date that have evaluated the benefits of these designs, and thus no
      evidence to support use of one type of prosthetic socket design over another. Thus, the
      overall purpose of this pilot study was to conduct a head-to-head comparison of two designs
      for transhumeral level upper limb prosthetic sockets: a traditional socket design and a
      socket design hypothesized to provide greater skeletal stabilization.
