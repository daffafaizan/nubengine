      lymphomas, relapsed/ refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia and relapsed/refractory acute
      lymphoblastic leukemia with chimeric antigen receptor T cells targeting CD19 and to find the
      recommended phase II dose for this cellular therapy.

      T cells are a type of white blood cell that helps the body fight infections. This treatment
      uses T cells already present within the body that have been modified outside of the body by a
      lentivirus and then returned to the participant by an infusion to target the cancer.
      Lentivirus is a family of viruses that can be used by scientists to alter cells, which then
      could be used to change the course of a disease. This type of treatment is sometimes referred
      to as adoptive cell transfer (ACT). In this study the specific type of cells that will be
      used is called human chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-T cells). The CAR-T cells that
      will be reinfused to the body are modified using a lentivirus that is no longer active. The
      CAR-T cells will be returned to the body through an intravenous (IV) infusion. Another
      purpose of this study is to learn about the side effects and toxicities related to this
      treatment. Human CAR-T cell therapy is investigational (experimental) and works by removing T
      cells from the blood and modifying them to be able to target the cancer.
