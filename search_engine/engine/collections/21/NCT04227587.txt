    
      This randomized controlled trial (RCT) with a longitudinal mixed-method process evaluation
      aims to (1) determine the effectiveness of a ZTEx intervention program, which is a
      lifestyle-integrated physical activity program, on sleep and related outcomes in inactive
      adults with insomnia disorder; (2) identify the facilitators and barriers of ZTEx adherence,
      (3) explore the possible mechanisms of impact on ZTEx adherence and the same abovementioned
      outcomes.

      This RCT consists of two phases. In the first phase (baseline to week 8), 136 subjects will
      be randomly allocated to the ZTEx intervention or the sleep hygiene education (SHE)
      comparison group. They will receive two 2-hour ZTEx training or SHE lessons and practice ZTEx
      or follow the sleep hygiene instruction for 24 weeks. After assessment at week 8, for the
      second phase of the study (weeks 9-24), which is a proof-of-concept pilot nested in the RCT,
      subjects in the ZTEx group will be randomly divided into either an ZTEx with WhatsApp
      reminder (ZTEx+R) subgroup or an ZTEx without WhatsApp reminder (ZTEx alone) subgroup to
      evaluate the effects of WhatsApp reminders on exercise adherence and the same outcomes. Mixed
      methods process evaluation will be conducted. Post-training and post-follow-up qualitative
      focus group interviews will be conducted; facilitators, barriers, and mediators will be
      analyzed.
