      become frequent in the outpatient management of patients. Indeed the advantages are numerous:
      better fluidity of the patient circuits to the block, reduction of the stress of the operated
      one etc. Yet some patients might experience fears.

      Thus, in order to improve our practice, we want to take into account your experience with
      this innovative procedure.

      To determine patients' fears concerning their endoscopic standing before general anesthesia
      and to evaluate their evolution after this first experience

      After your installation in the preoperative area, we submit a questionnaire that corresponds
      to the first part of the document and then accompanied by a hospital agent you will walk
      towards the entrance to the endoscopy room. These questions are about your possible fears and
      your degree of anxiety.

      After an endoscopy under general anesthesia, you will be taken back to your stretcher room
      where you will complete the second part of the questionnaire which deals with the same topics
      as the questions asked before the endoscopy.
