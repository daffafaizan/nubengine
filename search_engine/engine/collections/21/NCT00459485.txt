      years of age. Participants will receive daily zinc or placebo liquid supplements for 21 days.
      Supplemental zinc will be given as zinc sulfate; the lower dose zinc supplement will contain
      10 mg/d elemental zinc, and the higher dose zinc supplement will contain 20 mg/d elemental
      zinc. The placebo will contain the same excipients expect for zinc sulfate.

      Multiple blood draws will be performed throughout the course of the study, to determine the
      responsiveness of plasma zinc concentrations to zinc supplementation. Two baseline blood
      draws will occur prior to the start of supplementation (study days -7 and 0). Blood draws
      will be performed on days 1, 2, 5, 9, 14 and 21 of the 21 day supplementation period. Upon
      termination of supplementation (day 21), blood draws will be performed on days 1, 2, 5, 9, 14
      and 21 post-supplementation (study days 22, 23, 26, 30, 35 and 42).

      The major outcomes of interest are the magnitude and velocity of change in plasma zinc
      concentration. Other outcomes to be assessed are plasma concentrations of the acute phase
      proteins CRP and AGP, as well as reported morbidity, because of their potential roles as
      confounding variables. Anthropometric variables will be assessed at baseline.
