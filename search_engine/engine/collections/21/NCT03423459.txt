      treat patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis at high or extreme risk for open heart
      surgery, and in July 2017 for intermediate risk patients. This latest generation device
      features an outer wrap to improve annular sealing and reduce paravalvular leak.

      In this observational study, baseline demographic and imaging characteristics, procedural
      details and clinical outcomes of patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement
      with the CoreValve Evolut PRO will be prospectively collected into a registry database. The
      institutional Heart Team will select patients according to standard practice.
