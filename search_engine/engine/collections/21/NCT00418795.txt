    
      The primary objective is: To investigate the biochemical efficacy on plasma porphobilinogen
      (PBG) of Porphozy(recombinant human porphobilinogen deaminase) in subjects with Acute
      Intermittent Porphyria (AIP) during an attack and the clinical efficacy clinical efficacy of
      Porphozym™, being the change in pain from baseline to 24 hours after start of treatment. The
      correlation between the biochemical and clinical efficacy is investigated as well. Further
      the safety of Porphozym™ is evaluated.

      After a screening period lasting as short as possible subjects enrolled in the trial will be
      randomized to treatment with either Porphozym™ or placebo. Treatment is given over 48 hours.
      After end of treatment, the subject enters the observation period, which lasts until the
      discharge from the hospital. Subjects are followed up with visits 14 and 28 days after end of
      treatment. Additional safety follow-up will be performed 2, 4 and 6 months after end of
      treatment. At least 36 Subjects will be enrolled in the trial.

      The trial drug,is supplied by Zymenex A/S, Denmark in vials for reconstitution in water for
      injections (WFI).

      At start of treatment a bolus injection iv is given to decrease PBG levels ot zero. This is
      followed by continuous iv infusion of the enzyme over the following 48 hours.
