    
      The study is a randomized controlled trial comparing a mindfulness-enhanced evidence-based
      caregiver skill-building intervention (PAACC) to REACH-VA to reduce caregiver burden and
      increase quality of life of the care recipient. For this, caregivers of persons with ADRD or
      TBI-AD who have moderate to severe burden will be randomly assigned to either receive PAACC
      or receive REACH-VA. Both the interventions will include 4 biweekly sessions delivered by
      trained interventionists, followed by an outcome testing session after the intervention.
      Outcomes of caregiver stress, health and well being will be assessed at baseline and at the
      end of the intervention.
