    
      This is a Phase 1, randomized, open-label, dose-escalation study to examine the safety,
      tolerability, and immune response of three doses (6 mcg, 30 mcg, and 60 mcg) of the WEVEE
      vaccine (VRC-WEVVLP073-00-VP) alone or with alum adjuvant (VRC-GENMIX083-AL-VP) in a
      2-product administration regimen.

      Eligible subjects were randomized to WEVEE alone (Groups 1, 3, and 5) or WEVEE plus alum
      (Groups 2, 4, and 6, respectively) in each dose group. No more than 1 subject was randomized
      and vaccinated per day for the first 3 subjects at each dose. If the 6 mcg dose of WEVEE was
      assessed as not showing safety concerns by a Protocol Safety Review Team (PSRT),
      randomization began for Groups 3 and 4 (30 mcg WEVEE without alum and with alum,
      respectively). In a second safety review conducted on the first 3 subjects to receive 30 mcg,
      if the 30 mcg dose of WEVEE was assessed as not showing safety concerns by the PSRT,
      randomization began for Groups 5 and 6 (60 mcg WEVEE without and with alum, respectively).

      The product was administered in the upper arm muscle as an intramuscular (IM) injection via
      needle and syringe at Day 0 and 8 weeks later.

      For all groups, solicited reactogenicity was evaluated using a 7-day diary card. Assessment
      of vaccine safety included clinical observation and monitoring of hematological and chemical
      parameters at clinical visits throughout the study.
