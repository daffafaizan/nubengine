      Since then, reports on the safety and feasibility of the application of robotic surgical
      system in the treatment of gastric cancer (GC) have gradually increased. Reports of robotic
      surgery for GC are increasing, especially in Asia. Several studies confirmed the advantages
      of robotic gastrectomy when compared with laparoscopic gastrectomy. However, whether total
      robotic gastrectomy is noninferior to robotic-assisted gastrectomy remains unclear. The
      investigator first carried out this study in the world to evaluate the efficacy of total
      robotic versus robotic assisted distal gastrectomy for GC.
