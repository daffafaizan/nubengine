      procedures, have make this type of surgery one of the most innovative fields in medicine.
      However the endovascular experience in an office-based angiosuite is different from that in a
      hospital suite, and has been viewed in the past by some physicians as unsafe because it lacks
      the safety net of immediate hospital resources. In 2005, medicine allowed endovascular
      procedures to be performed in the office setting. The results of this study will serve as a
      starting point for future trials concentrating on the effectiveness and clinical outcomes of
      the procedures performed in an office based angiosuite.
