      of lamotrigine in the treatment of seizures. However, randomized trials take place in
      artificial experimental conditions with many restrictions imposed. There hasn't been much
      focus on positive effects on the patient, such as improvement in mood and level of alertness
      related to the drug. Other factors related to quality of life that affect the decision to
      continue or discontinue the drug are also important. Anecdotal experience suggests that
      lamotrigine is associated with increased alertness, enhanced energy levels and improved
      general sense of well-being. Observational studies that promote awareness of such
      distinguishing features and other aspects of efficacy are essential for guiding
      decision-making when prescribing anti-epileptic drugs.
