      (Ibuprofen, Hydromorphone, Ibuprofen+Hydromorphone groups). Positive analgesic efficacy was
      defined as a numeric rating scale (NRS) â‰¤3 on a 0-10 NRS, 30 min after the drug
      administration. Drug was administered by the Dixon and Mood up-and-down method. Starting
      doses were ibuprofen 50 mg, hydromorphone 0.25 mg, or ibuprofen 25 mg + hydromorphone 0.125
      mg. The maximum doses were ibuprofen 800 mg, hydromorphone 2 mg, or ibuprofen 400 mg +
      hydromorphone 1 mg. Combination index (CI) (additive: 0.9-1.1, synergism: <0.9, antagonism:
      >1.1), dose reduction index (DRI, a measure of how much the dose of each drug in a
      combination can be reduced), and isobologram were used to define the nature of their
      interaction.
