    
      Infantile colic Ä±s one of the most common problems within the first 3 months of life,
      affecting as many as 3% to 28% of newborn children. It consists of a behavioral syndrome
      characterized by paroxysmal, excessive, inconsolable crying without identifiable cause.
      Lactobacillus reuteri, one of the few endogenous lactobacillus species in the human
      gastrointestinal tract, has been used safely for many years as a probiotic dietary supplement
      in adults, and recent data demonstrated safety after long-term dietary supplementation for
      newborn infants. The positive effects of this probiotic on intestinal disorders such as
      constipation and diarrhea and in protection from infection,as well as its capacity to
      modulate immune responses.

      The aim was to test the hypothesis that oral administration of Lactobacillus reuteri in a
      prospective randomized controlled study would improve symptoms of infantile colic.
