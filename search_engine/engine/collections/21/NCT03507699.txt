      by a priming dose of subcutaneous CMP-001 (day 1 Â± 4 days), intratumoral injections of
      CMP-001 on days 13, 36 and 55, combined with nivolumab 3mg/kg every 2 weeks (start day 15)
      and ipilimumab 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks (start day 15). From day 71 biweekly subcutaneous
      injections of CMP-001 will commence. Nivolumab, ipilimumab and subcutaneous injections of
      CMP-001 will be continued until disease progression or up to 24 months in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Two research biopsies will be taken from a
      liver metastasis. The first biopsy will be taken during the screening period (pretreatment)
      and the second one 5 weeks post-radiosurgery (which is 3 weeks post-initiation of nivolumab /
      ipilimumab). As a safety run-in, the initial cohort of 3-6 patients will not receive
      radiosurgery. The next cohort will not commence until the last patient from the initial
      cohort has been followed up for at least 8 weeks post first intratumoral injection. Efficacy
      endpoints will be based upon a non-irradiated lesion.
