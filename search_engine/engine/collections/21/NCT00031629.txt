      I. Determine the antitumor activity of docetaxel, gemcitabine, and filgrastim (G-CSF) or
      pegfilgrastim in patients with persistent or recurrent uterine leiomyosarcoma.

      II. Determine the nature and degree of toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 90 minutes on days 1 and 8, docetaxel IV over 1 hour on
      day 8, and filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) on days 9-15 or pegfilgrastim SC on day 9
      only. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 19-51 patients will be accrued for this study within 10-24
      months.
