      disease drives proarrhythmic changes in refractoriness and conduction, and decreases cardiac
      contractility, which promotes VT/VF. Dantrolene, a currently available drug that inhibits
      RyR2, but has no Na or K channel activity, will be used as a tool to study RyR2 modulation.
      The investigators propose a randomized controlled trial of dantrolene versus placebo in
      patients with structural heart disease referred for VT ablation to evaluate
      electrophysiologic, hemodynamic, and arrhythmia prevention endpoints. Dantrolene's inhibition
      of RyR1 will also be studied to define its effect on muscle and respiratory strength in this
      clinical population, which will be important if dantrolene is to be considered for
      repurposing as an antiarrhythmic drug.

      The two aims are:

      Aim 1: To conduct a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of dantrolene to study the effect of
      RyR inhibition on cardiac electrophysiology, hemodynamics, arrhythmia inducibility, muscle
      strength, and respiratory mechanics in patients with structural heart disease referred for VT
      ablation.

      Aim 2: To explore the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship of I.V. dantrolene and its
      short-term effect on cardiac electrophysiology, hemodynamics, and muscle and respiratory
      strength.
