    
      This study is an open-label split-mouth study that aims to assess the improvement of
      periodontal inflammatory indices after sessions of professional oral hygiene with the
      administration of Biorepair Implant Bioactive Gel and Chlorhexidine gel 1%. It will also
      compare the efficacy of the two gel in rebalancing periodontal health.

      Periodontal patients that will give the informed consent to the treatment protocol and that
      satisfy the eligibility criteria will undergo 4 sessions of professional oral hygiene. For
      each session, periodontal inflammatory indices will be recorded and professional manual and
      mechanical removal of supragingival and subgingival deposits of both arches will be
      performed, following air-perio polishing with glycine powders. At this stage, patients will
      be randomized and allocated to the following two groups:

        -  Group 1: application in periodontal pockets of quadrants Q1 and Q3 of Biorepair Implant
           Bioactive Gel; irrigation of periodontal pockets of quadrants Q2 and Q4 with
           chlorhexidine 1% gel.

        -  Group 2: irrigation of periodontal pockets of quadrants Q1 and Q3 with chlorhexidine 1%
           gel; application in periodontal pockets of quadrants Q2 and Q4 of Biorepair Implant
           Bioactive Gel.

      Patients will continue with a home oral care protocol, using both gels for the same quadrants
      of their group for the following 14 days after the professional oral hygiene session.

      The first session is at the baseline (T0), the second is after 1 month (T1), the third is
      after 3 months (T2) and the last is after 6 months (T4).
