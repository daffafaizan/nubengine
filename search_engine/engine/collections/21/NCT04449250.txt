    
      An open-label, randomized, single-dose, two-sequence, two-period, in-clinic crossover study
      with two treatments (fed vs fasted) in approximately 26 healthy adult subjects aged 18 to 55
      years.

      Fed arm: Following an overnight fast of at least 10 hours, subjects should begin consuming
      the test meal 30 minutes prior to administration of CTx-1301. CTx-1301 (50 mg) should be
      administered 30 minutes after the start of the meal. CTx-1301 (50 mg) should be administered
      with approximately 240 mL (8 fluid ounces) of water. No food should be allowed for at least 4
      hours post-dose. Water can be allowed as desired except for at least one hour before and at
      least one hour after drug administration. Subjects should receive standardized meals as
      defined in the study schedule for the fed treatment arm.

      Fasted arm: Following an overnight fast of at least 10 hours, subjects should be administered
      CTx-1301 (50 mg) with approximately 240 mL (8 fluid ounces) of water. No food should be
      allowed for at least 4 hours post-dose. Water can be allowed as desired except for at least
      one hour before and at least one hour after drug administration. Subjects should receive
      standardized meals as defined in the study schedule for the fasted treatment arm.

      A high-fat (approximately 50 percent of total caloric content of the meal) and high-calorie
      (approximately 800 to 1000 calories) meal is used as the test meal for food-effect
      bioanalytical (BA) and fed bioequivalency (BE) studies. This test meal allows approximately
      150, 250, and 500-600 calories from protein, carbohydrate, and fat, respectively. The test
      meal, eaten within 30 minutes prior to administration of CTx-1301, is two eggs fried in
      butter, two strips of bacon, two slices of toast with butter, four ounces of hash brown
      potatoes and eight ounces of whole milk.
