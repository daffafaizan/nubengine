      their main branches. It mainly affects young women. Blood vessel inflammation may result in
      stenosis, occlusions, ectasias and/or aneurysms and, consequently, difference of blood
      pressure between limbs and vascular claudication. Aerobic capacity (CA) is the measure of
      oxygen uptake, transport and use by the body, characterizing the individual's ability to
      perform activity. It is also a tool that can predict cardiovascular diseases. Our group has
      been a pioneer in demonstrating that CA is decreased in the small sample of the young women
      with TA. In addition, the safety and efficacy of aerobic exercises in this sample of patients
      were shown, as well as the influence of these sessions on the pro-inflammatory and angiogenic
      serum levels of the cytokines. However, due to the small samples, it was not possible to
      correlate CA with clinical and laboratory parameters and also with the presence of vascular
      damage. Moreover, to date, no studies have evaluated securityof an acute strength exercise
      session in TA.Therefore, thes objectives of the present study were to evaluate: a) the CA; b)
      security of the acute strength exercise session; c) correlation between CA, as well as
      strength exercise session, with demographic, clinical, therapeutic, comorbid parameters, and
      presence and degree of vascular damage; d) serum levels of the cytokine.
