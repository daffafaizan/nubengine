           cycle lasted three weeks. They took the lenalidomide (capsules) every day for the first
           two weeks only (days 1-14). They took dexamethasone (tablets) on Day 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9,
           11 and 12 and came to the outpatient treatment center for intravenous bortezomib on Day
           1, 4, 8 and 11. The third week of the cycle was a rest period and the participant did
           not take any study medication.

        -  Certain tests and procedures were performed throughout each treatment cycle at
           definitive time periods. These tests included: medical history update,
           physical/neurological examination, skeletal survey (x-rays or scan), blood samples,
           urine samples, optional bone marrow aspiration/tissue biopsy, 12-lead ECG, and MRI/CT
           (if needed).

        -  It was expected that participants were going to complete at least 8 cycles of the study,
           which adds up to 168 days. If the participant completed the first 8 cycles, had stable
           or responding disease and had not experienced bad side effects, they were allowed to
           continue treatment on a maintenance schedule, detailed in the protocol, at the study
           doctor's discretion.
