      nodes. The status of these nodes helps clinicians determine prognosis and guides treatment
      decisions. Unfortunately, a relatively common side effect following axillary lymph node
      dissection is upper-extremity lymphedema. The purpose of this study is to identify risk
      factors for lymphedema among women who have had axillary surgery for breast cancer. Specific
      aims include identifying risk factors for lymphedema and comparing quality of life (QOL)
      ratings for women who have and do not have lymphedema. A case-control study will be conducted
      with enrollment of 200 participants. Cases will be identified at their lymphedema consult in
      the physical therapy centers. Using the oncology registry, controls will include patients who
      have had breast cancer surgery and have not developed lymphedema. The severity of lymphedema
      and interference with daily life will be assessed with the Measure of Arm Symptom Survey
      (MASS), a patient-completed survey, and QOL will be collected with the SF-36. Treatment risk
      factors including previous surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy will be obtained from
      oncology registry data. This study will determine which factors play a role in lymphedema
      development.
