      participation from the A5 and A6 spinal nerve roots and occasionally from the A4 root. It is
      treading behind the clavicle and to the upper border of the scapula and then enters through
      the scapular notch of the shoulder and below the transverse superior transverse ligament to
      the rear surface of the scapula. This entry point is an important factor of pressure and
      surgical dissection of the ligament enlarges the space through which the nerve travels.

      The rotator cuff consists of the tendons of subscapularis, supraspinatus , infraspinatus and
      minor teres muscles. Cadaveric studies have shown that tears in the cuff , particularly
      massive ruptures a gap more than 5cm, change the path of the suprascapular nerve and create
      conditions that pressure.

      Until now, there are no prospective studies that compare the improvement of suprascapular
      neuropathy after arthroscopic dissection of the superior transverse scapular ligament in
      patients with rotator cuff tears , or that study the degree of neuropathy compared with the
      extent of the rupture .
