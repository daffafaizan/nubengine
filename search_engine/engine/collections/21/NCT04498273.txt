    
      The COVID-19 Outpatient Thrombosis Prevention Trial is a multi-center adaptive randomized
      double-blind placebo-controlled platform trial to compare the effectiveness of
      anti-coagulation with anti-platelet agents and with placebo to prevent thrombotic events in
      patients diagnosed with COVID-19 who have evidence of increased inflammation based on
      elevated D-dimer and hsCRP levels, yet are not admitted to hospital as COVID-19 related
      symptoms are currently stable. Participants will all be adults between 40 and 79 years who
      will be enrolled from approximately 100 facilities, such as emergency rooms and other
      settings where a physician is present to evaluate the patient for inclusion and exclusion
      criteria.
