    
      Veterans (participants and peers) with PTSD will be recruited from the Charleston VA Medical
      Center catchment area. Participants will have been assigned to exposure therapy for PTSD and
      either started treatment, or dropped out before treatment; peers will have successfully
      completed exposure therapy for PTSD. Those eligible to participate will also include Veterans
      who are identified as "at-risk" of dropping out, Veterans who are uncomfortable completing in
      vivo exposure activities, and those who may have PTSD symptoms, but at the sub-threshold
      level. Participants will receive 8-12 weekly sessions of exposure therapy treatment with
      assistance of a PE Peer. Half of subjects will be randomized to the PE+Workout Buddy
      condition, where they will complete treatment with the assistance of a Veteran who will meet
      them at least once per week for in vivo exposure therapy assignments, for 3-4 weeks at the
      beginning of treatment. Half of subjects will be randomized to the PE+General Support
      condition, where they will complete treatment with the assistance of a Veteran who will call
      them via telephone once per week to encourage session attendance and ask about treatment
      progress, life stresses, etc. General support peers will also meeting Veterans 2-4 times per
      month to check in about treatment progress. All participants and peers will be consented.
      Participants will be assessed at baseline, post-treatment, and 3- & 6-month follow-up.
