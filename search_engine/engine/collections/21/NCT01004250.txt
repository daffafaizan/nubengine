      induction and maintenance treatment; and a follow-up period. Approximately 110 participants
      will be enrolled into the study, with the aim of having 100 evaluable participants. Eligible
      participants will first receive 4 cycles of induction chemotherapy with
      pemetrexed-cisplatin-bevacizumab. Participants who achieve a response or do not progress
      after completion of induction chemotherapy and have an adequate performance status will
      receive maintenance therapy with pemetrexed-bevacizumab. Treatment will continue until
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs. When treatment is discontinued, the
      participants health status will be monitored till death, loss to follow-up or data cut-off
      date.

      Participants who continue to receive benefit from treatment at the time of data cut-off may
      receive continued access to pemetrexed and bevacizumab until disease progression,
      unacceptable toxicity, or any other reason at investigator or participants decision.
