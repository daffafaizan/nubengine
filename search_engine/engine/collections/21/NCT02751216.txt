      before implanting the definitive neurostimulator. The definitive neurostimulator will be
      implanted minimum 4 weeks after the trial implantation, when the patient reports more than
      50% pain reduction and/or more than 50% reduction in pain medication.

      Patients who are included in this study will have four extra study visits at the University
      Hospital Brussels. The first assessment will take place during the week prior to surgery, the
      second minimal one month after definitive implantation of the stimulator. The assessments
      consist of filling in the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and the Pain Catastrophizing
      Scale (PCS) and recording brain activity before and during the pain protocol. Additionally,
      patients will wear an Actiwatch for measuring sleep patterns and fill in a VAS diary (back
      and leg pain separately), one month before the baseline assessment and one month before the
      second assessment.
