      substitution. Endocrinologists are split in their opinion on combination therapy with T4 and
      T3 on patients with poorly regulated hypothyroidism. There are no objective means, by which
      to identify individuals who would benefit from combination therapy. The purpose of this study
      is to assess differential effects of T4 and T3 on body temperature, metabolism, muscle
      strength and brain function. The main aim is to try to identify biomarkers reflecting
      different effects of T4 and T3 on cell and tissue level.
