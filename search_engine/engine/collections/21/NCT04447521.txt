      pneumoniae infections in Belgium. Monthly, 12 peripheral hospitals will send the first 15
      unduplicated clinical S. pneumoniae samples (coming from patients diagnosed with pneumonia,
      otitits media or sinusitis) to Sciensano. Sciensano will determine the serotype and the
      antibiotic resistance profile of these clinical isolates. Whole genome seuqencing will be
      performed on a subset of these isolates.
