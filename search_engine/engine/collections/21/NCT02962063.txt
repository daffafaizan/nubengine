    
      Patients will undergo a baseline PET/CT scan prior to receiving mFOLFOX6 chemotherapy (bolus
      5-fluorouracil or -FU 400 mg/m2, leucovorin 400 mg/m2, oxaliplatin 70-85 mg/m2 and infusional
      5-FU 1,200 mg/m2/day ×46 hours) q14 days ×2, followed by repeat PET scan.

      Two weeks after the second dose of mFOLFOX6, patients receive 1 dose of durvalumab 1,500 mg.
      and tremelimumab 300 mg. Two weeks later, all patients will initiate radiation (1.8
      Gy/fraction ×28 fractions Monday through Friday for total dose of 50.4 Gy). PET responders
      receive concurrent chemotherapy with oxaliplatin 70-85 mg/m2 q14 days ×3 doses with either
      infusional 5-FU 300 mg/m2/day ×96 hours or capecitabine 825 mg/m2 BID Monday through Friday
      throughout the radiation period. PET non-responders receive concurrent carboplatin AUC
      2/paclitaxel 50 mg/m2 weekly ×5 with concurrent. All patients receive a second dose of
      durvalumab 1,500 mg q28 days after the first dose.

      Patients undergo surgical resection 6-8 weeks after the completion of chemoradiation. In the
      adjuvant setting, patients who have undergone R0 resections will receive tremelimiumab 300 mg
      ×1 and durvalumab 1,500 mg every 4 weeks ×6 doses starting within 12 weeks of surgery.

      Radiation will be administered starting ≥14 days after the first durvalumab treatment; it
      will commence on a Monday or Tuesday and continue weekly from Monday through Friday (except
      for public holidays).
