      at the healing of inflammation of ileal pouch in people who take vedolizumab as compared to
      those receiving a matching placebo. The study will enroll approximately 110 patients.
      Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the two treatment groups-which will remain
      undisclosed to the patient and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent
      medical need):

        -  Vedolizumab 300 mg IV

        -  Placebo

      All participants will receive an intravenous infusion at Weeks 0, 2, 6, 14, 22, and 30 along
      with concomitant antibiotic treatment with ciprofloxacin 500 mg twice daily through Week 4.

      This multicenter trial will be conducted in North America and Europe. The overall time to
      participate in treatment and efficacy assessment of this study is 34 weeks. Participants will
      make multiple visits to the clinic, plus a final visit 18 weeks after the last dose of study
      drug for a safety follow-up assessment (up to Week 48). Participants will also participate in
      a long-term follow-up, by phone after the last dose of study drug up to Week 56.
