      following bariatric surgery. Previous animal studies have suggested that there is an
      underlying regulatory process controlled by 'the gravitostat' which is an evolutionary
      adaptation responsible for weight control and maintenance. Studies exploring this concept in
      rodent models have suggested that artificially increasing the animal's weight with the
      implantation of weighted capsules results in greater weight loss in mice with obesity but
      does not affect those of normal weight. We will use weighted vests in patients following
      surgery to replicate this increased mechanical loading to determine whether a similar process
      occurs in humans. This will improve our understanding of the underlying processes regulating
      weight in patients with obesity and following bariatric surgery.
