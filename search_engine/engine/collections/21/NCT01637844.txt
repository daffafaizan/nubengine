      infected with HBV. Standard immunoprophylaxis against mother-to-infant transmission of HBV
      includes administration of hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) and hepatitis B vaccine;
      however, approximately 5-15% of the infants are not protected despite having received these
      preventive measures. It is reported that antiviral prophylaxis among HBV-infected pregnant
      women can reduce mother-to-infant transmission of HBV. However, more research is needed to
      obtain the definite conclusion. This study will determine whether telbivudine among HBsAg-
      and HBeAg-positive pregnant women during the third trimester, in addition to standard
      immunoprophylaxis in infants, will be more effective than standard immunoprophylaxis alone at
      preventing HBV infections in these infants.
