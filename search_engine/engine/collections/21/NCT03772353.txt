    
      This is a single-center, single arm, open-label, run-in phase Ib / roll-over phase II study
      of letrozole in combination with novel human epidermal growth factor
      receptor-2(HER2)-targeted tyrosine kinase Inhibitor pyrotinib and cyclin-dependent kinase
      4/6(CDK4/6) Inhibitor SHR6390 in subjects with hormone receptor(HR)+/HER2+ relapsed or
      metastatic breast cancer. The study will enroll natural postmenopausal women, or women who
      have undergone bilateral oophorectomy.The phase Ib part of the study will determine safety
      and tolerability of the combination of letrozole, pyrotinib and SHR6390 to define that
      appropriate dose of SHR6390 for phase II.The dose of letrozole and pyrotinib will be constant
      through the study period. Once the recommended regimen has been identified, subjects with the
      selected tumor type will be enrolled into expansion cohorts for the purpose of assessing
      efficacy and safety of the combination treatment.Data from phase Ib showed the triplet of
      pyrotinib, SHR6390, and letrozole had an acceptable safety profile and encouraging efficacy,
      potentially offering a chemotherapy-sparing treatment option for patients with
      HER2-positive/HR-positive MBC. Based on DLTs and clinical efficacy, pyrotinib 320mg/d,
      SHR6390 125mg/d, and letrozole 2.5mg/d was declared as RP2D. The pharmacokinetic analysis had
      not yielded conclusive results and would involve more samples in phase II trial.
