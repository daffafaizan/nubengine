      placebo-controlled. They followed very similar protocols, were of nearly identical design,
      had common inclusion and exclusion criteria. Both studies achieved statistical significance
      for ammonium succinate-based dietary supplement on most of pre-specified endpoints of Greene
      Climacteric Scale symptoms severity reduction at week 12. Nevertheless, some minor variation
      in the patient population, both within the studies (e.g., between different centres, as well
      as seasonal variability) and between the studies can be expected.

      Naturally occuring estrogen deficiency over the course of the menopausal transition and
      postmenopause causes hot flushes and other psychosomatic and vasomotor symptoms. Menopausal
      hormone therapy is a method of choice, however in many cases it is contraindicated or
      unacceptable for other reasons. Many alternatives exist, generally acting via estrogen
      receptors (ER). The dietary supplement tested in the aforementioned studies contains ammonium
      succinate, which does not bind to ER, instead acting by supporting the Krebs cycle. It does
      not have phytoestrogenic ingredients.
