        -  Investigate if dietary fat composition influences liver fat accumulation and metabolic
           risk factors in response to moderate weight gain

        -  Investigate if polyunsaturated fat (PUFA) in the diet could counteract any unfavorable
           metabolic changes that are expected to accompany moderate weight gain

        -  Investigate effects of weight gain and dietary fat composition on markers of vascular
           health
