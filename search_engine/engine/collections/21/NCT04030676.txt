      CytoMegaloVirus (CMV) reactivation in the colon of UC patients. A new algorithm for the care
      of Ulcerative Colitis (UC) patients that could be used in all centers, even those without
      molecular biology lab, could be proposed: in case of a positive QuantiFERON-CytoMegaloVirus
      (QF-CMV) assay, the immune response protects the patient against Cytomegalovirus (CMV)
      reactivation and intensification of immunosuppressive therapies should be proposed; at the
      opposite, a negative QuantiFERON-CytoMegaloVirus (QF-CMV) assay will invite to biopsy in
      order to detect CytoMegaloVirus (CMV) replication and to treat with ganciclovir when
      appropriate. This algorithm will preserve invasive biopsies in absence of CytoMegaloVirus
      (CMV) tissue reactivation.
