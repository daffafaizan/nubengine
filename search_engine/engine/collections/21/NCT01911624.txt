    
      Single center randomized controlled trial of direct thrombin inhibitors versus standard
      enoxaparin.

        -  Feasibility: proportion of patients eligible for randomization; clinically attained
           concentration of DTI and resulting staphylothrombin inhibition

        -  Safety: bleeding events (major/ clinically relevant non-major)

        -  Efficacy: thrombotic events during the thromboprophylactic treatment + 3 days

        -  Secondary outcome measures

             -  Coagulation parameters: evolution of D-dimers from day 0-4; other lab parameters of
                coagulation (PT/APTT/fibrinogen/platelet count)

             -  Inflammatory parameters: CRP, white blood cell count, neutrophilia

             -  Clinical outcomes: metastatic infections, assessed clinically or by PET/CT; relapse
                of S. aureus bacteremia; defervescence; persistent positive blood cultures;
                hospital stay, mortality.
