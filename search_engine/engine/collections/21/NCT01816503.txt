      prospective (the patients are identified and then followed forward in time for the outcome of
      the study) observational study. The study population comprises patients who are admitted to a
      study center during the study period and are receiving a strong oral long-acting opioid
      analgesic but deemed to control pain insufficiently. Since this study is an observational
      study conducted in real practice, a dose of fentanyl matrix should be adjusted depending on
      an individual patient's response at the investigator's discretion. However, for the patients
      whose pain is not sufficiently controlled despite administration of strong long-acting opioid
      analgesics, the minimum initial dose will be fentanyl matrix 75 micrograms/h and the
      investigator can adjust dosage according to the degree of the patients' pain control during
      the 9 days of the study period.
