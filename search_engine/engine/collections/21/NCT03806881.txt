      reconstruction (primary or revision) because of a severely damaged glenoid associated with
      severe bone loss. In these cases, standard reconstruction of the glenoid is not possible
      because of the lack of body support of the glenoid rim or columns.

      The Glenius implant is custom-made prothesis: during pre-operative planning, the implant is
      designed based on a detailed 3D CT analysis of the defect with special reference to bone
      quality and the anatomy of the bone deficient glenoid. Optimized screw fixation trajectories
      are defined for each individual patient, which accommodate screws that are positioned and
      angled towards the best bone stock available in the glenoid/coracoid/scapula with each
      specific patient. The surgeon provides feedback on the the design and orientation of the
      implant needed to achieve the optimal inclination of the head and the position & offset of
      the joint's centre of rotation.

      Because Glenius is a relatively new product and only for use in specific and complex cases of
      severy glenoid erosion, follow-up data on the clinical and radiological outcome are scarce.
      With this study we aim to collect long-term clinical and radiological follow-up data for
      patients treated with Glenius in a uniform, standardized way.
