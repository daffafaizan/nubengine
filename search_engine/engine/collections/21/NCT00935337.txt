    
      In this follow-up, we ask subjects to answer the same questionnaires that they completed at
      the beginning of the study. In addition we will ask subjects to complete a survey reflecting
      their medical history over the past 6 months and a second survey establishing their
      behavioral patterns and whether they continued practicing techniques of the intervention they
      were assigned to.
