      : Comparison of prognosis between RA-ILD and RA-non ILD patients

      Secondary objectives

        1. Identification of the prognostic factors or aggravation factors of ILD in RA-ILD
           patients

        2. Identification of the association between ILD and autoantibody profiles in RA-ILD
           patients

        3. Comparison of RA disease activity control between RA-ILD and RA-non ILD patients using
           disease activity score (DAS)28-erythrocyte sedimentation ratio (ESR), DAS28 C-reactive
           protein (CRP), simple disease activity index (SDAI) and clinical disease activity index
           (CDAI)

        4. Comparison of biologic and non-biologic DMARD treatment response in RA-ILD patients
           using disease activity parameters

      The study population will be adult RA patients who have checked a chest computed tomography
      (CT) scan within 2 years of enrollment. No additional visits or laboratory tests will be done
      outside the routine clinical practice for RA-non ILD patients. For RA-ILD patients, high
      resolution computed tomography (HRCT), pulmonary function test (PFT) and 6-min walk test will
      be examined annually to identify the progression of ILD. Selection of medication including
      conventional DMARDs, biologic DMARDs, glucocorticoid, and inhaler, dosing and treatment
      duration are at the discretion of the investigator.
