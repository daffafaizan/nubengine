      addiction of Cyclophosphamide to Rd (CRd) treatment significantly increases response rates
      and prolonged the outcome (PFS, OS) in patients who experienced a biochemical relapse,
      without CRAB under Rd treatment. Patients will be evaluated at scheduled visits in up to 3
      study periods: pre-treatment, treatment and long-term follow-up (LTFU).

      The pre-treatment period includes: screening visits, performed at study entry. After
      providing written informed consent to participate in the study, patients will be evaluated
      for study eligibility. The screening period includes the availability of inclusion criteria
      described above. Subjects who meet all the inclusion criteria will be enrolled.

      The treatment period includes: administration of the combination CRd for 9 cycles. In order
      to assess the efficacy and safety of treatment, patients will attend the study center visits
      at least every 2 weeks. The response will be assessed after each cycle.

      During the LTFU period, after development of confirmed progression disease (PD), all patients
      are to be followed for survival every 1-3 months via telephone or office visit.
