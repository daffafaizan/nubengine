    
      Participants were randomized to receive denosumab 120 mg or placebo every 4 weeks (Q4W) until
      approximately 660 participants developed bone metastasis or died and the primary efficacy and
      safety analyses were completed.

      All participants undergoing scheduled assessments were offered open-label denosumab 120 mg
      subcutaneous (SC) until they either developed a bone metastasis, obtained access to
      commercially available product in this setting, or for up to 3 years, whichever came first.
      For participants who ended participation before the open-label extension (OLE) phase or
      withdrew from investigational product during the OLE phase, their survival data was to be
      collected every 6 months for up to 3 years after their last dose of investigational product.

      Participants in the Czech Republic and United Kingdom were enrolled under a separate protocol
      for the OLE phase per Health Authority request, and are reported separately (Study 20080585;
      NCT01824342).
