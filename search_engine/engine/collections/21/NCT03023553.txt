      study will help identify and describe important factors in the early-stage development of
      influenza immunity and possibly lead to the development of more effective vaccines. This
      study will be conducted in healthy male and female volunteers 18-30 years of age who received
      one of two seasonal influenza vaccine types, intramuscular standard trivalent inactivated
      influenza vaccine (TIV) or live, attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) given by intranasal
      spray.

      Participants are divided into two groups. The control group will receive the 2012-2013
      formulation of the standard intramuscular trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV). A
      blood sample and nasopharyngeal swab samples (one from each nostril) will be collected at a
      single visit, Day 0. For those in the live, attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) group, at the
      first visit, they will receive a single administration of the 2012-2013 formulation of LAIV.
      At the second study visit two days later, they will provide a blood sample and two
      nasopharyngeal swab samples (one from each nostril).
