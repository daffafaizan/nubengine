      (Amalaki), Terminalia bellerica (Bibhitaki), and Terminalia chebula (Haritaki)] are commonly
      used for skin based treatments in India. However, the scientific evidence for their specific
      effects on the skin are scant. Rubia cordifolia is a root that is used in skin care for
      pigmentation and inflammation.1 Triphala is thought to have antioxidant properties and reduce
      inflammation in general. Herbs have been shown to modulate the gut microbiome, as previous
      studies have suggested that triphala may modify the gut microbiome.2

      However, few studies have assessed the effects of these herbs from a skin biophysical
      perspective. Here, we aim to understand how these herbs can modulate the skin's barrier
      properties and the gut microbiome.
