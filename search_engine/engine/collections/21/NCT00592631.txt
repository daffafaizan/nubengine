      reactivity) after inhalation of agents that induce constriction of the bronchi in healthy
      adults. This response is absent in adult asthmatics; however, there is data demonstrating
      that use of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) for short periods of time may decrease
      airway reactivity in adult asthmatics. This suggests that although deep inspirations may not
      result in decreased airway reactivity, sustained lung inflation may lead to changes in
      asthmatic airway smooth muscle structure that lead to a decrease in airway reactivity. The
      purpose of our study is to determine whether short and long term use of CPAP in children and
      adults leads to decreased airway reactivity. If airway reactivity is decreased with CPAP,
      this may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for patients with asthma.
