      hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). The purpose of the study is to find out whether
      adult patients with bicytopenia or pancytopenia fulfilling the clinical HLH criteria used in
      children reflect life-threatening hemophagocytosis and whether hemophagocytosis is associated
      with responsiveness to recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulation factor (rhG-CSF) or
      not.
