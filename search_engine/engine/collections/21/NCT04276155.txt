      worsens the short-term, medium-term and long-term prognosis. It is then usual, according to
      ESC recommendations, to add to the DAPT, an anticoagulant treatment, which is a source of
      iatrogenic events, in particular hemorrhagic events. However, recurrence is not a certainty.
      Albeit variable, its highest rate is estimated to be 38%. Consequently, a well-conducted
      screening of atrial fibrillation recurrence could allow to treat only selected recurrent
      patients. At present, this screening can be carried out in a reliable and minimally invasive
      way with an implantable device with telecardiology. We propose a study for these patients
      with ACS associated with de novo AF. The study will be multicenter, randomized, open-label,
      with two arms: patient conventionally treated (DAPT + AC) and patient treated by DAPT +
      implantable device and followed for two years by telecardiology. This patient will only
      reintegrate the first arm in case of AF recurrence.
