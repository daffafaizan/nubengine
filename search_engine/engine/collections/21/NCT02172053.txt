      the effectiveness the training heavy with resistance exercise program in the muscle fatigue
      control. Methods: This is a randomized controlled trial by cluster, in which workers who
      participate in the intervention group will perform resistance exercise protocols; and workers
      in the comparative group held only stretching exercises and light resistance training with
      elastic bands. Expected results: strong evidence that fatigue reducing after ten weeks in
      workers and improve in others outcomes. Not found in literature studies in occupational
      evaluating this aspect of training.
