    
      COHIVE is an observational cohort study nested within four parent open label randomised
      clinical trials of first- and second-line antiretroviral therapies (ADVANCE - NCT03122262;
      D²EFT - NCT03017872; DolPHIN2 - NCT03249181 and NAMSAL-ANRS12313 - NCT02777229). COHIVE
      objective is to study the occurrence and outcomes of COVID-19 in people living with HIV
      across a variety of clinical settings. Taken together, these pivotal trials provide an
      established population and encompass a range of HIV therapies, HIV populations, and
      geographic regions to capture the full spectrum of these global public health emergency as it
      pertains to people living with HIV.

      The sample will include participants who are possible symptomatic or confirmed COVID-19
      cases, and participants who agree to enrol in the SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence cohort
      (regardless of SARS-CoV-2 infection). Approximately 2,500 participants are enrolled in these
      4 studies.

      Enrolment into COHIVE substudy is voluntary and optional for participants in ADVANCE, D²EFT,
      DolPHIN2 and NAMSAL studies. Parameters relevant to COHIVE substudy including demographics,
      arm of randomised ART, medical and HIV history, immunological and virological results,
      adverse events at required time points will be collected as part of parent studies. Substudy
      specific assessments performed at baseline include optional sample collection for SARS-CoV-2
      RT-PCR and serology; for the possible symptomatic or confirmed COVID-19 cases, the management
      of the patients, diagnostic test results, and outcomes, will be collected.
