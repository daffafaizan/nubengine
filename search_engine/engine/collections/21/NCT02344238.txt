    
      The primary objective of the clinical trial is to evaluate the acceptability, tolerability,
      and efficacy of the ID-Cap System in a healthy population.

      Participation in the study takes 10 visits over a period of approximately five weeks. The
      first visit is a screening visit to determine if participants are eligible to participate.
      After inclusion into the study, participants will be randomized into one of three groups.
      Participants randomized to Group 1 will have compliance measured by patient reports, pill
      count, and riboflavin measurement. Participants randomized to Group 2 will have compliance
      measured by patient reports, pill count, riboflavin measurement, and data collected by the
      e-Tect reader. Participants randomized to Group 3 will also have compliance measured by
      patient reports, pill count, riboflavin measurement, and data collected by the ID-Cap reader.
      However, participants randomized to this group will also receive reminder calls and/or text
      messages to ingest the study medication if a signal is not sent from the ID-Cap reader to the
      study team within one hour of the scheduled medication administration time.

      After the initial screening visit, participants will present to the clinic twice weekly to
      complete self-reports of compliance, provide urine samples for riboflavin assessment, and be
      assessed for adverse effects.

      They will also be asked to attend one follow-up visit to include abdominal x-ray in order to
      confirm passage of the capsules.
