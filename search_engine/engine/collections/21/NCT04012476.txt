      patients who present post-thyroidectomy hypocalcemia with that of patients who do not have
      it. Therefore, the following points will be studied:

        -  To study the correlation between parathyroid vascularization (intraoperative
           fluorescence intensity) and postoperative glandular function (serum calcium and
           parathormone levels).

        -  To compare the surgeon's subjective assessment of parathyroid fluorescence in the groups
           of patients with and without postoperative hypocalcemia.

        -  To compare the objective assessment of parathyroid fluorescence, by using specific
           computer software developed ad hoc, in the groups of patients with and without
           postoperative hypocalcemia.
