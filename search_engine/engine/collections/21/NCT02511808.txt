      alcohol problems that spans a spectrum of severity from individuals who drink excessively and
      experience of occasional negative consequences to those with moderate Alcohol Dependence (AD)
      and intact psychosocial functioning. PDs can benefit from relatively brief treatment that
      could be delivered in mainstream healthcare, but less than 5% receive such care. In addition,
      PD treatment is only modestly effective, and there is a surprising absence of empirical
      research to guide PD treatment selection. Adaptive Interventions (AI) are a novel approach to
      treatment development that may have significant advantages over fixed treatments in improving
      efficacy and fostering adoption of Evidence Based Practices in mainstream healthcare. If
      study aims are achieved, a set of empirically-derived decision support tools will be created
      to guide Alcohol Use Disorders (AUD) care similar to tools that exist for other chronic
      diseases. In addition, new knowledge will be gained about Mechanisms of Behavior Change of
      AUD that can guide future AUD treatment research. Finally, important progress will be made in
      methods that capitalize on the remarkable advances in sensor technologies, advanced
      mathematics, and engineering to create a new type of tailored, near-real time feedback,
      adaptive behavior therapies.
