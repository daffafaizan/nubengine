      hands and arms, sometimes experienced by people with diabetes. Neuropathic pain syndromes are
      much more common than is perhaps generally recognized. Approximately 1% of the population in
      western countries suffers from neuropathic pain. Some clinical conditions are associated with
      a relatively high incidence of neuropathic pain. Approximately 15% of patients with diabetic
      neuropathy have persistent neuropathic pain in the feet, legs and hands.
