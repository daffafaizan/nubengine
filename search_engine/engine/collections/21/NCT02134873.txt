      therapeutic purposes; less than half receive interventions to manage pain. Both immediate and
      long term effects of unmanaged pain in these vulnerable infants have been reported, including
      impaired brain development. To ensure optimal outcomes for hospitalized infants in NICUs,
      there is a crucial need to minimize procedural pain and its associated consequences. Multiple
      clinical trials have identified sucrose as an effective strategy for reducing procedural pain
      in infants. Despite its inclusion in neonatal pain guidelines, standards, and consensus
      statements sucrose has been inconsistently used. The under-utilization of sucrose may be
      explained by knowledge gaps in relation to the minimally effective dose and the influence of
      concurrent opioid analgesia, as well as the short and long-term effects of repeated
      administration. Once infants in the NICU are determined to be eligible for the study and
      parents consent, infants will be randomized to one of 3 dose of sucrose and their pain will
      be assessed using a validated pain assessment measure.
