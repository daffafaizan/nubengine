      cancer remains incurable partially due to the lack of targeted therapy for selected subsets
      of patients. There are five distinct subsets of breast cancer with unique biological
      profiles. Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a subset with special clinical interest
      because of its significant percentage of occurrence (10-20% of all breast cancer diagnoses)
      and its poor prognosis. With no defined targeted therapy to date, this study seeks to
      investigate a therapeutic strategy based on specific molecular abnormalities in the tumor
      cells of TNBC.
