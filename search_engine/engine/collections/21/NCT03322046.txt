      areas was performed. First responders attended a one hour lecture on the specific risks of
      CVD in that population and then qualified intervention candidates were enrolled into a
      lifestyle program, consisting of telephone-based coaching sessions with a registered
      dietitian and an online/app based food journaling program. Both groups had blood test draws
      at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months. The intervention group met with the team practitioner to
      review results and progress after each blood draw. The test panel comprised blood-based
      markers of CVD risk associated with lipid metabolism, metabolics, inflammation and basic
      liver and kidney function.
