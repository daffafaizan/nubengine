      Primary

        -  Determine whether breast density, as measured by digital mammography, decreases in
           premenopausal women receiving tamoxifen for breast cancer or for breast cancer risk
           reduction.

        -  Determine whether breast density, as determined by a trained mammographer, decreases in
           patients treated with this drug.

        -  Correlate tamoxifen-induced symptoms in estrogen target tissue with change in salivary
           steroids in patients treated with this drug.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the effect of this drug on salivary steroids in regularly cycling and
           amenorrheic patients.

        -  Correlate changes in breast density with tamoxifen-induced alterations in sex steroid
           levels, as measured in the saliva, of patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral tamoxifen once daily. Treatment continues for 5 years in the
      absence of disease metastasis (patients with known breast cancer) or a diagnosis of breast
      cancer (patients undergoing risk reduction).

      Patients undergo mammography to determine breast density at baseline, at 6 and 12 months, and
      then annually for 4 years. Patients also collect daily salivary samples during the 30-day
      periods surrounding the imaging studies to measure salivary estradiol and progesterone
      levels. The results of the salivary hormone studies are correlated with density changes at
      study completion.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 100 patients will be accrued for this study.
