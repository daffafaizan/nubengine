      patient population in the pediatric dental clinics at Baylor College of Dentistry and in
      select faculty private practices. The study will use a within-subject control design whereby
      one tooth will be treated with a pulpotomy using the new formulation of MTA (NeoMTA Plus,
      Avalon Biomed Inc., Bradenton, FL, USA) and restored with a multi-surface composite, and the
      other tooth with an MTA pulpotomy and restored with a SSC; thus, approximately 50 teeth will
      be treated for each treatment group. The restoration type will be randomized as to which side
      will receive the SSC or composite using sealed, opaque envelopes. Approximately 50 subjects
      will be needed for the study in order to elicit any significant findings as demonstrated by a
      power analysis from a similar study.
