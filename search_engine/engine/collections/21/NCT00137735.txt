      universal agreement. Recent reports suggested that untreated CTS might improve or remain
      stationary. In this respect, treatment directing towards symptom suppression alone may have a
      role in the initial management of CTS. Gabapentin (1-[aminomethyl]-cyclohexaneacetic acid;
      Neurontin, Pfizer) is an effective drug for treatment of neuropathic pain and has been
      reported to be effective in case series for the treatment of CTS with relatively benign side
      effects profile. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      gabapentin in the treatment of CTS.
