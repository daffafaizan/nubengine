      polymer hydrogel chemically impregnated into a rayon/polyester formed fabric, forming a
      pliable, conforming solid matrix. TheraGauze is FDA Class I exempt (regulation #21CFR,
      product code 5878.4022). It is hypothesized that this material will be useful for the
      treatment of full-thickness diabetic ulcers. It is further hypothesized that this material
      will enhance the action of Regranex (becaplermin) gel by providing an optimal environment for
      this growth factor to function. This study will observe patient outcomes following diabetic
      foot ulcer treatment with TheraGauze and with or without the use of Regranex.
