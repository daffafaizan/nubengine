      SPECIMEN COLLECTION: Patients undergo collection of tumor tissue and peripheral blood samples
      for analysis via next generation sequencing to identify novel pathways in the pathogenesis of
      breast cancer.

      TREATMENT: Patients are invited to participate in a treatment study. Patients receive
      cyclophosphamide orally (PO) daily on days 1-21, methotrexate PO QD on days 1, 8, and 15, and
      capecitabine PO twice daily (BID) on days 1-14. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 8 cycles
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up for 24 months.
