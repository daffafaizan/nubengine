      traditionally performed under general anesthesia with opioid-based analgesia. It is
      associated with higher incidences of PONV, more severe acute postoperative pain and increased
      incidences of chronic pain. The possibility of higher risk of metastasis has also been
      reported.

      The purpose of our study is to compare the opioid-free general anesthesia with the
      opioid-based general anesthesia with respect to the quality of recovery, postoperative pain
      and cancer recurrence and metastasis.
