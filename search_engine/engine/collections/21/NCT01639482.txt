      18-Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography imaging, will be characterized (FDG PET).
      The following hypothesis will be tested: Antidepressant response or remission in depressed
      BPD patients will be associated with changes in cortical (prefrontal, parietal, premotor) and
      paralimbic (hippocampus, anterior cingulate, subgenual cingulate, posterior cingulate, and
      anterior insula) regions, consistent with SRI antidepressant response in unipolar depressed
      patients.
