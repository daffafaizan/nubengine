      Severe acute pain as well as long-lasting pain after surgery and pain-related interference of
      daily activities are frequent. Some risk factors for severe pain after surgery in adults have
      been described, e.g. younger age and pre-existing chronic pain. The question arises whether a
      specific genetic background is related to an unfavorable pain outcome.

      Objective

      The aim of this study is to investigate clinical and genetic variables and their possible
      association to severe acute postoperative pain, higher analgesic consumption and the
      development of chronic postsurgical pain.

      Methods

      Prospective observational study investigating clinical, patient related, surgery related and
      anesthesia related variables as well as genetic variants and their possible association to
      patients' pain related outcome after surgery.
