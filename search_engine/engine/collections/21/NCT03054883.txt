      basic inclusion criteria. The study will enrol patients who will be treated according to
      standard protocol used in the hematologic department. Scheme of treatment: alternating cycles
      of R-CHOP and R-AraC: R-CHOP / R-AraC / R-CHOP / R-AraC / R-CHOP / R-AraC.

      Baseline procedures:

        -  CT or PET-CT (positron emission tomography with computed tomography)before starting
           treatment, after 3 cycles and at the end of treatment (after 6 cycles)

        -  bone marrow examination before therapy, after 3 cycles and after completion of induction

        -  maintenance rituximab based of standards of each centre

      The study was proposed based on the previously published data in the younger patients, which
      demonstrated improved outcome after implementation of Ara-C into induction.

      Primary objectives include response after induction by PET-CT and PFS (progression-free
      survival).

      Secondary objectives include OS (overall survival), and prognostic significance of minimal
      residual disease detection after completion of induction
