    
      This is a phase 4 prospective, nonrandomized, open label, interventional clinical trial.
      Study eyes will receive 5 required initial monthly IAI doses of 2 mg followed by 2q8 IAI for
      a total of 52 weeks; only one study eye from each patient will be enrolled.

      Starting at week 24, patients may be eligible to receive additional 2mg IAI (2q4) treatment
      if both of the following criteria is met and the investigator feels additional treatment
      would be beneficial:

        -  Loss of >5 letters from baseline or best previously recorded best corrected visual
           acuity (BCVA)

        -  Presence of new or recurrent intraretinal fluid or subretinal fluid as assessed by SD
           OCT

      Starting at week 24, rescue therapy with macular laser photocoagulation may be administered
      if any the following criteria are met

        -  Loss of > 15 letters from baseline or best previously recorded BCVA and loss of acuity
           felt to be secondary to Diabetic Macular Edema (DME) and not from other cause (i.e.,
           cataract, epiretinal membrane, vitreous hemorrhage, etc) and investigator feels patient
           would benefit from rescue therapy

        -  Increase in SD OCT CSF > 100 um from baseline or best previously recorded SD OCT CSF and
           investigator feels patient would benefit from rescue therapy.

      Every 4 week visit will include ETDRS BCVA, IOP measurement, Slit lamp biomicroscopy,
      Indirect ophthalmoscopy, Heidelberg Spectralis SD-OCT and evaluation for systemic and ocular
      adverse events. Fundus Photography and Wide field Optos fluorescein angiography will be
      performed at baseline and at week 20and week 52.

      STUDY DURATION: Approximately 52 weeks to the end of the study. Primary endpoint will be
      evaluated at week 52.
