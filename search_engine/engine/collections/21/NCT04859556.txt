      This study aims to compare the performance of the Alcon 25+速 UltraVit速 5000 cpm vitrectomy
      probe versus the 25+速 Ultravit 10,000 cpm速 beveled tip, dual drive vitrectomy probe. The
      safety profile and efficiency were compared.

      Method:

      Prospective, randomised study. Consecutive patients from January 2019 to August 2019
      requiring vitrectomy for retinal detachment, epiretinal membrane, vitreous haemorrhage, and
      macula hole were randomized into either the 10K or 5K vitrectomy group. Both groups underwent
      vitrectomy using the proportional vacuum mode with the cut rate set at the fastest rate.
      Patients with previous vitrectomy, other ocular diseases (glaucoma, corneal disease, or
      significant corneal opacities), or trauma were excluded from the study. The primary endpoint
      was vitrectomy time, while secondary endpoints included posterior vitreous detachment time,
      intraoperative complications, and number of instruments used. The preoperative, postoperative
      1 month and 3 month best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), and complications were recorded.
