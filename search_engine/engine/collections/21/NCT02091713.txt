      healthcare utilization data. Injury data will be collected at baseline and for six
      iterations, every 60 days, over the course of one year following baseline. Based on the data
      collected, clinical prediction rules will be used to develop computerized algorithm to
      predict injury risk in these populations. Moreover, these results will assist in creating
      individualized preventing physical training program.
