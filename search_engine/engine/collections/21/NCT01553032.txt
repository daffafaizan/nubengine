      manageable side effects, the implementation of Cetuximab an EGFR targeting antibody
      demonstrated successfully a significant increase in survival times, although exhibiting an
      expected increase in skin toxicities (1,2). This Phase IV trial will explore this prominent
      side effect, which is due to a synergistic effect of radiodermatitis and acneiform rash, in
      great detail. In addition, feasibility aspects of the complex treatment schedule in common
      routine and with patients presenting an increased comorbidity rate compared to the study
      population studied in the pivotal Phase III trial will be observed.

      Further, peripheral blood samples of patients that consent to participate in the molecular
      monitoring will be collected and their genetic, epigenetic- and transcriptional profiles
      correlated with clinical outcome parameters. The goal of this translational program is to
      identify and confirm novel peripheral blood based molecular predictors and surrogates of
      therapy response. Tissue samples and available medical evidence of patients that consent to
      participate in the assessment of the HPV status will be collected. The goal of this program
      is to correlate HPV status with clinical outcome parameters.

      In addition, all patients will answer Quality of Life questionnaires including the EORTC
      QLQ-C30 questionnaire, the Head and Neck cancer specific module (3) and the Dermatology Life
      Quality Index (DLQI).

      This prospective, open, multicenter phase IV study is designed to assess the rate of
      radiodermatitis in patients with LASCCHN treated with a combination of radiotherapy and the
      EGFR-targeted monoclonal antibody Cetuximab.
