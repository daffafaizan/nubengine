      THERMAL IMAGER:

      A thermal imager (a camera similar to a digital camera) takes pictures of skin surfaces. The
      imager is able to view temperature distribution of the skin surface.

      STUDY PARTICIPATION:

      If you agree to take part in this study, your body temperature will be measured with thermal
      imaging.

      You will have thermal imaging sessions several times before the cancer treatment starts and
      during the therapy course. You will be given detailed instructions on how to prepare for the
      imaging sessions ahead of time as well as what to expect during the imaging sessions.

      Before beginning thermal imaging, your temperature will be measured with a thermometer. To
      perform thermal imaging, you will be asked to take off all of your clothes in a private room
      and stand still in front of a thermal imaging camera. No one will be present while you
      disrobe. When you have finished taking off your clothes a radiation oncologist or other
      medical doctor will record several pictures from a computer stationed outside the room.
      Pictures of your front, back, and side views will be taken. These pictures will look like a
      silhouette (body outline) with thermal coloring. The entire imaging session should take about
      10 minutes to complete each time.

      LENGTH OF STUDY:

      Your participation will be over in this study after the thermal images have been recorded.

      This is an investigational study. Thermal imaging is FDA approved and commercially available
      for breast cancer screening. Its use in this study is investigational. Up to 35 patients will
      take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.

      Volunteers will not participate in any part of cancer treatment, diagnostic imaging tests
      (CT, PET, etc), or any other clinical procedures in MD Anderson. Volunteers will not need to
      see physicians at MD Anderson or elsewhere. Thermal images will be taken 4 times during one
      day for a volunteer (morning, midmorning, earlier afternoon, late afternoon). Volunteers
      should not take any medications or perform any other medical procedures from morning to late
      afternoon until the thermal imaging is completed.

      LENGTH OF STUDY:

      Your participation will be over in this study after the thermal images have been recorded.

      This is an investigational study. Thermal imaging is FDA approved and commercially available
      for breast cancer screening. Its use in this study is investigational. Up to 10 volunteers
      without cancer (5 males and 5 non-pregnant females) will take part in this study. All will be
      enrolled at M. D. Anderson.
