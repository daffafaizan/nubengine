    
      This is a single-arm, open-label, phase II trial for patients in complete cytogenetic
      response that have not achieved major molecular response or have lost a prior major molecular
      response, after at least 18 months of treatment with imatinib.

      All enrolled patients will receive dasatinib 100 mg once daily orally for 1 year until
      progression, loss of cytogenetic response, transformation to advanced phases, unacceptable
      toxicity (clinical adverse event, lab abnormality or concurrent disease), pregnancy if a
      female or withdrawal of consent, whichever happens first. Patients will undergo BCR-ABL
      assessments at study entry and every 3 months (central lab) and immunophenotyping and studies
      for clonal lymphocytosis at study entry, at 3 and 6 months.

      Cytogenetic assessment will be done only if loss of response/progression/clonal evolution are
      suspected.

      Subjects will be evaluated for the efficacy and safety of dasatinib (Sprycel). Lymphocytosis
      data will be collected for all patients and separate description for efficacy and safety
      parameters will be done in patients with and without lymphocytosis.
