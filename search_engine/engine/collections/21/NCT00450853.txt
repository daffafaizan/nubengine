      either intravenously or orally. Nevertheless sometimes neither administration route is
      feasible, such as in patients unable to admit oral intake managed in an outpatient setting.
      Our objective is to evaluate the bioavailability of subcutaneous granisetron.Patients
      receiving platinum-based chemotherapy will be randomized to receive granisetron 3 mg either
      subcutaneously or intravenously in a crossover manner during two cycles. Blood and urine
      samples will be collected after each cycle. Pharmacokinetics of SC and IV granisetron will be
      prospectively compared.
