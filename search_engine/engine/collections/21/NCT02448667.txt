      exercise capacity, and that exercise induces muscle pain and cramps. These symptoms are
      caused by the inability to mobilize skeletal muscle glycogen and are most likely the
      consequence of a severe energy deficiency within muscles. The study changed the phenotype of
      GSDIIIa, to include exercise-induced symptoms, which is a typical presentation in other
      metabolic myopathies. It also documented that exercise capacity was significantly improved
      while exercise-induced muscular symptoms were relieved by an intravenous glucose infusion.
      Based on these findings, this study wishes to investigate if oral ingestion of sucrose has
      the same effects on work capacity on a larger number of patients, in a randomized,
      placebo-controlled, cross-over setup. Ingestion of sucrose has the potential to be an
      effective, cheap and easily accessible dietary treatment of muscular symptoms in GSDIIIa.
