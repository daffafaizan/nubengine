      with an isoenergetic, equal weight chocolate cookie and 2. test the hypothesis that a carob
      preload consumed as snack before a meal, compared to chocolate cookie would: (a) have greater
      short-term effect on satiety measured by subsequent ad libitum meal intake, (b) induce
      greater satiety as assessed by visual analogue scales (VAS), and (c) reduce postprandial
      glycemic response.
