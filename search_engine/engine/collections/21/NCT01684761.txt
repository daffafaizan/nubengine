      provide blood to manufacture Tcelna. Approximately 5 weeks after receipt of the subject's
      whole blood procurement, the subjects will receive either Tcelna or placebo and will complete
      baseline assessments and will receive study treatments at Weeks 0, 4, 8, 12, and 24 (Visits
      3-7), totaling 5 doses in year one.

      Approximately one month prior to the Week 52 visit a second blood procurement will be
      performed and the subject will receive the second series of treatments as received in the
      first year study schedule. Subjects will be evaluated for changes in disability and cognitive
      function every 3 months, and radiographic changes annually.
