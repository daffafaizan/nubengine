      applied nasally) on the increase of peak nasal inspiratory flow in patients suffering from
      moderately severe / severe persistent allergic rhinitis.

      The design of the trial is parallel-groups, double blind, randomized, placebo controlled,
      single centre study.

      Forty patients are randomly assigned to receive either oxymetazoline followed by HPMC (Group
      A) or oxymetazoline followed by placebo (Group B).

      Each patient is followed up for 15 days. Day 1 is the screening and inclusion visit. Data
      will then be collected on day 8 & 15. Patients will fill in diaries their everyday symptoms,
      adverse events and applied medications.
