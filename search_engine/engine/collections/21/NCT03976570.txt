      are possibly more sensitive to their environment. Therefore, it is very important to target
      the elimination of symptoms with appropriate preventive therapies before this disorder
      occurs. One of the promising preventive therapy option may be occupational therapy.

      Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder can have a negative impact on occupational
      performance such as: activities of daily living, education, resting, sleeping, playing and
      social participation. Occupational therapists are able to provide interventions to improve
      engagement in daily activities on social skills, play, executive functioning, impulsivity,
      inattention, and motor coordination.

      Although the guidelines about the treatment of ADHD are primarily medically and
      psychologically based, certain treatment components are useful for occupational therapy
      practice; for example, behavioural management of the child and psychoeducational programmes
      for families.

      However, treatment recommendations for subthreshold ADHD cases or the population at risk are
      limited. This study investigates the effectiveness of occupational therapy in subthreshold
      attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.
