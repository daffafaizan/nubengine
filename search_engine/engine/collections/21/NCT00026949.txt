    
      Etoposide is a topoisomerase II inhibitor that has a broad range of anticancer activity at
      conventional doses (100 mg/m(2) daily x 5 days) and is administered in high doses (greater
      than 1200 mg/m(2)) as a component of pre-transplant myeloablative chemotherapy regimens.
      Etoposide pharmacokinetics are linear over a 30-fold dose range, but disposition is highly
      variable. Etoposide is highly protein bound (95%) to albumin, but protein binding (and
      therefore free drug concentrations) vary widely in cancer patients. Etoposide is eliminated
      by metabolism and renal excretion, which may also contribute to the variability. The
      pharmacokinetics of etoposide will be studied in patients receiving high-dose etoposide as
      part of their pre-transplant preparative regimen, and pharmacokinetic parameters generated
      from pharmacokinetic modeling will be correlated with clinical and laboratory characteristics
      and toxicity in order to develop more rational dosing methods.
