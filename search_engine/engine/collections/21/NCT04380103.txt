      (irinotecan/oxaliplatin/fluorouracil) can further improves survival benefit for patients with
      metastatic colorectal cancer(mCRC) compared to standard two-drug regimens in first-line
      therapy, especially when combined with bevacizumab. However, the increased toxicities of
      FOLFOXIRI limited its usage. Capecitabine demonstrates a superior efficacy and safety than
      fluorouracil, so we designed this trial to evaluate if the XELOXIRI plus bevacizumab can be a
      better alternative to FOLFOXIRI plus bevacizumab. The phase I study is to determine the
      safety and the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of XELOXIRI plus Bevacizumab. In the phase II
      study, we aim to determine the efficacy of the regimen as first-line therapy for mCRC and
      explore potential molecular biomarkers (genomes, circulating tumor cell) for toxicity
      forecasting or efficacy monitoring.
