      Primary

        -  Determine the antitumor activity of valganciclovir in patients with classic
           non-HIV-associated Kaposi's sarcoma (KS).

      Secondary

        -  Determine the effect of this drug on lytic and latent human herpesvirus-8 gene
           expression in KS lesions of these patients.

        -  Determine the effect of this drug on the markers of angiogenesis in KS lesions of these
           patients.

        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot study.

      Patients receive oral valganciclovir twice daily for 3 weeks and then once daily for 21 weeks
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      All patients are followed for 1 month after completion of therapy. Patients with responding
      disease are followed monthly for up to 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.
