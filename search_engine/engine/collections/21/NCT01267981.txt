      gastrointestinal bleeding exploration. The responsible damage of this unexplained bleeding
      are frequently small vascular damages, hard to be detected in the bowel or ulcerations or
      tumors. The exam quality can be limited by food residues, bubbles or bile.

      30% of damage are probably undetectable because of a lack of visibility. An efficient
      preparation will probably increased the quality of the video-capsule exploration.

      The bowel exploration by endoscopy video-capsule will be realized in the usual condition. The
      study included 4 steps:

        1. Inclusion

        2. Randomization

        3. Video-capsule exploration

        4. Reading of the video-capsule exam by endoscopist doctors who are in blind.
