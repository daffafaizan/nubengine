      IgG-subclass deficiency and/or selective antipolysaccharide antibody deficiency. At present,
      there are no robust criteria to predict which patient will or will not respond adequately to
      antibiotic treatment or to IVIG. Furthermore, it is unknown whether IVIG treatment improves
      the quality of life in these patients. Therefore, the Dutch InterUniversity Working Party
      intends to start a study in this patient group. In this study, treatment for a year with
      antibiotics will be compared with a year intravenous immunoglobulin therapy with respect to
      clinical outcome measures in both children and adults with this disorder.

      The patient will visit the clinic every 3 months during which laboratory tests and
      physiological measurements will be performed. Moreover the occurrence of infections and
      fever, the use of antibiotics, hospital admissions, and quality of life will be documented.

      The study should result in a national harmonization in the treatment of this patient group.
      To this end, the results of the study will be used to compile a treatment protocol for this
      group of patients in the Netherlands and if applicable also in other countries worldwide.
