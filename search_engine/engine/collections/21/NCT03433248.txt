      inhibitors are relatively novel glucose-lowering drugs for the treatment of T2DM. These
      agents seem to exert pleiotropic actions 'beyond glucose control'. SGLT-2 inhibitors decrease
      proximal sodium reabsorption and decrease glomerular pressure and albuminuria in rodents and
      type 1 diabetes patients. In addition, SGLT-2 inhibitors reduce, blood pressure and body
      weight. In rodents, SGLT-2 inhibitors also improved histopathological abnormalities
      associated with DKD. DPP-4 inhibitors are considered weight neutral, improve lipid profiles
      and slight reductions in blood pressure have been reported. To date, the potential
      renoprotective effects and mechanisms of SGLT-2 inhibitors and combination therapy with
      SGLT-2 inhibitors have not been sufficiently detailed in human type 2 diabetes. The current
      study aims to explore the clinical effects and mechanistics of mono- and combination therapy
      with an SGLT-2 inhibitor and a DPP-4 inhibitor on renal physiology and biomarkers in
      metformin-treated T2DM patients.

      66 patients with type 2 diabetes will undergo a 16-week intervention period with 8-week
      empagliflozin (SGLT-2 inhibitor) monotherapy, followed by 8-week empagliflozin and
      linagliptin (DPP-4 inhibitor) combination therapy or 8-week linagliptin monotherapy, followed
      by 8-week linagliptin and empagliflozin combination therapy or 8-week gliclazide (SU
      derivative), followed by 8-week gliclazide intensification therapy in order to assess changes
      in the outcome parameters.
