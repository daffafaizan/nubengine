      condition affecting 70% of amputees, so as to improve these patients' quality of life.
      Traditionally, mirror box therapy and other tools based on the same concept, have been used
      to alleviate pain, but their efficacy varies greatly. This project targets amputees for whom
      other PLP treatments have failed. Various virtual environments, including virtual/augmented
      reality, are controlled by the patient's phantom limb using muscle (myoelectric) signals from
      the stump. The patient learns to reactivates areas in the brain related to motor control of
      the missing limb.

      The medical device is non-invasive and based on surface electromyography, a standard and
      widely used clinical and research tool. The surface electrodes are a standard disposable
      electrodes widely used in clinics and hospitals for EMG and/or ECG.

      The clinical investigation period consists of 12 sessions per patient including 3 short
      follow-up assessments. Length of the session: 1.5 hours (the first sessions can take longer
      time due to learning/familiarization). The centers participating in this study can choose
      between the following treatment administrations:

        -  2 times per week (advised)

        -  1 time per week

        -  Daily (5 times per week)
