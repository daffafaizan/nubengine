    
      The principle objectives of this study are to assess safety and tolerability and to explore
      pharmacokinetic(PK) and pharmacodynamic(PD) parameters of a single dose of a novel very-long
      acting insulin formulation (HM12460A) in comparison to a single dose of human Neutral
      Protamine Hagedorn (NPH) in healthy volunteers (part 1), subjects with type 1 diabetes (part
      2) and in subjects with type 2 diabetes (part 3).

      The study will incorporate adaptive elements to provide both PK and PD data. The dose of
      HM12460A to be administered to the subjects with type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes will be
      guided by PK data from part 1 of the study; the PD assessment of HM12460A in subjects with
      diabetes will also be informed by knowledge of PK gained from the healthy volunteer study.
