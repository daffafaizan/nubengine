      same night, patients will be asked to collect their urines. Twentyfour-hour ambulatory BP
      monitoring (ABPM) will be performed starting from the next morning. After analysis of the
      polygraphic recording, subjects with AHI <15 will be excluded from the study, while CPAP will
      be proposed as a treatment to the other patients.

      Before starting treatment, a full night standard polysomnography will be performed: in
      subjects assigned to fixed CPAP for attended CPAP titration; in the other subjects during
      application of the Somnosmart2 device, to verify if obstructive events are adequately
      eliminated by it.

      After analysis of polysomnography, patients will be given a fixed CPAP or the auto-CPAP
      device for nocturnal home use. Two months later, compliance to treatment will be verified
      measured by the in-built time counter of the devices. Then, cardiorespiratory monitoring
      during application of the device used for treatment, nocturnal urine collection and 24-hour
      ABPM will be repeated.
