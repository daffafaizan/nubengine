      Primary

        -  Determine the recommended phase II dose of AT7519M in patients with advanced or
           metastatic solid tumors or refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

        -  Determine the safety, tolerability, toxicity profile, and dose-limiting toxicities of
           this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetic profile of this drug in these patients.

        -  Correlate the toxicity profile with pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Assess, preliminarily, the antitumor activity of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation, multicenter study.

      Patients receive AT7519M IV over 1-3 hours on days 1, 4, 8, and 11. Courses repeat every 21
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of AT7519M until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity during course 1. Once the MTD has been determined,
      up to 8 additional patients are treated at the MTD.

      Patients undergo blood collection periodically for pharmacokinetic studies. Patients treated
      at the MTD also undergo tumor tissue biopsies or aspirates and blood collection periodically
      for additional pharmacodynamic and correlative biomarker studies.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed at 4 weeks. Patients with complete
      response, partial response, or stable disease are followed every 3 months thereafter until
      relapse.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.
