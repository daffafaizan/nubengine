      initial assessment or for recurrence detection. Tumor uptake was quantified by the maximum
      standard uptake value (SUVmax). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value
      (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and accuracy of 68Ga-DOTA/NOTA-FAPI-04 PET/CT were
      calculated.
