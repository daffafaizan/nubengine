      pathophysiology of schizophrenia making this system a potential target for therapeutic
      agents. PDEs are a family of enzymes that hydrolyse cyclic nucleotides and thus play a key
      role in regulating intracellular levels of the second messenger cyclic adenosine
      monophosphate (cAMP) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate. Pentoxifylline (PTX) is a methylated
      xanthine derivative and a PDE inhibitor that is FDA-approved for the treatment of patients
      with intermittent claudication on the basis of chronic occlusive arterial disease of the
      limbs. It is known to inhibit platelet aggregation, increase erythrocyte flexibility or
      deformability, and reduce blood viscosity. The rationale for its use in schizophrenia is that
      it competitively inhibits PDEs, resulting in increased cAMP levels, the activation of protein
      kinase A (PKA), the inhibition of IL and TNF-Î± synthesis, and reduced inflammation.
      Furthermore, there is growing evidence to support the inflammatory hypothesis of
      schizophrenia, the investigators will also explore whether cytokine levels mediate the
      response from pentoxifylline treatment.
