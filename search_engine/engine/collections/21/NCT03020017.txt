      I. To assess the safety of intravenous NU-0129 in patients with recurrent glioblastoma
      multiforme (GBM) or gliosarcoma (GS).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To analyze drug concentration in serum at specific time points after drug administration.

      II. To demonstrate intratumoral penetration of NU-0129. III. To assess the feasibility of
      giving NU-0129 as a standard treatment for recurrent GBM or GS.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To analyze tumor tissue for Bcl2L12 expression levels after NU-0129 administration.

      II. Preliminary response (progression free survival [PFS] and overall survival [OS] at 6
      months; overall response rate [ORR]).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive NU-0129 intravenously (IV) over 20-50 minutes and undergo standard of care
      tumor resection within 8-48 hours.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 7, 14, 21, and 28 days and
      then every 84 days for up to 2 years.
