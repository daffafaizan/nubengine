      older community-dwelling women (age>60 years). Incontinence predisposes patients to other
      health problems, contributes to depression and social isolation, is a significant source of
      dependency among the elderly, and is widely cited as a factor in nursing home admissions.
      Sarcopenia is age-related and is characterized by loss of muscle mass, strength and
      endurance. There is not only a decrease in the number of muscle fibers, but also atrophy in
      the remaining ones. Several studies indicate glutamine supplementations lead to better muscle
      performance by stimulate muscle producing in extremities. Similarly, we assume glutamine
      supplementation could increase pelvic muscle mass and improve the pelvic floor strength. From
      this point, using glutamine supplementation may effect positively on stress, urge or mixed
      incontinence, and pelvic prolapse.
