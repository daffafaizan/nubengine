      main clinical aspect is the irregularity on skin surface which is classified in 4 grades, 0
      to III, according to Nurenberg classification, 1978.

      It is a multifactorial condition, involving: herniation of subcutaneous fat into deep dermis;
      vertical fibrous septum from fatty tissue to dermis; alterations in microcirculation;
      hormonal and inflammatory factors Clinical evaluation is very difficult and the best methods
      are: high resolution ultrasound and magnetic resonance.

      There is no effective management. Many devices have been introduced to treat that aesthetic
      condition which causes a great discomfort to women. There are few controlled studies with
      high level methodology and consistent conclusions.

      The far-IR radiation can be obtained by low energy emitting devices and its main effects are
      the interaction with water and temperature increase. This method had already shown efficacy
      for circulation system disorders and wound healing by activation of TGF-beta and fibroblasts.

      Our aim is to evaluate the benefits of far-IR for cellulitis control.
