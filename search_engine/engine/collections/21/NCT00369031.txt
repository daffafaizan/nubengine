      immunisations with a protein from HIV virus mixed with a toxoid adjuvant, followed by two
      intramuscular immunisations with the same protein mixed with a liquid adjuvant, causes
      untoward adverse reactions when administered to healthy adult volunteers. An initial
      evaluation of immune responses to the vaccine will also be undertaken by measuring gp140- and
      LTK63-specific IgG and IgA in cervical secretions, vaginal secretions, serum and nasal wash.
      IFNg secretion of T cells in response to gp140 peptide stimulation will be undertaken along
      with neutralising assays.
