      with Alzheimer's Disease pathogenesis, and consequently this disease has been referred to as
      a type III diabetes of the brain. Clinical trials of intranasal insulin in AD have
      demonstrated therapeutic effects of intranasal (IN) insulin in memory-impaired adults in
      terms of memory recall without significantly altering serum insulin or glucose levels. In
      this study, the investigators are investigating the chronic effects of the rapid acting
      insulin, glulisine, administered intranasally (IN) 20 IU two times daily in adults with
      amnestic-mild cognitive impairment (a-MCI) and mild Alzheimer's disease (AD). The
      investigation will enroll n=90 subjects and follow them over a 6 month period.

      This study has the following objectives:

        1. Primary:

           a. To measure the chronic effects of IN insulin glulisine on cognition and function in
           subjects with aMCI and probable mild AD over a 6 month period.

        2. Secondary:

             1. To measure the effect of IN insulin glulisine on mood in subjects with aMCI and
                mild AD over a 6 month period.

             2. To measure the safety and efficacy of IN glulisine in aMCI and mild AD subjects
                with non-insulin dependent diabetes over a 6 month period.

        3. Exploratory:

             1. To measure the effect of IN delivery of insulin glulisine on parieto-temporal and
                posterior cingulate/precuneus glucose metabolism in subjects with aMCI and mild AD
                over a 6 month period.

             2. To measure the chronic effect of IN delivery of insulin glulisine on AD-specific
                cerebrospinal (CSF) biomarkers (Abeta42, tau, and phospho-tau) in subjects with
                aMCI and mild AD over a 6 month period.
