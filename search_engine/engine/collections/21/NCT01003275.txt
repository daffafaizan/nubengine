      particularly from cardiovascular disease (CVD). A number of metabolic abnormalities may
      contribute to adverse health outcomes in CKD, including glucose intolerance, altered immune
      cell function, and oxidative stress. Each of these metabolic stressors is a known
      complication of CKD. Since these metabolic abnormalities are also known to contribute to the
      pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease, they are important potential therapeutic targets in
      CKD.

      This study will test whether oral paricalcitol, an active form of vitamin D, will improve
      glucose tolerance, immune cell function, and reduce oxidative stress in people with stage 3-4
      chronic kidney disease.
