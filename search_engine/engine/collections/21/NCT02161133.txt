      as other major medical diseases. Previous clinical trials (i.e. cognitive behavioral therapy
      and graded exercise) for GWI have sought to improve disability by increasing activity
      regardless of symptom presentation. These previous trials for GWI have shown limited efficacy
      and poor adherence. An innovative treatment approach is to target a specific component of
      GWI, namely problem-solving ability, known to be associated with disability.

      Impairment in problem-solving ability affects Gulf War Veterans (GWV) with GWI and is
      prospectively related to greater risk of disability. This impairment is also related to
      poorer adherence to medical regimes, making it difficult for GWV to manage other aspects of
      GWI. Problem-solving is considered one of the most complex of cognitive abilities and is
      related to complicated behaviors such as setting goals, sequencing and multi-tasking. Despite
      published reports documenting these deficits there are no treatments that target the
      problem-solving deficits of GWI in order to reduce disability.

      The investigators propose a targeted treatment, Problem-Solving Therapy, to compensate for
      the problem-solving deficits of GWI and thereby reducing disability. Problem-Solving Therapy,
      a top down approach, teaches patients skills to overcome problems like cognitive dysfunction
      or physical symptoms that impact problem-solving. Compensating for problem-solving deficits
      would reduce disability and provide information on the effect of treating one component of
      GWI on other symptoms of GWI. This is the first trial of cognitive rehabilitation therapy for
      GWI.
