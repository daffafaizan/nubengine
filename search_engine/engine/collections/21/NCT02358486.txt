    
      Functional dyspepsia (FD) is a functional gastrointestinal disorder without any structural
      lesion. Due to the lack of satisfactory effect of conventional treatments, many FD patients
      turn to alternative treatments such as acupuncture. Acupuncture, one of the most sought
      therapeutic modalities in traditional Korean Medicine, has been commonly used for treating
      gastrointestinal disorders.

      However, the effect and mechanism of acupuncture on FD has not been rigorously evaluated. In
      the present study, we will investigate whether 10 sessions of acupuncture over 4 weeks, in
      comparison with sham acupuncture, improve symptoms of FD and activate regions of brain area.
      We will also perform metabolomics study to find the mechanism of acupuncture to FD. Outcome
      measures include proportion of responder, Korean version of Nepean Dyspepsia Index,
      Functional Dyspepsia-Related Quality of Life, Ways of Coping Question, Coping Strategy
      Questionnaire, Perception of bodily sensation, The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Center for
      Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, functional magnetic resonance imaging and metabolomic
      study.
