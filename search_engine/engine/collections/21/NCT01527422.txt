    
      1.1 Primary Objective:

        1. To identify the ideal dose of the combination of CHOP-R with PEG-Filgrastim (Neulasta)
           using first a fixed dose of Neulasta and an escalating dose of GM-CSF (Leukine) up to
           250 mcg. When that dose is reached, if possible, the dose of Neulasta will be increased
           stepwise. CHOP-R will be delivered every 14 days at a fixed standard dose with dose
           adjustments of PEG-Filgrastim and GM-CSF upwards and downwards according to nadir or
           zenith blood counts.

           1.2 Secondary Objective:

        2. To generate preliminary pilot data as to the effectiveness of the regimen in inducing
           very early remissions as measured by the CT-PET scan technique.
