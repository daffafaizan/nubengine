    
      POST-AMI is a single-center, prospective, randomized trial, with a planned inclusion of 78
      patients with ST-elevation Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI). Patients will be randomly
      assigned to postconditioning arm (primary angioplasty (PA) and stenting followed by brief
      episodes of ischemia-reperfusion performed during the first minutes of reperfusion) or
      non-postconditioning arm (PA and stenting without additional intervention). All patients will
      be treated medically according to current international guidelines, including glycoprotein
      IIb/IIIa inhibitors before PCI. The primary end point is to evaluate whether
      postconditioning, compared to PA without additional intervention, reduces infarct size
      estimated by magnetic resonance at 30±10 days after the AMI. Secondary end points are
      microvascular obstruction observed at magnetic resonance, ST-segment elevation resolution,
      persistent ST-segment elevation, angiographic myocardial blush grade <2 and non
      sustained/sustained ventricular tachycardia in the 48 hours following PA. Further secondary
      end points are enzymatic infarct size, left ventricular remodeling and left ventricular
      function at magnetic resonance performed at 6±1 months, and the reduction of major adverse
      cardiac events at 30 days and 6 months.
