    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the effect of neoadjuvant androgen receptor antagonist ARN-509 (apalutamide)
      with or without abiraterone acetate, GnRH agonist, and prednisone on the feasibility of
      performing nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy (RP) in men with high-risk prostate cancer
      (PCa).

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive androgen receptor antagonist ARN-509 orally (PO) daily for 3 months.
      Patients then undergo radical prostatectomy.

      ARM II: Patients receive GnRH agonist subcutaneously (SC) on day 1, androgen receptor
      antagonist ARN-509 PO daily PO for 4 times, abiraterone acetate PO daily for 4 times, and
      prednisone PO daily for 3 months. Patients then undergo radical prostatectomy.

      ARM III: Patients undergo radical prostatectomy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 2 years.
