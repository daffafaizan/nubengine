      abdominal and trunk extensors; functional capacity by Rolland-Morris Questionnaire; pain by
      visual analog scale; heart rate(HR) by polar frequencymetric; peripheral oxygen saturation by
      Finger Pulse Oximeter; and systolic and diastolic blood pressure with a Sphygmomanometer. The
      sample was divided in two groups (1-GPR with 11 patients, 2-Isostretching with 10 patients).
