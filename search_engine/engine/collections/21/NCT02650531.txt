      addition to motor impairments and comorbidities, disability after stroke is often related to
      post stroke dementia (PSD) or mild neurocognitive disorder (NCD). However, these problems are
      hardly addressed in stroke or dementia research and frequently ignored in clinical practise.
      In the Nor-COAST study an interdisciplinary research group will collaborate to establish a
      research platform across all Norwegian Health Authorities. The overall aim of the study is to
      improve competence on PSD and NCD in order to improve individual health outcomes following a
      stroke. The specific objectives are to determine the incidence of PSD and NCD and the
      consequences on function and use of health care services and to enhance the early detection
      of PSD and NCD by identifying a set of risk factors, ranging from genetics to physical
      activity. The incidence and impact of PSD and NCD on function and use of health care
      services, medication and life-style changes are important when planning future health care
      services. Tools identifying patients at risk might improve diagnostic work up and together
      with knowledge on pathogenic aspects it will contribute to future treatment and prevention of
      PSD and NCD.
