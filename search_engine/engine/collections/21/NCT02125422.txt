      thermo-nociceptive sensibility and thermonociceptive potentials, whilst cathodal transcranial
      direct current stimulation has the opposite effect, it decreases VEP amplitude and
      habituation. This neuromodulation technique is probably a tool in the prevention in episodic
      and chronic migraine.

      The aim of the study is to study short and long term effect of tDCS over pain treshold,
      contact heat evoked potentials, blink reflex and visual evoked potentials in healthy
      volunteers.
