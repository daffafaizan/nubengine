      inflammation stage while improvement of materials, techniques and vital pulp therapy have
      received a wider acceptance in symptomatic pulpitis treatment. The aim of this clinical study
      was to compare MMP-9 expression in healthy and inflamed pulp and to assess the short-term
      outcome of coronal pulpotomy in mature permanent teeth with symptomatic pulpitis.

      Methods: Patients diagnosed with symptomatic pulpitis were included in this clinical study.
      Coronal pulpotomy was performed using calcium-silicate based material and blood samples were
      taken. Initial and postoperative pain was recorded by Heft-Parker visual analog scale at 24
      hours and 72 hours after the procedure. In control group teeth with healthy pulp were used.
      During follow-up visits after three and six-months, patients were examined clinically and
      radiographically. The ELISA kit was used to determine the levels of MMP-9 in inflamed and
      healthy coronal pulp tissue.
