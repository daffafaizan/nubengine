      Biomedical Research Institute at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center and the University of Washington.

      Two doses of 11β-MNTDC (200 mg and 400 mg) were selected for a dose-escalating 28-day repeat
      dose study. Twenty subjects will complete this study at each of the 11β-MNTDC (15 on
      11β-MNTDC and 5 on placebo) yielding a total of 40 completed subjects (30 on 11β-MNTDC and 10
      on placebo) across both sites. Safety will be assessed in subjects receiving the lower dosage
      before additional men receive the higher dose for 28 days. In addition to safety and
      tolerability, suppression of serum T, calculated free T, E2, gonadotropins (LH & FSH), and
      SHBG will also be assessed as secondary pharmacodynamic (PD) endpoints. The 24-hour detailed
      PK of 11β-MNTDC will be assessed on Days 1 and 28. Trough levels of 11β-MNTDC will be
      obtained throughout the 28-day treatment period, at 48 and 72 hours (Days 30 and 31) after
      the last dose and at the End of Study visit (between Days 70-76).
