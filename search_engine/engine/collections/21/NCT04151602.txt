      used for this research study.

      In Aim 1, individuals will be recruited who currently use meth and/or Mandrax to assess TB
      exposure, incipient TB prevalence, and TB disease prevalence in the network. RDS will be used
      to seek out 750 meth/Mandrax users. Initial seeds (N=4) will be individuals from the
      investigator's current R01, the Tuberculosis treatment outcomes and alcohol use study (TRUST)
      cohort who have had active pulmonary TB disease in the prior 1-2 years and report current
      meth/Mandrax use.

      For Aim 2, individuals from Aim 1 identified to have possible TB disease will be screened and
      enrolled to estimate the proportion that reflect recent transmission via genotyping and
      social epidemiologic links.

      In Aim 3, the investigators will examine physiologic factors that may make PWUD more
      efficient TB transmitters. 50 PWUD participants from Aim 2 will be recruited who have active,
      untreated pulmonary TB and 50 individuals with active, untreated pulmonary TB who do not use
      meth/Mandrax, matched on age and gender will be recruited
