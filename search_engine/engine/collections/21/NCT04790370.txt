      standard anticoagulation are associated with a significant reduction in the composite outcome
      of pulmonary embolism (PE)-related mortality, cardiorespiratory decompensation or collapse,
      or nonfatal symptomatic and objectively confirmed recurrence of PE compared to
      anticoagulation alone within seven days of randomization

      The HI-PEITHO study has been designed to address the important gaps in clinical evidence by
      comparing the clinical benefit of the ultrasound-facilitated local delivery of a low dose
      thrombolytic agent and anticoagulation with those of anticoagulation alone in patients with
      intermediate-high risk PE at a higher estimated risk of early decompensation based on
      clinical parameters at presentation.

      This study has a focus on improving the safety of thrombolysis and advancing the concept of
      intermediate-high risk and the PE severity criteria, to better identify patients who may
      clinically benefit from thrombolysis.

      The results of this study will contribute further evidence to the existing data on the
      treatment and outcomes of acute, intermediate-high risk PE and provide controlled data
      related to catheter-based interventions.

      Data will be entered by the site into an electronic database. The database will include data
      checks to compare data entered into the database against predefined rules for ranges and
      consistency with other data fields in the database.

      Site monitoring will take place with source data verification to assess the accuracy and
      completeness of registry data by comparing the data to medical records and study assessments.
