    
      This study is designed to assess oral ketamine for the treatment of Rett Syndrome and
      consists of up to 4 ascending dose cohorts, each assessing 1 dose level of ketamine vs
      placebo. Patients will receive in either order, a 5-day BID regimen of both placebo and the
      cohort-specified dose level of oral ketamine. Patients may only participate in 1 cohort.
      Safety and tolerability will be assessed via patient disposition, vital signs, physical
      examination, adverse events and concomitant medication use. Efficacy will be assessed via
      physician and caregiver questionnaires and assessments, and continuous, wearable, at-home
      biosensor data collection. An independent safety committee will review safety data from each
      cohort to determine if the subsequent ascending dose cohort is warranted. A total of 12
      patients per cohort and up to 48 patients in total is anticipated at approximately 7 sites.
      The screening period will last between 2 and 4 weeks, the cross-over treatment period will
      last 4 weeks, and the safety follow-up period will last 2 weeks. Total patient participation
      is approximately 8-10 weeks.
