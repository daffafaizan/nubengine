      Primary

        -  Determine the clinical response rate in postmenopausal women with estrogen and/or
           progesterone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer that has failed prior sequential
           endocrine therapy treated with high-dose esterified estrogens (Menest^®).

      Secondary

        -  Determine time to disease progression in patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral high-dose esterified estrogens (Menest^®) 3 times daily.
      Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 2 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-35 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
