           receive platelets over 30 minutes (short transfusion group) will be significantly
           different from the change in babies who receive platelets over two hours (long
           transfusion group) when platelets are checked immediately after transfusion and 6 hours
           after the completion of transfusion.

        2. We also expect there to be significant differences in the platelet counts drawn thirty
           minutes after transfusion compared to the counts drawn 6 hours after the completion of
           the transfusion in either group.
