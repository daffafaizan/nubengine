      localization, speech understanding in noise, and binaural squelch suffer due to lack of
      binaural timing and level cues. This study is designed to examine how binaural hearing is
      improved following cochlear implantation on the impaired side. The study endpoints are
      collected at 6 months and 12 months post activation of the implant.

      This is not a funded study. All costs are billed through insurance for reimbursement. There
      is an insurance approval process that we move through after a participant has been evaluated
      at the Mayo Clinic and found to be a candidate for cochlear implantation.
