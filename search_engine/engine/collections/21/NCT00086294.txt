      fluctuations are frequent, disabling complications. Therefore, it is imperative to find
      nondopaminergic approaches to the palliation of parkinsonian signs. Previously, we
      demonstrated that drugs that block 5HT2A receptors benefit motor dysfunction in parkinsonian
      animals.

      Objective: To test our hypothesis that blockade of serotonin 2A/2C receptors (5HT2A/C) will
      lessen the severity of parkinsonian signs and levodopa-associated motor response
      complications in PD patients.

      Methods: In a placebo-controlled, proof-of-principle study, the effect of the 5HT2A/C
      receptor inverse agonist ACP-103 on levodopa induced motor complications and parkinsonian
      signs will be assessed in up to 20 patients with moderately advanced Parkinson's disease.
      Efficacy will be assessed through the use of validated motor function scales. Safety will be
      monitored by means of frequent clinical evaluations and laboratory tests.

      Risks and benefits: Risks involved in this study are a minor increase over minimal risks and
      are deemed reasonable in relation to potential benefits. This investigation should lead to a
      better understanding of the pathophysiology and treatment of levodopa-induced motor
      complications in PD.
