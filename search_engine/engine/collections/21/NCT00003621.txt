      and during radiotherapy in patients with anaplastic astrocytoma. II. Assess the toxic effects
      associated with this regimen in these patients. III. Evaluate this regimen in terms of
      fatigue, depression, excessive daytime somnolence, and quality of life in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive carmustine IV over 1 hour on days 1-3, oral etoposide on days 1-21
      and 29-49, and cisplatin IV over 1-2 hours on days 1-3 and 29-31. Treatment repeats every 8
      weeks for 3 courses. Patients receive radiotherapy concurrently with the third course of
      chemotherapy. Quality of life is assessed every 4 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 4
      years, and then annually for 5 years. Patients are followed every 3 months for 5 years and
      then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 28 patients will be accrued for this study within 20 months.
