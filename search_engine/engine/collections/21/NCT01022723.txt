    
      -  Validate the clinical use of a mircofluidic device to capture circulating timor cells
           from a broad range of tumor types

        -  Characterize and identify these circulating tumor cells and demostrate cell viability
           with this capture method

        -  Apply this technology in clinically relevant settings and correlate to response to
           treatment and disease progression

        -  Elucidate predictive and pharmacodynamic biomarkers in the context of early phase trials
           of novel therapeutics
