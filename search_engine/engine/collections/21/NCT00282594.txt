      patient, other patient populations have yet to be studied. We performed a prospective
      randomized trial for using intensive insulin therapy in the general and vascular critically
      ill surgical patient population. We will compare tight glycemic control versus conventional
      glycemic control to determine if there is a benefit to the normalization of blood glucose
      levels in this patient population
