      practice of dosing three times per week, represents a significant change in anemia treatment
      for dialysis patients. Because of the differences in the processes needed to support monthly
      dosing versus thrice weekly dosing, there is a need to prospectively identify and evaluate
      factors in the dialysis environment during center-level transition of patients from one ESA
      to another.

      AFX01-18 is a Phase 3b open-label, single-arm conversion study that was conducted at 5
      hemodialysis sites in the United States, and enrolled Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) patients
      receiving outpatient, in-center hemodialysis. The study treatment period was approximately 12
      months in duration. Participants received peginesatide injection for approximately six
      months.
