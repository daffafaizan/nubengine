      intraoperative fluid management during liver transplant is challenging . Cirrhotic patients
      not only have large blood volume but abnormal blood volume distribution, with a substantial
      fraction of this volume in the splanchnic circulation (. These hemodynamic changes render
      volume loading in these patients has little impact on CO because a large proportion of
      infused fluid is shifted to the splanchnic system . In addition, patients with liver
      cirrhosis is similar to septic patients who have increased total vascular compliance which
      may cause pooling of blood in venous pool. Several studies in patients with sepsis found that
      use of low dose vasopressor may convert unstressed blood volume (i.e the amount of blood not
      causing pressure on the vessels) to stressed volume (i.e additional blood causing a
      distending pressure on the vascular walls and reflects the effective circulating volume) .
      However, no previous studies tested the effect of using norepinephrine (NE) on venous return
      and cardiac preload in patients undergoing liver transplant. An obvious advantage of this
      possibility is that NE will be used instead of true ﬂuid replacement which may minimize fluid
      replacement during operation.

      Recently, a method was described to estimate the changes in intravascular volume and vascular
      capacitance by calculating mean systemic ﬁlling pressure (MSFP) . MSFP is the driving
      pressure in venous return, and it allows calculation of the arterial and venous components of
      systemic vascular resistance .
