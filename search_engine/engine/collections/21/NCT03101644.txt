      pharmacokinetic variability will be quantified and linked to patient-specific covariates,
      both genetic and non-genetic in nature. Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationships will be
      established, linking drug exposure to efficacy (as measured by CD4 cell count and viral load
      reduction) and toxicity (as measured by frequency and degree of adverse events). Simulations
      will be conducted for specific patient profiles and current dosage guidelines reviewed.

      Pharmacokinetic design : combined sparse/intensive sampling

        -  Sparse sampling : One blood sample collected in each individual at a random post-intake
           time (during a routine visit to the hospital), up to three times over the course of the
           study period (months 1-18).

        -  Intensive sampling : Eight blood samples collected over six hours in a subset of twelve
           individuals (during an additional observation period, months 19-22).
