      keratoconjunctivitis in whom treatment with topical anti-allergic agents had been
      ineffective. The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean change from the baseline (before the
      treatment)in total score for objective clinical signs at the final observation. The safety of
      FK506 ophthalmic suspension was also investigated.
