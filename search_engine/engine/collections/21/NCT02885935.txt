      dietary intervention and control in subjects with metabolic syndrome. Two groups of subjects
      were studied before and after a weight maintenance diet. Group 1 was fed a common American
      diet with a macronutrient distribution of 10% protein, 55% carbohydrates, and 35% fat. Group
      2 consumed a higher protein diet (20%; 1.4 g/kg/d of protein). Carbohydrate intake was lower
      in Group 2 (45%), with fat intake (largely derived from dairy sources) similar between
      groups. Glucose utilization and endogenous glucose production were determined during an oral
      glucose tolerance test (OGTT) with a novel double-tracer approach. The secondary aim was to
      determine the effect of a diet high in dairy consumption on blood lipid profiles. The
      investigators measured blood lipids before and after dietary intervention in each group.
