      the subsequent treatment for ITP patients, which also already showed robust
      efficacy.Recombinant human thrombopoietin (rhTPO) is a full-length glycosylated-TPO produced
      by Chinese hamster ovary cells, which showed its effectiveness in ITP in a variety of
      studies.

      Both eltrombopag and rhTPO demonstrated good safety in ITP patients. Because of their
      non-immunosuppressive nature, both of them serve as a reasonable choice during the global
      COVID-19 pandemic.

      Since they increase the number of platelets through different mechanisms, and previous
      studies demonstrated that they might exert synergic effect. The investigators hypothesized
      that the combination of these two agents could be a promising option for treatment of
      corticosteroid-resistant or relapsed ITP patients.
