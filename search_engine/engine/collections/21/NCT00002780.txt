      sargramostim (GM-CSF), and multiple doses of activated T cells (ATC) following peripheral
      blood stem cell transplantation in women with stage IIIB or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the
      breast. II. Evaluate the efficacy of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously daily for 5 days prior to
      peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) collection or for 2 days prior to bone marrow harvest.
      Following PBSC collection or bone marrow harvest, patients receive high dose chemotherapy
      consisting of cyclophosphamide IV, carboplatin IV, and thiotepa IV over days -6 through -3.
      Patients undergo PBSC transplantation on day 0. Following PBSC transplantation, patients
      receive multiple doses of monoclonal antibody OKT3 activated T lymphocytes IV over 1 hour
      between days 1 and 65, continuous low dose interleukin-2 (IL-2) IV over days 1-65, and
      sargramostim (GM-CSF) subcutaneously on days 5-21. Patients are followed at day 100, as
      clinically indicated, and then annually.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 40-60 patients will be accrued for this study within 1-2
      years.
