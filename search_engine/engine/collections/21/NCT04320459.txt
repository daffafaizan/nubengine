      diagnosed according to the ASAS classification criteria who presented to our hospital's
      outpatient clinic and 55 healthy subjects. Demographic data were recorded for 55 AS patients
      who were subsequently assessed using the BASMI (Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Metrology Index)
      in terms of elasticity and spinal mobility as well as the BASFI (Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis
      Functional Index) to determine functional status, the BASDAI (Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis
      Disease Activity Index) to assess the disease activity and the ASQoL (Ankylosing Spondylitis
      Quality of Life Questionnaire) to evaluate quality of life. The Toronto Alexithymia Scale-20
      (TAS-20) was used for assessment of alexithymia and Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI) for
      depression among patients.
