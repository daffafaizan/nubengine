      compromises the quality of life, affecting 80% of patients during the course of the disease.
      Nociceptive pain is the most frequent subtype, mainly musculoskeletal in nature. There is
      currently no evidence-based treatment for PD-related pain in general. The present study tests
      the effectiveness and safety of non-invasive trans-spinal magnetic stimulation (TsMS) to
      treat musculoskeletal pain directly related to PD in a sham-controlled randomized approach.

      Patients and Methods: this is a randomized, sham-controlled trial including 40 subjects, aged
      between 18 and 85 years, with musculoskeletal pain directly related to PD, that will be
      randomized to receive TsMS active or TsMS sham in a 1:1 ratio. Enrollment will take place at
      the Pain Center of the University of São Paulo and Movement Disorders Center of the
      University of São Paulo.

      We have decided to perform an interim analysis when 24 patients will be included in the trial
      in order to assess safety and calculate effect size of the active intervention, after meeting
      with the research and statistical board. A decision will thereafter be made to, either: 1:
      halt the study due to futility, 2: continue the study with a new target sample size based on
      the calculations made with the effect from the n= 24 sample.

      Expected results: the study hypothesis is that non-invasive trans-spinal magnetic stimulation
      is superior to sham and it is safe to use that device in patients with nociceptive
      (musculoskeletal) pain in PD.
