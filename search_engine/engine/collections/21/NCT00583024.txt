      disease (D3) and either (a) have a positive bone scan or a positive CT scan (with obvious
      soft tissue metastasis or lymph nodes >1 cm), with a PSA doubling time of >/= 12 months, a
      total PSA of < 5 mg/ml, and are asymptomatic; or (b) have a negative bone scan with any PSA
      doubling time, are asymptomatic, and are not a candidate for chemotherapy.

      This is a virus vaccine in which the gene for prostate specific antigen (PSA) has been placed
      into a common cold virus termed adenovirus (Ad) to produce this Ad/PSA product. The purpose
      of this study is to determine whether vaccination with the Ad/PSA vaccine will induce an
      anti-PSA immunity that will result in the destruction of the remaining prostate cancer cells.

      Subjects will be vaccinated three times, each injection administered at 30-day intervals.
      Based upon our earlier clinical trial, the vaccine is considered safe and should not induce
      any major side effects. The investigators hope that vaccination with this PSA virus will
      cause the body to produce immunity to the PSA and that immunity will destroy any cell that
      produces PSA. Since the only cells left in the body that produce PSA will be the cancer
      cells, the investigators propose that the vaccination and ensuing anti-PSA immunity will kill
      the prostate cancer cells. Importantly, this treatment should not cause any major side
      effects as would treatment with anti-cancer drugs.
