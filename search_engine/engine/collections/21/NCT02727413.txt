      from the coincident infection and surgical stress plays a role in post-operative organ
      failure and altered immune defense, thus contributing to unfavorable post-operative outcome.

      Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) itself, even in the absence of IE, has been shown to modify
      cytokine and vasoactive mediator release and may cause organ failure. Tracing of release
      profiles of inflammatory cytokines and vasoactive mediators and their correlation with
      postoperative organ dysfunction in cardiac surgery for IE or non-IE patients aims at the
      assessment of the prognostic validity of these biomarkers and the evaluation of measures for
      their pro-active clearance during the surgical intervention.

      Induction of inflammatory mediators and their temporal release profile may vary depending on
      the involved pathogens, which cannot be always identified by conventional techniques (blood
      culture). Since it is conceivable that identification of the involved pathogen could explain
      differences in cytokine secretory patterns in IE, use of advanced molecular technologies
      (NGS) will support the clarification of such relations. Analysis of transcripts encoding
      inflammatory and vasoactive mediators in blood cells will enable the surveillance of temporal
      oscillations in their profiles during the observation time frame. Transcriptome analysis of
      identified putative pathogens can also disclose features of antibiotic resistance.
