      background (either meningococcal vaccine naïve or primed with MenC) and received a single
      dose of either MenACYW Conjugate vaccine or Nimenrix®. They were assessed for immunogenicity
      at baseline (pre-vaccination) and 30 to 44 days post-vaccination. Safety information were
      collected post-vaccination and throughout the entire study.
