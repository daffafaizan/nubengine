      measures of PAH after the initiation of first line combination therapy with bosentan and
      tadalafil in adult patients with PAH. The safety and tolerability of first line combination
      therapy will also be evaluated.

      In patients with PAH initial upfront combination treatment with bosentan and tadalafil

        1. Improves

             -  Exercise capacity as expressed by distance walked in six minute walk test and WHO
                functional class

             -  Hemodynamics in terms of pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), mean pulmonary artery
                pressure (mPAP) reduction and cardiac index (CI) elevation

             -  Quality of life

             -  NTproBNP serum levels

             -  Echocardiographic prognostic parameters such as right atrial area and presence of
                pericardial effusion.

        2. Is safe as assessed by

             -  Liver function markers such as serum SGOT and SGPT levels

             -  Hemoglobin levels
