      however, are associated with a high incidence of adverse effects as well as metabolic
      complications such as lipodystrophy and hyperlipidemia. At the same time, though, a causal
      relationship linking these complications to the use of protease inhibitors remains to be
      established. Studies have shown APV to be well tolerated and effective in reducing plasma
      HIV-1 RNA levels. The safety profile of APV suggests it may offer therapeutic potential in
      subjects developing intolerance to other protease inhibitors.

      Patients receive open-label APV plus at least 2 other antiretroviral drugs. Fasting blood
      samples and patient medication adherence questionnaires are collected at Weeks 12 and 24.
      Bodily assessments are collected at Day 1 and Weeks 12 and 24. Hematology, serum chemistry,
      plasma HIV-1 viral load determination and CD4+ cell count measurements are collected at
      pre-entry and every 12 weeks for the duration of the study.
