      investigate if volatile anesthetics have a positive effect on the prognostic sepsis marker
      IL-6. All patients with septic shock are intubated, ventilated and sedated with an
      intravenous anesthetic. In this study, eligible patients diagnosed with septic shock will be
      randomized 1:1 to the 'volatile group' with interruption of the propofol infusion, followed
      by a 4-hour sedation with the volatile anesthetic sevoflurane, or a continuous intravenous
      sedation ('intravenous' =control group). In both groups, 'intravenous' and 'volatile', the
      inflammatory markers as well as clinical parameters will be determined. The investigators
      will explore if there is a difference between the course of sepsis markers of the two groups
      within 5 days after intervention in favor of the volatile group.
