      Primary

        -  Determine the safety and toxicity of celecoxib in pediatric patients with
           genotype-positive familial adenomatous polyposis.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the aberrant crypt foci (ACF) and adenoma burden in the entire colorectum of
           these patients.

        -  Eliminate the learning curve in a phase II/III trial (reproducibility of endoscopic
           techniques, tolerability of procedure).

        -  Compare sedation strategies based on local standards (monitored anesthesia care vs
           conscious sedation).

        -  Validate the ACF scoring technique.

        -  Establish the short-term (3 month) impact of celecoxib on ACF count in order to
           determine appropriateness of ACF as a pathologic endpoint in a phase II/III trial.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral celecoxib twice daily for 3 months in the absence of
           disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo twice daily for 3 months in the absence of disease
           progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients undergo colonoscopy at baseline and at 3 months. Patients also complete psychosocial
      questionnaires at baseline.

      Blood samples are collected at baseline to assess the influence of polymorphisms (CYP2C9,
      uridine diphosphate (UDP)-glucuronosyl transferase, A6, glutathione S-transferase [GST] M1,
      and Glutathione S-transferase (GST) theta 1 (GSTT1)) on age of onset of phenotype or number
      of colorectal polyps. Plasma drug trough levels are assessed at baseline, 1 month, and 3
      months.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 2 months.
