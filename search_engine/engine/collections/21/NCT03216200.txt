      RenewalNailâ„¢ system and the treatment protocol that was developed based on extensive
      laboratory testing on human cadaver nails. The Protocol calls for three 45-minute treatments
      performed over a week to achieve mycological cure. Mycological cure will be assessed with two
      consecutive mycological culture tests done over a week following the third treatment. Two
      consecutive negative mycology culture results confirm the elimination of fungus causing
      onychomycosis infection, as recommended by recent FDA guidance. There will be no placebo arm
      in the study. Clear nail growth will be documented and assessed by photography for 5 months
      after treatment.
