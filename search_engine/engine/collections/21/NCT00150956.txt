      great deal of end-stage renal disease patients, treated with this modality, have suboptimal
      or high blood pressure, and suffer poor quality of life. Daily hemodialysis has been reported
      to improve both, but the pathophysiological background is poorly understood.

      Patients were studied before and after 6 months of daily (i.e.6 times a week) home
      hemodialysis, and again after two months of conventional (i.e. thrice weekly) hemodialysis.

      We measured the effects of daily dialysis (compared with conventional dialysis) on blood
      pressure, cardiac output, extracellular fluid volume, plasma renin activity, sympathetic
      nervous system activity (through MSNA), the electroencephalogram (EEG), neurocognitive
      functioning (speed of information processing, memory, executive functioning, and attention),
      quality of life, and nutritional status
