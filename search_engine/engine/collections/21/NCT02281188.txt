      patients with UUT tumours are collected. Centers from every continent may apply for
      participation in this registry. Data will be collected from consecutive patients over a five
      year period. Patients' data at baseline visit, at one year, three years and five years after
      inclusion in the registry will be recorded, as well as data on intra- and postoperative
      complications, recurrence and survival in the whole study period. Data from all participating
      centers will be collected through electronic case report forms (eCRFs), with use of an online
      Data Management System (DMS), which is located and maintained at the CROES Office.
