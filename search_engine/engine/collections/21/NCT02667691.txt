      investigators expect several effects of SODB® here. Indeed, this clinical study could show
      that SODB® is able to induce endogenous antioxidant defence, and then reduce oxidative stress
      generally observed in overweight adipose tissue.

      Moreover, this study could evaluate the impact of a decrease in oxidative stress on the
      others overweight-induced disorders, such as insulin resistance, inflammation, fibrosis,
      lipolyse alterations.
