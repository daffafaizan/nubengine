      rate a Visual Analog Scale grading the pain they experienced, about their health history,
      personal treatment. If they accept to be included in the study we'll record different
      parameters related to the surgery: Visual analog scale of pain according to the surgeon
      (before recording the patient), type of anesthesia, duration of surgery, machines used, time
      of ultrasound used for phakoemulsification, preoperoative visual acuity and intraocular
      pressure, biometry, iris color, preoperative donesis, preoperative capsular
      pseudoexfolliation, unexpected events, particularities noticed by the surgeon as Floppy iris
      syndrome, Lens-iris diaphragm retropulsion syndrome There will be no unusual intervention,
      everything will be run exactly as if there was no study. No additional consultation needed.
