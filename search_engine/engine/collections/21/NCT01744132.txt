      Institute has aimed:

        1. to establish a retrospective analysis of existing ophthalmic data sets to assess and
           evaluate system-level and individual-level factors that impact access to and quality of
           vision care in patients with diabetes;

        2. to implement telephone-based and educational interventions to improve DFE follow-up
           adherence in African Americans with diabetes utilizing a prospective, cluster-based,
           randomized cohort design;

        3. to determine the feasibility and effectiveness of using a non-invasive, non-mydriatic
           fundus camera (Nidek) in a community-based pharmacy setting to screen and detect
           diabetic retinopathy and other ocular diseases among individuals with diabetes.
