    
      In a first part, various cardiovascular risk factors will be determined in a group of MS
      patients (n=~16). These patients will be enrolled in a pilot trail, investigating the
      feasability and impact of a high intense interval exercise intervention (12 weeks high
      intensity interval training). After 12 weeks, baseline cardiovascular risk measurements will
      be repeated to determine the impact of high intensity interval training on these risk factors
      in MS.

      In a second part, these cardiovascular risk factors in a larger group of MS patients (n=~50)
      will be compared to healthy controls (n=~25), in order to determine whether MS patients show
      an increased prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors, and thus an elevated risk to develop
      cardiovascular diseases.

      In total, a group of 80 subjects (MS patients and HC) will be investigated throughout this
      study, with only MS patients participating in the pilot trial/exercise intervention.

      Measurements of cardiovascular risk factors will include:

        -  body composition (DEXA)

        -  blood pressure and heart rate (Omron M4-I)

        -  whole body glucose disposal (oral glucose tolerance test)

        -  blood analysis: insulin, total cholesterol, high- density lipoprotein, low-density
           lipoprotein, plasma triglycerides, C-reactive protein and glycosylated haemoglobin.

      Furthermore, a maximal exercise test (determination maximal heart rate, workload, lactate
      concentrations, etc) and an isometric/isokinetic strength test will be performed to determine
      the impact of the rehabilitation program in MS patients.
