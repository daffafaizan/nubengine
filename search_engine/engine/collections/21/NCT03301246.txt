      definitive therapy using additional PTCA catheters and stents, according to standard of care
      will be enrolled in this study.

      A maximum of 60 subjects with native coronary artery lesions or occlusions will be treated
      using the Artimes pro Balloon Dilatation Catheters in a 3:1 ratio using the 1.0mm and 1.25mm
      dilatation catheters for pre-dilatation and will complete the study within the U.S. This
      equals 45 patients treated using the 1.0mm dilatation catheter, and 15 patients treated with
      the 1.25mm dilatation catheter for a total of 60 subjects enrolled and treated.
