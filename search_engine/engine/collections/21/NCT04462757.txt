      Royal NHS Foundation Trust (SRFT) and Manchester Foundation Trust (MFT). The investigators
      will recruit patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection within 24 hours of being
      transfer in a Critical Care department. The investigators have been testing interleukin-1
      receptor antagonist: IL-1Ra (known as Anakinra) for many years. Marketed as a treatment for
      rheumatoid arthritis and for some rare autoimmune diseases, we have shown Anakinra also
      reduces or blocks inflammation in a number of other conditions e.g. stroke and brain
      haemorrhage. The investigators have found it to be safe, easily administered and well
      tolerated. As part of the global response to the SARS-COV-2 pandemic, researchers have
      identified drugs that repurposing existing drugs. Anakinra has been proposed as a candidate
      therapy for COVID-19 and will be used in REMAP-CAP clinical trial as an intravenous (IV)
      therapy four times daily (qds). Whilst there is uncertainty about the therapeutic benefits,
      the investigators wish to explore the theory that they can achieve comparable concentrations
      in the blood using a subcutaneous (SC) injection twice daily (bd), as observed with IV
      therapy qds. We will randomise up to 40 patients to receive either SC Anakinra twice daily or
      IV Anakinra four-times daily for 14 days (or until discharge from CCU). They will measure
      changes in biomarkers in both groups and use the data to inform a mathematical model to
      simulate the effect the drug may have on the body. The aim is to the provide evidence that a
      lower dose SC Anakinra is as effective as higher dose IV.
