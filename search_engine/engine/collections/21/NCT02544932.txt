      dabigatran) have been examined the haemostasis and thromboembolism management. Preclinical
      studies have provided evidences for the effects of direct factor Xa or thrombin inhibition
      beyond anticoagulation, including anti-inflammatory and protective activities in
      atherosclerotic plaque development . Therefore, this study evaluates the protective effects
      of NAOC with the reactive hyperemia peripheral arterial tonometry (RH-PAT) measurements
      reflecting endothelial function by Endo-PAT2000 and intima-media thickness (IMT) of the
      carotid artery, which is used as a surrogate endpoint of atherosclerosis.
