      plasma products, volume expansion or antibiotic treatment. The only specific treatment is
      liver transplantation, which is limited by available organs and may be a therapeutic option
      only for a very minority of patients with recently deteriorated end stage liver disease. The
      clinical management of defect hepatic synthesis and metabolic regulation has been improved
      dramatically within the past decades by the development of transfusion and intensive care
      medicine, but the replacement of detoxification has been more difficult, as the majority of
      endogenous toxins accumulating in liver failure is bound to albumin. Therefore, conventional
      dialysis and hemofiltration have been shown to be ineffective for their removal. The present
      study is based on the theory, that supporting the failing liver by the removal of toxic
      substances with a biocompatible method (the MARS system) may improve the capacity for
      recovery of the patient.
