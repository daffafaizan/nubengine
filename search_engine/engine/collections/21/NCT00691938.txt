      advanced MDS and AML, the purpose of this Phase 1-2 single institution study is to evaluate
      the safety and efficacy of LBH 589 and decitabine administered in combination.

      Decitabine is an epigenetic modifier of gene expression that has been shown to be
      well-tolerated in this population at the dose schedule proposed in this study, with
      reasonable efficacy. Although its precise mechanism of action is incompletely understood, it
      is postulated to work by reactivating the expression of key tumor suppressor genes silenced
      in tumor cells by reversing a pattern of hypermethylation of promotor elements.

      LBH389 is likewise an epigenetic modifier that inhibits the deacetylation of both histones
      and non-histone proteins, including HSP90 and p53. Although clinical experience with LBH589
      in AML is limited, aberrant histone deacetylase activity has been previously shown to play a
      significant role in the pathogenesis of AML. The addition of LBH589 to a decitabine regimen
      of previously established efficacy and tolerability will allow us to evaluate the hypothesis
      that two epigenetic modifiers that are believed to work through distinct mechanisms of action
      may act together to improve the responses of patients treated with decitabine alone, without
      significant additional toxicity.
