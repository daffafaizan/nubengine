      are hospitalized due to a suspected brain injury. After an informed consent is received, the
      patient has been enrolled in the study and sample collection can be started. Plasma samples
      are taken by the TYKSlab personnel, and the other samples by the nurses in the Neurosurgical
      ward. The sampling will be organized so that all the samples from a patient are preferably
      collected at one event. Samples will stored in the TYKSlab at the temperature of -70 Â°C.
      Collection of a sufficient number of samples (patients) will take a few months, and
      subsequent analysis by the Sponsor a few months. All the activities will be done during the
      years 2016 to 2017.

      When the samples of 24 subjects have been collected, they will be transferred to the Sponsor
      who will ship them further to the sub-contractors. The results received from the research
      laboratories will be evaluated by the scientist team at Medicortex Finland Oy. The results
      will be published in a scientific journal, when considered to be of high enough quality and
      impact.
