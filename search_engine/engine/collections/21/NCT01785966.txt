    
      Cluster randomized trial involving ICUs in Brazil. ICU is the unit of randomization.

      The trial will have two stages:

        -  Stage I - Baseline data.In this stage we will:

             -  Apply "Safety Attitudes Questionnaire" for the employees of the participating ICU.

             -  Characterize participant ICUs in terms of the standards (RDC nº7/2010, RDC
                nº26/2012 e RDC nº 63/2011) for intensive care units proposed by the Brazilian
                National Health Agency (ANVISA)

             -  Characterize patients: we will collect data from 60 consecutive critically ill
                patients from each participant ICU to describe adherence to measures aimed at
                avoiding ICU complications and clinical outcome measures.

        -  Stage II - Intervention: This is the main stage for data analysis. ICUs will be randomly
           assigned to an experimental or control group. The experimental group should use a
           multi-item verbal checklist including assessment of daily goals during the
           multidisciplinary visits plus clinician prompting. We will collect data from 60
           additional patients for each ICU in both study groups and apply "Safety Attitudes
           Questionnaire".
