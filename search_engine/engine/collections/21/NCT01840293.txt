    
      This is a translational study. Patient will undergo standard treatment and tissue and blood
      samples will be taken at various time points:

      Tissue: Fresh frozen (FF) and Formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue (FFPE) will be
      collected at time of surgery/biopsy of a primary or a recurrent/metastatic tumour tissue.

      Blood: Two types of study bloods (non-heparinised and Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA))
      will be taken pre-neoadjuvant treatment (if applicable), pre- and post-operatively of primary
      and recurrent/ metastatic breast cancer (if recurrent/metastatic diagnosis and no
      biopsy/surgery required then study bloods will be taken prior to starting treatment).

      Additional blood samples will be taken annually at follow-up visits for 5 years from primary
      cases and for up to 2 years from recurrent/metastatic cases.

      Non-heparinised blood will be processed to serum. Clinical data will be collected at all
      times of biological sampling.
