    
      This study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of focused ultrasound in patients
      with age-related frailty characterized by reduced physical and immunological functioning. The
      safety of this protocol will be closely monitored and data will be used to determine whether
      any significant safety issues exist when using focused ultrasound. Adverse events will be
      noted whenever they occur but will be recorded at the time of the procedure and throughout
      routine follow-ups, which will persist weekly throughout the duration of the active study
      protocol. Patients deemed potentially appropriate candidates for focused ultrasound therapy
      will be treated with 8 sessions of transcranial ultrasound, each of which consists of 10 to
      30 minutes of active administration. Clinical and safety outcome measures will be obtained
      throughout and after completion of the study protocol.
