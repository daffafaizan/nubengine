      wearing single-vision spectacles (Cho et al. 2005) or soft lenses (Walline et al. 2009). Both
      studies showed that the effect of myopic control was most significant during the first six
      months of the treatment. It is unknown whether the myopic control effect would dissipate upon
      the discontinuation of the treatment or whether the myopic control effect only happened in
      the first six month of lens wear and was maintained thereafter. The current study aims at
      evaluating the effect of discontinuation of ortho-k treatment on myopic control in children
      who are currently on the treatment. This knowledge is necessary and important as
      patients/parents have concerns about the permanent dependency on ortho-k once they enrolled
      in the treatment.

      Children who have been on the treatment for two years and have recently completed the myopic
      control studies at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, i.e. the ROMIO, TO-SEE and HM-PRO
      studies, will be invited to participate in this 14-month study. Ortho-k subjects will be
      randomly assigned to study group or the ortho-k control group. The study group subjects will
      be required to stop lens wear for 7 months at the completion of the previous study (Phase I)
      and resume lens wear for next 7 months (Phase II). The ortho-k control group subjects will be
      required to continue the current treatment for another 14 months. Control subjects in the
      existing myopic control studies will be required to continue using the same treatment, i.e.
      single-vision glasses, for another 14 months. Rate of myopic progression among the 3 groups
      and at the two study phases will be determined and compared.
