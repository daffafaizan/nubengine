      vaporization rather than combustion, the generation and inhaltion of smoke and carbon
      monoxide (CO) may be reduced or avoided. JUUL has developed several nicotine based liquid
      blends for use in e-cigarettes. This study will assess nicotine uptake during a 10-puff
      controlled and a 5-minute ad libitum use of four JUUL 5% electronic nicotine delivery systems
      (ENDS) relative to usual brand (UB) combustible cigarettes, a comparator electronic cigarette
      (e-cigarette), and nicotine gum.
