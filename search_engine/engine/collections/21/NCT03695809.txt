      vulvar cancer generally can be detected by imaging study. Currently, there is a paucity of
      sensitive marker to detect the recurrence of vulvar cancer. G9a is a recently identified
      protein with histone lysine methyltransferase activity. The role of histone
      methyltransferases in promoting tumorigenesis and progression of human cancers has been noted
      in some cancers, such as ovarian cancer, endometrial cancer and cervical cancer. The role of
      G9a protein in vulvar cancer remains obscure.

      All female patients with vulvar cancer or vulvar intraepithelial neoplasm II /III who
      underwent surgery at Far Eastern Memorial Hospital from January 2003 will be included. All
      patients' clinical characteristerics including age, stage, pathologic finding, and follow-up
      data will be recorded from chart review.

      The archived specimens will be used for immunohistochemical staining of G9a protein. Tumor
      size, local invasion, lymph node metastasis, and final disease stage will be determined.
      Correlation will be performed between G9a and clinical outcome of vulvar cancer.
