      SCD is a common disorder among African Americans and other minority groups. It is
      characterized by chronic anemia and episodic vaso-occlusive crises. The most common of these
      crises is the painful crisis. Current treatment of the painful crisis includes rest,
      hydration, and analgesic medication. Morphine is the most commonly prescribed analgesic
      medication for moderate to severe painful episodes, but there are several side effects
      associated with its use, including somnolence, respiratory depression, constipation,
      dysphoria, and pruritus. Other analgesic medications, including NSAIDs, may improve pain
      control and decrease the need for morphine and other opioid drugs; however, more research is
      needed to confirm the benefits in individuals with SCD.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      This study will enroll 120 children who will receive standard opioid and supportive therapy.
      In addition to this care, participants will be randomly assigned to receive one of the
      following: 1) intravenous ketorolac and oral placebo; or 2) intravenous placebo and oral
      ibuprofen. Outcome assessments will include the duration of hospitalization for opioid
      therapy; the degree of pain intensity and relief determined by validated pain scales; and the
      utilization of opioid medications during hospitalization. All participants will be monitored
      for potential adverse effects of the study medications by laboratory measurements and
      clinical assessments. Additionally, participants will self-report pain levels using the
      Oucher pain scale. Participants will be monitored for the development of adverse events,
      including gastrointestinal symptoms and deterioration of kidney function, as determined by
      daily kidney function tests including BUN, creatinine, and hematuria.
