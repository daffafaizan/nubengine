    
      This is a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled study designed to evaluate the safety,
      tolerability, PK and efficacy of ascending doses of Cotadutide in Japanese obese subjects
      with T2DM. Approximately 20 subjects will be screened in total and 16 subjects will be
      randomized to Cotadutide or placebo in a 3:1 ratio. Those subjects who receive Cotadutide
      will be titrated up to HCTD. The study has a 2-week screening period, a run-in period of 9
      days and an up to 7-week up-titration treatment period followed by a 3-week treatment
      extension period (if applicable), followed by a 28-day follow-up period.
