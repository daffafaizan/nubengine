      50 percent of HIV+ individuals, are poorly understood. No therapies exist despite significant
      impact on quality of life and mortality. Identifying molecular pathways of DLco impairment in
      HIV+ individuals and developing ability to predict HIV+ individuals at risk of DLco
      impairment is thus of utmost importance for improving care. In this proposal, the
      investigators construct a systems' modeling approach to identify molecular and clinical
      pathways contributing to DLco impairment in HIV+ individuals. The investigators collect
      multiple parallel molecular datasets integrated with detailed pulmonary function,
      radiographic, and echocardiographic measurements to build a comprehensive, systems level
      model of DLco abnormalities in HIV and to develop predictive models of susceptibility to DLco
      worsening. As our preliminary data suggest that certain micro ribonucleic acid (miRNAs), such
      as the hypoxia-induced and metabolically active gene (miR-210), may play an important role in
      DLco abnormalities in HIV, the investigators then perform hypothesis-testing experiments to
      determine the impact of miRNAs on lung epithelial and endothelial cells. The investigators
      will utilize a well phenotyped cohort of over 500 HIV+ individuals with associated
      biospecimens to execute the aims.

      Participants identified to already have specimens available will be scheduled to have PFT
      testing, bronchoscopy including bronchial wash with brushes and blood collection.
