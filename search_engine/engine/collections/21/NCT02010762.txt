      recurrence of Crohn's disease (CD), with an endoscopic endpoint 6 months after surgery as the
      primary outcome. Endoscopy has been an established surrogate marker for future clinical
      relapse. Secondary objectives include clinical recurrence rates at 6 months, the difference
      in recurrence rates among patients with and without low Vitamin D levels at baseline, the
      effects of Vitamin D3 on quality of life parameters, resource use and related costs.

      ANTICIPATED OUTCOME This study will provide proof of the anti-inflammatory effect of vitamin
      D, which to our opinion can best be studied in a post-operative setting. Since post-operative
      recurrence is frequent, a safe and cost-effective therapy is highly needed for this
      indication. The hypothesis is that patients who receive vitamin D treatment will have less
      frequent and less severe endoscopic recurrence.
