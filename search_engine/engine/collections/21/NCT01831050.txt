      polio to zero. However, final and definitive eradication of the disease will require stopping
      the use of oral polio vaccines (OPV's) which contain live virus and can rarely revert back to
      disease producing strains. This period will result in a risk of polio re-emergence as
      immunity will wane while some vaccine poliovirus will still be circulating. Inactivated polio
      vaccine (IPV) could potentially play a central role during this process but at present
      barriers of cost and logistics prevent its routine use in resource limited countries, and
      concerns exist as to whether IPV provides enough immunity in the intestine to reduce the
      spread of polioviruses in communities once OPV's are stopped. We plan a multi-center trial in
      Latin America in which we will administer 1 or 2 doses of IPV to children previously
      vaccinated with an OPV containing type 1 and 3 poliovirus (bOPV), and then assess the
      shedding in the stool of a type 2 OPV virus administered later. A decrease in the amount of
      virus shed compared to children not given IPV would indicate that the IPV boosted intestinal
      immunity, and would suggest that spread of virus in communities could be reduced using this
      strategy. We will also measure the impact of supplemental IPV's on antibody formation in the
      blood, which is a marker of protection of the individual from polio disease. A secondary aim
      will be to compare the immunogenicity and safety of three IPV's produced by different
      manufacturers. The overall goal will be to inform policy makers in polio eradication
      regarding the potential role that one or two doses of IPV might play in the final steps
      toward polio eradication.
