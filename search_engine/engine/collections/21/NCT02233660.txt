      motion and deficits in pinch grip force. In fact, restricted cervical range of motion and
      deficits in pinch grip force seems to be independent of electro-diagnostic findings. These
      findings would be associated with the proposed "double crush syndrome" theory. However no
      longitudinal studies have been conducted. Further it has been demonstrated that hand function
      is associated to deficits in these outcomes. Since previous studies support the use of
      physical therapy and surgical interventions for the management of function in these patients,
      the aim of this study is to conduct a randomized clinical trial to determine if changes in
      hand function are related to changes in active cervical range of motion and pinch grip force
      after the application of a physical therapy program including manual therapies targeted to
      those areas related to the median nerve or endoscopic surgery in women with CTS.
