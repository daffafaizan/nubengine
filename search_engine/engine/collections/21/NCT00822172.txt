      blood. It is caused by atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries).

      Muscles require oxygen carried by the blood. When the leg muscles do not get enough blood and
      oxygen, this can cause pain, cramping, fatigue, and/or discomfort in the leg muscles during
      walking or exercise. These symptoms are called intermittent claudication (IC). In more severe
      cases, tissues do not get enough blood and oxygen at rest, and pain may also be present when
      the legs are resting. Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD)is one of the most common causes of pain
      and disability in people between 55 and 75 years of age.

      Cilostazol is a medication currently available by prescription for intermittent claudication.
      L-carnitine is an over-the-counter supplement. It is a natural substance in the human body
      and is also in some red meats, nuts, and energy drinks.

      Some subjects in the study will take L-carnitine with cilostazol and others will take placebo
      with cilostazol. The purpose of this study is to see how safe and effective L carnitine taken
      with cilostazol is compared to placebo taken with cilostazol for people with intermittent
      claudication. A placebo is a tablet or pill that looks like regular medication, but it
      doesn't have any actual medicine in it. A second purpose of the study is to see if
      L-carnitine is absorbed into the blood stream.
