      treatment is increasing. The short- and long-term effects of masculinizing treatment with
      testosterone are debated as serum testosterone increase up to 20-fold compared to cisgender
      women. We hypothesize that, testosterone treatment is associated with non-calcified coronary
      plaque (NCP) development in transgender men.

      Methods and analyses: Prospective, single-center, observational cohort study at the Body
      Identity Clinic (BIC), Odense University Hospital, Denmark, where all investigations are
      performed at inclusion and after 1, 3, 5 and 10 years of testosterone therapy.

      Ethics and dissemination: The Regional Committees on Health Research Ethics for Southern
      Denmark (S-20190108) and the Danish Data Protection Agency approved the study (19/27572).
      Signed informed consent will be obtained from all participants. All findings will be
      published in peer-reviewed journals or at scientific conferences.
