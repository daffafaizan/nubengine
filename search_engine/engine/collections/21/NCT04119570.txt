      patient-physician interaction during a nephrology clinic visit both with and without use of
      the CKD Report Card, and 2) to determine which physician and patient characteristics are
      associated with effective and patient centered communication. There will be block enrollment.
      For Nephrology physicians who agreed to participate will complete a baseline questionnaire.
      Research assistants will approach patients of participating providers in clinic waiting
      rooms, with the goal of enrolling patients for each provider For half of the study,
      investigators will enroll patients in the study and observe patient-physician communication
      and use a survey measure CKD knowledge pre-visit and post-visit. For the second half of the
      study, investigators will give participants the CKD Report Card, an investigator-developed
      handout, to use during the clinic visit. Investigators will observe patient-physician
      communication and use a survey to measure CKD knowledge pre-visit and post-visit. For both
      groups, eligible participants will give informed consent and will complete a baseline
      questionnaire; research assistants will place a digital audio-recording device in the
      examination room to record the patient-provider encounter. Following the medical encounter,
      research assistants will administered an interview with patients, assessing demographic,
      social, and behavioral characteristics, as well as their experience of care and ratings of
      provider communication.
