      followed by subcutaneous injections of 1 mg/kg body weight every 12 hours during hospital
      stay.

      Patients in the invasive group were given an intravenous injection of enoxaparin of (0.75
      mg/kg body weight) and abciximab as a intravenous bolus (0.25 mg/kg body weight) followed by
      a 12 hour infusion (10 microg/minute).

      Secondary outcome measures were death, myocardial infarction and stroke alone or as a
      composite at 30 days.

      Data on use of health care resources, loss of production and health-related quality of life
      were collected during one year. Cost-effectiveness was determined by comparing costs and
      quality-adjusted survival.
