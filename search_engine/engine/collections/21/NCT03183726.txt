      ALLO-ASC-DFU treatment in phase 1 clinical trial (ALLO-ASC-DFU-101) for 23 months.

      ALLO-ASC-DFU is a hydrogel sheet containing allogenic adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells.
      Adipose-derived stem cells have anti-inflammatory effect and release growth factors such as
      vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), which can
      enhance wound healing and regeneration of new tissue, finally may provide a new option in
      treating a Diabetic Foot Ulcer.
