      meant an increase of long term complications. Nevertheless, it could involve an increase if
      the associated co-mordibity in the future, taking in care that in general population
      osteoporosis increases 4 times the pathologic fracture risk. That's why it is necessary to
      know the real prevalence of osteoporosis in this population of patients so the real
      dimensions of the problems can be defined.

      This project wills to determine the incidence of osteoporosis in our population of
      HIV-infected patients and to assess the efficacy and security of ibandronate, whose efficacy
      in post-menopausal women has been already proved. If the quarterly use of endovenous
      ibandronate obtains equivalent results to those obtained with oral and weekly alendronate in
      other studies with the same population, its use would be justified because of its posology
      benefits. The monthly or quarterly administration can improve compliance in patients who are
      recieving a big quantity of drugs, as HIV infected patients do and who probably have to be
      treated for life. Moreover, its elimination is renal so there is absence of interactions with
      antiretroviral drugs what mades of ibandronate a very promising alternative. Finally, there's
      no risk of digestive intolerance because of its parenteral administration and it has a better
      posology than oral bifosfonates.
