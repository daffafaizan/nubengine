    
      This study is a double blinded randomized control trial of a Surface acoustic wave patch
      device for the treatment of Trigeminal Neuralgia. All subjects will be enrolled for a 14 day
      lead up period, where baseline measures of pain, quality of life and analgesic use will be
      recorded.

      During the first month of the study subjects will be randomized into a sham or active device
      group. Both groups will be assessed every two weeks for pain, quality of life and analgesic
      use. After 4 weeks, those subjects in the sham group will be crossed over into the active
      group. Both groups will continue to be assessed biweekly through months 2 and 3.

      After 3 months of treatment a final assessment will be conducted and the results evaluated.
