      annuloplasty concomitantly with any of the following, either individually or in combination:

        -  Tricuspid valve repair

        -  Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)

        -  Valve resection and chordae repair

        -  Correction of atrial septal defect

        -  Correction of patent foramen ovale

        -  Ablation therapy for atrial defibrillation
