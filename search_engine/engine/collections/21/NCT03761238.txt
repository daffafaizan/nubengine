    
      PHLF is a major risk factor for mortality in patients who underwent major hepatectomy. A
      specific treatment is yet not available. In a primary proof-of-concept study, it was shown
      that it is safe and feasible to use MARS in patients with PHLF early after hepatectomy.
      Survival was superior to a historical control group.

      This study will include patients with early, primary PHLF (based on the 50:50 criteria) after
      major liver surgery. Patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive standard treatment alone or
      standard treatment + liver dialysis using the Molecular Adsorbent Recirculating System
      (MARS). Relevant outcome along with several physiological parameters will be assessed.
