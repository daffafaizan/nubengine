      Before the cystoscopy, we will collect your basic information and medical history. We will
      take your vital signs and the anesthesiologist will perform routine assessments. This will
      take about 30-60 minutes to complete.

      Before the cystoscopy, you will be given rocuronium to relax your muscles. After the
      procedure, you will receive either sugammadex or the standard of care to reverse the
      relaxation.

      After you are extubated (the tube is removed from your throat), we will assess how fast the
      relaxation drugs the anesthesiologist gave you wear off (stop working), using a small
      monitoring device that will be attached to your wrist. This is the only research test that
      will be done right after surgery.

      If you are still in the hospital 1 day after the cystoscopy, a member of the staff will ask
      you the series of questions. If you have been sent home, you will be called and you will
      complete them by phone.

      Researchers will also collect information about your cystoscopy procedure and recovery from
      your medical record. This collection will continue for up to 1 week after surgery.
