      I. To evaluate the proportion of patients with the objective response rate (ORR) to
      adavosertib (AZD1775) in patients with advanced refractory cancers with CCNE1 amplification.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the proportion of patients alive and progression free at 6 months of treatment
      with AZD1775 in patients with advanced refractory cancers with CCNE1 amplification.

      II. To evaluate proportion of patients with extended time to progression (time to progression
      on AZD1775/ time to progression on last line of therapy >= 1.3).

      III. To evaluate time until death or disease progression. IV. To identify potential
      predictive biomarkers beyond the genomic alteration by which treatment is assigned or
      resistance mechanisms using additional genomic, ribonucleic acid (RNA), protein and
      imaging-based assessment platforms.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive adavosertib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-5 and 8-12. Cycles repeat
      every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks.
