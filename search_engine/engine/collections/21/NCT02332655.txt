      medically refractory epilepsy in SWS in this open-label, safety dose-finding, study. Recent
      evidence suggests that CBD has multiple, beneficial, effects in patients (such as those with
      SWS that undergo neurological deterioration) suffering from medically refractory seizures. We
      hypothesize that CBD will reduce seizure frequency in children and young adults with SWS and
      will therefore help stabilize and improve their neurologic status.This trial is part of an
      expanded access program, available through a partnership with GW Pharmaceutical, which has
      been sanctioned by the FDA to study the safety and efficacy of Epidiolex (cannabidiol/CBD) in
      participants with SWS and medically refractory seizures.
