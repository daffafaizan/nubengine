      TrPs. The MgSO4 prevents the release of pre-synaptic acetylcholine from neuromuscular and
      sympathetic junctions that could explain the ability of the MgSO4 to relax the muscle and
      reduce pain Specific aim: evaluate the effectiveness of magnesium sulphate injections in
      treatment of myofascial trigger points in the masseter muscle versus the saline injection.

      Hypothesis: the injection of masseter muscle trigger points with magnesium sulphate is more
      effective than saline injection in pain relief.
