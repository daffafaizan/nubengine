      with conformational radiotherapy with or without intensity modulation, and breast cancer
      patients treated with adjuvant radiotherapy after breast conservative surgery for patients
      aged under 60 years of age. The identification of 5% of patients at risk of severe toxicity
      should allow to deliver high dose radiotherapy among 95% of patients with a lower risk of
      severe late complications.
