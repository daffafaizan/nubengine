      (ARDS) pose a global public health problem. The increase in spread and associated mortality
      poses a scenario where cost-effective therapeutic options are urgently and effectively
      proposed to control and reduce the pandemic and even to reduce the number of deaths
      Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral colchicine plus treatment standard
      versus standard treatment in the clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 virus infection, in a
      population group with moderate COVID-19 involvement and requiring hospitalization.
      Methodology: A prospective, open, randomized, parallel-group study, the sample size of 120
      subjects each arm of 60 subjects. Random assignment (1: 1) to either colchicine plus standard
      treatment or control arm (standard treatment) orally for 14 days. An initial dose of 1.5 mg
      orally on the first day, followed by 0.5 mg every 12 hours on days 2 to 7 and continuing with
      0.5 mg a day until completing 14 days Â± 1. It will be followed on days 1, 3, 7, 14, and day
      28, evaluating physical examination, clinical situation, laboratories, and adverse events.
      The primary efficacy data correspond to the deterioration in the clinical status of the
      patients through the semiquantitative ordinal scale suggested by the WHO R&D committee.
      Expected results: It is expected to find out how, through different pathways, colchicine
      could act in modulating or preventing the appearance of ARDS associated with COVID-19, its
      possible effects on viral replication and antigenic presentation.
