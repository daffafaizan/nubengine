      L-DLPFC or the ACC for reducing SI in individuals with OUD and identify neural functional
      connectivity changes underlying treatment response. 30 individuals with OUD who endorse
      suicidal ideation will be recruited. The accelerated iTBS treatment will involve 10 daily
      sessions of iTBS. Stimulation will be delivered to either the ACC or the L-DLPFC for 5
      consecutive days. Suicidal ideation, depressive symptoms and opiate misuse will be measured
      before and after the 5-day stimulation course. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
      scans will also be carried out before and after stimulation to examine aiTBS-induced changes
      in neural functional connectivity. Changes in suicidal ideation, depressive symptoms and
      opiate misuse will be measured using both clinician-rated and self-report assessments.
