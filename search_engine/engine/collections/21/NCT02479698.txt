      I. To assess the efficacy, feasibility and safety of administering most closely human
      leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched BK specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) lines (BK-CTLs)
      generated by ex vivo expansion to mediate antiviral activity in patients with any type of
      malignancies, and/or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome
      (AIDs), and/or history of solid organ transplant with BK and JC infections.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To assess the persistence of the administered BK-CTLs generated by ex vivo expansion in
      patients with any type of malignancies, and/or HIV/AIDs, and/or history of solid organ
      transplant with BK and JC infections.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive allogeneic BK-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes intravenously (IV) over 30
      minutes. Patients achieving partial response, stable disease, or progressive disease are
      eligible for 7 additional infusions of CTL occurring at least 2 weeks after the previous CTL
      infusion if they meet the eligibility criteria for subsequent therapy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for 12 months.
