      including cardiovascular disease, motor vehicle accidents, daytime functional impairments and
      mortality risk. A significant proportion of the populace has mild SDB.

      This study is a randomized control trial (RCT) to test the efficacy of a program combining
      patient monitoring with behavioral techniques across Positive Airway Pressure (PAP) and sleep
      education. Screening for sleep apnea will be performed based on a phone screening
      questionnaire and an initial polysomnography (collected from another clinic or collected by
      research staff). Both objective (actigraphy, Psychomotor Vigilance Test, 24 hour blood
      pressure monitoring, office blood pressure, and EndoPATTM) and self-report
      (questionnaire/diary) sleep measure will be collected, as well as other health-related
      measures. Participants with an Apnea Hypopnea Index between 5 and 15, and who meet all
      inclusion/exclusion criteria will be randomized to one of three educational programs.

      All groups will receive education about SDB and sleep, but only one group will receive PAP
      devices. This information will be provided to participants as part of the 4-session
      intervention. Follow-up assessments will be conducted immediately following the intervention
      and after 3-months.

      Main study outcomes (lapses, daytime sleepiness, endothelial function and ambulatory blood
      pressure) will be assessed at baseline, post treatment and 3 month. Data will be analyzed
      using "intention to treat" principles, using appropriate statistical methods for clinical
      trials.
