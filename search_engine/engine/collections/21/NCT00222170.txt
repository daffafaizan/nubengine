      Subsequently, all patients will receive rabeprazole (20mg QD) for 8 weeks and will be
      re-endoscoped to confirm complete healing of reflux esophagitis. In patients with completely
      healed reflux esophagitis the second collection of salivary and esophageal secretion will be
      implemented. In both secretions, adequately coded for the laboratory Research Fellow (blinded
      in terms of which sample is collected before and which after treatment with rabeprazole) the
      content of mucin will be measured using commercially available assay and its secretion
      expressed in units per minute of collection time.
