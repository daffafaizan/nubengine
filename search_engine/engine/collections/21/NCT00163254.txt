      This study is designed as a feasibility trial, which compares the two new treatment
      modalities: drug eluting stents and GP IIb/IIIa blockade.

      Patients with current ulcers (Rutherford 5, or 6) are randomly assigned to one of the
      treatment groups: [1] ReoPro + Sirolimus coated stent, [2] ReoPro + bare Stent, [3] ReoPro +
      PTA, [4] PTA without ReoPro. Angiographic control will be at 2 and 6 months with block wise
      randomisation to the treatment groups.
