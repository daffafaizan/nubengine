      disease and should be at high prioritisation for vaccination against SARS-CoV-2. In Greece
      the vaccination of healthcare workers has been initiated in January 2021, elderly citizens as
      well and for cancer patients of all ages will be initiated early February 2021. There are
      very little available data on the efficacy of immunisation with vaccines overall in cancer
      patients, with most existing data involving the influenza vaccine. The covid-19 vaccine
      trials have not included cancer patients, therefore, the efficacy and duration of immunity in
      patients with cancer are still unknown. Those patients are often immunocompromised due to
      their disease or the side-effects of their treatment.

      Based on the above this study was designed to prospectively record and monitor patients with
      cancer after covid-19 vaccination. The study will record and measure clinical outcomes, such
      as possible infection from covid-19 despite vaccination, severity and mortality, but also
      possible side effects post vaccination. Within the study serological responses (IgG antibody
      titers) will also be monitored in three timepoints (prior to vaccination, one month and three
      months after completion of the two doses of vaccination). Potential factors that affect
      immunity, will be recorded, such as type and stage of cancer, type and time of systemic
      therapy in relation to covid-19 vaccination.
