      such way related to physical exercise is AI-enabled exercise mobile application (digital
      coach), which uses motion tracking technology to monitor and provide real-time audio feedback
      on a person's exercise form. However, this AI technology has yet to be independently tested
      against an in-person evaluator (human coach) for its ability to improve exercise form. This
      study is a blinded randomized controlled trial comparing the ability of the digital coach
      (n=15) and a Physical Therapist (PT) human coach (n=15) to improve bodyweight squat form in
      30 able-bodied volunteers age 20 - 35. Each volunteer performs 10 unassisted control squats,
      then 10 squats with assistive vocal feedback from either coach after each repetition, and
      finally 10 more unassisted test squats, all squats video-recorded. Three independent video
      evaluators count the number of correct squat repetitions completed by volunteers before and
      after intervention by the different coaches. This project is important to validate the
      digital coach compared to a PT human coach in a small population using a bodyweight squat for
      its wide applicability to daily movement patterns.
