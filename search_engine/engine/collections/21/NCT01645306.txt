      ischemic stroke, transitory ischemic attack or intermittent blindness (amaurosis fugax)
      within the last 30 days. All patients were on standard medication with aspirin or clopidogrel
      and received heparin for thrombosis prophylaxis. Carotid endarterectomy (CEA), carotid
      stenting (CAS) or best medical therapy for treatment of the carotid stenosis and prevention
      of secondary thrombo-emboli was performed according to guidelines. Additional treatment with
      Revacept or placebo was done on top of the standard therapy. Therefore the control group
      receiving placebo was already on the standard medical therapy for patients with symptomatic
      carotid stenosis and received also the guideline conform interventions CEA, CAS or best
      medical therapy.

      Secondary prophylaxis of thrombo-embolic ischemic events by Revacept should be investigated.
      Therefore microemboli were detected by transcranial Doppler and ischemic brain lesions were
      investigated by diffusion weighted imaging magnetic resonance imaging (DWI-MRI) scan as
      exploratory endpoints. Moreover clinical endpoints such as stroke, TIA, myocardial
      infarction, coronary intervention and death were investigated at 1 week, 3 months and 12
      months follow-up. Safety was closely monitored with emphasis on bleeding complications as
      bleeding is the most dreaded complication of anti-thrombotic agents especially in patients
      with cerebral strokes.
