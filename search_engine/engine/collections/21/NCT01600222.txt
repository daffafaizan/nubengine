    
      The purpose of the present study is to assess the systemic safety of LEO 90100. Although LEO
      90100 contains the same active ingredients in the same concentration as
      DAIVOBET/DOVOBET/TACLONEX ointment, the degree of absorption of the active ingredients from
      the new formulation may differ. Systemic safety will be assessed through the effect of LEO
      90100 on calcium metabolism and HPA axis function under maximum use conditions (i.e., in
      subjects with very extensive psoriasis on the trunk, limbs and scalp, using up to 120g per
      week of LEO 90100 for up to 4 weeks). Data from this study, together with the measurements of
      albumin-corrected serum calcium and the calcium:creatinine ratio in spot urine samples in the
      planned phase 2 and 3 studies in the development program for LEO 90100, are expected to
      provide adequate information with respect to the systemic safety of LEO 90100.
