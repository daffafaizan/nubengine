      severe infections. Aminoglycosides are well known for their nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity,
      meanwhile the renal function of the newborns is not yet fully developed.The aminoglycoside
      dosage currently applied in Indonesia is derived from studies done in Caucasian populations.
      The safety and efficacy of this dosage regimen, however, have never been evaluated till date.
      The pharmacokinetic profile of drugs may vary between populations and this may be influenced
      by genetic factors, lifestyle, drug interactions, etc. The detection of aminoglycoside
      toxicity in newborns is usually problematic. The present study aims to know the proportion of
      nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity in newborns in the Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital treated with
      gentamicin or amikacin in relation to their trough serum concentration. The serum level of
      gentamicin and amikacin is assumed to be safe if the trough serum concentrations are < 2
      mcg/mL and effective if its is between 5-12 mcg/mL. For amikacin the desired trough serum
      concentrations are <10 mcg/mL and the peak is between 20-30 mcg/mL. The nephrotoxicity was
      assessed by measuring the level of kidney injury molecule-1 in urine while the ototoxicity
      was assessed by Distortion Product Otoacoustic Emission (DPOE) instrument.
