    
      This is an open-label, nonrandomized phase 2 trial to assess the efficacy of cobimetinib in
      RAS pathway activated CMML. Two cohorts of patients will be accrued using Simon's two-stage
      design (Simon, 1989) for both cohorts. Cohort 1 will enroll nine newly diagnosed patients in
      the first stage and if four or more responses are observed five additional patients will be
      enrolled in the second stage. Cohort 2 will enroll six HMA refractory patients in the first
      stage and if one or more responses are observed then nine additional patients will be
      enrolled in the second stage.

      All eligible patients will be treated daily with cobimetinib in 28-day cycles. Cobimetinib
      will be administered consecutively for three weeks followed by a one week break prior to the
      start of the following cycle. Patients will remain on study therapy until treatment
      discontinuation criteria is met.
