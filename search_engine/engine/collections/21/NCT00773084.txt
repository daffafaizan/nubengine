      activation is more pronounced in Mexican Americans with diastolic HF and consequently their
      response to RAAS inhibition therapy is greater. Blocking the RAAS with renin inhibitor plus
      aldosterone receptor blocker should produce measurable changes in biomarkers as well as
      physiologic improvement that could therefore translate into improved clinical outcomes. These
      changes should be greater appreciated in Mexican Americans if the central pathophysiologic
      influence of HF in this population was RAAS maladaptation.
