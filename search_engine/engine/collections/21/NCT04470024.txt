    
      This is a phase Ib trial of an autophagosome vaccine (DPV-001) with or without anti-GITR
      (INCAGN01876), combined with subsequent anti-PD1 (INCMGA00012), in patients with recurrent or
      metastatic HNSCC. Eligible patients will be registered and assigned to one of two treatment
      arms. Subjects in Arm 1 will receive combination therapy with DPV-001 with delayed anti-PD-1,
      and subjects in Arm 2 will receive DPV-001 and anti-GITR with delayed anti-PD-1 (triplet
      therapy). Mandatory biopsy will occur at week 2. Initial restaging CT and mandatory biopsy
      will occur at 8 weeks, followed by confirmatory CT at 12 weeks. Subsequent restaging CT will
      be performed at week 24 and every 12 weeks thereafter. Starting at week 22, dosing of DPV-101
      will switch to a q4wk schedule, while the schedule of anti-GITR and anti-PD1 will remain
      unchanged.
