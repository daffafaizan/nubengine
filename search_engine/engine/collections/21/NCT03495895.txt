      or high risk mothers. The focus of the intervention is to reduce negative infant and maternal
      outcomes and strengthen the attachment relationship. MTB is delivered by an interdisciplinary
      team of highly skilled practitioners, who have health and social work experience, integrating
      advanced practice nursing and mental health care for mothers and infants. In the proposed
      Randomised Control Trial (RCT) the investigators will study the efficacy of this innovative
      intervention across ten Danish sites. Site staff will be trained at two sessions one year
      apart. Sites are randomized to training at time 1 or 2. All sites will recruit treatment as
      usual control families before they receive the training and start offering the intervention
      to all families. Potential participants will be approached by a local front staff member
      (e.g. midwife, helath visitor or social worker) who will inform mothers of the project in the
      early pregnancy. Consenting eligible participants will be assessed before they give birth and
      when their child is three months, one and two years old.

      The effectiveness of the MTB programme will be evaluated by assessing a range of maternal and
      infant outcomes, including maternal sensitivity, parent mental Health, child development, and
      register data on e.g. infant maltreatment and neglect, hospitalization, income, immunization.
      By combining parent report, observational and register data researchers will get a unique
      opportunity to advance knowledge regarding effective ways to support some of the youngest and
      most vulnerable children in Denmark.
