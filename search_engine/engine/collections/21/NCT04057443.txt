      This study aims to determine wether a geriatric intervention based on an individualized
      program of physical exercise and nutritional support improves the ability to complete
      oncological treatment at the doses and time initially planned in patients ≥ 70 years affected
      by hematological malignancies.

      DESIGN:

      Prospective, clinical trial, randomized, parallel and open groups.

      SETTING:

      Patients ≥ 70 years recently diagnosed of malignant hematological pathology in a
      comprehensive cancer center

      INTERVENTION:

      All those patients who meet the inclusion criteria and agree to participate, will sign the
      corresponding informed consent and will be assessed through a CGA (comprehensive geriatric
      assessment), that includes the performance of a physical condition test (SPPB), and
      randomized to the study group or control group. Patients in the study group will participate
      in an intervention program with nutritional support and physical exercise during the period
      in which they are receiving oncological treatment or for a maximum period of 6 months. The
      patients of the control group will pass to follow up. All patients, regardless of the branch
      of study to which they are assigned, will receive the oncological treatment indicated by
      their doctor and a standard follow-up according to the current care protocols in the center.

      DETERMINATIONS:

      Main variable: proportion of adherence to treatment calculated as the percentage between the
      dose administered and the prescribed. Adherence over 80% will be considered acceptable.

      Secondary variables: geriatric, nutritional and physical-condition parameters before and
      after the intervention, quality of life before and after the intervention, toxicity and
      complications during treatment and response to treatment.
