      cancer after standard surgery. Additional treatment may sometimes be given after the main
      treatment in hopes of preventing the cancer from worsening or coming back (called adjuvant
      therapy).

      It is not fully know whether adjuvant therapy after surgery is useful in early stage
      endometrial cancer. It is also not known what the best adjuvant therapy after surgery is. The
      most commonly given adjuvant therapy is chemotherapy with carboplatin and paclitaxel.
      Sometimes, chemotherapy and radiation therapy may be given. There is not enough information
      available as to how useful adjuvant therapy is and what the most useful type of treatment is.
      This study will look at adjuvant chemotherapy alone compared with adjuvant radiation therapy
      and chemotherapy, after standard of care surgery, in patients with serous or p53 abnormal
      endometrial cancer.
