    
      The Harmony 522 study has been terminated due to the closing of the Astora Women's Health
      business. No other entity will be taking responsibility for this study. The study was
      terminated with partial subject enrollment complete and therefore no primary or secondary
      data analysis can be performed. The data from this study resides in a national data base
      which Astora no longer has access and therefore is another reason why no data analysis can be
      performed. The national database is owned and managed by the American Urogynecology Society
      (AUGS). AUGS has access to Astora's data and will at some time in the near future publish
      results to physicians who are active participants in the registry. Full public disclosure of
      this data may not occur for a number of years and will be aggregated with data from other
      study sponsors.
