      I. To evaluate the standardized uptake value maximum (SUVmax) in patients with previously
      untreated HER2+ breast cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate if the uptake of copper 64 Cu-64-DOTA-trastuzumab, a proposed indicator of
      responsiveness to HER2-directed therapy, correlates with serpin peptidase inhibitor alpha-1
      antiproteinase, antitrypsin, member 1 gene (SERPINA1) expression, which has been shown to be
      associated with estrogen receptor positive (ER+)/ HER2+ patient survival, both in the
      HER2+/ER+ patients and in all patients.

      II. To compare uptake of copper Cu 64-DOTA-trastuzumab in the patients with complete
      pathologic response (pCR) versus (vs) non-pCR patients.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive trastuzumab intravenously (IV) over 15 minutes immediately before receiving
      copper Cu 64-DOTA-trastuzumab IV on day 0. Patients undergo PET scans at 18-24 and 42-48
      hours, on day 1 and 2. Within 4 days after completion of PET scans, patients then receive
      trastuzumab IV over 30-90 minutes weekly or every 3 weeks and pertuzumab IV over 30-60
      minutes. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 6 cycles in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo surgery after 6 cycles of trastuzumab and
      pertuzumab.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 1 year.
