      heart failure, depressed left ventricular function and a wide QRS-complex. Large clinical
      trials have demonstrated unequivocal improvements in functional status, morbidity and
      mortality. However, 30 % of heart failure patients treated with a CRT-device do not benefit
      clinically. Several factors have been suggested to be important for the response to CRT such
      as mechanical dyssynchrony, presence of scar tissue in the myocardium, and
      device-optimization (among others). It is the purpose of this study to investigate the
      importance of these factors.

      100 patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy, eligible to CRT according to current guidelines,
      will be included. Patients are randomised to two arms. One group will have atrioventricular
      (AV)-optimization after implantation, the other AV -and interventricular (VV)-optimization.
      After 4 months patients are crossed-over to the other arm. Preimplantation patients are
      MR-scanned and low-dose dobutamine stress-echocardiography is performed. Furthermore patients
      will be examined by echocardiography and evaluation of clinical status

        1. Mechanical dyssynchrony can predict response to CRT. b. Measures of mechanical
           dyssynchrony is related to myocardial viability and conduction.

        2. Individual optimization based on conduction times will increase benefit to CRT. b. The
           effect of adding VV-optimization is related to myocardial viability.

        3. > 30 % of non-viable tissue globally in the myocardium is predictive of lack of CRT-
           response. b. Non-viable tissue located in the area of the left ventricular lead is
           predictive of non-response.
