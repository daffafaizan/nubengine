      program for incoming fourth class cadets at the United States Air Force Academy (USAFA). The
      resulting adaptation, called Cadet Healthy Personal Skills (CHiPS), provides cadets with the
      knowledge, attitudes, and skills to enhance their personal resilience, increase their
      potential for success, help them develop healthy and rewarding personal relationships, and
      reduce sexual harassment and assault. The CHiPS program includes ten units, spread across
      three blocks of content, and each block teaches cadets a range of life skills. All incoming
      fourth class cadets (N=1,203) were invited to participate in this study, beginning in the
      Summer of 2017, and of those, 1,098 cadets (91.3%) consented to participate in the
      trial.Twenty-five facilitators were trained to implement the newly adapted CHiPS program.
      Half of the incoming class [four Basic Cadet Training (BCT) squadrons] was assigned to
      receive the intervention, while the other half (four BCT squadrons) continued to receive
      standard trainings already in place at USAFA. All cadets completed a self-report survey at
      pretest, posttest, and at a 12-month follow-up
