    
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the usability, feasibility, and acceptability of a
      game-based intervention (Prognosis) designed to improve science, technology, engineering, and
      mathematics (STEM) skills among high school-aged students. The research questions are as
      follows:

      H1: Students will find Prognosis usable, feasible, and acceptable and recommend continued
      development and testing of Prognosis.

      H2: After playing Prognosis, students will be able to perform basic quantitative data skills
      such as calculating incidence and prevalence.

      H3: After playing Prognosis, students will be able to observe patterns in data at the
      neighborhood and city level.

      H4: After playing Prognosis, students will be able to construct explanations and models
      describing the organization of systems in the game and how they contribute to health
      outcomes.

      H5: After playing Prognosis, students will be able to formulate and test hypotheses for how
      to best coordinate various city systems and leverage finite resources to reach their target
      health goal.
