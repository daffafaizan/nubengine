      I. To determine the toxicities and tolerability of bortezomib in combination with
      standard-relapse AML therapy (idarubicin/cytarabine or etoposide/high-dose cytarabine) in
      pediatric and young adult patients with relapsed or primary-refractory or secondary AML.

      II. To estimate the complete response rate to the Arm A and Arm B regimens.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether bortezomib inhibits proteasome activity, NF-kB activity and induces
      apoptosis pathway proteins in leukemia myeloblasts. II. To determine the feasibility of
      measuring AML stem cells in relapsed and recovering bone marrow.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of bortezomib. Patients are stratified
      according to anthracycline*-equivalent cumulative exposure (≤ 400 mg/m² vs > 400 mg/m²).
      Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I (efficacy phase, patients with ≤ 400 mg/m² anthracycline-equivalent cumulative
      exposure - Closed as of 08/01/10): Patients receive idarubicin IV over 15 minutes on days
      1-3, low-dose cytarabine IV continuously over days 1-7, and bortezomib IV on days 1, 4, and
      8.

      GROUP II (dose-finding phase (closed as of 10/10) and efficacy phase, patients with > 400
      mg/m² anthracycline*-equivalent cumulative exposure): Patients receive etoposide IV over 1
      hour on days 1-5, high-dose cytarabine IV over 1 hour twice daily on days 1-5, and bortezomib
      IV on days 1, 4, and 8.

      NOTE: * Anthracycline restriction no longer required for group 2 as of 10/02/10.

      All patients receive intrathecal cytarabine prior to courses 1 and 2. In both arms, treatment
      repeats every 28 days for up to 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically for at least 5 years.
