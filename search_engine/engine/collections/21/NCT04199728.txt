      treatment outcomes in opioid use disorder (OUD) by reducing craving, a primary factor
      contributing to early relapse. Although liraglutide was approved for human use in 2010, there
      are no data testing the effectiveness in patients with an OUD. The objective of the proposed
      research is to test whether treatment with a GLP-1R agonist can reduce craving in humans with
      OUD. Understanding how a 'satiety' agent may affect craving and brain responses to drug cues
      in an OUD population would provide entirely novel information. If liraglutide shows a trend
      towards efficacy, and safety of the GLP-1R agonist is demonstrated in this population, it
      would provide an indication to run the second phase, multi-center clinical trial of GLP-1R
      agonist in OUD patients.
