    
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of nanoparticle albumin-bound rapamycin
      followed by a phase II study.

      Participants receive ABI-009 intravenously (IV) on days 1 and 8 and pazopanib hydrochloride
      orally (PO) daily on days 1-21. Cycles repeat every 21 days until unequivocal clinical
      disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or until in the opinion of the investigator the
      patient is no longer benefiting from therapy, or at the patient's discretion.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up at 30 days, then every 12
      weeks.
