    
      This is a 3-part Phase 2a study, with Part A (Blinded Phase), Part B (Open-label
      Interventional Phase), and Part C (Rollover Proof of Concept).

      Participants in Part A are blinded to their treatment assignment, with participants receiving
      either 2 active mRNA-1273 vaccine doses or placebo. Part B of the study is designed to offer
      participants to be unblinded so that participants who received placebo in Part A can request
      2 doses of open-label mRNA-1273 vaccine. Additionally, participants who originally received 1
      or 2 doses of mRNA-1273 (50 microgram [μg] or 100 μg vaccine) during Part A, will have the
      opportunity to request to receive a single booster dose of mRNA-1273.

      Part C will be a proof-of-concept rollover study to evaluate a vaccine to treat mutations of
      SARS-CoV2, such as the S-protein of the B.1.351 variant. Part C will include approximately 60
      participants, who are currently enrolled in Moderna's Phase 3 mRNA-1273-P301 study
      (NCT04470427), have already been unblinded, and have previously received 2 doses of mRNA-1273
      at least 6 months earlier. At enrollment into Part C of this study, their participation in
      mRNA-1273-P301 study will be terminated. Part C will evaluate the safety and immunogenicity
      of 2 dose levels (20 µg and 50 µg) of mRNA-1273.351 and mRNA-1273/mRNA-1273.351 mixture (50
      µg total), given as a single booster dose.
