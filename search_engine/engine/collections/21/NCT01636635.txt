      immune response. These are conditions seen also with aging, but it is unknown to what extent
      they may be further impacted by obesity in the elderly. With this study the investigators aim
      to establish the mechanism by which weight loss may reduce inflammation and enhance iron
      status in young and older obese adults through the peptide hormone hepcidin, which regulates
      iron homeostasis. The investigators also aim to identify a possible link between iron
      homeostasis and immune response through hepcidin, which has been implicated in T cell
      mediated immunity. The investigators hypothesize that obesity-induced inflammation causes
      dysregulation of hepcidin expression leading to lower iron status through decreased iron
      absorption and availability in young and older adults. Furthermore, the investigators
      hypothesize that hepcidin dysregulation, and thus iron status can be mitigated with weight
      loss in both young and older obese adults. This hypothesis will be tested in obese young and
      older women undergoing weight loss through calorie restriction. Change in iron status,
      inflammation, and hepcidin will be determined before and after weight loss. Further, the
      impact of inflammatory environment of obesity on peripheral blood mononuclear cell hepcidin,
      ferroportin, intracellular iron, and T cell function in young and older adults will be
      determined. This study will address two important public health problems, i.e. obesity and
      iron deficiency and will be an important step toward the identification of strategies to
      enhance health of obese young and older adults.
