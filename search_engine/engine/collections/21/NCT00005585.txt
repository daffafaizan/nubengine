    
      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare the efficacy and toxicity of short methotrexate infusion vs longer infusion in
           patients with low-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

        -  Compare the efficacy of these regimens of methotrexate, with or without multidrug
           intensification, in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      genetics (stratum 1: trisomy 4/10 but not TEL/AML1 vs stratum 2: TEL/AML1 with or without
      trisomy 4/10).

      All patients receive induction therapy (weeks 1-4) on another protocol (POG-9900).

      Stratum 1

        -  Consolidation therapy begins on week 5. Patients are randomized to arm I or II.

             -  Arm I: Patients receive methotrexate (MTX) IV over 24 hours on day 1 and oral
                leucovorin calcium (CF) every 6 hours for 3 doses beginning 42 hours after
                initiation of MTX infusion during weeks 7, 10, 13, 16, and 19.

             -  Arm II: Patients receive MTX IV over 4 hours on day 1 and oral CF as in arm I
                during weeks 7, 10, 13, 16, and 19.

        -  Patients in arms I and II also receive MTX intrathecally (IT) on weeks 7, 10, 13, 16,
           19, and 22; oral mercaptopurine (6-MP) daily on weeks 5-24; oral dexamethasone (DM)
           twice daily on days 1-7 of weeks 8 and 17; and vincristine (VCR) IV on day 1 of weeks 8,
           9, 17, and 18.

      Stratum 2

        -  Consolidation therapy begins on week 5 and delayed intensification therapy begins on
           week 16. Patients are randomized to delayed intensification or no delayed
           intensification. Patients randomized to no delayed intensification are then randomized
           to consolidation therapy on arm I or II. Patients randomized to delayed intensification
           are then randomized to arm III or IV. Patients with trisomy 4/10 are not randomized to
           arms III and IV.

             -  Arm III: Patients receive MTX IV and CF as in arm I on weeks 7, 10, 13, 24, 27, and
                30.

             -  Arm IV: Patients receive MTX IV and CF as in arm II on weeks 7, 10, 13, 24, 27, and
                30.

        -  Patients in arms III and IV also receive oral 6-MP daily on weeks 5-13 and then
           beginning on week 24 and continuing until the end of consolidation; MTX IT on weeks 7,
           10, 13, 16, 20, 21, and 30; oral DM twice daily on days 1-7 of weeks 8, 16-18, and 28;
           VCR IV on day 1 of weeks 8, 9, 16-18, 28, and 29; pegaspargase intramuscularly on week
           16; daunorubicin IV on day 1 of weeks 16-18; cyclophosphamide IV on day 1 of week 20;
           cytarabine IV or subcutaneously on days 2-5 of weeks 20 and 21; and oral thioguanine
           daily on days 1-14 of weeks 20 and 21.

      All patients then receive continuation therapy beginning on week 25 for arms I and II and
      week 33 for arms III and IV and continuing until week 130 for all arms.

      Continuation

        -  Arms I and II: Patients receive oral 6-MP daily on weeks 25-130; oral DM twice a day on
           days 1-7 and VCR IV on days 1 and 8 during weeks 25, 41, 57, 73, 89, and 105; oral MTX
           weekly on weeks 25-130 (except during weeks of IT MTX); and MTX IT on weeks 25, 37, 49,
           61, 73, 85, 97, and 109.

        -  Arms III and IV: Patients receive oral 6-MP daily on weeks 33-130; oral DM twice a day
           on days 1-7 and VCR IV on days 1 and 8 during weeks 41, 57, 73, 89, and 105; oral MTX
           weekly on weeks 33-130 (except during weeks of IT MTX); and MTX IT on weeks 37, 49, 61,
           73, 85, 97, and 109.

      Patients are followed every 2 months for 2 years, every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months
      for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total 902 patients will be accrued for this study within 3.22 years.
