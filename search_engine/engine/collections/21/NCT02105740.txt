    
      Volunteers cancer patients of both gender, aged between 40 and 70 years, susceptible to
      hypnosis, with pain scores â‰¥ 3 measured by Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), will be randomized
      into two groups of 12 participants each. They might or might not present metastasis, whether
      or not performed cancer surgery, regardless of the location of the primary tumor, with or
      without concomitant surgical indication. It will be used the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and
      Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) at 3 different times: at baseline, after 7 days
      and after 2 weeks of the first assessment. It will be done, in the hypnosis group, an
      hypnosis intervention. It consists of two 40-minute sessions, with an interval of 7 days
      between them, emphasizing the pain blocking, the well-being of the patient and the reduction
      of the symptoms of anxiety and depression. Then, it will be evaluated the intensity of the
      pain as well as depression and anxiety in both groups. Finally, the results of both groups
      will be compared.
