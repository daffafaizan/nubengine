    
      Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is an acknowledged therapy of selected patients with
      heart failure (HF). One of the unresolved problems is high percentage of non-responders to
      CRT, reaching 40%. No single parameter, helpful in identifying non-responders prior to CRT
      implantation, was found.

      The study included patients with HF of ischemic or non-ischemic etiology, in NYHA class
      II-IV, EF≤35% and QRS≥120ms. All the patients had CRT implanted. Clinical evaluation, CPET
      and NT-proBNP levels measurement were performed before CRT implantation and after 3-6 months.
      Improvement in HF symptoms of one or more NYHA class correlated with two-years survival. It
      was used as the criterion of positive response to CRT.
