    
      This is a prospective, controlled, randomized, double blind study. A total of 36 subjects
      will be enrolled into the study. Subjects will be randomized to receive Teduglutide or
      Placebo for 12 weeks or until the ileostomy is reversed. Teduglutide or placebo will be
      administered via a daily subcutaneous injection into the abdomen or thigh. The sites will be
      rotated with each injection. If adverse effects develop the subjects will be permitted to
      hold drug administration for a maximum of 5 days in total during the 12-week study.
