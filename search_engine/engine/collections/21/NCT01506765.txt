      Laboratory of Psychiatric Neuroscience (LUNEP) DUPA of Lausanne, reinforce the hypothesis
      proposed that a deficit intracerebral glutathione is a vulnerability factor for Schizophrenia
      at least for a subgroup of patients. While pursuing the baseline study, it is appropriate now
      to try to restore a higher level of glutathione in patients to see if this increase is
      accompanied by an improvement in symptoms, particularly negative symptoms and disorders
      cognitive, particularly resistant to current therapy. N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) is a precursor
      of glutathione which is used clinically for various indications, well tolerated even at high
      doses. The investigators propose a double-blind cross-over with the aim to study if the
      N-acetyl-cystein (at a dose of oral 2g/day) leads on the one hand a rising glutathione brain
      (measured in resonance magnetic spectroscopic) and also improved patients' conditions
      (determined by clinical assessments, psychopathological, neuropsychological, biochemical and
      physiological), while recording any side effects. As a first step, this study should include
      at least thirty patients and last for two to three years. It is important to note that this
      is not a study of medication suggested by a pharmaceutical industry, but a medical search.
