      Rebuilding Bridges intervention, which was designed to help homeless Veterans plan and
      implement steps to engage friends, family and other loved ones in their lives. The PI and his
      team will enroll approximately 25-30 Veterans. Veterans will be recruited via provider
      referral and via advertisements that will be placed in general clinical areas and desks at
      the Errera Center. The PI will work with the Veterans to create a detailed genogram of
      family, friends and other supporters in the Veteran's life. This will be followed by a
      meeting with each Veteran over the course of three 30-minute weekly sessions to help the
      Veteran identify and engage people listed in their genogram which the Veteran might want to
      form stronger relationships with. Veterans will also be asked to complete several measures
      and questionnaires such as housing information, employment, mental health and quality of
      life.
