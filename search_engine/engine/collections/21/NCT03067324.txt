      Chip study proposes to develop a bio-sensor that will allow a multi-parametric analysis of
      islet graft based on measurement of islet membrane electric potential.

      The project aims to :

        -  develop the bio-sensor necessary to measure islet membrane electric potential

        -  develop interface between bio-sensor and user

        -  correlate analysis data collected by bio-sensor with metabolic results of islet graft
