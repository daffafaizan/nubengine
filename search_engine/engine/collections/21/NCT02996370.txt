      surgery, I shape technique used in test group and mid-crestal technique used in control
      group. The clinical parameters, including modified plaque index, modified sulcus bleeding
      index, probing depth, keratinized tissue level were recorded baseline, 3 and 6 month. The
      vertical distance between the crests top-contact point was evaluated with digital periapical
      radiographs at baseline 3 and 6 month. Also the clinical photographs were taken baseline, 3
      and 6 month. Two T shaped full-round hexagonal straight filaments, each 5 mm, were used in
      the taking of standardized images. With these images the ratio of the papilla area in
      proportion to the embrasure area and the papilla classification was measured. Non-parametric
      test were used for statistically analysis.
