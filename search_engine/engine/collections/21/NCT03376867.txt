        1. To establish baseline values of DNICs using CPM protocol

        2. To identify the variables that will be integrated in the algorithm of the clinical
           screening test (clinical decision rule).

      First the target population will be healthy volunteers, male and female, stratified by age.
      The reference values will be established via a non-parametric method for a standard CPM
      protocol in which two different pain stimuli are applied. Two "stimuli tests" of the same
      intensity and nature (heat) will be applied before and after the application of another
      "conditioning stimulus" (cold water bath). The perceived pain difference between the 1st and
      2nd stimuli tests will reflect the intensity of the DNICs.

      Secondly, these results will be compared to those from volunteers suffering of chronic pain.
      The clinical decision rule will result from clinical and paraclinical elements correlating
      with the amplitude of the efficacy of CPM (serum noradrenaline, intensity of pain, heart rate
      and blood pressure measurements, psychometric questionnaires assessing anxiety, depressive
      feelings and pain catastrophizing). Logistic regression analysis will determine the best
      predictors of a CPM deficit.
