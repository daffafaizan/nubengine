      experience with the use of rFVIIa at UCSF/SFGH with other trauma centers. The study is being
      conducted under the auspices of the Western Trauma Association and the American Association
      of the Surgery of Trauma. Both organizations have a long history of successfully completing
      multi-center studies. The outcomes to be used in this study are: 1) survival, 2) amount of
      blood products infused before and after rFVIIa, 3) coagulation factors (PTT, INR) before and
      after, and 4) the surgeon's assessment of hemostasis. Data will also be analyzed to determine
      the cost effectiveness of rFVIIa when compared with other methods of treating severe
      hemorrhage, primarily administration of blood products. Finally, the incidence of
      complications and thrombotic events after drug administration will be evaluated.
