      Endurance training: 31 min at 65-75% HRmax, making it a total of 25min; HIT: 4x4min intervals
      at 85-95% HRmax divided by 3x3min of active recovery at 60-70% HRmax, making it a total of 25
      min; Pyramid: One pyramid consists of 8 one-minute blocks. Those are grouped starting with
      one block of 70-75% HRmax, followed by one block at 75-80% HRmax and another one at 80-85%
      HRmax. The top of the pyramid are 2 blocks of 85-90% HRmax. Intensity is lowered afterwards
      with one block of 80-85% HRmax, followed by one block at 75-80% HRmax and last one at 70-75%
      HRmax. Two more pyramids follow, each divided by 2min of active recovery at 65-70% HRmax,
      making it a total of 28min.

      All protocols are initiated by 5min of warm-up and end with 5min of cool-down, both at 60-70%
      HRmax.

      Primary Outcome: Individual maximum power output in watt (Pmax). Secondary Outcome: Change of
      power output in watt at lactate tresholds at 2 and 4mmol/l.
