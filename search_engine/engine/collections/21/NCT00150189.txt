      behavioral outcomes. Immunization injections represent a relatively brief exposure to acute
      pain, yet assessment studies demonstrate that infants respond with significant distress
      during the injections. This study will examine the analgesic potential of oral sucrose in
      diminishing the pain associated with immunization injections in 6 week to 4-month-old
      infants. The proposed mechanism of action is via the activation of endogenous opioids that
      attenuate nociceptive information at the level of the dorsal horn.

      Comparison: Administration of oral sucrose 2 minutes prior to immunizations compared to
      administration of sterile water 2 minutes prior to immunizations
