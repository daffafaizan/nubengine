      potential risk factors related to pregnancy and interactions of the environment and genetics.
      The Registry provides researchers with the approximate number of children with cerebral palsy
      across Canada, and data in the Registry helps researchers explore reasons behind the causes
      of cerebral palsy, in addition to supporting studies which may lead to improvements in the
      overall care of children with CP.

      Cerebral palsy is the most common cause of physical disability in children in Canada and it
      is important that we gain a better understanding of its prevalence, risk factors and current
      clinical profile. The Canadian CP Registry provides valuable data from different Canadian
      regions which can be shared and analyzed so as to provide answers to these important
      questions. Specifically, the Registry serves to:

        -  Characterize the profile of children living with CP across the country

        -  Identify risk factors associated with CP

        -  Monitor the prevalence of CP across the country

        -  Provide a platform for subject recruitment for population-based research on CP
