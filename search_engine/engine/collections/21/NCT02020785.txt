      single-center, randomized, double-blind, two-period cross-over study that examined the effect
      of higher vs. lower phosphorus intake for 3 week periods, achieved by addition of
      commercially available diet beverages and breakfast bars to diet on albuminuria and
      fibroblast growth factor 23, in adults with presumed early chronic kidney disease (estimated
      glomerular filtration rate >= 45 ml/min/1.73m2; and urine albumin/creatinine ratio >=17 mg/g
      for men or >=25 mg/g for women).
