      Primary

        -  Determine the tumor response rate in patients with colorectal cancer and hepatic and/or
           pulmonary metastases treated with cetuximab and FOLFIRI chemotherapy comprising
           irinotecan hydrochloride, leucovorin calcium, and fluorouracil as first-line therapy.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the rate of resectability in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the overall and disease-free survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the tolerability of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive cetuximab IV over 60-120 minutes on days 1 and 8. Patients also receive
      FOLFIRI chemotherapy comprising irinotecan hydrochloride IV over 90 minutes and leucovorin
      calcium IV over 2 hours on day 1 and fluorouracil IV continuously over 48 hours on days 1 and
      2. Patients with 7/6 or 7/7 genotypes also receive filgrastim (G-CSF) as primary prophylaxis
      (patients with 6/6 genotypes receive G-CSF as secondary prophylaxis). Treatment repeats every
      2 weeks for up to 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Within 6 weeks after the completion of cetuximab and FOLFIRI chemotherapy, patients with
      responding disease undergo surgical resection of visceral metastases.
