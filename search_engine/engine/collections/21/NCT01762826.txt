      pregnant non-obese patient with different stereoisomears of inositol supply. Dietary control
      and placebo or inositol steroisomears were administered starting at the enrolling time (first
      fasting oral glucose above 92 mg%; usually before 20 weeks gestations') till the delivery
      and/or pregnancy end/termination. Oral glucose tolerance test results at 24-28 weeks'
