      groups; half of the subjects will be provided with an instruction sheet on how best to take
      photographs of skin conditions with their mobile devices (study group) and half will not be
      provided this instruction sheet (control group). Photographs will be evaluated for image
      quality and to provide a diagnosis (See attached forms including Photograph Quality Rating
      Scale).
