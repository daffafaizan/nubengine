      head. The training of the needed skills is made conventionally in most cases. In such the
      training sessions students examine each other after dilating one pupil. Examining of patients
      with pathologies is very important, but in many cases not very easy without any experience.

      Simulators are of growing impact to teach diagnostic or surgical skills. A digital simulator
      with virtual reality technology is used to teach the skills to unexperienced examiners. The
      head-eye-hand-coordination can be trained without any stress.
