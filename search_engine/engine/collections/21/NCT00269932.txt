      and effectiveness of 500 mg of levofloxacin (once daily for 5 - 7 days) compared with 250 mg
      of cefuroxime axetil (every 12 hours for 10 days) in adults with chronic bronchitis
      experiencing rapid onset of severe worsening of symptoms caused by bacteria. The study
      consists of 3 visits: one visit for screening and enrollment, and 2 visits for assessment of
      safety and effectiveness (one visit on Days 3 - 5 of the study and one visit [post-therapy] 5
      - 7 days after the last dose of the study drug). The total duration of patient participation
      in the study is approximately 2 weeks. The primary efficacy assessment is the clinical
      response 5 - 7 days after the last dose of study drug, (categorized as cured, improved, or
      failed) based upon changes in signs and symptoms. Safety evaluations (incidence of adverse
      events, physical examination, laboratory tests) are performed throughout the study. The study
      hypothesis is that treatment with levofloxacin is at least as effective and as well tolerated
      as treatment with cefuroxime axetil in adult patients with chronic bronchitis experiencing
      sudden worsening of symptoms caused by bacterial infection. Levofloxacin 500 mg by mouth once
      daily for 5 - 7 days, or cefuroxime axetil 250 mg by mouth every 12 hours for 10 days
