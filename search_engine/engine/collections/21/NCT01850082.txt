      study. Cardiac Surgery Programs at Veterans Affairs Medical Centers (VAMC) with expertise in
      performing both EVH and OVH will be invited to participate in the study. Subjects requiring
      elective or urgent CABG using cardiopulmonary bypass with use of at least one SVG will be
      screened for enrollment using established inclusion/exclusion criteria. Enrolled Subjects
      will be randomized to one of the two arms (EVH or OVH) after an experienced vein harvester is
      identified and assigned. Intraoperative assessments will be collected and post-operative
      assessments will be completed 24 hours post-surgery. Additional assessments will be completed
      at the time of discharge or at the 30-day post-surgery date if the subject is still in the
      hospital. Assessment of leg wound complications will be completed at the time of discharge
      and at six-week post-surgery. Telephone follow-ups will occur at three-month interval
      post-surgery until the participating sites are decommissioned at the end of the trial period
      (which would be approximately 4.5 years after the site initiations). For long-term MACE
      outcomes, passive follow up for MACE events using VA databases (CPRS, VASQIP) will be
      performed centrally by the Study Chair's office for another 2 years.
