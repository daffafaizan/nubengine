      who had traumatic brain injury (TBI) in 1 year, 5 years, 10 years and 15 years ago.
      Age-gender-matched controls without TBI will be recruited.

      The main aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of TBI on amyloid accumulation in the
      brain. In the mean time, we also will test the effects of APOE genotypes in amyloid
      accumulation after TBI and the clinical relevants, in terms of cognitive function.
