      pharmaceutical care, with mixed results. It is not yet clear which elements exactly
      contribute to the success of these projects and to implementation of pharmaceutical care.

      One of the subjects to which attention is paid in community pharmacies, is the undesirable
      long-term use of benzodiazepines. Treatment methods for discontinuation of long-term
      benzodiazepine use have been studied rather extensively. A simple patient-directed
      discontinuation letter proved to be effective in several studies.

      Comparison: a minimal intervention group (pharmacists carrying out the intervention guided by
      a manual only) compared to a maximal intervention group (pharmacists receiving a manual, a
      training aimed at better cooperation and communication with family practitioners and some
      support in the management of the project).
