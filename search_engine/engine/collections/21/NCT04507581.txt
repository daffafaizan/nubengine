    
      Eligible, children, with parental written informed consent, scheduled for a cerebral magnetic
      resonance image (MRI) will receive an intravenous anaesthesia using a Propofol infusion of 10
      mg/kg/h. At the Bern Children's Hospital all children will be premedicated with Midazolam
      rectal/oral 0.5 mg/kg or Dexmedetomidine nasal 2 mcg/kg 20 minutes before the beginning of
      the procedure Eligible children will be prepared for procedure according to the local SOPs of
      the paediatric anaesthesia departments. Mandatory monitoring will consist of: SpO2, HR, NIBP.
      An iv-line for drugs injection will be placed.

      Induction of anaesthesia: after iv-line placement a bolus of Propofol of 2 mg/kg followed by
      a continuous infusion of 10 mg/kg/h will be applied. Administration of low-flow oxygen for
      all children (0.3 l/kg/min) via Microstream® Smart CapnoLine® paediatric cannula (Philips
      Healthcare, Amsterdam, Netherlands). This cannula allows to measure the etCO2.

      In case of extremely agitated child an inhalative induction may be performed. This technique
      represent the actual standard of care and is not associated with increased risks because of
      the study.

      Before induction of the anaesthesia, before the radiological procedure when the induction is
      terminated, after the termination of the radiological procedure, before transport to the Post
      anaesthesia Care Unite (PACU), and before the discharge from the PACU after 2 hours of
      monitoring ventilation distribution changes by thoracic electrical impedance tomography are
      measured (each measurement will last 1 min).
