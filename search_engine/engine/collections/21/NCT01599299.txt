      and venous access. Most often the right internal jugular vein (RIJV) is used. The RIJV is
      preferred over the left-sided internal jugular vein (LIJV) because cannulation of the LIJV is
      more difficult and associated with a higher complication rate(1). A possible explanation for
      the higher complication rate can be explained by the difference in diameter between the RIJV
      and the LIJV. It has been demonstrated that large vessels are easier to catheterize than
      small ones.

      Data suggest that the internal jugular veins are most often asymmetric but data are limited.
      Until now, there is one small prospective study in which 80 ICU patients where examined (30
      patients were mechanically ventilated) which showed an asymmetry in 62,5% and a dominant RIJV
      in 68% and a smaller study performed by Lobato and colleagues in which 50 healthy patients
      were examined. They measured the cross-sectional areas of the internal jugular veins. They
      showed that in 80% the RIJV was greater than the LIJV. Two CT studies has been done so far.
      In 2009 Tarti√®re and colleagues carried out an observational study in 190 patients. All
      patients were in the supine position, neutral head position an spontaneous breathing. During
      the CT patients were asked to hold there breath. The study showed that the diameter and
      cross-sectional area of the RIJV were significantly greater than those of the LIJV. A smaller
      retrospective CT-study (88 patients) performed by Lim et al in 2006 showed a larger RIJV in
      79,5% compared to the LIJV.

      Until now, there are no data known about the difference between the RIJV and LIJV in
      preoperative mechanical ventilated patients when ultrasound is used.
