      patients are randomized into HIPEC group and control group. In HIPEC group, the patients
      undergo neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by radical gastrectomy with D2 lymphadenectomy and
      HIPEC with paclitaxel and 5-Fu. Patients in the control group just undergo neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy followed by radical gastrectomy with D2 lymphadenectomy. Patients in both groups
      receive postoperative chemotherapy (6 circles together with neoadjuvant chemotherapy) and are
      followed up for 5 years or until death.

      The trial is designed as a prospective, randomized, open and parallel group study.
