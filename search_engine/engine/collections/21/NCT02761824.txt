      the summer of 2012, 2013, and 2014 for women diagnosed with cancer. Each camp was held in a
      different geographical location: rural (Renovo, PA), suburban (Gilda's Club in Warminster,
      PA), MD Anderson of Camden, and urban (University of the Sciences with the Cancer Support
      Community of Philadelphia). The focus of this programming was to allow women to engage in
      activities they may not be engaged in since the diagnosis of cancer and to provide them with
      opportunities to socially interact and communicate with individuals who may have encountered
      the same difficulties as them. Quality of life information was collected before, during and
      after implementation of the activity program. The main objective was to demonstrate improved
      life satisfaction (with evidenced gathered at three consecutive periods and geographical
      locations through Quality of Life surveys). 77 women were recruited over a three year period.
      6 dropped out and 71 completed the entire study.
