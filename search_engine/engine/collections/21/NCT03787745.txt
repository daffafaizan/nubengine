      effective, but restoration of blood flow may itself jeopardize the myocardium, a phenomenon
      known as reperfusion injury.

      In ischemic postconditioning (iPOST), repetitive interruptions of blood flow to the injured
      region applied after initial reperfusion, has been shown favorable with different modalities
      such as biomarkers, echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance.

      However, the largest trial to date (DANAMI3-iPOST) failed to show clinical favor of iPOST
      when compared to conventional PCI. Importantly, however, in DANAMI3-iPOST thrombectomy was
      allowed and this might have impaired postconditioning, since thrombectomy itself creates
      reperfusion and thus reperfusion damage. Analysis of the fraction of DANAMI3-iPOST patients
      not undergoing thrombectomy showed a remarkable 45% reduction in death and heart failure in
      favor of postconditioning.

      iPOST2 will investigate in a randomized, prospective and adequately powered trial the effect
      of iPOST without thrombectomy compared to conventional PCI on the development of heart
      failure and death in STEMI patients.
