      Declaration of Helsinki. For all patients after taking signed informed consent ,
      transcervical hysteroscopic cannulation of the proximal one centimeter of fallopian tubes
      with hydrosalpinx, will be done using a 4 Fr, 42cm long, polyethylene ureteric catheter,
      where 0.5 ml of Iso Amyl-2-cyanoacrylate (AMCRYLATEÂ®) will be injected.

      All the surgical procedures will be performed without anesthesia, only premedication with an
      NSAID (e.g. NaproxenR) is given orally one hour before the procedure.

      Each patient will be under close observation for the first 24 hours postprocedure for any
      signs of inflammation as abdominal pain, tenderness or fever and for the vital data.

      Hysterosalpingography will be done for all patients 0ne and 3 months postinjection to confirm
      tubal occlusion prior to IVF.
