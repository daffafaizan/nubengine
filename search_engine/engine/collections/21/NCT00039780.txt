      treatment for cancer. Chemotherapy induced toxicities can adversely impact the quality of
      life and the ability of patients to continue treatment for their cancer. One such toxicity
      associated with the use of paclitaxel (TaxolÂ®) is peripheral neurotoxicity.

      Paclitaxel is an active drug in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer as first-line
      treatment and in patients with recurrent or refractory disease, including patients who have
      failed to respond to previous anthracycline therapy. Recent studies with paclitaxel using a
      weekly schedule of administration have demonstrated higher tumor response rates and disease
      free survival accompanied by a shift in the frequency of certain toxicities, increased dose
      intensity and a potential means to improve the treatment schedule of paclitaxel for improved
      patient benefit.

      Paclitaxel induced neurotoxicity remains an important problem that limits the ability to
      improve the schedule of administration of this drug. To date, there is no effective or FDA
      approved therapy to prevent the development of or reduce the frequency or severity of
      paclitaxel-induced neurotoxicity.

      BNP7787 is an investigational new drug that is undergoing development for chemoprotection of
      platinum and taxane associated common clinical toxicities, particularly the prevention of
      chemotherapy-induced neurotoxicity.

      In this Phase 3 clinical trial the safety and effectiveness of BNP7787 in preventing or
      mitigating the frequency, severity, worsening of grade, time to onset, duration and
      discontinuation of therapy due to paclitaxel-induced neurotoxicity will be assessed in
      patients with metastatic breast cancer.
