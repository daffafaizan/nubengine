      stimulation among essential tremor (ET) patients with a chronic history of continuous
      stimulation. The trial is 10 weeks in length with clinical evaluations (about 60 minutes)
      performed on weeks 1, 2, 6, and 10, and phone interviews (about 5 minutes) on weeks 3, 4, 5,
      7, 8, and 9. The study includes outcome measures of tremor, stimulation-induced side effects,
      sleep quality, and voltage threshold for optimal tremor control and sustained side-effects.
