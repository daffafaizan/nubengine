      a critical component of maintaining renal and urinary health. This monitoring is currently
      done by in-office urodynamics testing (UDS). This testing is done intermittently, leaving
      open the possibility of worsening of bladder function and renal deterioration between testing
      sessions.

      This study utilizes a novel pressure monitoring device which is portable and attaches to the
      end of a standard urinary catheter. The investigators will be investigating if this device
      can be used by patients or their caregivers in a home setting.

      This study will enroll patients with neurogenic bladder that currently perform clean
      intermittent catheterization on a daily basis as part of their regular care. The patients
      will be asked to use the device at least twice a day for two weeks.
