      patient delivered at the authors'institution. In the event of delivery at distant locations,
      patients were contacted by telephone to obtain delivery and neonatal information. Patients
      are randomly assigned 1:1 to different intervention groups by parallel design. Chorionicity
      was assessed by the referring physicians during the Ô¨Årst trimester. All patients underwent
      comprehensive ultrasound examination to confirm the fetal diagnosis, chorionicity,
      amnionicity and cervical length upon arrival at Peking University Third Hospital.
      Monochorionicity was confirmed through the ultrasound findings of a single placenta, a thin
      intervening membrane, lack of a lambda sign and concordance for fetal gender. Patients were
      counseled about the risks and benefits of expectant management vs. selective reduction.
      Written informed consent was obtained. Statistical analysis was performed using the
      statistical software Statistical Product and Service Solutions(SPSS), for comparison of entry
      and outcome variables using the chi-square test, Fisher's exact test and the Student's
      t-test, where appropriate. P < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.
