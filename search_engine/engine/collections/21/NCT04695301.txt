      clinical, functional and social aspects in these patients affected by COVID-19 and to propose
      the continuity of specific care after hospital discharge with a physical rehabilitation
      program through a digital platform, remotely for a period of 3 months. The proposed
      hypothesis is that patients convalescing from COVID-19 and undergoing the rehabilitation
      program will have a gain in functional skills and quality of life. The professional team
      involved in this study will be responsible for managing, monitoring and evaluating the
      participating patients and monitoring the performance of the proposed functional exercises.
