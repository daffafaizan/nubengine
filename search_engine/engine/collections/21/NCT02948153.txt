      not well understood but probably is related to the innate impaired immunity, particularly
      with "toll-like receptors" (TLR) and secretory mucin (MUC).

      Objectives 1) Define the clinical and inflammatory phenotype of asthma with bronchial
      hypersecretion of mucus. 2) Compare the type of mucin present in induced sputum (IS) of
      patients with and without bronchial hypersecretion. 3) Determine the expression of TLRs in
      the IS and in the peripheral blood of asthmatics with and without bronchial hypersecretion.

      Method: Cross-sectional study which included 43 asthmatic patients, 19 with and 24 without
      bronchial hypersecretion. All patients underwent the following: IS, spirometry, fractional
      exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), prick test, total IgE and blood albumin. Analysis of mucins
      (MUC2, MUC5AC, MUC5B and MUC1) was determined by ELISA and expression of TLR2 and TLR4 by
      flow cytometry. The level of asthma control was determined by the asthma control test
      questionnaire (ACT) and quality of life was assessed by the MiniAQLQ questionnaire.
