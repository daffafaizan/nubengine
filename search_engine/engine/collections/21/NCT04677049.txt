      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD dose will be prescribed to patients during the
      Phase II stage.

      During the Phase I study a sample of blood at baseline, at each level dose of Niacin CRT™,
      and every two months during the maintenance phase while on Niacin CRTTM will be sent to a lab
      to evaluate the peripheral activity of Niacin CRT™ in innate immune system cells. These
      samples will be taken at the time of routine standard of care lab work.

      Based on prior clinical trials evaluating niacin extended release formulation for the
      management of dyslipidaemias there is vast experience on dose escalation of niacin. One of
      the main side effects is flushing that is ameliorated by escalating doses in intervals no
      shorter than 4 weeks and usually decreases with time.

      Following this schema, there is no increase in dose coinciding with TMZ while administered in
      a 5/28 days schedule (given daily for 5 days of each 28-day cycle). This will not only
      improve tolerance but also will allow us to differentiate potential adverse events from
      chemotherapy from the ones from Niacin CRT™.
