    
      Primary objectives:

        1. Establish a human challenge model of S. sonnei 53G infection using a lyophilized
           formulation of the challenge strain.

        2. Identify a dose of lyophilized S. sonnei 53G that induces the primary outcome in
           approximately 60% of subjects with no adverse safety concerns.

      Secondary objectives:

        1. Estimate quantitative shedding and basic immunogenicity of the challenge strain.

        2. Collect and archive blood and fecal samples for systems biology, microbiome, and other
           omics-based work to be conducted under a separate research protocol in future studies.
