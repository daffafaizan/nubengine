    
      Enrolled participants were divided into 2 groups, with 30 participants in each group.

      Group 1: This group was randomized into a 2-way crossover design with an added third period.
      These participants received single administrations (day 1 dosing only) of Zegerid Powder for
      Oral Suspension, and Prilosec OTC (both at a 20 mg omeprazole dose), in a 2-way randomized
      order, with a minimum of a 2-week washout period between treatment legs. Following completion
      of the 2-way crossover study, and a subsequent washout period (minimum of 2 weeks), all
      participants then received a single administration of sodium bicarbonate (at same dose as
      contained in Zegerid Powder for Oral Suspension) in Period 3. This group underwent a 24-hour
      intragastric pH study on each of the 3 dosing occasions.

      Group 2: This group was randomized into a 2-way crossover design in which they received 7
      days administration of Zegerid Powder for Oral Suspension and Prilosec OTC tablets,
      respectively. As with the prior group, there was a minimum of a 2-week washout period between
      treatment legs. Participants assigned to this treatment group also underwent 24-hour
      intragastric pH recordings on the days on which they received their 1st and last (7th) dose
      of the two treatment drugs.

      In addition to the above detailed procedures, all participants (both groups) underwent a
      24-hour baseline intragastric pH study prior to starting their randomized treatments. This
      study design enabled all 60 participants to be evaluated for effects of the first dose of
      Prilosec OTC and Zegerid Powder for Oral Suspension on change in intragastric pH during the
      subsequent 24-hour period following the first dose.
