      treatment of locally advanced breast cancer has become a standard therapy. Results from
      neoadjuvant trials have shown that pathological complete response (pCR) is an independent
      predictor of outcome. Docetaxel was introduced into clinical practice in the early 1990s and
      has demonstrated good activity in the adjuvant and metastatic settings. Both TC and TAC are
      effective regimens in the adjuvant setting. The most optimal regimen in the neoadjuvant
      treatment is however unknown. This is especially true in triple-negative or HER2 positive
      breast cancer. This study will evaluate the pCR rate of TAC and TC as neoadjuvant treatment
      for triple-negative or HER2 positive breast cancer.
