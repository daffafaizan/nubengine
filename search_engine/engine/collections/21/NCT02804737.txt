      in thirteen individuals in their lifetime. Colonoscopy is the most used procedure to allow
      gastroenterologist to identify colorectal malignancies or precancerous lesions at an earlier
      stage, which affords a greater chance for cure. However, low bowel cleanliness hinders polyp
      detection rates and therefore colonoscopy effectiveness. In the past, the majority of the
      studies have focused on pharmacological factors to optimize bowel preparation quality.
      Recently, the non-pharmacological factors have been found to have significant increases in
      bowel preparation quality. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the
      GI clinic's currently used web-based instructions at St. Paul's Hospital.
