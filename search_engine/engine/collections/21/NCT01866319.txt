      treatment. Participants with Stable Disease (SD) or better will then proceed to Post
      Treatment Follow-up. All efficacy and safety analyses will be based on the primary
      pembrolizumab course.

      Participants who experience disease progression during the Post Treatment Follow-up will be
      eligible for a Second Course of pembrolizumab treatment for up to 1 additional year. With
      Amendment 05, all Second Course participants will be treated with a fixed dose of
      pembrolizumab 200 mg Q3W. With Amendment 06, after the study has achieved its key objectives
      or the study has ended, participants will be discontinued from this study and enrolled in an
      extension study to continue protocol-defined assessments and treatment.
