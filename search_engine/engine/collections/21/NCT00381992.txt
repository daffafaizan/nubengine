      Specific Aim 1. To perform focus groups and in-depth interviews with long-haul truck drivers
      to guide development of both a behavioral risk assessment instrument and an acceptable
      HIV/STI screening protocol for long-haul truckers.

      Specific Aim 2. To perform in-depth interviews with trucking industry executives to determine
      barriers to routine HIV/STI assessment and screening of their employees.

      Specific Aim 3. To perform a pilot phase with a subsample of long-haul truck drivers
      characterized by the following steps: TTM-based "cognitive interviews" (N=5); pilot testing
      of the survey and biomedical screening protocol (N=15); and a follow-up focus group (N=8)

      Specific Aim 4. To assess a sample of (N=300) truck drivers for general health and sexual
      risk behaviors using the adapted theory-based survey and to determine the prevalence of
      hepatitis B, hepatitis C, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes and obesity, HIV, N.
      gonorrhoeae, and C. trachomatis
