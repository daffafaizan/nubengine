      needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) is often a luxury. In addition, preparation of multiple slides
      for a fine needle aspiration can be time-consuming for the gastroenterologist who waits for
      verbal feedback on the adequacy of the specimen. Often, a timely diagnosis is needed to
      direct patient management. Currently, there is no established standard of care for EUS-FNA
      preparation. A liquid based cytologic fixative preparation (Thin-prep or CytoLyt), is a
      well-established process used by pathologists for evaluating cervical smears. It has not yet
      been adopted or accepted for EUS-FNA. This method combines multiple aspirates on a single
      slide, thereby decreasing the number of slides that need to be processed and interpreted by
      the pathologist
