    
      Objectives:

      To obtain blood samples from patients with prostate cancer for genotyping analyses.

      Eligibility:

      All patients seen in the NCI prostate cancer clinic are eligible.

      Design:

      Patients with a prior diagnosis of prostate cancer will be evaluated in the GMB Clinic, NCI.

      Blood samples will be collected after the patient signs the protocol consent form. In
      general, blood will be collected one time for this study. Extra samples may be requested if
      the original sample was not enough. The additional sample can range from one to two tubes of
      blood (approximately 2-3 teaspoons total). Genomic DNA and white blood cells will each be
      extracted from these samples to be utilized for genotyping and establishment of individual
      cell lines.

      Genetic variance will be correlated with prostate cancer prognosis (i.e. time from diagnosis
      to death) and prognostic indicators (i.e. histological tumor grade).

      Healthy controls will not be compared and no correlations will be made with prostate cancer
      susceptibility.
