      Bevacizumab provides a modest survival improvement when added to chemotherapy and VEGFR
      tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been associated with minimal efficacy as single agents and
      increased toxicity when combined with chemotherapy. We postulate that the response rates and
      survival may be improved with a better selection of patients based on abnormalities of the
      targets for the drugs. According to the preliminary data from the cancer genome atlas (TCGA),
      the targets of pazopanib are altered in 28% of patients with adenocarcinoma and 24% of
      patients with squamous cell lung cancer. Since, despite the molecular selection prior to
      treatment, only a small percentage of patients will benefit from the treatment, we plan to
      further investigate those patients with whole exome sequencing in both the pre-treatment
      samples to identify the predictors for response and at the time of progression, with repeated
      biopsy, in an attempt to identify the predictors for secondary resistance. By identifying
      more reliable predictors for response to pazopanib, our study may help to establish its role
      in the treatment of NSCLC.
