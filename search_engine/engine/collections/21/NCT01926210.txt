      protocol arms,i.e, mild ovarian stimulation(experimental arm) or controlled ovarian
      stimulation(control arm). In experimental arm, patients will received letrozole 5mg per day
      from cycle day 3 to 7 and recombinant follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) 150 international
      unit (IU) on day 4 and 6. The dose of recombinant FSH is adjusted according to the ovarian
      response and the gonadotropin-releasing hormone(GnRH)antagonist(Cetrotide) 0.25mg per day is
      administrated when the estradiol level reaches 200 pg/ml and the serum luteinizing hormone
      （LH）level rises above 2 times of basal LH level. In control arm,patients will be stimulated
      with short-acting GnRH agonist long protocol. After complete downregulation is achieved
      through GnRH-agonist, recombinant FSH 300 IU/d is given for 5 days, then the dose of
      recombinant FSH is adjusted according to ovarian response.

      The clinical and ongoing pregnancy rate and other secondary outcome parameters are compared
      between these two groups.
