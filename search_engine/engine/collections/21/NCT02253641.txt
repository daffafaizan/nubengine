      (e.g. diet and exercise) among African American women. African American women consistently
      lose less weight than their Caucasian counterparts in weight loss interventions. One reason
      for this disparity may be due to the failure of most weight loss interventions to address
      stress management adequately or in a culturally competent way.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of a stress-focused tailored weight
      loss intervention compared to a standard weight loss intervention on weight loss in severely
      obese (BMI > 40.0) African American women. The stress-focused weight loss intervention will
      incorporate stress management content throughout the entire intervention and will include
      content that is culturally tailored. The standard weight loss intervention will cover stress
      management techniques during one of the 14 sessions and the material will be more generic in
      nature (e.g. not culturally tailored).
