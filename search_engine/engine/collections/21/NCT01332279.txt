      I. To establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and safety of RAD001 given concurrently with
      external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) in the re-irradiation setting for head and neck
      cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Obtain preliminary data on response rate. II. Determine progression-free survival at 6 and
      12 months and overall survival.

      III. Perform correlative studies to evaluate and characterize biological features of
      recurrent or second primary tumors, as well as to follow surrogates of mammalian target of
      rapamycin (mTOR), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and hypoxia-inducible factor
      1-alpha (HIF-1Î±) inhibition.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of everolimus and erlotinib hydrochloride.

      Patients receive RAD001 orally (PO) and erlotinib hydrochloride PO once daily (QD). Treatment
      continues for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Patients also undergo EBRT twice daily (BID) 5 days a week for 5 weeks.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 2 years.
