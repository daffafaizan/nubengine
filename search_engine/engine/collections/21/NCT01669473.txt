    
      The strategy takes advantage of health information technology to assist patients with
      Medication Therapy Management (MTM) tasks, intervening with a set of low-literacy MTM printed
      tools triggered by the Electronic Health Record (EHR) in a primary health care clinic.
      Patients at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) Medicine Clinic who are randomized to
      the intervention arm will be given three printed tools, one when they check in to the clinic
      and the other two when they check out. The Electronic Health Record (EHR) triggers the
      printing of these tools, and the receptionist hands them to the patient. Patients receive
      either English or Spanish language materials depending on the preference determined in the
      screening process and stored in their EHR.

      Specific Aims

        1. Refine and Field Test an EHR strategy for generating and distributing low literacy
           prescription information for English and Spanish-speaking patients

        2. Assess the process of the EHR intervention and its fidelity for providing prescription
           information for patients at the point of prescribing and dispensing medications.

        3. Evaluate the effectiveness of the EHR strategy to improve medication understanding,
           reconciliation, regimen consolidation, and adherence compared to standard care.

      In addition, we will be powered to also investigate our strategy's impact on intermediary
      clinical outcomes including systolic blood pressure, HbA1c, and LDL cholesterol.
