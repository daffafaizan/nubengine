      complete dentures before relining with soft denture liners and then with the same dentures
      after relining with soft denture liners. The study sample included 50 males completely
      edentulous contributors, All patients were controlled type 2 diabetes during the study
      period. All selected patients had previously constructed and used conventional heat cured
      acrylic resin complete dentures for not less than two years with history of retention and
      stability problems of mandibular dentures. Mandibular complete dentures had received the
      essential prosthetic adjustments aiming to achieve optimal retention, maximum stability and
      the necessary occlusal contacts. The first occlusal parameters were recorded before denture
      relining. Relining of mandibular dentures was performed and Patients were comfortably using
      their relined mandibular complete dentures for at least three months and the retention and
      stability of the conventional dentures were assessed before second recording of occlusal
      parameter. The evaluation of occlusal force distribution was carried out with the aid of
      T-Scan device (Tekscan Inc., South Boston, MA, USA). The first record was recorded before
      denture relining and the second record was three months after denture relining
