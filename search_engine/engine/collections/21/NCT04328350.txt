      study objectives. AYA ages 15 to 22 will be recruited to participate. Two cohorts will be
      enrolled: AYA who are on-treatment, 2-12 months post-diagnosis; and AYA who are off-therapy 1
      to 4 years. AYA will complete questionnaires assessing peer versus family connectedness,
      peer/romantic competence, coping, distress, social support, and quality of life. A
      study-specific needs assessment regarding interest in social functioning interventions will
      also be completed. If a caregiver is available, they will be asked to complete questionnaires
      regarding family functioning and quality of life. A subset of 50 AYA (30 on-therapy/20
      off-therapy) will be interviewed to further explore aspects of peer/family connectedness and
      intervention interest. Analyses will focus on describing how aspects of social experiences
      (peer connectedness, social competence, peer versus parent attachment) differ based on
      treatment status (on versus off therapy) and developmental stage (high school versus
      post-high school), as well as potential moderators.

      Two cohorts of AYA with cancer, ages 15-22, will be identified and recruited for the study:
      1) patients on-therapy, 2-12 months from diagnosis; and 2) patients off- therapy 1-4 years,
      and â‰¥13 years of age at diagnosis. AYA from all diagnostic groups - brain tumor, solid tumor,
      leukemia/lymphoma - and developmental periods - high school, post-high school - will be
      targeted, and care will be taken to ensure a representative sample.
