      prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission. TDF has been associated to renal function
      abnormalities both in macaques and HIV-infected adults and infants. Therefore concerns have
      been raised about its renal safety in exposed infants of women on Option B+. Data for HEU is
      sparse and routine measures of renal function (creatinine, proteinuria), may not be
      appropriate to detect TDF-associated renal injury early. The goal of our study is to assess
      whether TDF use in pregnancy and breastfeeding affects the function of the kidney function of
      the child. Pregnant women who consent during their first antenatal consultation to take
      antiretroviral drugs for PMTCT after testing positive, will be enrolled and followed till
      birth, for adherence using HPLC. Their terms infants who are HIV negative by DNA PCR at 6
      weeks (HEU), will have urine collected at 1.5, 3, 6, 9 months. Using appropriate and more
      sensitive markers (RBP4, KIM1, NAG, β2M), proximal tubular function will be assessed in 159
      HEU infants and same number of controls. Nutritional status and drug history data will be
      collected for both mother and child. RBP, KIM1, β2M will be measured using XMAP assay while
      ELISA will be used for NAG according to manufacturer recommendations. Creatinine, phosphates
      and urinary tract infection will be measured using standard methods. Values of these markers
      will be compared between the 2 groups. Results will confirm/infirm renal safety of TDF in
      pregnancy, improve prevention of long term renal injury through early detection, contribute
      to promote development of routine rapid diagnostic tests for acute renal tubular injury
