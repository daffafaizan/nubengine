      the question of prognostic factors for a successful (i.e. complete) debulking for recurrence.
      That way, a hypothesis for a score with 3 factors could be developed:

        -  PS ECOG = 0

        -  tumor-free after primary surgery (if unknown: FIGO I/II)

        -  Ascites < 500 ml.

      The goal of this study is to evaluate in a prospective multicentre setting, to what extent
      this retrospectively defined AGO-score has predictive validity. The criterion aimed at is
      therefore the rate of complete tumor resections if the three score characteristics are
      present in invasive epithelial platinum-sensitive ovarian-, fallopian tube- or primary
      peritoneal cancer. This study will be the second in a series of three: (1) hypothesis
      building for a potential predictive score for resectability, (2) prospective confirmation of
      the AGO-score, and (3) application of the AGO-score as inclusion criteria for eligible
      patients in whom a formal comparison of the role of secondary debulking of relapsed ovarian
      cancer could be performed.
