    
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety
      and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a
      specific disease. "Investigational" means that the drug is being studied.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved durvalumab or tremelimumab
      as a treatment for any disease.

      In this research study, the investigators are studying if the study drug can help your cancer
      compared to the usual approach to treating malignant pleural mesothelioma . Durvalumab is a
      drug that blocks a protein often produced by cancer cells or surrounding cells to suppress
      immune cells from attacking cancer cells. Tremelimumab blocks a receptor on immune cells that
      normally suppresses immune attack. These two study drugs have been used alone for
      mesothelioma but the combination has not yet been tested for mesothelioma. These two drugs
      have been used for cancers such as melanoma and have been effective than using either drug
      alone.
