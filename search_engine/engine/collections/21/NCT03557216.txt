      of retrospective studies to reliably assess the global prevalence of advanced colon neoplasia
      (ACN) and the difference in prevalence among populations with complicated and uncomplicated
      acute diverticulitis diagnosed by computed tomography. Another objective is to assess the
      diagnostic prediction of computed tomography to detect ACN in acute diverticulitis. It also
      aims to assess the safety and quality of colonoscopy in a patient recently diagnosed with
      acute diverticulitis. Finally, it aims to study whether other diagnostic tools such as the
      presence of clinical risk symptoms or the performance of fecal biological tests could help in
      narrowing the indication of colonoscopy in this clinical scenario.
