      symptom of many psychiatric illnesses. The stop signal paradigm, which involves withholding a
      prepotent motor response to a signal, has proved useful in assessing this deficit in children
      with a range of disorders, particularly attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). In
      order to adapt the paradigm for use in fMRI studies, it is important to address two
      methodological issues: 1) the substitution of a visual stop signal for the more
      commonly-employed auditory stop signal, and 2) the fact that, on the traditional stop task
      (in which the subject withholds a motor response to the stop signal), correct trials do not
      involve a motor response whereas incorrect trials do. The latter problem can be addressed
      using the stop-change task (in which the subject executes alternative motor responses to the
      stop and go signals). The first aim of this protocol is to compare behavioral data from the
      stop and stop-change tasks in control adults, control children, and children with ADHD. These
      data will be used to test the hypotheses that, on each of these paradigms, children with ADHD
      will show an inhibitory deficit compared to control children, and control children will show
      an inhibitory deficit compared to control adults. The second aim of the protocol is to
      conduct a pilot fMRI study of the stop and stop-change tasks in control adults. The study has
      an event-related design and will test the hypotheses that ventral prefrontal activation will
      be greater during successful than unsuccessful stop (or stop-change) trials, and that stop
      and stop-change trials will be associated with more anterior cingulate and right inferior
      frontal activation than will go trials.
