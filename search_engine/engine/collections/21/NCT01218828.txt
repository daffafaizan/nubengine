      Subjects will be randomized to one of two hydration protocols:

        1. normal saline at 3 mL/kg for one hour prior to contrast exposure and 1.5 mL/kg/hr during
           and for four hours post procedure.

        2. normal saline at 3 mL/kg for one hour prior to contrast exposure and then the fluid rate
           would be adjusted according to the left ventricular end diastolic pressure (LVEDP). The
           fluid rate based upon the LVEDP measurement is maintained during the procedure and for
           four hours post procedure. The LVEDP hydration strategy follows: (2A) < 13 mmHg, 5
           mL/kg/hr during and for four hours post procedure. (2B) 13-18 mmHg, 3 mL/kg during and
           for four hours post procedure. (2C) > 18 mmHg, 1.5 mL/kg during and four hours post
           procedure.

      Renal function assessment will be made using standard laboratory measures post procedure.
