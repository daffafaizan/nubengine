      Primary

        -  Determine the efficacy and toxicity of vinblastine, cyclophosphamide, procarbazine,
           prednisolone, etoposide, mitoxantrone, and bleomycin in older patients with Hodgkin's
           lymphoma.

        -  Determine whether the application of the Hasenclever prognostic index is valid in these
           patients at diagnosis.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study.

        -  Chemotherapy: Patients receive vinblastine IV and cyclophosphamide IV on day 1; oral
           procarbazine and oral prednisolone on days 1-5; oral etoposide on days 15-19; and
           mitoxantrone IV and bleomycin IV on day 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days, in the
           absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, for a total of 3 courses in
           patients with early (stage IA or IIA) disease or 6 courses in patients with advanced
           (stage IB or IIB-IV) disease.

        -  Radiotherapy: Patients with early stage disease receive involved-field radiotherapy.
           Patients with advanced stage disease receive radiotherapy limited to sites of initial
           bulky disease or residual disease. Radiotherapy begins 4 weeks after the completion of
           chemotherapy.

      Patients are followed monthly for 3 months, every 3 months for 6 months, and then annually
      thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 150 patients will be accrued for this study within 36 months.
