      Iron Fishâ„¢) compared to traditional oral iron supplementation methods among preschool aged
      children in a Dominican community with a high prevalence of anemia (> 50%). Data will be
      collected to characterize the natural history of iron deficiency and anemia in pre-school
      aged children in a Dominican community. The study will involve a randomized control trial to
      assess the primary objective: children > 1 year and < 5 years of age will be randomized into
      two study arms: LIF plus citrus (LIF arm) versus standard iron-supplementation (enhanced
      standard of care). Participants enrolled in the both study arms will have study labs drawn
      every 3, 6, and 12-months (hemoglobin, serum ferritin, c-reactive protein) to assess the
      natural history of iron deficiency in these children. Concomitant to study labs,
      parents/guardians will be surveyed on acceptability, compliance, and barriers to use of their
      assigned iron supplementation method.

      Primary study outcomes are the change in hemoglobin within the LIF group and then difference
      in change in hemoglobin between study arms over a 12-month study period. Secondary outcomes
      include changes in serum ferritin within and between study arms and exploring the
      relationship between changes in hemoglobin, serum ferritin, and C-reactive protein
