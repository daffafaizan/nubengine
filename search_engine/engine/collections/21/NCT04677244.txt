    
      The study will include 42 evaluable patients suspected of having pancreatic cancer and for
      whom an echo-endoscopic biopsy (EUS-FNA) and/or biliary drainage is planned.

      In these patients, a 6 ml blood sample will be taken from the portal vein before and after
      the echo-endoscopic biopsy of the pancreatic mass to determine:

        -  the level of circulating tumor cells (CTC) per milliliter of blood,

        -  cytological characteristics of CTCs (isolated, clustered, giant, and clustered including
           other cell types).

      A peripheral blood sample will also be taken to evaluate peripheral CTC levels and
      cytological characteristics before and after biopsy, as well as one month after biopsy.

      Patients will be evaluated every 6 months as part of their follow-up to assess the
      progression of their pathology and morbidity.
