      machine that assists breathing) in patients admitted to hospital with a sudden worsening of
      their existing breathing insufficiency, including an increase of carbon dioxide in the blood
      (hypercapnia) and acidity of the blood. Noninvasive ventilation (NIV) is standard therapy for
      patients with acute hypercapnic exacerbations (sudden worsening of existing breathing
      insufficiency) of both chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and nonCOPD patients.

      The most common type of NIV is bilevel pressure support which assists patient breathing by
      delivering different levels of air pressure during inspiration and expiration via a mask
      covering the nose or nose and mouth. Standard bilevel NIV (VPAP™) has been further developed
      to create a new automatically adjusting NIV (AutoVPAP™). Automatically adjusting NIV varies
      the inspiratory air pressure according to the airflow rates generated by the patient. This
      may improve patient comfort, hours of NIV use and recovery time.

      Patients over the age of 18 admitted to Royal Brompton Hospital respiratory ward will be
      considered for entry into this randomised crossover study. If eligible for inclusion and
      willing to take part patients will be setup on automatically adjusting NIV or standard NIV,
      assigned in random order. After 24 hours on the first NIV the patient will be swapped to the
      alternative NIV for a further 24 hours of treatment.
