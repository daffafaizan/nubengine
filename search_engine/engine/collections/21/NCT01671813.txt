      have 2 parts; a part that targets cancer cells (the antibody) and a cell killing part (the
      chemotherapy). Antibodies are proteins that are part of the immune system. They can stick to
      and attack specific targets on cells. The antibody part of brentuximab vedotin sticks to a
      target called CD30. CD30 is an important molecule on some cancer cells (including non-Hodgkin
      lymphoma) and some normal cells of the immune system. The cell killing part of brentuximab
      vedotin is a chemotherapy called monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE). After the brentuximab
      vedotin attaches to the CD30 part of the cell, the MMAE enters the cell and kills it.

      More than 350 people with cancer have already been given brentuximab vedotin in research
      studies. These research studies were done to test the safety of different doses of
      brentuximab vedotin and to find out if brentuximab vedotin is active against cancer.
