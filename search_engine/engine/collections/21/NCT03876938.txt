      chemotherapy. We hypothesized that olanzapine may lead to less nausea compared to aprepitant
      based on previous study. However, data on efficacy and adverse effects of combination of
      olanzapine and ondansetron which is only serotonin antagonist in Thai national essential drug
      list, is scarce. Also, we aims to assess the efficacy of olanzapine dosage of 5 mg which is
      more commonly used in Thai patients.
