      accuracy of visual estimates of various joint measurements has not been previously assessed.
      No comparison has been done for years of experience and accuracy of estimations. This study
      will create a survey with pictures of joints at previously measured angles and therapists and
      students will be asked to estimate the range of motion. Various statistical analyses will be
      performed to determine accuracy and comparisons.
