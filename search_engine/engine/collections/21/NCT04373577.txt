      postoperative pain in children despite the use of systemic opioids. These patients may
      benefit from neuraxial analgesia in adjunction with general anesthesia. The reported
      advantages of this technique include decreased opiate exposure, decreased time in the
      post-anesthesia recovery room, decreased hospital stay, reduce the post-operative morbidity,
      provide early mobilization.

      Regional anesthetic techniques seem to be a better choice for improving acute pain management
      in these patients, with fewer adverse effects. The erector spinae block is a recently
      described ultrasound-guided technique in which local anesthetics is injected into a fascial
      plane between the tips of the thoracic transverse processes and the overlying erector spinae
      muscle (longissimus thoracis).

      Pericapsular nerve group (PENG) block has been recently recommended by Gir√≥n-Arango et al.
      for use as postoperative analgesia in hip surgeries. It is a new regional anesthesia
      technique in the region between the anterior inferior iliac spine (AIIS) and ilio-pubic
      eminence (IPE).

      The anterior capsule is the most richly innervated section of the joint suggesting these
      nerves should be the main targets for hip analgesia.
