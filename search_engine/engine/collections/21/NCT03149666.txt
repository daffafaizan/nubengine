      generalized Labeled Magnitude Scale, anthropometrics and other variables. Bitterness
      perceptions at the tip of the tongue (TOTp) and at the whole mouth (WMp) were recorded using
      a locally developed novel cloud-based software (Cloud-gLMS). The ANCOVA test was adjusted
      using TOTp and WMp as dependent variables and age, height, weight, BMI, gender, waist
      circumference, alcohol intake, comorbidities, and use of medications as independent
      variables.
