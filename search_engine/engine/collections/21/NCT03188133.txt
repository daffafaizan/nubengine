      processing could be illustrated by tasks of listening to white noise. These studies show that
      psychotic subjects detect more words and phrases when exposed to these stimuli. In
      schizophrenia patients with VHs, to our knowledge no study have explored the mechanism of
      false perception. Thus, we propose to experimentally manipulate the implication of Top-Down
      mechanisms on visual perception using an emotional priming task. This paradigm has already
      been used in this population to explain the mechanisms underlying productive symptoms. For
      example, in an emotional priming task authors have shown that a negative valence primer
      contributes to the implementation of an interpretive bias in a confidence judgment task.

      The aim of the present study is to explore the implication of these Top-Down mechanisms in
      hallucinatory manifestations, more specifically on the treatment of ambiguous visual stimuli
      during an emotional priming task by manipulating the emotional valence of the primer. The
      goal is to determine how emotional environmental elements contribute to the formation of
      erroneous perceptions in patients with schizophrenia with VHs.
