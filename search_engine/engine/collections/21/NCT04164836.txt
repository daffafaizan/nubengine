      allows you to observe the nasal mucosa, the inferior nasal concha, and in some cases, the
      nasal concha. You can see the nasal septum, polyps, and intranasal malformations. In
      addition, even when there are no structural abnormalities in the nasal cavity, the wider
      nasal cavity can be intuitively identified. This information is expected to assist in the
      selection of nostrils. It has not yet been studied whether anesthesiologists select nasal
      cavity for nasotracheal intubation using prosthesis can affect the occurrence of epistaxis.

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the selection of a nostril for nasotracheal
      intubation by rhinoscope affects the incidence and severity of epistaxis.
