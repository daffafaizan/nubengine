      flora mainly because intestinal microbiota can migrate and affect vaginal microecology. This
      project aims to evaluate the efficacy of oral probiotics (Umeta-Miyue, Lactobacillus
      rhamnosus GR-1 and Lactobacillus reuteri RC-14) (30 days) with metronidazole vaginal
      suppositories(7 days) in the treatment of bacterial vaginosis (BV) and to explore the
      correlation between vaginal flora and fecal flora by detecting the metagenomics of vaginal
      secretions and intestinal feces at the time of baseline phase, the first month after
      treatment, the third month after treatment and the sixth month after treatment.
