      Study Group Number 1: Port wine stain treated by the pulsed dye laser alone, which is the
      current standard of care: 20 subjects.

      Study Group Number 2: Port wine stain treated by combined pulsed dye laser and rapamycin: 20
      subjects.

      The researchers want to collect data on safety and efficacy of combined pulsed dye laser and
      rapamycin to improve fading/blanching of port wine stain birthmarks as compared to pulsed dye
      laser alone, which is the current standard of care. Twenty subjects will have their entire
      port wine stain birthmark treated by pulsed dye laser alone. Twenty subjects will have their
      entire port wine stain birthmark treated by combined pulsed dye laser and rapamycin, which is
      a drug that prevents the formation of blood vessels in the skin. Safety will be evaluated by
      searching for any local effects such as injury to the skin or systemic effects such as
      abnormal blood and/or urine studies. Efficacy will be determined by objectively measuring and
      comparing the port wine stain fading/blanching responses for the two study groups.
