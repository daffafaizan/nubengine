      of care (primary care, internal medicine, pain management providers, etc.) as well as a
      variety of specialty providers including neurosurgeons, orthopedic surgeons, oncologists, and
      dermatologists. The retrospective data collection will consist of a core set of data if
      available. The registry will attempt to collect data prior to surgery/treatment/procedures,
      during surgery, and various time points following surgery/treatment/procedures. The data will
      include, but is not limited to demographic data, past medical history, previous treatments,
      time off of work, type of surgery performed, products/implants/procedures/technology used
      during surgery, treatments/procedures/technology used for non-surgical conditions, anesthesia
      used during surgery, complications/adverse events following surgery and or treatment, outcome
      tools, imaging results, pain assessment, pain medication utilization, length of hospital
      stay, unplanned hospital admissions, revision surgery, adjacent level disease, genetic
      testing, urinary drug testing, other diagnostic or assessment testing, patient return to work
      and patient return to normal activity. The data collected will vary depending on disease
      state and treatment. This registry will also allow for comparisons on different treatments,
      procedures, etc. with a goal of developing the best pathways for a variety of different
      disease states.
