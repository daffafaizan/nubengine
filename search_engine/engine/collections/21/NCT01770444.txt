      pain patients in emergency department. However, it has been criticized for causing
      unnecessary radiation exposure in the population where its majority has no coronary lesion. A
      low-dose CCTA protocol comprised with 1) dedicated cardiac imaging protocol (rather than
      triple rule-out protocol), 2) prospective gating and 3) without additional imaging for
      calcium scoring will be used to implement the low-dose imaging. We hypothesized that the
      low-dose CCTA protocol will be as safe and efficacious as conventional dose protocol while
      decreasing the amount of radiation exposure significantly.
