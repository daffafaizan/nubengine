    
      This is a two part study to be conducted at a single study site. Both parts of the study may
      be conducted in parallel.

      A total of approximately 38 subjects will participate in this study, with approximately 19
      subjects in Part 1 and approximately 19 subjects in Part 2. Each subject may only participate
      in one of the parts.

      Each Part will consist of 2 study periods. Part 1 and Part 2, each subject will participate
      in a Screening phase, one baseline visit per period, one dosing phase per period, and
      follow-up telephone call.

      In Part 1, subjects will receive a single dose of CC-220 in Period 1 and, following an
      appropriate washout, multiple doses of itraconazole plus one dose of itraconazole with CC-220
      in Period 2. In Part 2, subjects will receive CC-220 in Period 1 and, following an
      appropriate washout, multiple doses of rifampin plus one dose of rifampin with CC-220 in
      Period 2.
