      high-pitched voice of childhood to the lower-pitch ed voice of adolescence and adulthood. In
      the recent years, kinesio taping has begun to be employed for treating dysphonia patients. We
      hypothesized that, because the kinesio taping relaxes the suprahyoid muscles and pushes the
      larynx backward, it could also be used as a therapy of mutational falsetto. This study aimed
      to assess of efficacy of the kinesio taping on male patients suffering from mutational
      falsetto.
