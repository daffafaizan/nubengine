      left high frequency or right high frequency, or sham rTMS. After 10 days of treatment, and no
      improvement, another 10 days of treatment follows, this time with the coil placed on the
      other hemisphere. Subjects will be followed for 2 months respectively with unrestricted
      treatment provided by their regular physician. Mood stabilizers will be continued throughout
      this trial.
