    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the proportion of patients requiring intubation/ventilator support, requiring
      rescue with tocilizumab, or dying.

      II. To determine 1 month survival.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the safety and tolerability of dasatinib anhydrous (dasatinib) in the setting
      of COVID-19 infection.

      II. To determine change in C-reactive protein (CRP) levels after starting therapy.

      III. To document activity of dasatinib in lessening cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and
      sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Interleukin-6 /cytokine assay weekly on treatment protocol. II. Ferritin levels at study
      entry and every (q) 2 days on treatment protocol. III. D-dimer levels at study entry and q 2
      days on treatment protocol.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive dasatinib anhydrous orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 14 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive placebo PO QD for 14 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 28 days.
