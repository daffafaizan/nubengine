      available.

      HP is resistant to metronidazole and clarithromycin, thus clarithromycin is expensive and it
      is not available in underdevelopment countries.

      of eradication of HP that is decreases length of therapy and increases, effectiveness of
      drugs and decreases resistance of drugs.
