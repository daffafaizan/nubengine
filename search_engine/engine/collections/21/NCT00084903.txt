        -  Identify potential improvements in noninvasive methods of diagnosing dysplasia and
           neoplasia of the cervix using fluorescence and reflectance spectroscopy in healthy
           participants with a history of normal pap smears.

        -  Determine the reflection and fluorescence spectra of in vivo samples of the normal human
           cervix.

        -  Refine the detection of cervical lesions by fluorescence spectroscopy in these
           participants using improved classification of normal columnar tissue and non-neoplastic
           tissue with inflammation.

        -  Determine and validate the wavelength selections for spectroscopic diagnosis derived
           from in vitro measurements from these participants.

        -  Compare specific tissue sections from these participants with their excitation-emission
           matrices in order to identify the cell types contributing to the signal.

      OUTLINE: Participants undergo placement of a fiber optic probe on one normal columnar cell
      site and one normal squamous cell site of the cervix during colposcopy*. The probe delivers
      laser light at a specific excitation wavelength and collects fluorescence from the entire
      emission wavelength range from the mucosa. Participants undergo biopsies of both sites.

      NOTE: *The columnar epithelium will not be colposcopically visible in all patients, in which
      case 2 normal squamous sites will be measured

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 1,000 participants will be accrued for this study.
