    
      This is a first-in-human open label phase I/II dose-escalation study in which participants
      with retinitis pigmentosa will receive a single uni-ocular subretinal implantation of one of
      three doses of hRPC.

      Treated eyes will be carefully monitored for any ocular or systemic adverse events for 2
      years.

      Testing will comprise a series of detailed ophthalmic examinations and imaging together with
      blood testing and systemic evaluations, as necessary.

      Ophthalmic testing will also be evaluated for any preliminary efficacy signal.
