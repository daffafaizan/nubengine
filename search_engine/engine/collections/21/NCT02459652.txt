      5-FU), 5-chloro-2,4-dihydropyrimidine (CHDP) and potassium oxonate (Oxo) effective for
      gastric and various other types of cancers. S-1 is also active for pancreatic cancer: S-1
      demonstrated non-inferiority to gemcitabine in overall survival for metastatic or locally
      advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC).

      S-1 and Concurrent radiotherapy: S-1 therapy with concurrent radiation therapy (RT) had
      favorable activity with overall tumor response rate of 37%, as well as mild toxicity in
      patients with LAPC. The median survival time and the 2-year survival rate for LAPC patients
      treated by S-1/RT were 16.2 months and 26% respectively.

      Definition of Borderline Resectable Pancreatic Cancer:(1) Reconstructible bilateral
      impingement of superior mesenteric vein or portal vein; (2) Tumor contact with the superior
      mesenteric artery (SMA) of </= 180 degrees ; (3) Tumor contact with the common hepatic artery
      of </= 180 degrees (at the root of the gastroduodenal artery); and (4) Tumor contact with the
      celiac axis of </= 180 degrees.

      Tumor with portal vein tumor thrombus and tumor contact with the second or further jejunal
      SMA branch are considered as unresectable. Tumor which is contact with the common hepatic
      artery or celiac axis but can be resected by distal pancreatectomy with en bloc celiac axis
      resection, is not included in this study.
