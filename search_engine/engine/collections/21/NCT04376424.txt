      measurements of volume status in directing treatment of heart failure patients admitted with
      acute exacerbation. The use of hand carried ultrasound is expected to reduce hospital Length
      of stay, heart failure re-admission rates, emergency room visits and in hospital
      complications such as renal failure. The hypothesis tested is as follows:

      Null: The use of hand carried ultrasound in the management of heart failure patients did not
      change outcome.

      Alternative: The use of hand carried ultrasound in the management of heart failure patients
      did change outcome.

      The study endpoints are as follows:

        1. A primary endpoint will be the impact of using hand carried ultrasound on length of
           hospital stay.

        2. The secondary endpoint will be 30 days re-admission following heart failure
           hospitalization, emergency room visits and in hospital complications such as renal
           failure.

      This is a randomized controlled un-blinded study that poses very minimal risk because
      patients will only undergo an ultrasound measurement of Inferior vein cava (IVC) and internal
      jugular vein diameter and compressibility. Also, the society will benefit greatly with the
      prospect of reducing hospitalization and medical complications, optimizing healthcare
      delivery to heart failure patients, and reducing hospitalization cost. The results of this
      study/study procedure will only direct medical therapy that heart failure patients usually
      receive through routine care such as dose and frequency of diuresis.
