      Lugol's solution in the detection of early esophageal carcinomas (second primary carcinomas)
      in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (HNSCC).

      Methods: All patients with newly diagnosed HNSCC underwent office-based Lugol
      chromoendoscopy. After flexible esophagoscopy with white light, 3.0% Lugol iodine solution
      was sprayed over the entire esophageal mucosa. Areas with less-intense staining (LVLs) were
      evaluated and biopsies taken.
