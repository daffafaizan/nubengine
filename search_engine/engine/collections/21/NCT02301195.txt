      authors' 10-week Therapeutic horseback riding (THR) intervention pilot, by evaluating the
      effectiveness of therapeutic horseback riding (THR) on self-regulation, socialization,
      communication, adaptive, and motor behaviors in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).
      Method: One hundred and twenty-seven participants (ages 6-16 years) were randomized by
      nonverbal IQ standard scores (< 85 or > 85) to one of two 10-week small groups: THR
      intervention; or barn activity (BA) control group without horses. Both interventions used
      similar methods, and the fidelity of the THR intervention was monitored. Participants were
      evaluated within one month pre- and post-intervention by raters blind to intervention
      conditions and caregiver questionnaires. Weekly during the intervention, caregivers rated
      participants' behaviors during the preceding week.
