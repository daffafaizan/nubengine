      mornings, after a 10 hour overnight fast, each child will consume a standardized breakfast
      (including orange juice, a strawberry breakfast bar and a pear fruit cup) at home. Using a
      2x2 factorial design, 2 hours after breakfast consumption, each participant will arrive in
      the lab (T=-20 min) and participate in high-intensity interval exercise or sit quietly for 20
      min, followed by a treatment drink of chocolate milk or water (control) consumption in 10
      min. During high-intensity interval exercise treatment, children will exercise on a cycle
      ergometer with a 3-min warm-up, 7 repeated bouts of 60-sec exercise at 90% of peak power
      output and 60-second recovery, and a 3-min cool down. Blood glucose will be measured via
      finger-prick at baseline (-20 min), 10, 30, 60, and 90 min. Cognitive functions will be
      measured using a battery of cognitive tests which assess verbal declarative memory, working
      memory, and executive functioning, and will be measured at baseline, 10. 30. 60, and 90 min.
      Subjective appetite and emotions will be measured using a 100-mm visual analogue scale (VAS)
      at baseline, 10, 30, 60, and 90 min. Salivary cortisol will be assessed from saliva samples
      collected using the passive drool method, and will be collected at baseline, 10 and 30 min.
