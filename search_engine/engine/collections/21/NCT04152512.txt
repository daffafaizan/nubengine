      Information about:

        -  General and vulvar-cancer-specific quality of life before and after any treatment for
           newly diagnosed vulvar cancer

        -  Treatment-related morbidity after any treatment for newly diagnosed vulvar cancer

        -  Unmet needs of patients with newly diagnosed vulvar cancer

        -  Satisfaction with care after any treatment for newly diagnosed vulvar cancer in Sweden.

      OUTLINE:

      The study is planned as a prospective, longitudinal multi-centre study in Sweden. Since 2017,
      the treatment of vulvar cancer patients has been accredited to four tertiary referral
      university hospitals in Sweden; the Sahlgrenska University hospital in Gothenburg, the
      Linköping University hospital, the Skåne University hospital in Lund and the Karolinska
      University hospital in Stockholm.

      150 patients are estimated for inclusion during a time frame of about 18 months.

      Eligible patients will be asked to complete a validated questionnaire at different points of
      time (before and after treatment). Calculating a response rate of about 50% - 60%, this will
      result in at least 80 completed questionnaires.

      The questionnaires consist of the following parts:

        -  European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC)-QLQ-C30

        -  European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC)-QLQ-VU-34
           (Vulva-specific module)

        -  Hospital Depression and Anxiety Scale (HADS)

        -  Supportive Care Needs Survey Short Form, excerpt (SCNS-SF34)

        -  European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC)-PATSAT (Patient
           Satisfaction), excerpt

        -  Demographic data

        -  25 self-constructed (and validated) questions

      RESULTS:

      Results are expected to be available in 2021.
