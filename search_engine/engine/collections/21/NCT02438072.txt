           phenotypic approach

        -  Study design Prospective, clinical, naturalistic, descriptive study During a
           consultation with their clinician, depressive patients will receive information.

      During the visit V0 with an investigator: patients will be included:

        -  Verification of inclusion and non inclusion criteria

        -  Reminder participation conditions

        -  Inclusion, signature of consent

        -  Collection of clinical and demographic features Between V0 and V1, for patients with
           change in antidepressant therapy, will take place telephone interviews every two weeks,
           conducted by the clinician to evaluate treatment depression response (tolerance and
           efficacy)

      During the visit V1, will take place:

        -  Phenotypic study

        -  Genetic study

        -  Dosage of current antidepressant drug

        -  Clinical evaluation: efficacy and tolerance

             -  Number of patients During one year, the protocol will be proposed to all patients
                with depression and decision of change in antidepressant therapy, and all patients
                with stability od prescription since almost 6 weeks. The inclusion of approximately
                100 patients is expected.

             -  Duration of treatment One time during the study, one day (Visit 1)

             -  Time plan of research -Duration for the patient: The study will stop when the
                patient has performed the V1 study Minimal delay between V0 and V1: 6 weeks (5-7
                weeks) : for patient with decision to change the treatment, 5 days for patients
                with stability of treatment since almost 6 weeks.

      Maximal delay of participation for the patient: 4 months even when V1 was not performed

      -Overall duration of inclusion: one year Maximal overall duration of the study: 12 months+4
      months= 16 months Maximal duration for the analytical study since the beginning of the study=
      16 months+6 months: 22 months.

      Maximal delay for communication of the results: 2 years after the beginning of the study
