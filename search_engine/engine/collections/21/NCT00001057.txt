      infection, there is an extraordinarily large number of infected CD4+ lymphocytes and
      macrophages throughout the lymphoid system, both in latent and productive states. These
      findings support the belief that early intervention therapy with reverse transcriptase
      inhibitors could prolong the clinical latency period.

      Patients are randomized to receive AZT alone, AZT plus ddI, or no therapy (placebo) daily for
      48 weeks. Patients are followed at weeks 2, 4, and 8, and then every 8 weeks thereafter until
      week 48.
