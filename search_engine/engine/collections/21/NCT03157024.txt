      needles (RN), previously validated Kim Sham needles (KS), or newly developed Ring Sham
      needles (RS) at a 1:1:1 ratio. Acupuncture sensation, blinding, and feasibility in a future
      clinical trial will be measured along with other physiological measurements including tactile
      sensitivity, interoceptive sensitivity, and electrodermal activity.
