      and skin scrapings from patients before and after kidney and pancreas transplantation. At Day
      0 and day 1, week 1, and at 3, 6, and 12 months.

      These samples will be collected longitudinally over a period of one year after
      transplantation and will be analysed using 16s rRNA gene sequencing in order to capture the
      dynamics of the microbiome after exposure to surgery, immunosuppression and the specific
      medication necessary during the process of transplantation.

      Two groups of recipients will be recruited, the first one includes kidney and/or pancreas
      transplant recipients from both deceased and living donors.
