    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the time-to-quality of life (QOL) improvement from baseline in postoperative
      gynecological cancer patients who are receiving oral serum bovine immunoglobulin (SBI) vs.
      placebo.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the surgical complication rates between oral SBI vs. placebo up to 1 month
      post-surgery (safety endpoint).

      II. To compare the QOL, as derived from the previously-validated Symptom Distress Scale, the
      Postoperative Quality of Life questionnaire (PQL), and the uniscale (overall QOL item)
      between patients receiving oral SBI vs. placebo.

      III. To compare the grade 2 or worse adverse event rates for patients receiving oral SBI vs.
      placebo.

      IV. To characterize the adverse event profile of oral SBI in postoperative gynecological
      cancer patients (safety endpoint).

      V. To compare supplement adherence between patients receiving oral SBI vs. placebo.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore whether candidate biomarkers are modified with SBI versus placebo.

      II. As part of ongoing research, to bank leftover blood samples for future studies.

      III. To explore quality of life during postoperative recovery after gynecologic surgery,
      regardless of whether or not patients take the study intervention/placebo or discontinue
      intervention/placebo early.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive SBI orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28.

      ARM II: Patients receive placebo PO BID on days 1-28.

      In both arms, treatment repeats every 28 days for 3 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4 weeks.
