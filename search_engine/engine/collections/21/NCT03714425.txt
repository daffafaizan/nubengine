      upper calf with a velcro band. It has been cleared by the FDA for safety. It is designed to
      improve fibromyalgia by the principles of transcutaneous electrical stimulation of nerves
      much like a traditional transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulator (TENS) unit. Investigators
      expect to enroll approximately 130 subjects in this study. Participants will be equally
      randomized to one of two experimental groups: High Frequency Quell group (N=65) or Low
      Frequency Quell group (N=65). This study hopes to find out whether low frequency or high
      frequency stimulation is most useful among persons with fibromyalgia.
