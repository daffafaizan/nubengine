      coronary artery disease (CAD) [1]. Influenza vaccination is now recommended as part of
      comprehensive secondary prevention in individuals with coronary and other atherosclerotic
      vascular disease (evidence level: Class I, Level B) [2]. Although there is controversial
      evidence pro [3,4] and against [5] the efficacy of influenza vaccination in protecting CAD
      population against cardiovascular events, the efficacy of vaccine in actual reduction in
      episodes of influenza infection and its fatal complications in CAD patients has not been, to
      our knowledge, well studied before. Furthermore, we found no report comparing serologic
      response to the influenza vaccine antigens between CAD patients and healthy controls.

      This study aims to identify the efficacy of influenza vaccination in CAD individuals in terms
      of both serologic response (as compared with healthy individuals) and clinical outcomes (as
      compared with CAD patients not vaccinated).
