      as a new provisional entity in the 2008 World Health Organization (WHO) classification of
      tumors of hematopoietic and lymphoid tissue. This lymphoma is defined as EBV+ clonal B-cell
      proliferation in immunocompetent adults older than 50 years. To denote patient age in
      definition of this disease, age cutoff was defined as older than 50 years. However, this
      cutoff is clearly arbitrary without any scientific background. the knowledge on EBV+DLBCL in
      young adult is very scanty. This EBV+DLBCL in young adult can be the same disease entity or
      it can be a distinct disease form EBV+DLBCL of elderly.
