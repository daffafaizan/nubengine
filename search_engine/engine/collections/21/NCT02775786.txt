    
      This is a prospective cohort study of dynamic contrast enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI), which includes
      diffusion weighted imaging (DWI-MRI) in participants with pancreatic adenocarcinoma who are
      undergoing surgical resection. Participants will have up to two MRI scans with and without
      intravenous contrast. The MRI will be performed using either an extracellular contrast agent
      or using a macromolecular contrast agent. These contrast agents are routinely used in body
      MRI and are on formulary at this institution. Quantitative parameters of volume transfer
      coefficient (Ktrans) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) will be calculated from the MRI
      sequences and each parameter will be compared to histopathology measures of mean vascular
      density and grade of fibrosis, respectively. The influence of the contrast agent
      (extracellular and macromolecular) on agreement between imaging parameters and histopathology
      will be assessed and agreement in Ktrans as derived from a one compartment and a
      two-compartment model will be assessed. If a participant is unable to receive intravenous
      contrast due to renal dysfunction or refuses IV contrast, the non-contrast portion of the
      exam will be used for analysis. The purpose is to establish a standard protocol for future
      clinical trials of treatments that would use MRI parameters as quantitative markers of
      treatment effect.
