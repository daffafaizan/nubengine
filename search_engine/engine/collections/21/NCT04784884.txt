      respectively, are investigated. The hyperspectral imaging camera head is placed and aligned
      over the surgical (camera and object distance: 30 cm for all measurements). The Field of view
      is illuminated by 8 halogen spots (20 W each) and 100 wavelengths in the wavelength range
      from 500 to 1000 nm were applied. The software calculates the tissue oxygenation [%] ,
      organ-hemoglobin-index, near-infrared-Index and the tissue-water-index of the investigated
      tissue. The study was designed to investigate tissue oxygenation in the superficial (app.
      1mm) and deeper layers (app. 4-6mm) of the bronchus before and after lung resection.
