      Radiation up to 5 years after the participant receive it. The investigators are also looking
      for how this type of radiation affects the quality of life as well as any type of side effect
      the participant may have after the radiation is administered.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved Proton Radiation for this
      specific disease but it has been approved for other uses.
