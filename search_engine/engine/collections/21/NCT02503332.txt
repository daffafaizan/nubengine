    
      This is a Phase II, prospective, multicenter, randomized, single-masked, sham-controlled
      study to assess the safety, tolerability and evidence of activity of multiple IVT injections
      of pegcetacoplan in subjects with GA secondary to Age-Related Macular Degeneration.

      The study will randomize approximately 240 subjects to obtain at least 200 evaluable subjects
      across 40 multinational sites.

      Subjects will be randomized in a 2:2:1:1 manner to receive pegcetacoplan Monthly (AM),
      pegcetacoplan Every-Other-Month (AEOM), Sham injection Monthly (SM) or Sham injection
      Every-Other-Month (SEOM), respectively.

      All subjects will return to the clinical site on Day 7 to assess acute safety after the first
      injection. After that, subjects in the monthly groups will return to the clinical site for
      additional pegcetacoplan (or Sham) injections and study procedures every month until Month
      12. Subjects in the Every-Other-Month groups will return to the clinical site for additional
      pegcetacoplan (or Sham) injections and study procedures every two months until Month 12. All
      subjects will return for follow-up visits on Months 15 and 18 (3 and 6 months after last
      injection, respectively).
