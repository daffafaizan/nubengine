      vitiligo include phototherapy with narrow-band (NB) ultraviolet B (UVB) irradiation (NB-UVB).
      Further therapeutic approaches are desired and currently being evaluated. The investigational
      product, afamelanotide, is a synthetic analogue of the human alpha melanocyte stimulating
      hormone (alpha-MSH). The earliest described function of alpha-MSH is its ability to stimulate
      melanin synthesis in the skin and therefore stimulate pigmentation.
