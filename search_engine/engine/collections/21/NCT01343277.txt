      an open-label (all people know study drug), active-controlled (comparing to a different drug
      used for the same condition), parallel-group (different treatment groups continue with
      separate treatments throughout the study), multicenter study. This study will be divided into
      3 phases, screening, treatment, follow-up and optional extension phase (OEP). During
      screening, potential participants will be assessed for study eligibility after providing
      signed informed consent. Approximately 570 patients who satisfy all inclusion and exclusion
      criteria will be randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to either the trabectedin (n=380) or
      dacarbazine (n=190) treatment groups. During the treatment phase, patients will receive study
      drug once every 3 weeks, until disease progression (defined by Response Evaluation Criteria
      in Solid Tumors [RECIST] Version 1.1 criteria) or signs of toxicity. Assessments will be
      performed to evaluate the effectiveness of the drug, and patient safety will be monitored.
      During the follow-up phase, after the last dose of study drug, clinical outcomes for patients
      will be evaluated. Trabectedin will be administered at a dose of 1.5 milligram per square
      meters (mg/m^2) through a catheter into a large vein as a 24-hour intravenous (IV) infusion,
      once every 3 weeks, until disease progression or signs of toxicity. Dacarbazine will be
      administered at a dose of 1.0 g/m^2 as a 20-120 minute infusion, once every 3 weeks, until
      disease progression or signs of toxicity. In the OEP, participants who were previously
      randomized to the dacarbazine group will have the option to receive trabectedin at the
      discretion of the investigator.
