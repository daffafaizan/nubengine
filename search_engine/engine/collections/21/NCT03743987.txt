      2016-November 2017. However; a total of 40 periapical lesions undergoing apical surgery were
      recruited for the planned clinical trial in the end. The study was conducted under randomized
      controlled protocol. Patients were informed about the surgical procedures and signed a
      consent form. The anticipated outcomes, possible risks and benefits of the study as well as
      the alternative treatment options were explained to the patients.

      Groups were designed to have 10 patients in each and randomly divided into four as; control,
      MTA, PRF and MTA+PRF. Apical resection was performed in all groups. No other interventions
      were made to the control group.

      Routine radiographs were taken in the 1st. 3th and 6th months. In the 12th month of the
      procedures computerized tomography (CT) scans were taken. Primary healing of the periapical
      tissues were evaluated according to the volumes and the densities of the lesions. Outcomes
      were measured. Comparison between the initial and the last 3D CT scan volumes were made by
      medical image processing software (MIMICS, Belgium). Patients have still been under control
      for the long term outcomes of the study.
