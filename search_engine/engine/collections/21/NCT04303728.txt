      although only 25% of patients regain this ability despite current rehabilitation protocols.
      There is emerging evidence that intensive and prolonged rehabilitation, though costly and
      manpower intensive, may result in ambulatory recovery in patients previously thought to be
      non-ambulant. However, there are no suitable clinical biomarkers which can identify these
      group of patients who will benefit from this intervention.

      Hence the aim is to establish if change from the baseline in ultrasound muscle parameters
      over rehabilitation correlates with functional status of SCI patients.
