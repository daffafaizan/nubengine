      weeks. During each feeding period all food and beverages to be consumed will be provided by
      the study.

      In Study 1, participants will be randomly assigned to receive one of two diets. Both diets
      are designed to maintain weight at a constant level. The diets are balanced nutritionally and
      have the same amount of protein. One diet has higher amounts of sugar, while the other has
      higher amounts of fat. For one 10-day period, the diet will be fed as two large meals
      ('meal-feeding'). For the other 10-day period, the identical diet will be fed as 8 small
      meals ('nibbling'). Half of the participants will meal-feed first, while the other half will
      'nibble' first. The order of nibbling or meal feeding will be determined randomly.

      In Study 2, the number of meals eaten per day will remain fixed at three (no nibbling or meal
      feeding). Participants will receive both the diet higher in sugar and the diet higher in fat.
      However, they will be randomly assigned to start one followed by the other for each 10-day
      feeding period.

      At the end of each 10-day feeding period, participants will spend two nights in a research
      ward (Clinical Research Center) to undergo testing.
