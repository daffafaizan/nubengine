      2-week intervention for infants with BPBP; and (2) determine the effect size for the primary
      outcome measure(s) in preparation for a future definitive randomized controlled trial (RCT).
      In this feasibility RCT, the investigators will compare two in-home interventions in 3 to
      12-month-old infants with upper trunk BPBP; n=12 per group: (1) experimental; and (2)
      dose-equivalent active control. For the experimental intervention, infants will trigger a
      musical toy to move and play via biceps contraction above a preset individual threshold. For
      the control intervention, toys will be available to play with, yet, there will be no
      reinforcement for biceps activation.
