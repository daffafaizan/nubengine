      death in the US. While radiation therapy is highly effective for many solid tumors, thoracic
      radiation therapy carries a risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality that limits
      critical gains in cancer control and survival. The investigators will perform detailed
      cardiovascular phenotyping using biologic and imaging markers to define functional and
      physiologic perturbations that occur with radiation therapy. The study will provide insights
      into how cardiovascular risk factors and disease impact these biologic and functional
      changes. The investigators will also determine which radiotherapy dose-volume metrics are
      indicative of subclinical cardiotoxicity.
