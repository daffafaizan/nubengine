      colorectal cancer screening program will be randomly assigned to innovative or conventional
      examination. Randomization will be based on computer-generated randomization lists. All
      patients will be blinded so they will not know which techniques will be used to assess
      lesions found in colon. In innovative colonoscopy group narrow band imaging (NBI) and Dual
      Focus (DF) function will be used to identify and classify all lesions according. to Kudo and
      NICE classification. Endoscopic biopsy samples will be taken from all lesions and in vivo
      endoscopic diagnosis will be compared with final histopathological result. Thus, sensitivity,
      specificity, diagnostic accuracy, predictive values, likelihood ratio and Youden index will
      be calculated. As secondary endpoints total examination time, cecal intubation rate and pain
      intensity (VAS) will be determined. This study will help to establish whether advanced
      imaging technologies used during colonoscopy may improve diagnostic possibilities and whether
      they prolong examination time or lead to increase of pain intensity afterwards.
