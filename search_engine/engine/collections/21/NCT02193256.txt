    
      The study comprises an 8-week double-blind, within-subjects, crossover design of varenicline
      (up to 2mg per day) plus either prazosin (up to 8mg per day) (V+P) or placebo (V) with 20
      heavy drinking smokers. Each medication phase is 3 weeks with a 2-week medication washout in
      between. Participants are asked to make a practice quit attempt for 3 days the last week of
      each medication phase.

      This is an exploratory study to look at two primary aims:

        1. Evaluate the effect of prazosin on sleep disturbance caused by varenicline in heavy
           drinking smokers prior to quitting smoking.

           Hypothesis: V+P will result in lower rates of vivid dreams and insomnia symptoms/sleep
           discontinuity than V alone.

        2. Evaluate the effect of prazosin on sleep disturbance caused by varenicline during
           smoking cessation in heavy drinking smokers.

      Hypothesis: V+P will result in lower rates of vivid dreams and insomnia symptoms/sleep
      discontinuity than V alone We will also investigate the combined effects of prazosin and
      varenicline on smoking behavior (i.e., smoking urge) and alcohol consumption (i.e., drinks
      per drinking day) as exploratory aims.
