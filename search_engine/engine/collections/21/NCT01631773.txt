      with nasal polyps and AERD disease and from the inferior turbinates of ten subjects with
      nasal polyps but without AERD. A rhinoprobeâ„¢ will be used to collect this epithelial tissue.
      These samples will be analyzed by miRNA assay to determine if there is a difference in
      mircroRNA expression between the two subject groups.
