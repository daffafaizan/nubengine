      treated with antibiotics. However, very little is know concerning the prevalent pathogens in
      patients with acute throat infections without abscess formation. Evidence suggests that
      Fusobacterium necrophorum plays an important role in complications of acute tonsillitis (e.g.
      peritonsillar abscess), but also uncomplicated acute tonsillitis.

      This study aims to explore the throat microbiology of patients with severe acute tonsillitis,
      peritonsillar cellulitis, or infectious mononucleosis with a special attention to a possible
      role of Fusobacterium necrophorum.
