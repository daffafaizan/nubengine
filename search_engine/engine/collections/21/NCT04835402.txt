      of a single liver metastasis can elicit a systemic anticancer immune response in patients
      with pancreatic cancer.

      Adult patients, in WHO performance status 0-1, with liver metastatic pancreatic cancer,
      intolerant to or progressing on first or further lines of chemotherapy can enter the trial.
      Pembrolizumab infusion is given every six weeks for up to six months. IRE of a single liver
      metastasis is performed between the first and second pembrolizumab infusion.

      Response to the therapy is examined by CT (RECIST) on non-IRE-ablated lesions every 2 months.
      Assessments of changes in peripheral blood immune cell composition, tumor gene expression and
      tumor infiltrating lymphocytes is performed on serial biopsies and blood samples.
