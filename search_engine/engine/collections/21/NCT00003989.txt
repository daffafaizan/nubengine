      patients with locally advanced, unresectable, or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer or
      unresectable or metastatic melanoma treated with ISIS 3521. II. Determine safety of ISIS 3521
      in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified by disease type. Patients
      receive ISIS 3521 IV over 21 days followed by 7 days of rest. Courses repeat every 28 days in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 28-50 patients (14-25 per stratum) will be accrued for this
      study.
