      schemes in the management of post-operative pain. However, agents with appropriate
      pharmacokinetic properties are not readily available. The premise of this double-blind,
      placebo and positive-controlled clinical study is to evaluate the efficacy of vanilloid
      agonists as preemptive agents in an oral surgery tissue injury model. Vanilloids are a class
      of small organic compounds; the most familiar of which is capsaicin, the active ingredient in
      hot pepper. Binding of capsaicin to the vanilloid-1 receptor produces initial activation and
      then long-acting desensitization of pain specific neurons. We propose to produce a selective,
      long-term inactivation of peripheral pain transmission through the local application of
      capsaicin in the oral mucosa in an effort to prevent or reduce post-operative pain in the
      oral surgery model. Healthy subjects will be recruited, and following local anesthesia, will
      be given an intramucosal injection of either capsaicin or placebo. (Or as a positive control,
      24 hours later, intravenous Toradol). Subjects will have one lower impacted wisdom tooth
      extracted under local anesthesia and then will rate their pain. The time of analgesic rescue
      medication request will be noted. A decrease in post-operative pain and decrease in analgesic
      use will be taken as a positive effect of the vanilloid for decreasing post-operative pain.
      We anticipate that through the long term blockade of pain specific fibers pre-operatively
      that there will be a significant attenuation of post-operative pain development following
      surgery. This has significant implications for reducing pain and suffering, decreasing
      analgesic use, and reducing post-operative complications following surgery.
