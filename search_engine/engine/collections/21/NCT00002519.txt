      with standard thoracic radiotherapy in patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung
      cancer. II. Determine the plasma levels of paclitaxel in these patients. III. Determine the
      effect of this regimen on the tumor cell cycle distribution in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of paclitaxel. Patients undergo standard thoracic
      radiotherapy 5 days a week for 7 weeks. Patients receive paclitaxel IV continuously beginning
      48 hours before initiating radiotherapy and continuing until the last day of radiotherapy.
      Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts
      of 3-5 patients receive escalating doses of paclitaxel until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)
      is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 5
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed monthly for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-5 patients per dose level will be accrued for this study
      within 2 years.
