      randomized 1:1 to receive either hydroxychloroquine or placebo control.

      Participants will receive their study intervention for 5 days, after which they will be
      considered off protocol- directed therapy and receive medical management of their disease
      according to institutional standards. Participants may be followed for up to 180 days from
      initiating protocol therapy for clinical outcome, after which they will discontinue study
      participation.
