    
      The study includes patients with cN+ positive axillary lymph nodes at initial diagnosis and
      who also have negative clinical and instrumental evaluation after NAC. Based on the sentinel
      lymph nodes definitive histological evaluation patients are allocated in one of the 2
      comparison groups (Group 1 experimental or Group 2 standard) or in Group 3 internal control
      group. Group 3 is not used in statistical comparison with the other two groups but it's aim
      is to evaluate the appropriateness of the cases.

      Referring to bio-pathologic characteristics after surgery patients will receive:

        -  no further treatment

        -  complementary radiotherapy

        -  adjuvant medical therapy (hormonal therapy and/or biological therapy)

      Irradiation:

      Group 1 (experimental) and Group 2 (standard): irradiation won't be performed neither in the
      axillary region nor in the other lymph node stations

      Group 3 (internal control): after conservative or radical surgery, patients will be subjected
      to loco-regional irradiation according to Guidelines.

      Duration:

      Patients enrollment in the study protocol will last for 3 years. Patients will have to be
      followed for the subsequent 5 years during which they will have to undergo to periodic visits
      and follow-up checks provided for by the current standard guidelines:

        -  clinical examination every six months for the first 5 years

        -  mammography and breast ultrasound yearly

        -  axillary ultrasound yearly
