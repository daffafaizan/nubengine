    
      Design: Multi-center, randomized, double-blind, active control, titrated dose,
      non-inferiority trial

      Population Studied: We will prospectively recruit 250 hypertensive patients who had ischemic
      stroke 2 or more weeks previously and were admitted at 7 centers in the Seoul metropolitan
      area in South Korea.

      Interventions: After a 2-week washout period, all patients will undergo baseline 99mTc-HMPAO
      single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), blood pressure evaluation, NIHSS
      examination, and laboratory test prior to treatment. The patients will be randomized to
      receive either cilnidipine 10-20mg or losartan 50-100mg once daily for 4 weeks with a target
      systolic blood pressure of < 140mmHg and diastolic blood pressure of < 90mmHg. After 4-week
      treatment, all patients will receive follow-up SPECT and blood pressure evaluation. For the
      quantitative CBF analysis, SPECT will be performed with a single machine in one center.

      Outcome Measures: Primary outcome measure is the percentile change of global CBF on SPECT
      between pre- and post-treatments. Secondary outcome measures include the percentile change of
      regional CBF, the proportion of patients less than 8.6% decrease of global CBF, and the
      change of NIHSS score.
