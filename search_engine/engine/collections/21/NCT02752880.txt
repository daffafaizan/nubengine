      renowned GMP manufacturer of concentrated herbal extract granules conforming to international
      standards. The YH1 was prepared in small granules, including concentrated herbal extract
      granules of Rhizoma Coptidis (50%) and SLBZS (50%). Both medicines have already been approved
      by the Ministry of Health and Welfare in Taiwan as ethical drugs. YH1 granules were packed in
      aluminum foil packages. The placebo was also prepared as granules by Sun Ten Pharmaceutical
      Co., LTD., and the packaging of the placebo was identical to that of YH1. The chemical
      composition of YH1 was analyzed and profiled by using a high performance liquid
      chromatography (HPLC) with photodiode array (PDA) detection. Fourteen components, allantoin,
      atractylenolide III, berberine, coptisine, ginsenoside Rb1, ginsenoside Re, ginsenoside Rg1,
      glycyrrhizin, liquiritin, pachymic acid, palmatine, platycodin D, magnoflorin and quercitrin,
      were simultaneously used in the qualitative analysis under the developed HPLC-PDA method. As
      for the quantitative detection, each gram of YH1 contained 20.05 mg berberine.
