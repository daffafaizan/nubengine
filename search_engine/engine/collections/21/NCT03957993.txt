      (ADHD) often receive occupational therapy (OT), which traditionally takes place in a clinical
      setting. This setting may present barriers and distractors that make it hard for children to
      achieve their OT goals. Telehealth-based sessions provide an alternative, allowing the
      therapist to be virtually present within the home.Once enrolled, children will randomly be
      assigned to be in one of two groups: (1) Standard, in which children will receive
      clinic-based services as per standard of care OR (2) Telehealth, in which children will
      receive in-home services on a video-based platform on a timeline identical to what they would
      receive if they were in the Standard group. Children in both groups will participate for the
      duration of the episode of care, estimated to last 10-12 weeks. Assessments will be completed
      at initial evaluation, discharge, and three months following discharge.
