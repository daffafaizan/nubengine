      endurance-type exercise. It's been shown that CHO feeding during exercise enhances endurance
      performance and capacity, attributed mainly to the facilitation of greater rates of exogenous
      CHO oxidation, prevention of hypoglycaemia and sparing of muscle glycogen. Previous studies
      based on supplementation of glucose during 180 min. of cycling exercise have reported a
      maximal rate of exogenous CHO oxidation to be about 1 g/min. Other studies have shown that
      CHO oxidation rates can reach peak values of about 1.3 g/min when a combination of fructose
      and glucose is ingested at a rate of 1.8 g/min. The limitation in uptake and oxidation of a
      single CHO source is attributed to its intestinal transporter saturation such that when
      multiple CHO source is used the uptake and oxidation rate is increased to a greater extent.
      Currently there is no information regarding Phx uptake or oxidation rate as a CHO source
      during exercise. Also, it is important to investigate whether Phx as a CHO sport drink can
      increase performance by sparing muscle and liver glycogen during exercise. Therefore, the
      objective of this experiment is to measure dose response of Phx oxidation rate during
      prolonged cycling exercise and its effect on muscle and liver glycogen levels.
