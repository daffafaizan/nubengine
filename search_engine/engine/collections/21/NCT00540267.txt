      because of lack of exercise, poor nutrition and high rate of smoking. Those with alcohol
      abuse may be higher risk group than one with schizophrenia without alcohol abuse, because
      they frequently have several medical problems such as liver dysfunction, Vitamin D
      deficiency, hyperparathyroidism and those medical condition increase risk for developing
      osteoporosis. Also alcohol itself can increase bone loss too by disturbing bone remodeling
      and enhancing bone fragility. To compare the prevalence of bone mineral density in patients
      with schizophrenia with alcohol abuse to those without alcohol problem, we will investigate
      BMD in large population of Korean patients with those illnesses.
