    
      Randomized double blinded placebo-controlled trial to evaluate: (1) the impact of letrozole
      use during ovarian hyperstimulation with respect to endometriosis-related symptoms,
      embryo/egg quality and quantity, and pregnancy rates, (2) the impact of ovarian
      hyperstimulation on endometriosis-related symptoms.

      There will be a total of 60 participants, 20 participants with endometriosis randomized to
      the placebo group, 20 participants with endometriosis randomized to the letrozole group and
      20 control patients with no history of endometriosis. Letrozole and placebo medication will
      be started on the first day of gonadotropin injections and continued until the day of trigger
      shot. Medication will be restarted the night of egg retrieval and continued for 2 weeks post
      retrieval. Endometriosis associated symptoms will be evaluated using a survey modeled after
      the clinical survey developed by the World Endometriosis Research Foundation Endometriosis
      Phenome and Biobanking Harmonisation Project. Surveys will be administered at baseline
      ultrasound appointment for controlled ovarian hyperstimulation cycle, the day of trigger
      shot, 3 weeks following egg retrieval, 6 weeks following egg retrieval and 12 weeks following
      egg retrieval.
