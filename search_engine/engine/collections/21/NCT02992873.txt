      rates. If the operator at the dispatch center suspects an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest he
      or she will activate the mobile positioning system (MPS) wich is integrated in the operators
      computer environment.

      After activation, the system will locate all CPR-trained volunteers nearby the suspected
      OHCA. By computer based 1:1 randomization lay volunteers will be alerted and dispatched in 50
      % of all suspected OHCAs in where the system is triggered by the dispatchers. In the
      intervention group, the activation of the system is supposed to result in lay volunteers to
      be alerted and directed to fetch the nearest AED and commence early defibrillation. Dependent
      on geographical and logistical circumstances, at a minimum one lay volunteer or more will be
      alerted to provide bystander CPR only.

      In the control group the MPS will be activated and lay responders will be dispatched to
      suspected OHCA to perform CPR only. In both groups the ordinary EMS services are dispatched
      in a regular fashion.
