      treated with with bone marrow concentrate (BMC) using an anterior approach through the
      posterior oropharynx for treating alar and transverse ligament injuries as part of their
      clinical care. The case series will observe pre and post-treatment subject-reported clinical
      outcomes. Secondary objectives include evaluation of post-treatment complications, adverse
      events, re-injections, and surgical intervention, change in use of pain medications, and
      changes on post treatment imaging.

      The treatment consists of patients undergoing a bone marrow aspiration of approximately 30-60
      cc. Platelet rich plasma (PRP) and platelet lysate (PL) will be derived from the bone marrow
      aspirate and later mixed with the bone marrow cell layer. While under anesthesia, the
      injectate is then injected under fluoroscopy into the area in need of treatment using an
      anterior approach through the posterior oropharynx.

      One of the challenges of treating the upper cervical ligaments through injection is that they
      can't be accessed from the posterior due to obstruction from the cervical spinal cord. The
      investigator's group has developed an injection technique using an anterior approach through
      the posterior oropharynx, which allows direct access to the ligaments for injection. The goal
      of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of this procedure in CCJ instability patients.
