      and clinical markers in predicting the development of IBD in a high risk population. The
      study will be divided in two phases. In the first phase the prevalence of genetic, serologic,
      fecal, clinical risk factors in 100 siblings of children affected with IBD compared to 100
      healthy children with no family history for IBD will be evaluated. The estimated duration of
      the first phase of the study is 12 months. In a second phase, a long-term follow-up (5 years)
      will be performed in order to evaluate the accidental cases of IBD in this population.
