      I. To determine the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of nortriptyline hydrochloride
      (nortriptyline) combined with weekly paclitaxel (PC).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the overall response rate (ORR) to nortriptyline combined with PC.

      II. To assess progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of nortriptyline hydrochloride.

      Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously (IV) on days 1, 8, and 15. Patients also receive
      nortriptyline hydrochloride orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-7, twice daily (BID) on
      days 8-14, and thrice daily (TID) on days 15-28 of course 1 and TID on days 1-28 of
      subsequent courses. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 28 days and every 3 months
      for 2 years.
