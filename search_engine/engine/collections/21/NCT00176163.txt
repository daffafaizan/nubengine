      medication in patients with fibromyalgia and patients with back pain. It is well known that
      cannabinoids (THC) accelerate learning processes. It is assumed that the combination of both
      treatments may exert an synergetic effect. A low dose of THC is used, which ist not expected
      to have direct analgetic effects. The study also investigates genetic determinants of both
      disorders and the response to treatment, respectively.

      The patients will be randomly assigned to one of four groups: Behavioral therapy and
      Dronabinol, behavioral therapy and placebo, behavioral therapy only, standard medical
      therapy. Patients will attend 12 weekly group-sessions (6-8 patients) of behavioral therapy.
      Behavioral therapy sessions will include training in reducing pain behaviour and establishing
      active and "healthy" behaviour instead. There will be weekly medical safety visits, in which
      the patients receive medication and undergo a physical examination (blood and urine samples).

      Patients will be evaluated before and after behavioral therapy and will be followed for an
      additional 6- and 12-months phase. The outcome variables will be recorded by the use of
      interviews and questionnaires.
