      symptoms among university students, highlighting an urgent need for preventative measures at
      low cost to better support often overwhelmed support services.

      Objectives: Here we propose a protocol for assessing the feasibility and acceptability of a
      randomised controlled trial (RCT) of an online transdiagnostic psychoeducational intervention
      called 'A Bite of ACT' (BOA) compared to a waitlist control.

      Methods and analysis:

      A randomised controlled trial with crossover design will be conducted at baseline, and two
      follow-up periods. The primary outcome measure will be the ACCEPT checklist, while secondary
      outcomes include measures of wellbeing, depression, anxiety, and stress (DASS21) and a
      process measure (psychological flexibility AAQII). Qualitative interviews and preliminary
      health economics analysis will provide additional insights. Analysis will focus on
      descriptive statistics and feasibility outcomes and calculate a treatment effect size to
      determine sample size needed for any future trial (if indicated).
