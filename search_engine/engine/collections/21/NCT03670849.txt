      performing laparoscopic procedures. An inability to see beneath organ surfaces is a
      limitation of the current visualization technology. Surgeons additionally use laparoscopic
      ultrasound to see beneath organ surfaces, but also need to mentally correlate the ultrasound
      image with the video of the operative field. This process is difficult, subjective, and
      variable with expertise, and discourages the use of ultrasound.

      We have developed a method to combine live laparoscopic video and laparoscopic ultrasound
      images to present fused multimodality images on a single display, eliminating the need for
      mental image correlation. Specifically, the image fusion method, called laparoscopic
      augmented reality (LapAR), augments the laparoscopic video with ultrasound data when required
      by surgeons. This study is designed to test this minimal-risk capability in patients referred
      for relevant laparoscopic procedures.
