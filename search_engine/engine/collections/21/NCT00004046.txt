      adenocarcinoma of the breast who have failed prior therapy with an anthracycline and a
      taxane. II. Evaluate the quantitative and qualitative toxicities of this drug in these
      patients. III. Evaluate the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients.

      21 days. Treatment continues in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.
      Patients are followed every 3 months until death.
