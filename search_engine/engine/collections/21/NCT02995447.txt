      surface of the head, which is approximately 1-2 cm above the cerebral cortex. Thus, the
      spatial resolution of the EEG is low, and the electrical activity recorded originates from a
      multitude of neurons.

      Deep brain structures such as the hippocampus also generate electrical activity which cannot
      be assessed from the surface of the head. However, in some patients electrodes are implanted
      into the brain to look for the origin of epileptic seizures. Along the way, these
      intracerebral electrodes enable to record the EEG from intracerebral structures which are
      generated from few neurons only. Once the origin of epilepsy has been identified, the
      intracerebral electrodes are removed under general anesthesia.

      Anesthetics such as propofol characteristically modify the EEG in a dose-dependant manner.
      More over, the propofol effect on the EEG recorded from the surface is likely to be different
      from the intracerebral EEG, however little is known so far. Therefore we aim to investigate
      the differential effect of propofol on the superficial versus intracerebral recorded EEG.
