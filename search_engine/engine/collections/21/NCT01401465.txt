    
      This is a randomized, multicenter, 2-way crossover study in subjects 12 years or older with
      perennial allergic rhinitis (PAR) to evaluate patient preference, satisfaction and efficacy
      of ciclesonide nasal aerosol versus mometasone aqueous nasal spray. A novel
      patient-administered assessment, developed and validated to measure patient satisfaction with
      and preference of intranasal corticosteroids (INCS) for the treatment of allergic rhinitis
      (AR), is utilized in this study.

      Subjects will be randomized to 1 of 2 treatment sequences:

      Sequence 1: Treatment Period 1 = ciclesonide nasal aerosol 74 mcg once daily for two weeks;
      Treatment Period 2 = mometasone nasal inhalation 200 mcg once daily for two weeks Sequence 2:
      Treatment Period 1 = mometasone nasal inhalation 200 mcg once daily for two weeks; Treatment
      Period 2 = ciclesonide Nasal aerosol 74 mcg once daily for two weeks
