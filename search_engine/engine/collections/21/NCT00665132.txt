    
      This is a prospective, single-center, open label study designed to evaluate the clinical use
      of the StimRouter (STR) as a peripheral nerve stimulation device for the treatment of chronic
      pain. The clinical study is proposed to serve as an evaluation of the preliminary StimRouter
      design, proposed implantation techniques, electrical stimulation parameters, and outcome
      measures for the StimRouter. The current study will utilize the median nerve (in the context
      of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS), status-post a single failed carpal tunnel release (CTR)
      surgery)as a model to represent the device's more general intended use as a peripheral nerve
      stimulator to treat chronic pain.
