      chemotherapy of breast magnetic resonance imaging was measured as 83%, specificity 47%, PPV
      47%, NPV 83%, and accuracy 74%. have.

      Most of the preoperative examinations after prior chemotherapy have the most confidence in
      the results of breast magnetic resonance imaging, but there will be other factors to predict
      this result as there will be differences in the actual postoperative pathology results. .

      After prior chemotherapy, total resection was performed, and cases where partial resection is
      possible in the postoperative pathologic results are prospectively identified and compared
      and analyzed.
