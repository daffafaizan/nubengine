    
      The investigators will address and accomplish aim 1 by taking the following steps:

        1. Conduct development focus groups with family caregivers of women with breast cancer.

        2. Develop the MCC-CG intervention prototype.

        3. Conduct feedback focus groups with family caregivers to evaluate the prototype.

        4. Revise the MCC-CG.

      To address and accomplish aim 2, the investigators will do the following:

        1. Conduct a pilot RCT to evaluate the feasibility of recruiting and retaining a sample of
           family caregivers.

        2. Assess the initial efficacy of the MCC-CG to improve knowledge of care options, goals of
           care communication, and other SM skills.

        3. Estimate power and determine the best measures for a large RCT testing the MCC-PT and
           MCC-CG together.
