      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose of vorinostat (SAHA)
           and capecitabine in patients with metastatic or unresectable solid tumors.

        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of this regimen in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Correlate the clinical effects with the pharmacokinetic effects of this regimen in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral vorinostat (SAHA) once or twice daily and oral capecitabine twice daily
      on days 1-14. Treatment repeats every 21 days for at least 6 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving a complete response (CR)
      receive 2 courses beyond documentation of CR. Patients achieving a partial response receive 2
      courses beyond documentation of best response.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of SAHA and capecitabine until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2
      of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. An additional 12 patients are
      treated at the MTD.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 3-4 weeks and then every 3
      months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 18-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 6-10
      months.
