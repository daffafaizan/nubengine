      based on age - will receive a single, weight adjusted dose of ZTI-01 via continuous IV
      infusion or syringe pump over a 1- hour (+10 min) period. Pediatric subjects participating in
      this study will be assigned to one of three cohorts based on age:

      Cohort 1: ≥ 6 years to <12 years (n=6 PK evaluable subjects) Cohort 2: ≥ 2 years to <6 years
      (n=6 PK evaluable subjects)

      Cohort 3: Birth to < 2 years (n=9 PK evaluable subjects), split into 3 subgroups:

      (3a) Birth (defined as full term: 37 weeks of gestations or greater) to < 3 mos, (3b) ≥ 3 mos
      to < 6 mos, (3c) ≥ 6 mos to < 24 months

      Cohorts 1 and 2 will be enrolled first with safety and PK data evaluated before enrolling the
      youngest Cohort 3. Blood for fosfomycin concentration measurement will be collected
      throughout the study. Safety will be assessed by monitoring adverse and serious adverse
      events based on medical history, vital signs, ECG, laboratory assessment and physical
      examination.
