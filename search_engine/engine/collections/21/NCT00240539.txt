      vaccine administered according to a 0, 1, 2, 12 month schedule in newborns of anti-hepatitis
      B envelope antigen positive (HBeAg+) and anti-hepatitis B surface antigen positive (HBsAg+)
      mothers. Results from the primary study have shown that the vaccine was immunogenic and
      protected neonates of HBeAg positive mothers against hepatitis B chronic carriage. The
      present study is carried out to evaluate the anti-HBs persistence and the prevalence and
      incidence of other hepatitis B markers (HBsAg, anti-hepatitis B core antigen {anti-HBc},
      HBeAg, Alanine aminotransferase/Aspartate aminotransferase {ALT/AST}), and the clinical
      significance of the HBsAg and anti-HBc positive cases observed during the long-term from year
      16-20. No vaccine will be administered during the long term follow up period.
