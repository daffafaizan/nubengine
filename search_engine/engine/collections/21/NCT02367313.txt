      hemisphere countries in North America and Central Europe. Sufficient patients will be
      randomized in order to recruit 150 subjects who are laboratory confirmed for human rhinovirus
      (HRV) infection. Depending on HRV PCR positivity rates, it is expected that randomization of
      250-480 subjects will be required to achieve this number of subjects with HRV infection.

      Appropriate asthma subjects will be screened up to 180 days prior to presentation at the
      study site with symptoms of presumed HRV infection for potential study inclusion on Study Day
      1. The study drug treatment period has a duration of 7 days, beginning on Study Day 1.
      Follow-up study visits to the clinic occur on Study Days 3, 5, 7, 14, 21, and 28 with a
      telephonic final safety follow-up visit conducted on Study Day 35. Thus, depending on the
      duration of the screening period, a subject's duration of participation can be estimated to
      last from approximately 37 days up to 215 days.
