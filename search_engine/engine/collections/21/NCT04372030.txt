      Belgium has put in place confinement measures on March 13th 2020 with the aim to reduce
      contagion related to Covid19 in the population and manage the number of patients to be
      treated in the hospital.

      However, some weeks after those confinement measures, health care professionals are worry
      about other patients than Covid19 since they have observed a significantly lower use of
      emergency services, cancellations of screening appointments, interrupted health care in
      patients with chronic conditions, disabilities, or mental health disorders.

      Objectives: to collect data on used, postponed and foregone medical care related to other
      health care needs than Covid19 during the confinement period in Belgium; to measure the
      magnitude of unsatisfied health care needs for various types of care; to identify the reasons
      explained postponed and foregone care

      Methods : the survey is made of about 50 questions collecting self-reported data on health
      care use and non-use for various types of care along with demographics, socioeconomics and
      health status characteristics during the confinement period . Data will be analysed with
      Stata 15 using statistical tests and regression models.

      Participants are collected via social media platforms and institutionnal mailing, and Belgian
      newspapers.
