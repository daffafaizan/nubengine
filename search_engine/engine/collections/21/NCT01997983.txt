      treatment of interstitial cystitis due to the seriousness and of adverse events, including
      dysuria, large post-void residuals, and the need for intermittent self-catheterization. An
      appealing alternative for BTX injection is intravesical instillation of BTX since the recent
      studies suggest that intravesically applied BTX acts through the afferent neuropathway
      involving sensory mechanism in the urothelium rather than the smooth muscle. TheraCoat core
      technology is based on a reverse thermal biodegradable gel (TC-3) (low viscosity at 5Â°C gel
      appearance at body temperature) for drug retention in the urinary bladder. Intravesical BTX
      instillation using TheraCoat gel is expected to increase treatment efficiency due to
      prolongation of treatment duration and consequently improving bladder exposure to BTX.

      Prior to instillation, the TC-3 hydrogel, in a liquid state, is mixed with BTX.TC-3 mixed
      with BTX is instilled to the bladder by a catheter. Following gel insertion to the bladder,
      the gel solidifies and forms a drug reservoir inside the bladder. Upon contact with urine the
      gel dissolves and is cleared out from the bladder Post instillation, patients followed at 2,
      6, 12 weeks thereafter.
