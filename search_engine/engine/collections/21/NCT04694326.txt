      medicine side-branch services at or over the age of 18 whose anthropometric measurements
      could be made. The sociodemographic properties and comorbidities of the patients were
      recorded. Their anthropometric measurements, fasting blood glucose and HbA1c measurements
      were made. Those with a previous diagnosis of diabetes were grouped as 'Known Diabetes',
      those without a known diabetes diagnosis but with an HbA1c value of â‰¥6.5% during
      hospitalization were grouped as 'Diabetes Unaware', and those with an HbA1C value of <6.5%
      were grouped as 'No Diabetes'. Whether or not there were differences among the 3 groups based
      on sociodemographic characteristics, anthropometric measurements and disease statuses was
      examined.
