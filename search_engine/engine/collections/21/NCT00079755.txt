    
      SGN-30 is the chimeric form of a novel murine monoclonal antibody (mAb), AC-10, that has
      specificity for CD30. The CD30 antigen has a very low expression on normal cells, but is
      expressed on malignant cells in Hodgkins disease and anaplastic large cell lymphoma.

      This study is designed to define the toxicity profile and antitumor activity of SGN-30 in
      patients with refractory or recurrent Hodgkin's disease and with refractory or recurrent
      anaplastic large cell lymphoma. Patients will receive 6 weekly intravenous (IV) infusions of
      SGN-30 followed by a 4 week observation period.
