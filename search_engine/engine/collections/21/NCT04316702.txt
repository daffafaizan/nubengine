      abuse, could be considered as the trigger for FMS. Each participant will be examined at the
      time of recruitment and a diagnosis of FMS will be verified, based on the updated 2016
      diagnostic criteria. In the current study the investigators will recruit patients not
      currently being treated with the target medications (Lyrica or Cymbalta).

      Patients will undergo randomization upon recruitment to one of the two study groups. One
      group will proceed to a course of HBOT treatment while the second group will commence with
      standard treatment for FMS, as outlined in the Israeli guidelines for the diagnosis and
      treatment of FMS .

      HBOT protocol: a total of 60 daily hyperbaric oxygen treatment sessions will be administrated
      5 days per week. 60 sessions will include exposure of 90 minutes to 100% at 2 Absolute
      atmospheres (ATA), with 5 minutes air breaks every 20 minutes.

      Pharmaceutical protocol: patients will be offered pharmacological treatment with one of the
      two medications currently licensed for the treatment of FMS in Israel, i.e. Cymbalta and
      Lyrica. Treatment with Lyrica will start at a dose of 75 mg twice a day, at morning and at
      bedtime, while treatment with Cymbalta will start at a dose of 30 mg a day (in the morning).
      After a period of 2 weeks, patients will be evaluated and dose will be adjusted as necessary
      and tolerated, up to the maximum dosage recommended for FM. Patients may also be switched
      from one medication to the other according to clinical judgment of the physician.
