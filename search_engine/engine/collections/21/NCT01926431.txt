      little is known about the impact of high-intensity exercise on central appetite regulation.
      This study aimed to investigate the effects of high-intensity exercise on both central and
      peripheral responses to images of food. Functional magnetic resonance techniques were used to
      assess the brains response to images of high and low calorie foods, following a short bout of
      high-intensity exercise. Appetite hormone concentrations were also measured. It was
      hypothesized that, due to the known effects of high-intensity exercise on appetite regulatory
      hormones and subjective appetite ratings, the activation of reward-related brain regions to
      visual food cues would be modulated following intense physical activity.
