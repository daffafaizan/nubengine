      3 patients in accordance with a traditional dose escalation 3+3 design, and the study will
      determine the MTD/RP2D of LNS8801. With permission from the Safety Review Committee (SRC), 2
      cohorts may be expanded to include 8 to 10 patients to further explore PK and
      pharmacodynamics. LNS8801 will be administered 3 days/week or once or twice a day during 21
      day cycle until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs.

      Safety assessments will be performed on all patients at screening, throughout their
      participation in the study, and for 30 days (90 days in combination cohorts) following the
      last dose of study drug. Throughout the study, imaging of tumors for evidence of tumor
      response and/or progression will be performed; biopsies will be performed on accessible
      lesions.

      After the RP2D of LNS8801 is identified and the safety of dosing LNS8801 with pembrolizumab
      has been established, up to 27 patients who have previously had confirmed clinical benefit
      from a PD-1/L1 therapy (defined by stable disease, partial response, or complete response by
      RECIST v1.1 for at least 16 weeks) but have since relapsed on the same PD-1/L1 therapy will
      be dosed in expansion cohorts.

      The expansion cohorts will determine the effects of LNS8801 alone and in combination with
      pembrolizumab. LNS8801 capsules or tablets will be administered orally for 3 (Day 1 to Day 3)
      or 7 consecutive days per week (once or twice daily) for each 21 day cycle until disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs. Pembrolizumab will be dosed at 200 mg every 3
      weeks with the first combination cohort to receive LNS8801 starting at the RP2D or one dose
      level below the MTD/RP2D determined in the monotherapy cohort. In the monotherapy expansion
      cohort, patients with a grade 3 immune related adverse event to prior immunotherapy will also
      be eligible for inclusion. Up to 100 patients will be accrued for this study at up to ten
      study sites in the United States.
