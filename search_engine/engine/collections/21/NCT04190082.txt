      groups using a computer-generated random assignment scheme. Five minutes before propofol
      sedation, remifentanil is administered intravenously at 0.025 μg / kg / min for analgesic
      effect and continued throughout the sedation process until just before the end of the
      procedure. Five minutes after remifentanil administration, 2 mg / kg of propofol mixed with 1
      mg / kg of lidocaine was administered over 30 seconds, followed by continuous infusion at 100
      μg / kg / min. Group C is monitored using UMSS(University of Michigan Sedation Scale) scores
      every three minutes, and group B is monitored using BIS score until deep sedation. Deep
      sedation is defined based on UMSS score of 3-4 and BIS score of 65 ± 5. If the sedation score
      is determined to have reached a deep sedation, a botulinum toxin injection is given by a
      practitioner blind to how to assess the depth of sedation. Independent investigator who is
      blind to group assignement assesses the oxygen saturation, respiration, and blood pressure,
      recovery time from sedation, and adverse events during and after sedation.
