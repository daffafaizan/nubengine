      degenerated LSS. Patients aged 50 years or older, had LSS will be invited to take part.
      Patients will be randomised divided into 2 arms. The participants in the intervention arm
      will have decompression surgery ; those randomised to the control arm will receive current
      standard conservative treatment methods.

      Patients were clinically assessed at baseline (the day of surgery or treatment), and at 6,12
      and 24 months afterwards. The primary outcome will be the pain release , categorised
      according to Oswestry disability index.
