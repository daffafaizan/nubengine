      developmental screening as part of routine well-child care, there have been many studies
      documenting that many pediatricians do not follow the AAP guidelines. One intervention that
      has the potential to improve care, especially for low-income families, is centralized,
      telephone-based developmental screening, and care coordination for families whose children
      have developmental or behavioral concerns. 2-1-1 Los Angeles developed such an intervention
      and this study aims to test its effectiveness, in partnership with a local community clinic,
      using a randomized, controlled study design. Investigators partnered with the Clinica Oscar A
      Romero, a federally-qualified health center in Los Angeles, serving predominantly low-income
      Latino families. Investigators hope to enroll up to 300 families in the study. Eligible
      families will have children ages 12 to 42 months of age who receive well-child care at the
      clinic. As investigators obtain informed consent and enroll families, they will randomize
      study participants into intervention and control groups. Intervention group families will be
      transferred to 211 Los Angeles to complete developmental screening over the phone, while
      control group families will go to their pediatricians for well-child care as usual.
