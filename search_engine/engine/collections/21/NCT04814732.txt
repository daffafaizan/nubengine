    
      Prior to any assessments, all subjects must provide a signed ICF. Prior to inclusion in the
      program, the patients must undergo all appropriate screening procedures to check for
      eligibility.

      Once eligibility is confirmed, patients will receive treatment with surufatinib 300mg, orally
      (PO), daily (QD). All patients will undergo continuous monitoring for safety until the end of
      treatment.

      There is no pre-defined duration of treatment for each patient. Patients will be treated
      until progressive disease (as defined by treating physician), unacceptable toxicity, death,
      withdrawal from program, the treatment becomes commercially available, or halting of product
      development.

      A follow-up clinic visit is recommended for all patients approximately 30 days after last
      dose of treatment to complete the final safety assessments, as applicable.
