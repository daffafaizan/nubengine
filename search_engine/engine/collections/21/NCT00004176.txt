      in patients with limited stage small cell lung cancer treated with amifostine chemoprotection
      plus chemotherapy and radiotherapy. II. Determine the tumor response to this regimen in these
      patients.

      OUTLINE: Course 1: Patients receive amifostine IV over 5 minutes daily, followed by
      radiotherapy twice daily Monday through Friday for 3 weeks. Patients receive cisplatin IV
      over 30-60 minutes on day 1, and etoposide IV over 1 hour on days 1, 2, and 3. Courses 2-4:
      Patients receive amifostine over 15 minutes on day 1, followed by cisplatin IV over 30-60
      minutes and etoposide IV over 1 hour every 3 weeks. Patients are followed at 1 month, then
      every 3 months until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 33 patients will be accrued for this study within 1-2 years.
