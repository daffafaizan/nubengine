      to the recent advance of treatment for variceal bleeding such as non-selective beta blocker
      (NSBB) added to endoscopic ligation further reduce rebleeding in cirrhotic patients, the
      rebleeding rate and mortality has a marked reduction. However, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
      is a distinct group characteristic of very poor prognosis in patients with portal
      hypertension when compared to those of liver cirrhosis only. Therefore, the investigators
      design a study to randomize patients with HCC and acute variceal bleeding to endoscopic
      treatment alone and combination with endoscopic treatment and NSBB. This is the two years
      study.
