      The lymphatics regulate the interstitial fluid by removing excessive fluid. It represents an
      extremely important step in the prevention of edema. The Fontan-Kreutzer procedure has
      revolutionized the treatment of univentricular hearts. However, it is associated with severe
      complications such as protein-losing enteropathy (PLE) and peripheral edema that may involve
      the lymphatic circulation.

      Hypothesis:

      Patients with a univentricular circulation have a reduced functionality of the lymphatic
      vasculature, which predisposes them to developing complications such as edema and PLE.

      Material and Methods:

      The functional state of lymphatics is investigated using near infrared fluorescence imaging,
      NIRF. The anatomy is described using non-contrast MRI and the capillary filtration rate is
      measured using plethysmography. The study population is patients with Fontan-Kreutzer
      circulation operated at Aarhus University hospital. Exclusion criteria is BMI>30 and age
      (years) < 18. The Fontan-Kreutzer group will be compared with an age, gender and weight
      matched control group of healthy volunteers.
