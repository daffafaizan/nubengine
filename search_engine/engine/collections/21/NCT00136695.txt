      gonadal androgen (male sex hormone) production. Several studies have explored androgen
      replacement, but the safety and efficacy of testosterone administration remains
      controversial. Aromatase inhibitors may provide a particularly useful way to restore normal
      androgen production in aging men.

      This study will recruit 150 male volunteers, 60 years of age or older, to be randomized to
      receive either anastrozole or a placebo for 24 months. Six visits are planned over the
      96-week treatment period.
