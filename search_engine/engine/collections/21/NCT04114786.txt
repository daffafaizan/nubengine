      or more commonly MRI) showing the disease at the central nervous system (CNS). Moreover,
      after surgical biopsy or resection, many Centers perform repeated post-operative imaging.
      Despite all prior imaging, when radiotherapy treatment is decided, all patients undergo
      another imaging study (CT simulation [CT-sim]) in which patient's head is placed in a
      reproducible position, and endure a moulding procedure to create a personalized plastic mask
      for securing the patient's head in a fixed position during the CT acquisition, and reproduced
      at the subsequent radiation treatment sessions. Typical wait times between moulding, CT-sim
      and the first radiation treatment is 3-7 days. If a method would be available to accurately
      recreate the patient's position during diagnostic imaging and reproduce it during radiation
      treatments without the need for a moulding session or CT-sim, the treatment process can be
      streamlined and wait times shortened for patients.

      Previous studies using 3D printing technology in radiotherapy (such as brachytherapy
      applicators) have shown that these employed materials are safe for use in clinical settings,
      and 3D printers can accurately produce devices of various shapes and sizes for clinical use.

      In this study, we propose a novel workflow in which patient's position at diagnostic imaging
      is reproduced with a 3D-printed patient-specific immobilization device, enabling the use of
      the same diagnostic imaging for planning purposes in lieu of dedicated simulation and
      moulding sessions, to decrease wait times for patients between diagnostic imaging and start
      of radiation treatment.
