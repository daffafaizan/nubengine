      receive optimal secondary prevention drug treatment without angioplasty, even after an acute
      coronary syndrome (ACS). Nevertheless, coronary angioplasty is rather frequently performed in
      such situations, presumably because, changes in the atherosclerotic plaque under drug
      treatment, have remained poorly described so far. Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) enables a
      precise description of coronary atheroma, better than the one provided by coronary
      angiography.

      The first objective is to assess by endo-coronary ultrasound, under optimal medical
      treatment, the evolution of atheromatous plaque (with stenosis <70%). The evolution will be
      appreciated after 12 months of treatment the percentage of atheromatous volume (PVA). The aim
      of the first secondary objective to evaluate, after 12 months of treatment, the evolution of
      the total atheromatous volume (VAT) and the standardized total atheromatous volume
      (standardized VAT). The Second secondary objective is to evaluate by endo-coronary
      ultrasound, the evolution of a stable atheromatous plaque. This analysis will be performed in
      patients with a second coronary lesion (atheroma plaque), resulting in less than 70%
      stenosis, and not being responsible for acute coronary syndrome. The evolution of the stable
      plate will be compared to the evolution of the unstable plate. Finally, the third secondary
      objective is to estimate the incidence of clinical events (death, acute coronary syndromes,
      ischemic stroke, revascularization, hospitalization for heart failure) within 12 months of
      the occurrence of an acute coronary syndrome managed by medical treatment optimal secondary
      prevention (without performing angioplasty).
