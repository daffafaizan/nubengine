      compensation in individuals with high and low traits (e.g. Autism, Anxiety, Depression
      traits, Alexithymia), high and low stress or protective factors in the environment (social
      network, early life stress) and different molecular genetic make-up. On the neural level,
      functional and structural connectivity as well as task-related BOLD activation will be
      assessed.
