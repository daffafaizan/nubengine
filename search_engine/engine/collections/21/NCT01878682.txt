      Prospective, single centre diagnostic evaluation. A single centre in the UK (Tameside
      Hospital NHS Foundation Trust). Patients will be recruited while attending Tameside Hospital
      NHS Foundation Trust Diabetes Clinic for a routine 12 month diabetes check up. Subjects will
      receive a Patient Letter to invite them to take part in the VibraTip study and a Patient
      Information Leaflet about the study enclosed within their Diabetes Clinic appointment. The
      study will aim to invite 180 patients to take part in the study and aims to recruit 100
      subjects into the study within 3 months. Subjects aged 18 to 75 (inclusive) of either sex
      with pre-existing diabetes (Type 1 and Type 2). The study aims to recruit approximately 50
      (50%) of patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy (both painful and painless) and 50
      (50%) without diabetic peripheral neuropathy. (we will go for even split if possible)
