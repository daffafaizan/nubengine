      chondrocytes that express growth factors to regenerate the damaged cartilage tissues.

      In the clinical trial Phase 2b, the investigators compared TissueGene-C to placebo during 6 -
      months trial with 54 outpatients who have had degenerative arthritis. The outpatients are
      assigned to TissueGene-C or placebo in 1:1 ratio, and will be monitored and recorded for
      improving clinical symptoms, sports activities, and function of the knee, and for the
      presence of adverse events.
