      colorectal cancer screening will be asked to collect a single stool sample for the Exact CRC
      screening test and for the commercially available FIT assay. Subjects will undergo
      colonoscopy within 90 days of enrollment. Representative histopathology slides from tissue
      biopsied or excised during colonoscopy and representative histopathology slides resulting
      from subsequent definitive surgery may be retrieved in order to be evaluated by central
      pathology to confirm diagnosis and staging.
