      are predominant, automated techniques of hyperinsufflation and in-exsufflation remain
      underused and undervalued. A single retrospective study suggests a decrease in the decline in
      respiratory function with regular manual hyperinsufflation.

      Evidence of a benefit of chest mobilization by hyperinsufflation by a controlled trial is
      therefore necessary before recommending its use in MS.
