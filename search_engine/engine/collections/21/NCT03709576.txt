      xenograft models of AML cell Line HL-60. Also this effect seemed to be synergistically
      enhanced by combining it with Azacitidine. In clinical arena, Pevonedistat has shown single
      agent activity in heavily pretreated patients with AML. In Study C15003, responses (complete
      responses [CRs] and partial responses [PRs]) were observed in a variety of patient settings,
      including post allogeneic transplant, therapy-related AML, and primary refractory AML,
      although some of the responses were of relatively short duration. Study C15009 is an ongoing
      phase 1b study evaluating the MTD of Pevonedistat on Days 1, 3, and 5 in combination with 75
      mg/m2 Azacitidine (administered on a 5-on/2-off [weekend]/2-on schedule) in a 28-day
      treatment cycle in patients 60 years of age or older with treatment naïve AML who are
      unlikely to benefit from standard induction therapy. As of 22 June 2017, enrollment had
      completed and 15 patients remained on study. As of 22 January 2017, preliminary data are
      available for 64 patients enrolled in the study who received at least 1 dose of Pevonedistat
      in combination with Azacitidine; these patients had completed a total of approximately 360
      cycles, with a median of 4 cycles of treatment In the dose escalation cohorts, 6 patients
      received 20 mg/m2 Pevonedistat, and 3 patients received 30 mg/m2. The most common events
      (reported by ≥ 25% of patients) were constipation (45%), nausea (42%), fatigue (39%), anemia
      (34%), febrile neutropenia (30%), decreased appetite (28%), and thrombocytopenia (27%). The
      MTD in this study was determined to be 20 mg/m2 Pevonedistat given on Days 1, 3, and 5, in
      combination with 75 mg/m2 Azacitidine given on Days 1 through 5, 8, and 9, in 28 day
      treatment cycles. A total of 45 (70%) patients experienced at least 1 SAE A total of 14 SAEs
      were reported for more than 1 patient, including: febrile neutropenia (16 patients);
      pneumonia (8 patients); pyrexia (4 patients); AML and sepsis (3 patients); and acute
      myocardial infarction, cellulitis, diverticulitis, dyspnea, embolism, hypoxia, mental status
      changes, multi-organ failure, and transaminase increased (2 patients each). A total of 19
      patients treated with Pevonedistat (either 20 mg/m2 or 30 mg/m2), discontinued from Study
      participation because of a TEAE. No other events leading to discontinuation were assessed by
      study investigators as at least possibly related to study drug treatment. 11 on-study deaths
      had been reported; none assessed as related to study treatment. A total of 31 patients
      experienced PR or better. Eighteen patients had a best response of CR, 4 patients had a best
      response of CRi, and 9 patients had a best response of PR. One patient in the 30 mg/m2 dose
      level group achieved a CR; all other responses occurred in patients treated with 20 mg/m2.

      The following studies are currently enrolling.

        -  Study 2001: A Phase 2, randomized, controlled Open-Label Clinical study of the efficacy
           and safety of Pevonedistat plus Azacitidine versus single-agent Azacitidine in patients
           with higher-risk myelodysplastic syndromes, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia and
           low-blast acute myelogenous leukemia.

        -  Study 1012: A phase 1/1b, Open-label Study of Pevonedistat (MLN4924, TAK-924) as Single
           Agent and in Combination with Azacitidine in adult East Asian patients with acute
           myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndromes

      Hence owing to the current knowledge of clinical and preclinical experience with Azacitidine
      and Pevonedistat alone and in combination, this combination appears feasible for testing in
      patients post-transplant with at very high risk of relapse.

      The Investigator proposes a study using a combination of Pevonedistat and Azacitidine for
      maintenance therapy after allogeneic HSCT for non-remission. Patients will receive up to five
      28 day cycles of the investigational maintenance therapy. Maintenance therapy will begin
      between days +30 to +45 post-transplant.
