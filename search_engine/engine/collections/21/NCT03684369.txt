      accomplished by recruiting two individuals with a similar level of disability at a time and
      flipping a coin (two persons present) to determine the group assignment (A or B) of the
      person who contacted the investigators first. The participants and outcome assessors will be
      blinded to group assignment. Both groups will receive the treatment (real or sham) during the
      first 4 weeks (3 sessions/week)and then there will be an 8-week follow-up period.
      Participants will be evaluated at weeks 0, 4, 8, and 12.
