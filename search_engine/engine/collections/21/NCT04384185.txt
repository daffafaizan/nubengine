    
      METHODOLOGY: A prospective randomized clinical trial with two types of intervention (lumbar
      exercise protocol and manual diaphragm therapy) will be carried out. The variables to be
      measured are pain, disability, mobility and kinesiophobia. It will be performed in two groups
      of 21 people who are of legal age, who have low back pain of more than 3 months duration and
      which is of non-specific origin.

      The patients will be randomized and divided into two groups A (control) and B (experimental).

      Group A will undergo an exercise protocol.

      Group B will undergo the same protocol plus manual therapy techniques on diaphragm muscle.
      Study participants will have treatment twice a week for 8 weeks, the first information
      session and the second measurement-evaluation session in the first week of treatment. In the
      following 3 weeks the session will last 40 minutes for both groups. In the 4th week the
      established measurements will be carried out again.
