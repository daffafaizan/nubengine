      I. Estimate the 2-year local recurrence rate for microwave ablation within a basket.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate whether microwave ablation offers treatment benefit for safety when compared to
      wedge resection using a contemporaneous database consisting of a commensurate surgical
      patient population.

      II. Evaluate whether microwave ablation offers treatment benefit for efficacy when compared
      to wedge resection using a contemporaneous database consisting of a commensurate surgical
      patient population.

      III. Evaluate whether microwave ablation offers treatment benefit for changes in patient
      reported outcomes when compared to wedge resection using a contemporaneous database
      consisting of a commensurate surgical patient population.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo standard care microwave ablation or wedge resection followed by
      contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) imaging at 1, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months. Patients
      also complete questionnaires over 10-15 minutes at baseline up to 9 months.
