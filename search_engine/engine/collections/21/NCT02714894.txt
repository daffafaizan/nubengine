    
      This study will be a prospective proton spectroscopy (1H-MRS) study designed to compare the
      levels of glutamate, glutamine, glx, and glutathione in age- and gender- matched patients
      with poor response to clozapine (URS), patients with good response to clozapine (non-URS),
      and healthy controls. Participants with schizophrenia who fail to respond to optimal
      treatment with at least two different non-clozapine antipsychotics (i.e. treatment-resistant
      schizophrenia [TRS]) and who are starting clozapine as part of their clinical care will be
      recruited. A sample of healthy controls will also be recruited. Participants with TRS will
      have two 1H-MRS scans. The 1H-MRS scan will be performed within 1 week and 12 weeks after
      clozapine initiation. Clinical assessments will be performed within 1 week of each 1H-MRS
      scan and after 6 weeks of clozapine treatment. Cognitive assessments will also be performed
      within 1 week of 1H-MRS scans. Healthy controls will also undergo two 1H-MRS scans with a
      12-week interval. Cognitive assessments will also be performed within 1 week of 1H-MRS scans.
