      unknown disease. However, carotid web lesions are associated with severe infarction involving
      the functional and vital prognosis of patients. The high rate of recurrence should lead to an
      identification of the lesion at the first event in order to propose a suitable preventive
      treatment. We believe that only a multicenter cohort will be able to analyze the
      characteristics of the pathology and propose studies on critical size samples. A national
      cohort would lead quickly to a consequent collection of cases. By including overseas
      departments and communities, notions of prevalence and characteristics within different
      populations could finally be studied. Participation to the cohort constitution will probably
      lead to sensitizing the various actors of the course of stroke care to the diagnosis and
      appropriate care of the carotid web.

      Patients will be selected by the Stroke Units which take part in the cohort constitution.
      Stroke Unit investigator will fill the WEPI online entry database. Clinical, imaging and
      outcome characteristics will be informed.

      In order to guarantee the quality of the cases collected, the validation of the carotid web
      lesion will be carried out by a pair of expert Neurologist - Neuroradiologist appointed
      within an expert committee. In case of no consensus, a third expert will resolve the
      disagreement.
