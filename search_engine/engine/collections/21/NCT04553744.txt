      I. Identify the practice patterns of sarcoma surgeons with respect to management of lymph
      node basins for extremity and trunk soft tissue sarcomas (ETSTS).

      II. Identify when surgeons would perform sentinel lymph node biopsy and/or lymph node
      dissection for ETSTS and if management differs for high-risk subtypes of sarcoma that are
      more likely to have nodal metastases.

      III. Identify differences in practice patterns between surgical oncologists and orthopedic
      oncologic surgeons.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants complete an online survey over 5-10 minutes asking how they would manage lymph
      node basins in the extremity sarcoma.
