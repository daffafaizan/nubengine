      chronic pain develop depression and people with depression develop chronic pain. In light of
      this coexistence it is not surprising that current best-evidence for depression and chronic
      pain shows significant overlap which includes primarily some type of cognitive intervention,
      aerobic exercise, and skilled delivery of medication including
      selective-serotonin-reuptake-inhibitors and/or membrane stabilizers. Current best-evidence
      regarding musculoskeletal pain provides strong support for Pain Neuroscience Education (PNE)
      to positively influence pain ratings, dysfunction, and limitations in movement, pain
      knowledge and healthcare utilization. Additionally, PNE has shown to powerfully influence
      psychosocial issues that powerfully influence pain and depression: fear-avoidance and pain
      catastrophization. Evidence is lacking in whether PNE could also influence depression
      ratings. The purpose of this study is to examine the immediate effect of PNE on pain,
      function, and depressive symptoms (using the Patient Health Questionnaire - PHQ-9) in
      patients attending PT for chronic low back pain (LBP).

      This will be a pre- and post-intervention convenience sample of consecutive patients with
      chronic LBP (pain > 6 months) meeting the inclusion criteria, attending outpatient PT. On
      initial examination, intake data and information will be collected prior to PNE and
      immediately following PNE.
