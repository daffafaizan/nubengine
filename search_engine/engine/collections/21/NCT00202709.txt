      reports, to give good results when applied for anxiety disorders. In this study 52 patients,
      with one or more of the diagnoses agoraphobia, social phobia and/or PTSD, where randomized to
      either treatment with TFT or a wait list. The treatment group all got treatment in one week.
      2 1/2 months later both the treatment group and the control group were tested on the same
      items as before the treatment started. After this evaluation phase the control group got the
      same treatment as the treatment or study group. Both groups were evaluated 3 and 12 months
      after treatment, the study group also 6 months after treatment. 4 patients were omitted
      because they changed groups. The study were performed from May 2002 until June 2003.
