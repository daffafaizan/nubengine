    
      This is a multicenter, open-label, phase I/II clinical trial that includes the dose
      escalation stage, dose confirmation stage and phase II stage.

      In dose escalation stage, a 3+3 trial design is adopted for dose escalation. Three dose
      groups are designed: 200, 250 and 300 mg/m2, once weekly; 28 days constitute a period. The
      drug is intravenously dripped for 60 minutes at the 1st, 8th and 15th day of each period. The
      safety, tolerability, PK and preliminary antitumor effect of PT-112 injection alone are
      evaluated. After Dose limited toxicity (DLT) evaluation is completed for all the patients in
      a dose group, the Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) will evaluate the safety and PK of the
      dose group based on the resulting data, and decide whether the dose should be escalated, and
      whether the dosing regimen or PK sampling points should be adjusted.

      After dose escalation is completed, the RP2D is selected by SMC for dose confirmation. Dose
      confirmation study will include approximately 10 patients each of the following six types of
      tumors:

      Group 1: Hepatocellular carcinoma Group 2: Gastric cancer Group 3: Colorectal cancer Group 4:
      Non-small cell lung cancer Group 5: Head and neck cancer Group 6: Breast cancer If it is
      difficult to include the patients with a specific type of tumor, or if the tumor is not
      sensitive to the efficacy of investigational drug, the SMC may discuss and decide to
      prematurely terminate inclusion of patients in that group.

      After sufficient data are obtained in dose confirmation stage, the SMC may discuss and decide
      to initiate phase II trial. Phase II trial plans to include about 40 subjects to evaluate the
      anti-tumor effect and safety of the monotherapy in patients with advanced HCC who have
      previously received only one systemic anticancer therapy.
