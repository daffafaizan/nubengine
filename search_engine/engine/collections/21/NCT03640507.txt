      preterm and term pregnancies admitted to Labor & Delivery unit for cesarean delivery with
      three arms. Randomization allocation would be performed in 1:1:1 fashion for vaginal
      preparation with chlorhexidine-alcohol, povidine-iodine, and saline washes. A saline wash
      group is included to determine if the act of cleansing the vagina with a sponge alone reduces
      bacterial colony counts.
