      growth and continued proliferation. The main energy regulatory system in eukaryotes and
      breast cancer cells is the AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) pathway. AMPK is triggered by changes
      in the AMP/Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) ratio thus impacting energy reserves and
      requirements. AMPK pathway closely interacts with the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt
      signaling pathway, affecting the downstream function of the master regulator mammalian target
      of rapamycin (mTOR). Activation of AMPK has been shown in vitro to result in inhibition of
      proliferation of various cancer cell lines.

      Utilizing a pre-surgical model, the investigator plans to conduct a pilot study of 40 women
      with newly diagnosed invasive breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in-situ (DCIS) who will
      receive oral metformin and atorvastatin daily in the interval between diagnostic breast
      biopsy and definitive breast surgery.

      The goal is to determine if dual combination treatment with metformin plus atorvastatin
      significantly impacts tumor-based markers, such as proliferation, and blood-based biomarkers.
