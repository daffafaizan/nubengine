      weight loss but improve or eliminate type 2 diabetes (T2D). Furthermore, it has become
      increasingly clear that glucose homeostasis, which is mainly determined based on insulin
      secretion and insulin resistance, improves through mechanisms additional to the secondary
      consequences of weight reduction. We aims to assess the effect of bariatric surgery on
      glucose control and kidney function, and excavate potential mechanism for those effects.
