      dependence pharmacotherapies when used in real-world clinical settings due to differences in
      patient selection, motivation, and adherence. To have a positive public health impact, a
      treatment must be accessible and acceptable to a broad range of smokers and effective under
      normal use conditions. The proposed project will assess primary care patients willingness to
      use cessation treatment and will determine the relative effectiveness of five cessation
      pharmacotherapies. This research builds on a primary care clinic-based recruitment strategy
      that was highly successful in a previous study. In the proposed research, 1320 primary care
      patients presenting for a regular outpatient visit will be recruited by medical assistants to
      participate in a free smoking cessation program and will be randomly assigned to one of five
      active pharmacotherapies: patch, lozenge, bupropion, patch+lozenge, and bupropion+lozenge (n
      = 264/condition). Interested participants who pass medical screening will pick up their
      medications at clinic pharmacies and will receive proactive telephone counseling from the
      Wisconsin Tobacco Quit Line. Assessment will be limited to preserve the generalizability of
      the findings, but select individual differences will be assessed pre-quit to validate
      algorithms (from Project 1: Efficacy) designed to optimize pharmacotherapy selection for
      smokers based on gender, level of dependence, and other factors. Smoking behavior will be
      assessed at six months and one year post-quit so that abstinence rates across pharmacotherapy
      conditions can be compared. The cost of incorporating tobacco dependence treatment into
      primary care will also be estimated.
