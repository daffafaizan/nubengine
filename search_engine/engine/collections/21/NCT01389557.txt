      and P. vivax). Malaria infected asymptomatic (from the mass screening) and symptomatic
      (malaria infected people attending the health center) people were enrolled in the study.
      Enrolled malaria infected subjects were treated with DHP and PQ according to the treatment
      regimen. The community was mass screened for malaria infections every 3 months and an
      incidence cohort screened every month for infections. The 3 aims were to look at malaria
      antibodies, haemoglobin levels and the incidence of malaria before and after the drug
      intervention.
