      frequently lead to a chronic cough that negatively impacts the quality of life (QOL) for
      patients and those around them. This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial
      to determine whether interferon-alpha, delivered in low doses via orally dissolving lozenges
      given 3 times per day for 4 weeks, can reduce the frequency and severity of chronic cough in
      patients with COPD or IPF. Cough frequency will be assessed via 24-hour digital audio
      recordings made prior to entry, and at weeks 2 and 4 of treatment. Cough severity will be
      assessed via a 100-mm visual analog scale questionnaire completed by the subject prior to
      entry and then weekly during treatment. Subjects will also complete questionnaires regarding
      cough frequency, duration and intensity, QOL, dyspnea, and antitussive medication usage
      weekly during treatment. All questionnaires will be repeated weekly during a 4-week
      post-treatment observation period to assess durability of response.
