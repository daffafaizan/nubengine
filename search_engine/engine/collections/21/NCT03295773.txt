      CT angiography and perfusion studies, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and digital
      subtraction angiography (DSA) respectively. Currently, the investigator applied 3-dimensional
      rotational angiogram (3DRA), a selective intra-arterial catheter-based imaging technique that
      had a superior spatial resolution compared with CT, MRI or DSA in depicting minute (<3mm)
      angio-architecture. Through 3DRA, the investigator could appreciate the ICAD patho-anatomy
      from a near-infinite number of planes, analyzing the stroke mechanisms and morphological
      changes with much improved precision. A neuro-radiologist and a stroke neurologist blind to
      time sequence will measure the geometric parameters and the luminal narrowing by WASID
      method.
