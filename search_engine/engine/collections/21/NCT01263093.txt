    
      Clopidogrel is rapidly converted to R-130964 by the enzyme cytochrome P450 2C19 (CYP2C19).
      Enrollment in the study was limited to participants with specific genotypes of the CYP2C19
      gene, including the *1/*1 genotype (CYP2C19 extensive metabolizers) and the *1/*17 or *17/*17
      genotypes (CYP2C19 ultra-rapid metabolizers). All primary and secondary objectives were
      limited to participants with the CYP2C19*1/*1 genotype.
