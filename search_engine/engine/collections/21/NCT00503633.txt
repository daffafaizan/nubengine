      parameters associated with these subtypes. The results will be useful in later developing
      interventions to improve sleep, reduce fatigue, and thereby enhance the quality of life of
      HIV-infected persons.

      A cross-sectional sample of 350 subjects will be recruited to describe relationships between
      biomarkers and insomnia subtypes. The initial assessment will include:

        -  wearing a wrist actigraph for 72 hours

        -  providing a fasting blood sample

        -  measuring blood pressure, height, weight, neck, waist, hip, and thigh

        -  completing questionnaires

        -  urine screening

      Depending on the results of the initial assessment, approximately 200 subjects will be
      followed every month by telephone to assess symptoms and every 3 to 6 months with study
      visits similar to the initial assessment. Findings from this longitudinal part of the study
      will characterize the development of insomnia, fatigue, and daytime sleepiness over time in
      patients living with HIV.
