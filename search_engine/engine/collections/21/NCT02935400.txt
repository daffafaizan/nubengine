      investigators will collect samples of blood, urine and feces from up to 50 participants with
      well documented acute porphyrias, at 2 expert sites that are members of the Porphyrias
      Consortium. Collection and analysis of these samples will be used to assess feasibility of
      performing such studies in humans with acute porphyrias, recognizing that these disorders are
      more heterogeneous than reproduced in animal models, and affect individuals who cannot all be
      studied simultaneously and in large groups. Therefore, we will assess the feasibility of
      methods for collecting, processing, storing and shipping samples at multiple study sites for
      later biomarker analysis. Larger and more definitive studies of biomarkers will be designed
      and implemented based on data and experience from this pilot-feasibility study.
