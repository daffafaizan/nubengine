      with the Problem Gambling Severity Index (PGSI). There will be 16 participants per group
      having two different groups (real stimulation and sham). Real stimulation involves the
      application of tDCS stimulation and sham condition is used as a control (similar to a
      placebo).

      Participants will attend 8 weekly sessions where they receive tDCS stimulation for 20
      minutes, while complete CANTAB cognitive tasks that measure cognitive processes such us
      control inhibition and risk-taking behaviour. Electroencephalography (EEG) activity will be
      measured before and after tDCS.

      Participants will also complete cognitive questionnaires (Pathological Gambling adapted
      Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (PG-YBOCS), Gambling Symptom Assessment Scale (G-SAS)
      and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for gambling cravings.
