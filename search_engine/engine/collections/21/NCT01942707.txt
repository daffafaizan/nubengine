      effective and long-lasting treatment. This leads to large weight losses leading to large body
      deformities due to excess skin and subcutaneous tissue. The most common post-bariatric
      plastic surgery is post-bariatric abdominoplasty which main complication is seroma. PURPOSE:
      To evaluate the effect of Scarpa fascia preservation in seroma reduction. METHODS: A total of
      46 patients were randomly assigned to two groups. One group will have the Fascia Scarpa
      removed and in the other the Fascia Scarpa will be preserved. The drains will be removed when
      the volume is less than 30 ml in 24 hours. The primary outcome will be the volume of total
      drainage obtained in the drains of the abdominal region. Secondary outcomes will be the
      length of time the drains remain and the presence of seroma assessed by ultrasound on the
      twentieth postoperative day.
