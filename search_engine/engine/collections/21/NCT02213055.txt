      year in the U.S., most commonly affecting children 3 to 11 years of age. Despite common
      perceptions, head lice crawl, and cannot hop or fly. For this reason, transmission occurs
      most often by human head-to-head contact, and much less commonly by the sharing of personal
      items such as hats, coats, combs, or towels. Because head lice feed on human blood, they
      cannot live on pets and are only viable 1-2 days on surfaces other than the human head.
