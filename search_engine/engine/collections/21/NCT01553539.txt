      I. To evaluate the response rate of chemotherapy-refractory sarcomas to 20 mg per day of
      single-agent Ang(Angiotensin)-(1-7) or 10 mg per day of single-agent Ang-(1-7) if excessive
      toxicity is observed at the 20 mg dose.

      II. To evaluate toxicities associated with single-agent Ang-(1-7) when given to patients with
      chemotherapy-refractory sarcomas.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess time to progression (TTP) and overall survival (OS) in patients treated with
      Ang-(1-7).

      II. To evaluate accumulation of Ang-(1-7) after 21 days of continuous treatment and quantify
      changes in plasma levels of angiogenic peptides including placental growth factor (PlGF).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive therapeutic angiotensin-(1-7) subcutaneously (SC) once daily in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every
      6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.
