    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine the effect of two different doses of AVE0005 (vascular endothelial growth
      factor [VEGF] Trap [ziv-aflibercept]) treatment on the progression-free proportion at 8 weeks
      in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma who had previous treatment with a tyrosine
      kinase inhibitor (TKI).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the effect of AVE0005 (VEGF Trap) treatment on objective response rate in
      patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma who have had previous TKI treatment.

      II. To describe progression-free survival among patients who undergo dose escalation
      following progression on low-dose AVE0005 (VEGF Trap).

      III. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of AVE0005 (VEGF Trap) in patients with
      metastatic renal cell carcinoma who have had previous treatment with a TKI.

      OTHER PRE-SPECIFIED OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the circulating levels of VEGF AVE0005 (VEGF-Trap) complex and correlate it
      with clinical activity.

      II. To evaluate the modulation of specific angiogenesis-related protein expression by AVE0005
      (VEGF Trap).

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM A (Higher dose of VEGF Trap): Patients receive a higher dose of ziv-aflibercept
      intervenously (IV) over 1 hour on day 1.

      ARM B (Lower dose of VEGF Trap): Patients receive a lower dose of ziv-aflibercept IV over 1
      hour on day 1.

      In both arms, courses repeat every 14 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients receiving treatment on Arm B may crossover and receive
      treatment on Arm A at the time of disease progression.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for 1 year.
