      This trial is a prospective, Phase IV 2 arm trial exploring the efficacy and safety of using
      either AFC or AMH to guide the starting GONAL-f® dose for the stimulation treatment of
      subjects undergoing ART.

      Throughout the trial period and before the start of a routine ART cycle, investigators will
      propose the trial to their potential subjects. All subjects who agree to participate in the
      trial must sign a consent form, irrespective of whether or not they ultimately agree to have
      their dose determined by the study protocol. Eligible subjects will be randomised in blocks
      of 4 at each site via a computer generated random number list to either the AFC guided arm
      (control) or the AMH guided arm (treatment). The starting doses of GONAL-f® for each arm will
      be based on the study algorithms, using AFC or AMH guidance.

      The investigator will then enter initiate ovarian stimulation with an individualised GONAL-f®
      dose for that specific subject. This will be maintained for the first 5 days of stimulation
      after which the dose can be modified based on investigator decision and in accordance with
      the site's routine clinical practice.

      Trial Population

      Female partners of infertile couples requiring Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART)
      treatment.

      Data Analysis and Statistics

      The primary end-point proportion of patients with desired number of retrieved oocytes (8-12)
      will be compared between the 2 arms using the chi -square test. The null hypothesis will be
      that there is no difference between the 2 arms in primary end-point, with the p level set at
      p=0.05. The secondary end-points will also be compared between the 2 arms using either the
      Student's t test or anova test.
