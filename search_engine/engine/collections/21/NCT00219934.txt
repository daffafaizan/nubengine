      and C serologies.

      Individuals in Group B will not have HIV-1 antibody testing, resistance testing, or Hepatitis
      B and C serologies performed, as these would have been performed as part of their current
      protocol. Individuals electing to initiate antiretroviral therapy will obtain standard HAART
      as prescribed by their physicians.

      Group A subjects will be seen at Weeks 4, and 12 ,then every 12 weeks until week 48, then
      every 24 weeks until week 96. If treated during acute and early infection, then they will be
      seen every 48 weeks thereafter for 5 years. If untreated during acute and early infection,
      then they will be discontinued from the study.

      Group B participants who have been followed for less than 96 weeks will be seen every 12
      weeks until week 48, then every 24 weeks until week 96.

      Participants currently enrolled beyond week 96 who were treated during acute and early
      infection, and whose treatment was uninterrupted, will be seen every 48 weeks. If
      participants were not treated during acute and early infection, or treatment was interrupted,
      then they will be discontinued from the study.
