      leave itself, fears and believes regarding return to work, and a low self-esteem have been
      identified as independent predictors of extended sick leave. Previous data suggested that
      multidisciplinary rehabilitation programs, including physical activities and psychobehavioral
      management, should decrease sick leave duration in chronic LBP. However these programs are
      heavy (at least 4 weeks long), and are often proposed to patients at the end of the
      management (over 6 months after the beginning of symptoms). Another approach could be to
      propose a shorter multidisciplinary program (for example 5 days long), earlier in the history
      of LBP to break the vicious circle as soon as possible. The target population could be people
      suffering from subacute LBP with sick leave duration between 4 and 24 weeks.
