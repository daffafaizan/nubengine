      with failure. Dietary factors such high sodium/low potassium diets contribute to the
      development of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) such as atherosclerosis and high blood pressure
      (BP). This is important as CVD is the number one killer in the U.S. While the role of these
      two nutrients on BP is widely accepted, their impact on the vasculature has received less
      attention. Endothelial dysfunction, characterized by impaired dilation, is an important
      non-traditional risk factor for atherosclerosis. Evidence supporting potassium's beneficial
      role on vascular health remains unclear although it may be more effective in the presence of
      a high sodium diet. A purported mechanism responsible for sodium-induced vascular dysfunction
      is overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) resulting in reduced nitric oxide (NO)
      production/bioavailability. Additionally, high sodium diets have been shown to stiffen the
      endothelium. This investigation will evaluate the vascular effects of dietary potassium
      during a high salt diet including its impact on sodium-induced oxidative stress and
      endothelial cell stiffness.
