      Depression has serious personal and social consequence. Sleep disorders are common in
      patients with depression. Resolving sleep disturbances in depression may prevent worsening of
      symptoms and relapse.

      Music listening is widely used as a sleep aid. A study from the Cochrane library shows
      consensus that music may be helpful to improve sleep quality in insomnia. It remains unclear
      if music listening is helpful to patients with depression as it is to a broader population.

      A randomized controlled trial address the use of music as a supplementary treatment to
      improve sleep in depression.
