      routine cataract surgery will have mono- or bilateral implantation of hydrophobic acrylic
      monofocal toric intraocular lens PODEYE TORIC. The device under investigation is a
      hydrophobic acrylic monofocal toric intraocular lens (IOL) manufactured by the sponsor of
      this study. The refractive power of the lens has a spherical and a cylindrical component. The
      IOLs will be implanted in the course of routine cataract surgery and will benefit to patients
      suffering from cataract development and showing pre-existing corneal astigmatism.

      If only one eye qualifies for toric lens implantation due to small amount of pre-existing
      corneal astigmatism, one eye will be implanted with PODEYE TORIC and the contralateral eye
      will be received an implantation with the monofocal parent lens PODEYE.

      The study purpose is to determine safety, rotational stability, refractive and visual
      performance, contrast sensitivity, patient satisfaction and PCO rate after mono- or bilateral
      implantation of PODEYE TORIC intraocular lens.

      In total approx. 23 patients will be recruited for this clinical study and undergo mono- or
      bilateral implantation of PODEYE TORIC intraocular lens. The maximum time between 1st and 2nd
      eye implantation is 30 days.

      Subjects participating in the trial will attend a total of maximum 12 study visits over a
      period of 630-780 days (preoperative, operative, 1-2 days, 7-14 days, 30-60 days, 120-180
      days, 330-420 days and 630-780 days postoperative visits). Subjects would have the option for
      unscheduled visits if required medically.
