      I. To assess the feasibility of expanding HER2 specific T cells ex vivo for infusion into
      subjects who have advanced HER2 overexpressing cancer.

      II. To assess the toxicity associated with infusing autologous HER2 specific T cells into
      patients using either a single dose of cyclophosphamide or ONTAK (denileukin diftitox) prior
      to T cell infusion.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To investigate to what extent HER2 specific T cell immunity can be boosted in individuals
      treated with a single dose of cyclophosphamide of ONTAK followed by infusion of autologous
      HER2 specific T cells.

      II. To investigate the potential anti-tumor effects of HER2 specific T cells in patients with
      HER2 overexpressing advanced-stage cancers.

      III. To evaluate how long tumor antigen specific T cell immune augmentation persists in vivo
      after a single dose of cyclophosphamide or ONTAK followed by infusion of autologous HER2
      specific T cells.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of ex vivo-expanded HER2-specific T cells. Patients
      are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups.

      GROUP A: Patients receive low-dose cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) on day -1 and 3
      escalating doses of autologous ex vivo-expanded HER2-specific T cells IV over 30 minutes on
      days 1, 10, and 20.

      GROUP B: Patients receive ONTAK (denileukin diftitox) IV over 1 hour on day -1 and 3
      escalating doses of autologous ex vivo-expanded HER2-specific T cells IV over 30 minutes on
      days 1, 10, and 20.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.
