      place in cooperation with smoking clinics of 5 centres in Germany (Heidelberg, Stuttgart,
      Munich, Chemnitz, Berlin). A total number of 800 smokers is calculated to participate in the
      study. After enrollment participants are randomized in one of the three intervention groups:
      (A) "Advice only", (B) "Brief intervention", (C) "Intensive therapy". The follow up includes
      a telephone interview 3 months after the last intervention, and two visits at the smoking
      clinics after 6 and 12 months with biochemical validation of the smoking status by
      measurement of the exhaled carbon monoxide and the concentration of cotinine in an urine
      sample respectively. The primary endpoint is the continuous abstinence rate after 12 months.
      Several secondary endpoints are determined amongst others the continuous abstinence rate
      after 6 months, point prevalence cessation rates after 6 and 12 months, life quality, weight
      gain, predictors of a successful cessation attempt.
