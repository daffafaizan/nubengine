      intensity exercise intervention on maternal and offspring vascular health. Participants will
      be recruited in the first trimester (T1, 10-12 weeks' gestation), and will be randomized to
      either a 24-week, structured and partially supervised, gym-based exercise intervention
      beginning in trimester 2 (T2) through to trimester 3 (T3), or a non-exercise control group
      who receive normal clinical care. The inclusion of this non-exercise control group is
      critical in allowing us to create an understanding of the adaptation of the vascular system
      during a normal (non-exercising) pregnancy, and also determining the physical activity and
      sedentary behaviour engaged in during normal healthy pregnancy. All participants will be
      asked to attend the laboratory at Liverpool John Moores University on 4 separate occasions
      synchronised with the end point of each trimester and then within four weeks of delivery.
      Maternal vascular health, physical activity, sedentary behaviour and fitness will be assessed
      during each time point throughout pregnancy while the fourth visit will comprise of an
      offspring vascular assessment. The investigators will also gain information on delivery
      outcomes including pre-term delivery, complications during labour, induction of labour,
      caesarean sections and post-partum haemorrhage via medical notes at the Liverpool Women's NHS
      Foundation Trust.
