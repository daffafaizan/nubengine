      glucocorticoid, but most of the patients, hemolytic events will frequently recurred after end
      of treatment or during the gradual reduction in dosage of prednisolone. As a result, many
      patients will finally accepted long-term glucocorticoids or other immunosuppressive drugs.
      How to reduce the relapse rate of AIHA is still difficult. Levamisole（LMS）is a
      immunoregulator.Recent studies have shown LMS has been widely used to treat autoimmune
      diseases ,such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus and idiopathic
      thrombocytopenic purpura. The purpose of this study is to determine whether LMS combined with
      prednisolone can further improve the efficacy，extend the remission duration and reduce the
      dosage of prednisone for newly diagnosed warm antibody autoimmune hemolytic anemia.
