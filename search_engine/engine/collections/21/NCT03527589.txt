    
      This is a prospective, open label post market study to evaluate the long-term safety and
      effectiveness of prostatic artery embolization (PAE) using Embosphere Microspheres. Up to 500
      patients with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) due to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)
      will be enrolled in this single arm post market study. All patients at sites who meet
      eligibility criteria will be offered participation. Long term effectiveness of PAE on LUTS
      will be evaluated by International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) at baseline, 3 months, 12
      months, 24 months and 36 months. Safety will be assessed by evaluating device or
      procedure-related adverse events at the same time points, plus at 4 weeks following
      embolization. Erectile function will be assessed at baseline and 12 months by Sexual Health
      Inventory for Men (SHIM) score. Additional treatments for refractory or recurrent LUTS due to
      BPH post prostatic artery embolization will also be recorded.
