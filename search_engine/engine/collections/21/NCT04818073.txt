      not achieve a functional benefit from robotic finger training. For this study, we would like
      to determine if and the extent of finger proprioception can be improved through targeted
      robotic proprioceptive training and the response to subsequent robotic finger movement
      training. We would also include imagining studies via MRI/fMRI/EEG to provide more insights
      to determine who responds best to proprioceptive training.
