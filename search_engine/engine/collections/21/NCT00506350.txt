    
      The present study is designed to evaluate the reactogenicity and immunogenicity of one or two
      booster administrations of an influenza pandemic candidate vaccine (GSK1562902A) in adults
      aged between 19 and 61 years, previously vaccinated with 2 doses of a pandemic candidate
      vaccine. The persistence of antibodies will be analysed at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months.
