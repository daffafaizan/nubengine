      (CBSM) intervention (relaxation, stress awareness, cognitive restructuring, coping skills
      training, interpersonal skills training) versus a single-day psycho-educational seminar
      (general information about stress and coping) in women who have recently had surgery for
      breast cancer but have not yet started adjuvant therapy. The study evaluates the effects of
      CBSM on psychosocial adaptation (includes measures of negative adaptation [distress and
      social disruption] and positive adaptation [benefit finding and positive affect]) at 6-month
      and 12-month follow-up. The study also evaluates the effects of CBSM on physiological
      adaptation (includes levels of PM serum cortisol and T-helper-type 1 (Th1) cytokine
      [interleukin-2, IL-2, and interferon-gamma, IFN-g, production after anti-CD3 stimulation of
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC).
