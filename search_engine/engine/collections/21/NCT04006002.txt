      physiologic changes that occur with gastric restrictive procedures for weight loss and to
      determine the differences in metabolic profile between the two restrictive procedures. We
      also want to identify the rate of Gastro Esophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) in patients
      undergoing gastric restrictive procedures for weight loss.
