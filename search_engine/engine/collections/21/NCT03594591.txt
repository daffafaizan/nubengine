      hypothesis is that chronic hyperglycemia causes an increase in the microcirculation on the
      carotid artery wall (evaluating vasa vasorum by contrast-assessed carotid ultrasound) and
      retina (evaluated by angio-OCT). Furthermore, the reestablishment of normoglycemia would
      decrease this microcirculation, which could trigger hypoxic and ischemic changes,
      accelerating preclinical atherosclerosis. The primary outcome is to describe the
      microangiopathy in both territories in 20 patients with type two diabetes and chronic
      hyperglycemia (basal), and to evaluate the changes after the reestablishment of normoglycemia
      (at 1, 3 and 6 months). Additionally, clinical, laboratory, diet and biomarkers will be
      evaluated.
