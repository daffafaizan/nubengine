      elastography for the determination of cirrhosis in patients with autoimmune hepatitis
      compared to the diagnosis of cirrhosis made on Laparoscopic guided liver biopsy. Patients
      referred for liver biopsy and transient elastography with a clinical diagnosis of AIH
      followed in the liver clinic of the Department of Gastroenterology at the UKE were
      prospectively included in the study.

      Inclusion criteria were as follows: Confirmed diagnosis of AIH based on the diagnostic
      criteria revised by the International Autoimmune Hepatitis Group 2008 (20): 1. liver related
      autoantibodies, 2. hypergammaglobulinaemia, 3.typical histological findings and 4. absence of
      viral markers. Exclusion criteria were morbid obesity (BMI > 40), ascites, ileus or subileus,
      peritonitis, pregnancy, extrahepatic cholestasis and a severe inflammatory flare of AIH.

      Blood liver tests including gamma-globulines, IgG, IgM, liver related autoantibodies (ANA,
      AMA, LKM, SMA, SLA) and viral markers (HBsAg, Anti HBs, Anti HBc, Anti HCV, Anti HAV) were
      performed before LB.

      Each patient underwent abdominal ultrasound to exclude extrahepatic cholestasis prior to TE
      and minilaparoscopic liver biopsy. TE and minilaparoscopy were performed by physicians
      blinded to the results the other within a period of less than 3 months.
