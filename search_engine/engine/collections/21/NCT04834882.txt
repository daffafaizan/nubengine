      paramedical staff. The covid-19 pandemic may generate more stress and increase the risk for
      burnout.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate burnout (prevalence and intensity) and stress of among
      healthcare workers in COVID-19 units and non COVID-19 units. We also explore the supportive
      coping strategies need to reduce their stress and burnout.
