    
      Single-center, prospective, pilot study. Aim of this study is to assess the feasibility of
      coronary ostia re-engagement beyond transcatheter aortic valve (TAV) stent through a
      transfemoral access in 300 consecutive patients undergoing transfemoral TAVR with
      pre-procedural computed tomography assessment available.

      The possibility to selectively cannulate each coronary, the amount of time and contrast will
      be evaluated in each patient before and after implantation of either balloon-(SAPIEN 3) or
      self-expanding (Evolut R/PRO, Acurate Neo or Portico) TAVs, thus generating an internal
      comparator.
