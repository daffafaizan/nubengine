      solutions may cause a relative reduction in hemoglobin (Hb) concentration, a situation that
      is termed 'dilutional anemia'. Such hemodilution may lead to an iatrogenic reduction in
      oxygen-carrying capacity and the development of organ dysfunction. Paradoxically, large
      amounts of fluids that are administered with the aim of increasing oxygen delivery (DO2), as
      is frequently done as part of perioperative goal-directed therapy; this may lead to an actual
      decrease in the DO2 due to a decrease in Hb concentration.

      Another potential parameter that may reflect the development of dilutional anemia is
      methemoglobin (MetHb), a form of Hb with reduced ability for oxygen binding. Experimental
      studies showed that dilutional anemia may lead to up-regulation of perivascular nitric oxide
      synthase (NOS) and increase NOS-derived nitric oxide (NO) leading to local vasodilation and
      oxidization of Hb to MetHb. MetHb may potentially serve as a biomarker of 'anemic stress'
      associated with reduced tissue perfusion during acute hemodilution.
