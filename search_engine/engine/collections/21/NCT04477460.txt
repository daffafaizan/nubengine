      appearance of life-threatening choking, pallor, cyanosis, and limpness in infants. These
      common events are resource-intensive and current management approaches inadequately address
      persistent symptoms. Infants with BRUE commonly have oropharyngeal dysphagia with aspiration,
      which is a modifiable risk factor for persistent symptoms, but there are no studies
      determining the mechanism behind this swallowing dysfunction and if swallowing interventions
      reduce morbidity. This is a prospective, longitudinal cohort study of infants who experienced
      brief resolved unexplained event receiving thickened feedings compared to those not receiving
      thickened feedings over 1 year.
