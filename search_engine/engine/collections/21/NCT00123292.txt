    
      This clinical trial is designed as an open-label, dose-escalating, single-centre trial of
      weight-adjusted dose regimens of microplasmin administered intra-arterially as an infusion to
      patients with acute peripheral arterial occlusion. Patients who meet all inclusion criteria
      and none of the exclusion criteria will be administered study drug for up to 4 hours.
      Different dose regimens will be evaluated in an ascending-dose fashion; an infusion will be
      administered for up to 4 hours.
