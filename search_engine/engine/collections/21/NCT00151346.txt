      the pregnant woman who arrives in advanced labor and does not have much time for the
      anesthetic to have its effect. This has been extended recently to women in all stages of
      labor because of its rapid and excellent control of pain. Recent case series comparing CSE
      with traditional epidural have shown a slight difference in the rate of hypotension and fetal
      bradycardia, with the CSE technique having a higher rate of both of these side effects. This
      study will compare the two techniques in a prospective, randomized method.

      The aim is to compare the maternal and fetal effects of two neuraxial block techniques for
      pain control during labor, to document blood pressure changes in upper and lower extremities
      pre- and post- block placement, and to document side effects (e.g. pruritus) and patient
      satisfaction with both techniques.
