      analgesic use over time, with particular attention to THC/CBD content, HIV outcomes, and
      adverse events. The study will include a cohort of 250 HIV+ and HIV- adults with (a) severe
      or chronic pain, (b) opioid analgesic use, and (c) new certification for medical cannabis.
      Over 18 months, participants will have 7 in-person visits every 3 months and 39 web-based
      questionnaires every 2 weeks. Data sources will include questionnaires; medical, pharmacy,
      and Prescription Monitoring Program records; and urine and blood samples. Over each 2-week
      time period (unit of analysis), the primary exposure measure will be number of days of
      medical cannabis use, and the primary outcome measure will be cumulative opioid analgesic
      dose. Qualitative interviews will also be conducted with a subgroup of 30 participants to
      explore perceptions of how medical cannabis use affects opioid analgesic use. Qualitative
      findings will help understand the reasons underlying the findings of the cohort study.
