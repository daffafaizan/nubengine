      effective interventions for this common cause of pain and disability.

      Because parenteral salmon calcitonin (sCT) has positive effects in canine experimental OA,
      this phase IIa, randomized,placebo-controlled, double-blind trial evaluates the safety,
      tolerance and clinical efficacy of an oral formulation of sCT in patients with OA.

      Patients receive a tablet containing either a placebo, 0.5 mg sCT or 1 mg sCT that they have
      to take every day in the morning 15 minutes before breakfast for 3 months.
