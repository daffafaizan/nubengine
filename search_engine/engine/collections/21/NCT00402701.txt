      objective of Healthy People 2010. However, parents' concerns about safety have been
      identified as a barrier that prevents their children from walking to school. A walking school
      bus (WSB) addresses these concerns by providing a supervised period of physical activity on
      the way to school. A WSB is a group of children led to and from school by responsible adults
      who walk together along a set route. The peer-reviewed literature on active travel to school
      is sparse. We evaluated a WSB program, to test the hypothesis that it would increase the
      proportion of children walking and decrease the proportion of children driven by car to
      school.

      Comparison: We conducted an 18-month controlled, quasi-experimental trial at three public
      elementary schools in Seattle, Washington. The intervention school was assigned a WSB
      coordinator who dedicated 10-15 hours/week establishing WSB routes and implementing school
      activities on pedestrian safety. Each "bus" had its own set route to school from different
      locations in the surrounding neighborhoods and was staffed by several parent leaders. The two
      control schools received standard Seattle Public Schools resources on walking to school
      including "Safe Route Maps," a traffic and safety committee, and school safety patrols. The
      primary outcomes were the proportions of children who walked with and without an adult or
      were driven by car to school. We used the test for independent proportions to compare the
      proportion of children transported to school at the intervention versus control schools.
