      investigated by measuring several parameters in induced sputum. The study will start with a 2
      week run-in period in which the planned 60 patients inhale isotonic saline once daily. This
      period is followed by a 4 week treatment period where 30 patients inhale AAT for peripheral
      deposition and 30 patients inhale AAT for bronchial deposition. Six patients in each group
      will be asked to collect spontaneous sputum at home.

      Twenty-five milligrams of AAT will be deposited at one of the two target sites using the
      AKITAÂ® device. The inhalation should take place in the evening between 18.00 and 23.00 h.

      Patients will inhale saline once daily for 2 weeks (run-in period) followed by 4 weeks of
      once daily inhalation of AAT. Induced sputum will be collected at visits to the clinic at the
      start of the run-in, at the start of AAT treatment, and at 2 and 4 weeks after the start of
      AAT treatment.
