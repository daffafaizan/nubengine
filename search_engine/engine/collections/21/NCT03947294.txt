    
      This study aims at evaluating the ease of use, the stability and the feasibility of EE
      measurements with the new IC device in spontaneously breathing adult patients with
      malnutrition, cancer, surgery or haemodialysis, using the canopy and face mask modes.

      Patient data will be obtained from the medical records before EE measurement. EE measurement
      will be performed sequentially with the Q-NRG® and the IC device currently used in each study
      center. Patient data input, calibration, installation of face mask or canopy hood on the
      patient, and EE measurement recording will be performed according to the procedure stated in
      their respective user manual. Time needed to perform EE will be calculated afterwards from
      the time the IC device is turned on to EE measurement reaches a steady state with a variation
      ≤10%.

      In a subset of 15 subjects, accuracy of gas composition (O2 and CO2) measurement by the
      Q-NRG® will be assessed by comparison with the reference method consisting in a mass
      spectrometer.
