      I. Determine the safety and feasibility of combining bortezomib with gemcitabine and
      carboplatin in patients with advanced or recurrent non-small cell lung cancer.

      II. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of bortezomib administered in combination with
      gemcitabine and carboplatin in these patients.

      III. Correlate results from laboratory studies on patient tissue and serum specimens with
      potential predictors of response in patients treated with this regimen.

      IV. Determine, preliminarily, the response of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of bortezomib.

      Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8, carboplatin IV over 15-30
      minutes on day 1, followed 1 hour later by bortezomib IV over 3-5 seconds on days 1, 4, 8,
      and 11. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with a clinical or radiographic response may
      continue receiving bortezomib beyond 6 courses.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of bortezomib until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, at least 10
      additional patients with chemotherapy-naive disease receive treatment as above with the MTD
      of bortezomib.

      Patients are followed for survival.
