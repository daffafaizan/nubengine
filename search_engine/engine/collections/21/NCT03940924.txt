      training (HIIT) combined with resistance training (RT) program on gut microbiota and body
      composition changes in postmenopausal women.

      30 postmenopausal women will be randomly assigned to HIIT + RT (n= 15) group or Control group
      (n=15).

      HIIT+RT: Each subject performed HIIT protocol consisted of repeated 60 cycles of speeding up
      for 8 s followed by pedalling slowly for 12 s (20min) Then they performed a single set of 10
      exercises with 1 or 2min resting period between exercises. The set consisted of 8-12
      repetitions at about 80% maximum repetition (1RM).

      Control group : (no training program) Subjects will keep their life style.

      Faecal microbiota and body composition will be measured before and after the intervention (3
      months).

      The investigators will examine the effects of HIIT + RT programs on:

      Body composition : total-abdominal and visceral fat mass, total fat free mass and muscle mass
      Faecal concentration of short chain fatty acids Total fat free mass (and appendicular fat
      free mass) (DEXA) Glycemic profile (plasma HbA1c, plasma glucose, plasma insulin) Lipid
      profile (TG, HDL, LDL, total cholesterol) Aerobic capacity (VO2 max) Muscular capacity
      (fatigability, isometric and dynamic strenght)
