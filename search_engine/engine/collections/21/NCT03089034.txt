      patients with advanced CHF, the investigators propose to enrol a cohort of 300 patients with
      advanced CHF (New York Heart Association class III and IV), survey the participants every 4
      months for a period of two years or till they die, whichever is earlier. The goal of this
      cohort study is to better understand the relationship between patient preferences, health
      care access, utilization, costs, and quality of life, and to identify strategies to improve
      the EOL experience for these patients. It is also important to recognize the significant role
      of the family in medical decision making in Asia. Previous studies from Singapore reveal that
      patients want their families to be involved in the decision making process. The role of the
      family in decision making is consistent with the Chinese culture of interdependency,
      obligations and filial piety. Decisions regarding treatment are often made by family
      caregivers, sometimes with little or no input from patients. Given this reality, the
      investigators will also enroll caregivers of the patients to evaluate their role in decision
      making for treatment of patients.
