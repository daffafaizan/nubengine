      crossover design.

      A total of 8 subjects will be enrolled in the study. The duration of participation for each
      subject will be approximately 36 days, not including a Screening Period of up to 30 days.

      Each treatment period, subjects will be admitted to the study site on Day -1 and observed
      through the morning of Day 3 (48-hour post-dose assessment). Over 2 treatment periods,
      subjects will receive each of the following treatments as a single dose orally, under fasting
      conditions, per the randomization (4 subjects per treatment in each treatment period:

      Treatment A - 15 mg of LGD-6972 as capsules

      Treatment B - 15 mg LGD-6972 as solution

      Serial blood samples will be collected through 48 hours following each dose to determine the
      concentration of LGD 6972 in plasma. Safety assessments will also occur during this time.
      Subjects will be discharged from the study site after the 48 hour assessments and return to
      the study site on Days 4, 7, and 14 for follow up procedures. Subjects will return to the
      study site for the second treatment period after an additional 7 days. Subjects will be
      discharged from the study after returning to the study site on Day 14 of the second treatment
      period.
