      Primary

        -  Determine response in patients with previously treated metastatic or unresectable
           gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma treated with bortezomib,
           fluorouracil, and leucovorin calcium.

      Secondary

        -  Determine time to progression and overall survival of patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a non-randomized, multicenter study.

      Patients receive bortezomib IV over 3-5 seconds on days 1, 8, and 15. One hour after
      completion of bortezomib, patients receive leucovorin calcium IV and fluorouracil IV followed
      by fluorouracil IV continuously over 46 hours on days 1 and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-37 patients will be accrued for this study.
