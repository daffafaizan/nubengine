      fatty acids on the bioavailability of docosahexaenoic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid.
      In-vitro studies have shown that long-term steric stabilization of an o/w-emulsion is
      obtained by arresting the oil droplets in a gelatin continuous gel matrix. The emulsion was
      also stable upon dissolution of the gel matrix at physiological conditions in-vitro and is
      hence referred to as a gastric stable emulsion (GSE).

      In the bioavailability study, healthy young students were recruited and presented two
      different single-dose treatments of fish oil containing 5 grams of ω-3 fatty acids; one group
      receiving the fatty acids in traditional soft gel capsules, whereas the other group received
      the fatty acids using the GSE technology. Time resolved (2 - 26 hours) blood plasma analysis
      after intake of this single dose ω-3 fatty acids revealed significantly increased AUC0-26h
      and Cmax of EPA and EPA + DHA when administered as GSE compared to traditional soft gel
      capsules.
