    
      This is a monocentric randomized controlled trial of superiority of LMA use in GI endoscopic
      procedures. Randomization is centralized. The study is single blind (patient). The study is
      no-profit. Every patients undergoing scheduled ERCP and endoscopic ultrasound will be
      screened and consecutive eligible patients will be enrolled. Subjects will be allocated
      according to a simple randomization list. The study starts after randomization and ends after
      discharge from the recovery room. After peripheral venous catheter insertion and vital
      parameters monitoring, patients will receive propofol TCI with a tailored target between 4
      and 6 mcg/ml. The treatment group will receive LMA insertion and End-Tidal Carbon Dioxide
      (ETCO2) monitoring throughout the procedure. In case of hypoventilation, with an ETCO2 above
      50 mmHg, the patient will be supported as necessary with PSV. The control group will not
      receive any airway device, according to the standard treatment. At the end of the procedure,
      both group will receive a laboratory testing (peripheral arterial sample), when the patient
      is still sedated. Vital parameters monitoring will continue in recovery room. Patients will
      be discharge as usual with an Aldrete score > 9.

      Data will be collected during the procedure and in recovery room. Data will be stored in
      electronic database without mention to patient's name.
