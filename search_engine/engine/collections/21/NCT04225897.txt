    
      This is a multicentre, 3-part study to evaluate safety, tolerability, PK, PD, and antiviral
      effect of single and multiple dosing of RV521 in infants hospitalised due to RSV LRTI.

      The clinical study consists of 3 parts, the third part (Part C) is optional:

        -  Part A is an open-label, multicentre, single dose study in infants hospitalised with RSV
           LRTI (Cohorts 1 & 2)

        -  Part B is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre multiple dose
           study in infants hospitalised with RSV LRTI (Cohorts 3, 4 & 5)

        -  Part C is a randomised 1:1, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre, multiple-dose
           study in infants hospitalised with RSV LRTI I The number of subjects enrolled in Parts A
           and B of the study will depend on the safety and PK data from the group of subjects
           enrolled in specified age cohorts and the subsequent recommendation of the Data Safety
           Monitoring Committee (DSMC).

      The DSMC may recommend a dose adjustment (either a reduction or an escalation) and/or regimen
      adjustment (Part B only) for subsequent subjects because of the observation of an unexpected
      safety/tolerability profile and/or differences between the observed and predicted exposure
      resulting from a specified dose of RV521.
