      volunteer basis. The participants meeting the inclusion criteria will be randomized to either
      the treatment arm (intrawound Vancomycin-saline + IV antibiotics) or control arm (intrawound
      saline + IV antibiotics alone) by site in a 1:1 ratio. A sample size calculation using STplan
      determined that 405 patients per arm is required to reduce overall infection rate from 3.5%
      to 0.5% (80% power, Î±=0.05, two-tailed). Final sample size per arm will be 410 after
      generously accounting for loss to follow-up, non-compliance, and unrelated death.

      The primary outcome will be a binary Yes/No on if IPG explantation due to infection was
      required within 6-months post-surgery.

      This is a superiority trial and the investigators hypothesize intrawound Vancomycin-saline +
      IV antibiotics is superior to intrawound saline + IV antibiotics alone. An intention-to-treat
      analysis will be applied in a blinded manner once all patients have completed the trial and
      the database is locked.

      The results of this trial will not only be applicable to neurosurgery, but also spine and
      cardiology.
