    
      TREATMENT PLAN

      Treatment will consist of 3 main phases: remission induction, consolidation [only for
      patients with any central nervous system (CNS) disease and/or testicular involvement], and
      continuation.

        -  Induction (6-7 weeks).

        -  Consolidation for participants with CNS involvement or those with testicular disease
           only (10 weeks).

        -  Reintensification - Participants with residual disease any time after induction therapy
           may receive 1-2 cycles of re-intensification therapy and may proceed to allogeneic stem
           cell transplant if suitable donor is available.

        -  Continuation Therapy (98-120 weeks).

        -  Intrathecal Chemotherapy (days 1 and 15; if needed also on days 8 and 22)

      TREATMENT SCHEME

      T lymphoblastic lymphoma: bone marrow/peripheral blood (BM/PB) involvement (MDD/MRD):
      Diagnosis: less than 1%; Day 8: +/- (Stratum 1)

        -  Induction

             -  Single dose of Cyclophosphamide

             -  Steroid: prednisone

        -  Continuation: 98 weeks

      T lymphoblastic lymphoma: BM/PB involvement (MDD/MRD): Diagnosis: equal to or greater than
      1%; Day 8: - (Stratum 2)

        -  Induction

             -  Fractionated Cyclophosphamide

             -  Steroid: prednisone

        -  Continuation : 98 weeks

      T lymphoblastic lymphoma: BM/PB involvement (MDD/MRD): Diagnosis: equal to or greater than
      1%; Day 8: + (Stratum 3)

        -  Induction

             -  Fractionated Cyclophosphamide

             -  Steroid: prednisone and dexamethasone

        -  Continuation: 120 weeks

      B lymphoblastic lymphoma: Stage I-III (Stratum 1)

        -  Induction

             -  Single dose of Cyclophosphamide

             -  Steroid: prednisone

        -  Continuation: 98 weeks

      B lymphoblastic lymphoma: Stage IV or testicular (Stratum 2)

        -  Induction

             -  Fractionated Cyclophosphamide

             -  Steroid: prednisone

        -  Continuation: 98 weeks

      Patients with CNS or testicular involvement will receive Consolidation therapy prior to
      continuation therapy and receive extended maintenance therapy (120 weeks).

      Any patient with detectable disease (MRD, bone marrow or biopsy of residual mass) at the end
      of induction may be considered for reintensification and/or hematopoietic stem cell
      transplantation (HSCT).
