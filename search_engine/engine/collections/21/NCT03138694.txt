      our team has shown the benefits of conservative treatment with only BHCG (Beta-Human
      Chorionic Gonadotropin) monitoring, proving that a vast number of patients will have a self
      resolution without the need for any further medical intervention. In addition, our working
      hypothesis is that this process in contrast to Methotrexate is a more physiologic one with
      less inflammatory and necrosis reaction.

      OBJECTIVE To measure and compare the size of the ectopic mass and monitor BHCG levels of
      women treated with Methotrexate and those that had a self resolution process of their ectopic
      pregnancy.

      Investigators aim to prove that the mass will have an enlargement trend after Methotrexate in
      contrast to being stable or decrease in size with conservative treatment.

      PATIENTS & METHODS Patients that will be offered to join the study are those that will be
      with either treated by a Methotrexate injection or those that had signs of self resolution
      with our "Watchful waiting" protocol.
