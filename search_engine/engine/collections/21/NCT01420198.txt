    
      In this randomized controlled trial, 308 participants (born in Iraq, living in Malm√∂, Sweden
      and at high risk of type 2 diabetes) will be allocated to either a culturally adapted
      intervention or a control group. The intervention will consist of 10 group counseling
      sessions focusing on diet, physical activity and behavioral change over 6 months, and the
      offer of exercise sessions. Cultural adaptation includes gender-specific exercise sessions,
      and counseling by a health coach community member. The control group will receive the
      information about healthy lifestyle habits provided by the primary health care center. The
      primary outcome is change in fasting glucose level. Secondary outcomes are changes in body
      mass index, insulin sensitivity,physical activity, food habits and health-related quality of
      life. Measurements will be taken at baseline, after 3 and 6 months. Data will be analyzed by
      the intention-to-treat approach. The cost-effectiveness during the trial period and over the
      longer term will be assessed by simulation modeling from patient, health care and societal
      perspectives.
