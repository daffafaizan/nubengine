      activities of daily living. Allergen immunotherapy or vaccination consists of the therapeutic
      administration of allergen extract. The efficacy of allergen immunotherapy in asthma is
      modest, however immunotherapy remains the only known disease modifying therapy for allergic
      asthma. Because the exact mechanism through which immunotherapy works is unclear, a greater
      understanding of the mechanism of action of allergen immunotherapy is needed before modern
      immunopharmacologic methods can be applied to increase its therapeutic efficacy. This goal of
      the study is to determine the effects of allergen immunotherapy on allergen specific T cell
      responses. This is an open label study in which allergen specific CD4+T lymphocyte responses
      will be monitored before, during and after 12 weekly injections of maintenance immunotherapy,
      allowing the study of both the induction as well as decay of these changes. Immunotherapy
      will be employed in a rush/cluster schedule consisting of the serial administration of
      rapidly increasing doses of allergen delivered subcutaneously over a 2 day period (rush),
      followed by more gradually increasing weekly injections over 2-6 weeks (cluster), during
      which time the subject is brought to a maintenance allergen dose, which will then be
      repeatedly administered on a weekly basis. Immunological endpoints will consist of the
      frequency and cytokine profile of allergen specific T cell responses as measured by
      intracellular cytokine staining and the measurement of in vitro induced T cell cytokines by
      real time RT-PCR. Ten allergic asthmatic subjects will be enrolled in the therapeutic arm of
      the study.
