      conducted at baseline, 12 weeks and 24 weeks. The intervention will be delivered in Scotland
      and Gloucestershire. Participants will take part in one RaceRunning session each week for a
      period of 24 weeks. The content of the sessions will be standardised for all training groups
      and will consist of a warm-up, coordination (drills), sprint and endurance training, and
      cool-down. The training program will be adapted to the athlete's ability and fitness. The
      project objectives are to examine the feasibility of delivering and acceptability of
      participating in RaceRunning as a community-based intervention for young people with
      moderate-to-severe CP, including fidelity to and safety of the intervention. Secondly, to
      examine the feasibility of conducting a definitive study of RaceRunning including exploring
      recruitment and retention over 24 weeks, acceptability of data collection methods and rate of
      outcome measure completion, and acceptability and quantity of missing data relating to health
      economic data collection tools. Finally, to examine the variability and patterns of change in
      outcomes over 24 weeks in order to determine a primary outcome measure and calculate sample
      size for a future study.
