      arthroplasty (THA) in young and active patients. Although there have been substantial
      improvements in THA, bearing surface wear and osteolysis are major factors limiting the
      durability of THAs in young and active patients. During the last decade, alternative bearings
      have been developed, including highly cross-linked polyethylene (HXLPE) and
      ceramic-on-ceramic (COC) bearings, with the potential to reduce wear and osteolysis in
      younger, more active patients.

      Despite contemporary cementless THA with COC bearings giving excellent clinical and
      radiographic outcomes, there is concern about squeaking, fracture of the ceramic head or
      acetabular insert or fretting and corrosion (trunnionosis). Although HXLPE have been reported
      to reduce polyethylene wear, there is concerned about a potential decrease in toughness,
      tensile strength and resistance to the propagation of fatigue cracks in a long-term
      follow-up.

      Several noncomparative studies of COC and COP THA have reported promising results in terms of
      Harris hip scores, radiographic findings, and survival rates, yet we are aware of no
      long-term comparative clinical studies with a COC THA and a COP THA in the same younger
      patients. This study aimed to see if long-term Harris hip scores and Western Ontario and
      McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis (WOMAC) score better in younger patients with a COC THA
      compared with those with a COP THA.
