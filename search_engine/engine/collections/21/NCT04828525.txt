      given dexamethasone treatment (course of 16 doses, 0.15 mg/kg/dose every 6 hours) in addition
      to antibiotic treatment. Control group will be given 16 doses of 0.9% normal saline in
      addition to antibiotic treatment. Management and treatment will be conducted according to
      clinical condition and laboratory findings as for routine institution protocols. It should be
      noted that the regular institutional management of children enrolled for the study will not
      be changed due to our research.
