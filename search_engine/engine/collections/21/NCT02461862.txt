      still little used by women. It is considered a long action reversible contraception (LARC).
      Among the many reasons for this resistance stands the fear of pain, the complications that
      can occur during the insertion.

      Objective: To evaluate the intensity of pain on outpatient insertion of IUD. In addition to
      evaluating changes in vital signs and detect which are the factors associated with pain on
      outpatient insertion of IUD. Methods: Cross Sectional Retrospective study of 285 procedures
      of outpatient insertion of IUD.

      Inclusion criteria were age older than 18 years, cervical cytology without abnormalities,
      classification for Category 1 or 2 of the WHO eligibility criteria for IUD. The criteria for
      non inclusion were patients with cardiac arrhythmias and gynecological disorders. The
      insertions of IUD were conducted on an outpatient basis without the use of painkillers.

      Evaluation of vital signs ( blood pressure and radial pulse) was performed pre and five
      minutes after the procedure. The pain assessment was performed using the scale visual analog
      (VAS), five minutes after the procedure.Correlations of the pain's score with clinical
      factors as age, parity, BMI, hysterometry, previous vaginal delivery were also performed.
