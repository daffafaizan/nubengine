      incidence of ankle ligament injuries has been correspondingly increased. Various surgical
      methods have been reported for chronic ankle instability. Of these methods, the modified
      Brostrom procedure is currently used most frequently, and its excellent treatment outcomes
      have been reported. If there are any methods for obtaining a strong ligament fixation force
      which are both technically simple and safe, such methods would shorten the operative time and
      be helpful for surgeons with little experience in managing chronic ankle instability to
      obtain excellent treatment outcomes. In recent years, a procedure using a suture anchor,
      which is used for various types of ligament or tendon reconstructions, has been frequently
      performed. To date, however, few studies have reported clinical outcomes of suture anchor
      techniques and comparisons of clinical results between suture anchor techniques and other
      procedures. Given the above background, we prospectively compared the clinical outcomes
      between the bone tunnel and suture anchor techniques in the modified Brostrom procedure for
      chronic lateral ankle instability.
