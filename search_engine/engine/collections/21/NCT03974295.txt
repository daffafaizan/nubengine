      implantation, we sought to explore this benefits in in vitro fertilization treatments by
      limiting the study cohort to those having frozen embryo transfer with programmed hormone
      replacement for endometrial preparation and some form of parenteral progesterone
      supplementation. This design will enable us to overcome the concerns and limitations of all
      previous studies. In this study, patients will be randomized into two groups, group 1 will
      have their frozen embryo transfer followed by current standard of care (no unprotected
      vaginal intercourse until pregnancy test) and group 2 will have their frozen embryo transfer
      followed by unlimited unprotected vaginal intercourse starting 24 hours after transfer. The
      primary endpoint of the study will be ongoing clinical pregnancy

      rates in the two groups while secondary endpoints will include implantation, positive
      pregnancy, miscarriage and live birth rates. Overall, this study aims to investigate whether
      the elimination of current universal pelvic rest protocol in patients undergoing frozen
      embryo transfer will help optimize pregnancy outcomes.

      This study aims to evaluate whether allowing unprotected vaginal intercourse 24 hours after
      frozen embryo transfer will result in higher ongoing clinical pregnancy rates in comparison
      to having participants abstain from unprotected vaginal intercourse until pregnancy test
      (10-14 days after frozen embryo transfer).
