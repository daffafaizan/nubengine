      known that changes in glucose concentration in the skin can be registered by means of
      optical, spectroscopic measures in subjects with diabetes. The precision of such measures,
      however, so far has been unsatisfactory.

      This study evaluates the changes in skin glucose concentration by means of a non-invasive
      glucose sensor and compares these to blood glucose concentrations during a glucose clamp. It
      is also known that with hyperglycemic blood glucose concentrations there is a consecutive
      hyponatraemia. This study shall evaluate to which extent and how fast serum electrolyte
      parameters change when establishing a hyperglycaemic blood glucose level. This shall help
      estimate which impact these changes in electrolytes have on the non-invasive glucose sensor.
