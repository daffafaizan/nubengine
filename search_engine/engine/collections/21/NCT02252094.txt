      nursing in the prone position. However, the best lung protective strategy is not currently
      established and using smaller ventilation volumes than standard lung protective ventilation
      suggest lung recovery is improved.

      Application of smaller ventilation volumes requires extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal,
      using a device similar to a dialysis to remove carbon dioxide directly from the blood. One
      such device in the Prismalung, it removes blood through a catheter, much like a dialysis
      catheter, pumps it through a gas exchange cartridge which removes carbon dioxide. The gas
      exchange cartridge functions in a similar way to a dialysis filter, except it allow gases to
      pass through, unlike dialysis filters which allow passage of fluid and small molecules.
