      issue. This project will utilize metabolomics approaches to identify biomarkers in the blood
      that respond consistently to insufficient sleep. The overall goal of this project is to use a
      discovery and targeted approach to identify specific small molecules in plasma as candidate
      biomarkers of insufficient sleep. Investigators will conduct a controlled in-laboratory
      insufficient sleep protocol where participants receive 2 days of 5 hour sleep opportunities
      per night on 2 separate occasions. Plasma will be collected for metabolomics analyses every 2
      hours (across 24 hours) during scheduled wakefulness at baseline and during insufficient
      sleep. Participants will complete the insufficient sleep protocol twice, separated by 23 days
      of sufficient sleep, to identify which plasma metabolites consistently change during
      insufficient sleep. Investigators anticipate these findings will be the first step in
      establishing validated biomarkers of impaired sleep that will advance our understanding,
      assessment and management of health consequences and symptoms associated with insufficient
      sleep.
