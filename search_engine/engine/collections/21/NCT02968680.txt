      I. To study the imaging feasibility of peri-tumoral administration of sonazoid ultrasound
      contrast agent for assessment of sentinel lymph node (SLN) detection in melanoma.

      II. To compare SLN detection between sonazoid ultrasound and standard of care (SOC)
      technique.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the sonazoid ultrasound (US) imaging appearance of lymph nodes which are shown
      to be involved with metastatic disease.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive sonazoid intradermally (ID) and undergo ultrasound imaging. Patients also
      undergo standard of care sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB).

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 24 and 48 hours.
