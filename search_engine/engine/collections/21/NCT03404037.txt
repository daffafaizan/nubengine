      and progression of coronary artery calcification independent of traditional cardiovascular
      disease risk factors in T2DM subjects with known coronary artery disease. So, Measurement of
      serum ES levels can improve the diagnosis of coronary artery calcification and could be
      useful as a high sensitive marker for the presence and progression of atherosclerosis in T2DM
      patients.
