      orthodontic tooth movement during alignment with fixed appliances in the mandibular arch.

      The secondary aim of this study is to determine whether patients treated with OrthoPulse
      demonstrate root resorption beyond what is commonly expected during orthodontic treatment.

      The study also aims to collect confirmatory evidence on the safety of the device.
