      ocular pathologies such as central serous chorioretinitis1, age-related macular degeneration,
      diabetic retinopathy, and myopia. Moreover, the recent development of new imaging methods
      allows the exploration of the normal and pathological processes of the choroid. In
      particular, the Enhanced Depth Imaging (EDI) mode in Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT)
      provides cross-sectional imaging of the choroid and in vivo measurement of its thickness.
      Understanding the factors that would modify the choroidal thickness would make it possible to
      better understand the pathophysiology of many chorioretinal pathologies and would help to
      guide therapeutics in the future.

      However, systemic changes induced by physical activity, and in particular changes in systolic
      blood pressure, could be responsible for changes in the choroidal blood flow and thus in the
      choroidal thickness. The study consists in testing ten patients who will perform an exercise
      testing as part of the practice of a sportive activity. Patients will undergo an OCT in EDI
      mode to measure the retrofoveolar choroidal thickness during the exercise.

      Each OCT image will be coupled to the evaluation of blood pression and heart rate.

      Patients are treated in the usual way but the study is an interventional study, with minimal
      risks and constraints, because of the imaging (OCT image in EDI mode).
