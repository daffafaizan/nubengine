      worldwide. In recent years, there has been the emerging popularity of strategies aimed at
      early discharge (ED) in such a field of spinal surgery. However, more data are required to
      corroborate the adaptation of ED in spinal surgery. The benefits of ED in lumbar fusion have
      not yet been validated by large cohort studies. This study undertake to determine the effects
      of ED on readmissions and reoperations in lumbar fusion.

      This population-based retrospective cohort study used admission records of Taiwan's National
      Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD). The NHIRD comprehensively contains de-identified
      claim data of Taiwan's National Health Insurance (NHI) program which covers 99% of the
      Taiwanese population and contracts with 97% of the providers of healthcare services in
      Taiwan. In order to protect privacy, the National Health Research Institute (NHRI)
      re-compiled, validated and de-identified the medical claims and finally made the data
      publicly available for medical researchers in Taiwan. In the admission database, the
      investigators are able to trace comprehensive information on the insured subjects, including
      gender, date of birth, dates of clinical visits and hospitalization, the International
      Classification of Diseases (Ninth Revision) Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes of
      diagnoses, ICD codes of surgical procedures, etc.
