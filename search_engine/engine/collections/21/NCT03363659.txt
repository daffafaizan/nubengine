      cancers. The current standard of care for glioblastoma includes maximal safe resection
      followed by radiotherapy and temozolomide, which results in a median progression-free
      survival of less than 7 months, and median overall survival (OS) of less than 15 months.
      Moreover, patients with unmethylated glioblastoma respond poorly to this current standard
      treatment. This clinical trial evaluates the potential role of continuous, upfront use of
      Disulfiram in combination with Copper gluconate in enhancing temozolomide effect in the
      treatment of unmethylated GBM patients.
