    
      Thirty nine subjects with at most 5% of the sites for GI= 2 (gingival health) will be
      randomized into three groups with different frequencies in self-mechanical control of plaque:
      Group 12 hours, 24 hours and 48 hours. The exams of plaque index, gingival index, probing
      depth, bleeding on probing, clinical attachment level and gingival crevicular fluid will be
      performed at baseline, 15, 30, 60 and 90 days.
