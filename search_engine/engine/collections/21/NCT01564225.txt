      subjects. The size and scope of the study design are consistent with a drug development
      program in an ultra-rare disease and supported by the absence of safety concerns in a GLP
      non-human primate toxicology study. All subjects must meet entry criteria including
      documentation of an EDA mutation. Mirroring the conditions of use anticipated for the
      XLHED-affected newborn study, the adult cohort study incorporates a multiple-dose regimen
      associated with maximal efficacy in the newborn canine model. Primary outcome measures will
      be safety, tolerability, immunogenicity and pharmacokinetics (PK). While current data does
      not support a likelihood of clinical benefit for the XLHED-affected adult subjects, assays of
      pharmacodynamic/biologic activity are incorporated into the study design as exploratory
      objectives.
