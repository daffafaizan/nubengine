      I. To assess the rate of vitamin D deficiency in breast cancer patients who experience
      myalgias, arthralgias and/or joint stiffness following initiation of adjuvant letrozole
      treatment.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if there is a correlation between letrozole serum levels and the development
      of myalgias, arthralgias and/or joint stiffness.

      II. To assess if vitamin D supplementation may alleviate myalgias, arthralgias and/or joint
      stiffness associated with letrozole in those subjects with vitamin D deficiency.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive letrozole orally (PO) once daily (QD). Patients, who experience muscle pain,
      joint pain, or joint stiffness that requires an intervention and who are found to be vitamin
      D deficient, also receive calcium PO and vitamin D3 PO. Treatment continues for up to 28
      weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
