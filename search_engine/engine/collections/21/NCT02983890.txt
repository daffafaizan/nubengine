      drug interaction because the effects of warfarin is downregulated to a degree as to where it
      might cause patients to have thrombotic events.

      A potential explanation to this is namely dicloxacillin increases the activity of certain
      drug metabolising enzymes metabolising warfaring which in turn decreases the concentration of
      the drug in the blood and the therapeutic effect.

      Cocktail study is the golden standard to investigate as to whether there is changes is P450
      enzymes as a result of drug-drug interactions.

      The cocktail consists of Midazolam, omeprazole, tolbutamide, caffein and dextromethorphan
      which is well known markers for these enzymes. These markers are safe, have specific (enzyme)
      metabolism and has been used in several studies with no Serious Adverse reactions reported.

      By measuring the Concentration of the drug and its metabolites in plasma / Urine before and
      after treatment with dicloxacillin we will estimate AUC (area under the curve) and test our
      hypothesis/primary end point of whether there is change in AUC for Tolbutamide (CYP2C9)
