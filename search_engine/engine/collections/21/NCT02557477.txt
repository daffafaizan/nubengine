      one-way crossover (placebo to active treatment) for an additional 3 months (Period 2).
      Participants were randomized to receive three Omega 3/6 capsules twice daily (corresponding
      to a daily dose of 558 mg EPA, 174 mg DHA, and 60 mg gamma-linolenic acid) or identical
      placebo capsules (palm oil). All daily doses were taken at home supervised by the parents.
      All outcome measures were assessed at baseline and at the 3- and 6-month follow-up visits.
      The participants were mainstream schoolchildren in the 3rd school year (aged 9-10 years).
      Exclusion criteria were continuous supplementation of Omega-3 fatty acids for periods longer
      than 1 month during the previous year, significant medical conditions (e.g. diabetes,
      epilepsy), intellectual disability, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)
      diagnosis, psychoactive medication, or substance use.
