      conventional adenoma (CA) and the serrated polyp. A relationship between the human gut
      microbiota and colorectal cancer has been shown; however, its relationship to the different
      early precursors of colorectal cancer is understudied. This study tested, for the first time,
      the relationship of the gut microbiota to specific colorectal polyp types.
