      Psychiatric Association, 2013), whereas its estimated prevalence among people living with HIV
      (PWH) is 73% (Rubinstein & Selwyn, 1998). Cognitive, behavioural, physiological, and
      psychosocial explanations for this elevated prevalence have been proposed (Taibi, 2013),
      however, there is a lack of consensus in the literature. Sleep disturbance is associated with
      disrupted immune functioning at the cellular level (Taylor, Lichstein, & Durrence, 2003), as
      well as increased risk of contracting infectious diseases (Patel et al., 2012); therefore,
      insomnia may be particularly problematic for PWH. Cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia
      (CBT-I; Edinger & Carney, 2008) is the first-line treatment for insomnia (Qaseem et al.,
      2016; Schutte-Rodin et al., 2008), and medium to large effect sizes have been reported
      (Okajima et al., 2011). CBT-I is effective at treating insomnia among individuals with
      comorbid medical disorders such as chronic pain (Jungquist et al., 2012), fibromyalgia
      (Mart√≠nez et al., 2014), and cancer (Garland et al., 2014). Surprisingly, no study to date
      has examined the efficacy of CBT-I among PWH. The current study will evaluate the safety,
      feasibility, acceptability, and effects of CBT-I among 20 PWH using a pragmatic pilot study
      design. An exit interview will be conducted to elicit participant feedback about the
      treatment and methods used. Additional cross-sectional analyses will examine predictors of
      insomnia symptom severity and other sleep-related outcomes among a larger sample (n = 60).
      This will be the first study to examine the impact of CBT-I among PWH.
