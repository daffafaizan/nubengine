    
      VAL-104 is a phase 1, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo- and active-controlled
      4 period, 4 way crossover study to assess the intranasal abuse potential of manipulated ADAIR
      formulation in nondependent, recreational stimulant users. The study objectives include
      assessing the pharmacodynamics (PD), pharmacokinetics (PK), safety and tolerability of
      manipulated ADAIR 30mg when compared to crushed d-amphetamine sulfate and placebo. The
      primary PD endpoint is mean maximum drug liking (Emax) on a bipolar 100mm visual analog
      scale.

      A total of 64 subjects demonstrating a confirmed positive response to stimulants will enter
      the treatment phase. Safety will be assess via adverse events, vital signs, ECGs, clinical
      laboratory tests and Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS).
