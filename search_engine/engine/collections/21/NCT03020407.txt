      initial treatment of this condition emphasize on the early recognition, prompt administration
      of antibiotic, and restoration of hemodynamic with aggressive fluid resuscitation and
      vasopressor. Regarding the initial fluid therapy, administration of empirical crystalloid at
      the dose of 30 ml/kg is recommended in the guideline. The ultrasound-assisted management of
      shock patients has been introduced in the past decade and now is widely used. By using the
      measurement of inferior vena cava (IVC) diameter change during respiratory phases, physicians
      can predict the fluid responsiveness in the shock patients and tailor the fluid therapy
      during the resuscitation.Unfortunately, clinical outcome related to the use of this concept
      in SS resuscitation has not been well studied. Inadequate resuscitation with fluid therapy is
      related with higher mortality; however, fluid bolus or positive fluid balance that may result
      from "too aggressive" fluid administration is also associated with increased mortality in SS
      patients. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the 30-day mortality outcome of the
      SS patients who were treated with ultrasound-assisted fluid management using change of the
      IVC during respiratory phases in the first 6 hours compared with those who were treated with
      "usual-care" strategy. The secondary outcomes were to compare the rate of the need for
      mechanical ventilation (MV) and renal replacement therapy (RRT) as well as the 6-hours
      lactate clearance and the change in Sequential Organ Failure (SOFA) score in 72 hours.
