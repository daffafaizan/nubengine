      anxiety disorders and emerging evidence suggests that attention bias modification can
      ameliorate attention bias for threatening stimuli. ABM is based on the premise that if biased
      attention maintains disorder symptoms, a modification of the bias should reduce symptoms. The
      advantage of ABM is that it operates implicitly, thereby offering a more indirect, less
      deliberate procedure. This requires less cognitive control compared to the effortful and
      explicit psychotherapeutic treatment of cognitive biases. As food-related fears and avoidance
      in AN patients have been recognized as important anxiety-related symptoms, ABM seems
      particularly suitable to treat food-related fears and avoidance, especially because AN
      patients might be unaware of their avoidance strategy. The aim of this study is to test if
      food-related fears and food avoidance can be changed by experimentally modifying attention
      towards food in Anorexia Nervosa patients using an innovative computerized training paradigm
      (computerized attention training - CAT) and to evaluate related change in symptoms.

      The investigators hypothesize that the active CAT will change attentional processing of food
      cues (research aim 1), transfer to changes in food-related fears and food avoidance, and to
      improvements in AN symptoms and weight in the short term (research aim 2) and longer term
      (research aim 3).
