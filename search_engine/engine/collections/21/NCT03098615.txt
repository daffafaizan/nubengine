      have therefore been excluded from both topical and systemic clinical trials for
      onychomycosis, including those for Efinaconazole solution. Efinaconazole (Jublia) 10%
      solution is an FDA approved topical medication indicated for treatment of distal lateral
      subungual onychomycosis (DLSO), and the utility of this medication likely exceeds published
      results. Efinaconazole solution's novel ability to penetrate into the subungual space likely
      accounts for improved treatment results seen in DLSO treated with Jublia. We will investigate
      the utility of topical efinaconazole solution in the treatment of dermatophytomas.
