      management interventions along with booster strategies will improve and sustain improvements
      in the domains of psychosocial functioning, quality of life, and somatic health among persons
      with varying stages of HIV disease. These three outcome domains, along with neuroendocrine
      mediation, will be measured by multiple indicators derived from the psychoneuroimmunology
      (PNI)paradigm. The interventions are designed to reduce perceived stress and increase coping
      effectiveness and include cognitive-behavioral stress management focused on positively living
      (+LIVE), focused Tai Chi (TCHI) training, and spiritual growth groups (SPRT). The primary aim
      of this randomized clinical trial is to compare the +LIVE, TCHI, and SPRT interventions to
      each other and to standard care received by a control group of wait-listed participants
      (WAIT) for effects on psychosocial functioning (perceived stress, coping patterns, social
      support, psychological distress), quality of life (including spiritual well-being),
      neuroendocrine mediation (cortisol, DHEA levels), and somatic health (disease progression,
      HIV-specific health status, immune status).
