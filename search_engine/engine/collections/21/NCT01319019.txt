      active-controlled, parallel-group, dose-ranging and dose-interval study. Eligible subjects
      will enter a seven-day run-in period followed by 28 days of double-blind, double-dummy
      treatment via the DISKUS inhaler. The study will consist of 8 visits, mainly conducted on an
      outpatient basis, 6 of which will be clinic visits and 2 of which will be phone contacts,
      including a post-treatment visit to follow up any adverse events. There will be approximately
      425 subjects randomised to the study.
