      3 in combination with 5-FU/L V every 2 weeks. (Arm I) II. Describe the 2-months progression
      free rate on vorinostat 1400mg/day x 3 in combination with 5-FU/L V every 2 weeks. (Arm II)
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Describe the response rate on Arm 1 and Arm 2 of the study. II.
      Estimate the median progression free survival on both arms of the study. III. Describe the
      overall survival on Arm 1 and Arm 2 of the study. IV. Describe the toxicities on Arm 1 and
      Arm 2 of the study. V. Describe vorinostat pharmacokinetics on Arm 1 and Arm 2 of the study.
      VI. Describe 5-FU steady state pharmacokinetics on Arm 1 and Arm 2 of the study. OUTLINE:
      Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. ARM I: Patients receive low-dose oral
      vorinostat once daily on days 1-3, leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours on day 2, and
      fluorouracil IV over 46 hours on days 2 and 3. Courses repeat every 2 weeks in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. ARM II: Patients receive high-dose oral
      vorinostat once daily on days 1-3 and leucovorin calcium and fluorouracil as in arm I.
      Courses repeat every 2 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up for 30 days and then every 3
      months.
