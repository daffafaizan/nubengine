      cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) (study group: 100 patients) and women who did not
      have intraepithelial neoplasia as a result of smear (control group: 100 patients). Patients
      who had well preserved sufficient number of squamous epithelial cells, who did not have
      bleeding, fixation failure, inflammation or atrophy, and had negative cervical cytology smear
      were considered as control group. HPV test was also requested from the study group. B12 and
      folate blood levels were compared between the groups.
