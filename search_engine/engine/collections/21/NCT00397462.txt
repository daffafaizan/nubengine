    
      Women between the ages of 30 and 60 years of age who work in positions that require them to
      be seated at desks for a large portion of each day, are capable of following the protocol for
      one year, have a t-score >- 2.5 (do not have osteoporosis), and respond to plantar
      stimulation will be asked to participate. Women will be excluded who are receiving
      medications for osteoporosis, taking hormone replacement therapy, taking steroids (either
      oral or inhaled), have metal implants in the tibia, hip and spine that interfere with DEXA
      (bone density) scanning, are professional or semi-professional athletes, have
      hyperparathyroidism, have a history of pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, peripheral
      vascular disease or varicose veins, have a Body Mass Index greater than 40 Kg/m2, have any
      type of neuromuscular disease, or are pregnant . Once the inclusion and exclusion criteria
      are met, 45 subjects will be randomized into 3 groups including 1) a group of 15 subjects who
      will use the device (stimulation) for up to 4 hours a day, 2) a group of 15 subjects that
      will use the device for up to 8 hours a day, and 3) a control group who will not use the
      device. Subjects in the two treatment groups will be asked to place their feet on a
      mechanical device that will deliver a slight vibration while they are seated at work.
      Vibrations between 30-60 Hz has been shown to stimulate the Meissner's corpuscles which in
      turn stimulate contraction of the deep muscles of the calves. This contraction has been shown
      to increase venous and lymphatic return from the lower extremities thus improve bone
      metabolism. Bone density readings and venous circulation will be measured at the onset of
      this research and will be repeated after 12 months of using the device.
