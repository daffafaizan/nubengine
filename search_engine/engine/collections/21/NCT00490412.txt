      infection who are being treated with tenofovir as part of an antiretroviral (ARV) combination
      regimen, vitamin D supplementation will decrease renal phosphate loss, increase plasma
      phosphate, decrease plasma PTH, and improve markers of bone turnover, including a decrease in
      plasma N-telopeptide and BAP.
