      the margins of the vaginal cuff closure, following hysterectomy.

      The recognition of the complication is made on a clinical basis. The investigators will
      compare the percentage of dehiscence among women who had transvaginal vs. laparoscopic suture
      of the vault.

      The investigators will also compare the two modalities in terms of:

        -  duration of the vaginal closure

        -  risk of bleeding from the vaginal cuff

        -  risk of post-operative pelvic infection

        -  risk of re-operation

        -  dyspareunia

        -  total vaginal length

        -  vaginal cuff prolapse.
