      with a diagnosis of metabolic syndrome in accordance with the International Diabetes
      Federation (IDF). Waist circumference, glucose, insulin levels, and lipid profile were
      evaluated after a 75 g of dextrose load.

      12 received Banaba, 500 mg, two times per day (1000 mg) before meals during 3 months.

      The remaining 12 patients received placebo with the same prescription.

      Area Under the Curve of glucose and insulin was calculated as well as total insulin secretion
      (insulinogenic index), first-phase of insulin secretion (Stumvoll index) and insulin
      sensitivity (Matsuda index).

      This protocol was approved by a local ethics committee and written informed consent was
      obtained from all volunteers.

      Results are presented as mean and standard deviation. Intra and inter group differences were
      tested using the Wilcoxon signed-rank and Mann-Whitney U-test respectively; pâ‰¤0.05 was
      considered significant.
