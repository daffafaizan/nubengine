    
      This is a PAES, double blind, double dummy, multicenter, randomized, controlled clinical
      study, which will consist of a Screening phase (Visit 1) of up to 14 days and a Follow-up
      phase of up to 15 days.

      A total of 300 patients of either sex, aged between 40 and 70 years with diagnosis of chronic
      mechanical (mild, moderate degenerative process of disc and facet) LBP for at least 3 months
      but no more than 6 months will be randomized.

      Two stratification groups will be distinguished: the first group will be comprised of
      patients with chronic mechanical LBP due to mild, moderate degenerative process of disc and
      facet from 40 to <55 years, the second group will be comprised of patients with chronic
      mechanical LBP due to mild-moderate degenerative process of disc and facet â‰¥55 to 70 years.

      All patients will be required to have diagnosis of chronic LBP with clinically and imaging
      confirmation of mechanical (mild, moderate degenerative process of disc and facet).

      Baseline assessments include: pain assessment and functional disability, clinical parameters,
      patient global assessment (PGA), clinical global impression (CGI) and consumption of rescue
      medication.

      Eligible patients will then be randomly assigned to one of the following three treatment
      arms:

        1. Tricortin 1000 by intramuscular route (Arm A)

        2. Diclofenac sodium medicated plaster by topical application (Arm B)

        3. Placebo (Arm C) In arm A and B, Tricortin 1000 and Diclofenac sodium medicated plaster
           will be administered together with the alternate placebo, while patients in the placebo
           arm (Arm C) will be treated with both intramuscular and locally applied placebo.

      Patients will be in the study for approximately 30 days of trial duration with a treatment
      period of 15 days.
