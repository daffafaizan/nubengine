    
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the vitamin D analog
      2-methylene-19-nor-20S-1Î±,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (DP001) in patients with end-stage renal
      disease (ESRD). The effect of 12 weeks of oral administration of DP001 on serum parathyroid
      hormone (PTH) levels will be evaluated in ESRD patients who have secondary
      hyperparathyroidism.
