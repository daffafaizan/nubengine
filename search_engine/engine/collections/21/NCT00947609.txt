        -  To compare the utility of IGRAs, T-Spot®.TB and QuantiFERON®-TB Gold In-Tube, and TST
           for screening of latent TB in HIV-infected children

        -  To compare these different screening modalities in HIV-infected children to HIV
           uninfected children

        -  To assess the influence of age, nutritional and immune status, prior BCG and TST status
           on children's response to IGRAs

        -  To assess the prognostic value of IGRAs vs. TST in predicting development of active TB
           in children over 9 months

      Research questions:

      Primary:

      What is the sensitivity and specificity of IGRAs and TST in screening for latent TB in
      HIV-infected and HIV uninfected children in Thailand?

      Secondary:

      How do age, nutritional and immune status, prior BCG and PPD status influence children's
      response to IGRAs? What is the prognostic value of IGRAs vs. TST in predicting development of
      active TB in children over 9 months?

      This is a prospective cohort study conducted at two sites in Bangkok, Thailand: HIV
      Netherlands Australia Thailand (HIV-NAT) Clinic/Chulalongkorn Hospital and Queen Sirikit
      National Institute of Child Health.
