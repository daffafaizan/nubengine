      will consist of 2 periods that will last up to a maximum of 21 days: Screening and Baseline.
      The Randomization Phase will comprise of four, 9-day treatment periods (Treatment Period 1 -
      Treatment Period 4) with a minimum 14-day washout between treatment periods, and a follow-up
      interval of at least 14 days after Treatment Period 4 before the end-of-study (EOS) visit.
      Participants will be randomized to 1 of 12 sequences in an incomplete blocks design.
