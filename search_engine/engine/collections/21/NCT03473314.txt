    
      Primary Objective: Determine the efficacy of prolonged delivery of inhaled nitric oxide to
      treat an adult patient with pulmonary NTM Primary Endpoint: Eradication of NTM growth in
      sputum cultures. Efficacy will be assessed by the antimicrobial effect of inhaled NO on the
      density of NTM species and other microorganisms in the sputum.

      • as confirmed by measurement of semi-quantitative culture sputum growth which has been
      verified with serial dilution technique on Day 7, 14, 21 and every 21 days thereafter for 90
      days as compared to pre-treatment baseline sputum culture.

      Secondary Objective(s): Determine the safety & efficacy of inhaled nitric oxide

      Secondary Endpoint(s):

        1. Safety

           • as evaluated by the number of unanticipated adverse events during home delivery in
           clinical labs (hematology, coagulation, and serum chemistries); in vitals; in inspired
           concentration of NO, O2 and NO2 delivered to subject and; in methemoglobin and oxygen
           saturation levels.

        2. Efficacy

             -  as determined by improvement in lung function as measured by spirometry, endurance
                as measured by six minute walk-test and quality of life as determined by
                self-reporting quality of life questionnaire (CFQ-R) on Day 7, 14, 21 and every 21
                days thereafter for 90 days as compared to pre-treatment baseline data.

             -  as assessed by recurrence of NTM in sputum as confirmed by measurement of
                semi-quantitative culture sputum growth on Day 30 and 60 post treatment.
