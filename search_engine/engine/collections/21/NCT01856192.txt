      I. Progression-free survival (PFS).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Response rate (RR). II. Complete remission (CR) rate as defined by positron emission
      tomography (PET)-computed tomography (CT) criteria.

      III. Overall survival (OS).

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Impact of diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) molecular subtype on outcome.

      II. Interim PET scan results in relation to treatment outcome.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM A: Patients receive rituximab intravenously (IV), cyclophosphamide IV, doxorubicin
      hydrochloride IV, and vincristine sulfate IV on day 1; prednisone orally (PO) on days 1-5;
      and lenalidomide PO on days 1-10. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 6 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM B: Patients receive rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin hydrochloride, vincristine
      sulfate, and prednisone as in Arm A. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 6 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years,
      every 6 months for 1 year, and then annually for up to 7 years.
