      an intensive individualized goal training with adolescents with CP. Adolescents will select
      up to 5 functional goals to be trained during a 2 weeks, 3 hour-daily training, totalling 30
      hours across 2 weeks. Moreover, they will be asked to daily practice these activities at home
      along the intervention period.
