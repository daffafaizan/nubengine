    
      -  Patients undergoing coronary angioplasty will be randomised to standard vs. low-dose
           heparin. the study will include "all-comers" (patients with either stable angina or
           acute coronary syndromes); only patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction will be
           excluded.

        -  An ACT (activated clotting time) will be performed after the initial bolus of heparin:
           for the standard dose group the target ACT will be > 300 sec. (as recommended by
           guidelines) while for the low-dose the target ACT will be > 180 sec.

      Aim of the study is to show equivalence in ischemic events between the two doses of heparin,
      in order to confirm the safety of lower dose of heparin in contemporary coronary
      interventions.
