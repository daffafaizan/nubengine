      headache) and occipital neuralgia were enrolled in the study. They have all received in the
      past the standard systemic pharmacotherapy prophylaxis for headache management (with
      topiramate or amitriptylline) as well as tryptanes for rescue treatment, and were scheduled
      for a diagnostic nerve block of the occipital nerves in cases of intractable pain. Inclusion
      criteria included: not adequate response to systemic pharmacotherapy, pain over crises of
      >4/10, occipital tenderness bilaterally or unilaterally, and days with headache of more than
      10/month. Exclusion criteria were age<18 years old, pregnancy or lactation, presence of
      cardiac pacemaker, previous therapy with PRF, severe psychiatric disorder and patient
      refusal. In cases of a positive response to the diagnostic nerve block with local anesthetic,
      with >50% pain relief they were scheduled for pulsed radiofrequency of GON and LON
      bilaterally.

      Primary outcome measure was the days with headache per month, before and after treatment. In
      addition, pain during headache crisis (with Visual Analogue Scale, VAS, 0-10), the analgesic
      consumption (number per month) and the quality of life (measured with EQ6D) were studied. All
      measurements were performed before treatment, as well as after 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. All
      patients completed the Brief Pain Inventory questionnaire in Greek language and signed an
      informed consent prior treatment. All measurements were accomplished by an independed
      (blinded) researcher of the pain unit. All complications and side effects were also recorded.
