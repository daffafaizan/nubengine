    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of FID-007 and the recommended phase II dose
      (RP2D).

      II. To determine the pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel, (free and total) in patients treated
      with FID-007.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To characterize the safety and tolerability of FID-007 by assessing toxicities per Common
      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version (v.)4.3.

      II. To obtain a preliminary assessment of anti-tumor activity of FID-007 via objective
      radiologic tumor response using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate in a preliminary fashion the serum concentration of total paclitaxel and free
      paclitaxel, and explore potential associations with serum concentrations, efficacy and
      toxicity.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study.

      Participants receive FID-007 intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on days 1, 8 and 15. Courses
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up periodically.
