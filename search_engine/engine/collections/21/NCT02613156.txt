      recurrent HCC and underwent surgical resection at the Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center
      from June 2014 to November 2014; 31 patients were enrolled in the laparoscopic group and
      underwent complete laparoscopic resection of HCC, and 33 patients were enrolled in the
      control group and underwent open surgical resection. The operation time, intraoperative blood
      loss, shortest distance between the tumor edge and normal liver tissue, postoperative pain
      scores, postoperative time until the patient could walk, postoperative time until the patient
      could pass gas, hospital stay, and inpatient costs were compared between the two groups. The
      patients were followed up for one year after surgery, and the relapse-free survival was
      compared between the two groups.
