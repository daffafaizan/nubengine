      follows:

      Patients on one of the above medications should undergo regular monitoring of the heart
      function during treatment as the following:

        1. Baseline evaluation of LVEF prior inhibitor of therapy

        2. Serial assessment of LVEF using the same modality.

      There is no clear international guidelines on the frequency and method of LVEF assessment.

      Cardiac function is usually measured by using (ECHO) echo cardiography and multiple-gated
      acquisition (MUGA) The patient should be assessed with the same techniques during treatment
      to avoid stressing the myocardium by the use of exercise or ionotropic agent, before
      measuring LVEF to prevent earlier evidence of cardiotoxicity. Changes in the early atrial
      (E/A) filling ratio reflect ventricular compliance and may predict diastolic dysfunction and
      so decline in LVEF.

      Diastolic dysfunction seems to be predictive of cardiac morbidity and mortality.

      Trials with adjuvant trastuzumab use the rules for stopping cardiotoxic agents. They
      identified subset of high risk patients by one or two of the following three criteria:

        1. A decline with 10% or more in absolute LVEF from a normal base line to 50% or less

        2. a high cumulative dose of Doxorubicin ( > 450 mg/m2 ) and / or;

        3. abnormal baseline LVEF < 50% Patients who stopped taking doxorubicin after an LVEF
           decline were less likely to develop congestive heart failure (CHF) than those who did
           not.

      Echocardiography is used regularly to monitor LVEF and is more widely available. The MUGA, in
      addition it does not expose patients to ionizing radiation but it is operator-dependent but
      training and use of automation may overcome the variation .
