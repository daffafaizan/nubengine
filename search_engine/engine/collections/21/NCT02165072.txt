      are associated with different inferior vena cava diameters and collapsibility index. The
      investigators will include subjects ages 18-89 years with AKI (creatinine of 2mg/100ml or
      higher for less than 24 hours from baseline creatinine â‰¤1.2 or with unknown baseline
      creatinine). Standard of care treatment will not be different for patients taking part in
      this study. Participants will have bedside ultrasounds on days 0, 1, and 3, and baseline and
      follow-up data will be collected from medical records.
