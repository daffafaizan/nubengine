      function and reduce or eliminate pain. The primary objective of this randomized controlled
      trial is to demonstrate, in patients 60 years or older with a large rotator cuff tear, that
      biological or synthetic patch augmen-tation in arthroscopic rotator cuff repair results in
      decreased rate of retear 24 months post-operatively compared to re-pair without patch
      augmentation.
