      single-chamber ventricular pacemakers, and will be executed by analyzing administrative
      claims data. The study consists of two primary objectives: estimate the: (1) acute overall
      complication rate and (2) the 2-year survival rate of patients implanted with a Micra
      leadless pacemaker. As part of the secondary objectives of the study, a comparative analysis
      of Micra leadless pacemakers to single-chamber ventricular transvenous pacemakers will be
      conducted.

      The analysis will be in CMS claims data and is subject to a central IRB. However, individual
      hospitals are not engaged in research and local IRB oversight is not necessary.
