    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the toxicity and overall survival of high dose Bu (busulfan)/VP-16 (etoposide)
      followed by post-transplant low-dose interleukin (IL)-2 (aldesleukin) in patients with AML.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the rate of relapse associated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE:

      PREPARATIVE REGIMEN: Patients receive busulfan intravenously (IV) over 2 hours or orally (PO)
      every 6 hours on days -7 to -4 and etoposide IV on day -3.

      STEM CELL INFUSION: Patients undergo autologous or syngeneic PBSC rescue on day 0.

      POST-TRANSPLANT ALDESLEUKIN THERAPY: Beginning 30-100 days after transplant, patients receive
      low-dose aldesleukin subcutaneously (SC) daily for 12 weeks.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years,
      every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.
