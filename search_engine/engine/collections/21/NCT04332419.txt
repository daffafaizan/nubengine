      imaging), within 6 hours after SIRT with Y-90 for palliative treatment of the liver
      malignancy. Patients will be randomized to receive either of the imaging modalities first,
      based on the availability of the imaging device, and less than 1 hour apart. Upon acquirement
      and construction of PET/CT and PET/MR images, a software (MIM SurePlan LiverY90) would be
      utilized for semi-automatic determination of the liver/tumor contours and calculation of the
      Y-90 absorbed doses (Gy) in the regions of interest (including within tumor and background
      liver outlines) using the Local Deposition Method.

      The primary objective of this study is to assess the agreement between post-Y-90 RE absorbed
      doses (Gy) in the liver tumor tissues based on PET/CT versus PET/MR imaging. This would
      permit the comparison of Y-90 tumor absorbed doses, acquired from PET/MR, with the current
      standard of care PET/CT imaging to verify the data consistency and to validate its
      application for the prediction of tumor response to treatment.

      The secondary objective of this study is to assess the agreement between post-Y-90 RE
      absorbed doses (Gy) in the background liver tissues (surrounding tumors), based on PET/CT
      versus PET/MR imaging. This would permit the comparison of Y-90 background liver absorbed
      doses, acquired from PET/MR, with the current standard of care PET/CT imaging to verify the
      data consistency and to validate its application for the prediction of dose toxicity.
