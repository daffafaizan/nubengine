      (controlled, micron level-filtered environmental air flow, in addition to conventional
      instrument sterilization) dental patient volunteers will have either areas of decayed tooth
      structure or recurrent caries defective fillings removed using conventional, routine
      procedures, which will include: local anesthesia; tooth isolation using rubber dam; removal
      of superficial decay, weakened tooth structure or defective filling materials with rotary
      tooth cutting instruments; and then removal of softened dentin using sterile sharp spoon
      excavators, by hand. The limit of dentin removal will be determined by the clinician's
      estimate of tooth hardness, that is, using present conventional and ethical practice. This
      last step, removal of tissue guided by estimated hardness, is as described above the
      universally accepted standard.

      Following removal, the exposed dentin surface will be examined visually with an 15X operating
      microscope to detect any areas of discolored dentin. Any such areas will be micro-sampled
      using ultra slow-speed, 0.2 mm diameter rotary cutting instruments and removal of resultant
      dentin flakes with sterile fibers. Each prepared cavity will then be restored using
      conventional tooth filling materials and techniques.

      Immediately after removal each dentin flake will be weighed, placed into bacterial transport
      medium, then sonicated. The transport medium will be divided in two, and separate samples
      added to bacterial growth medium under anaerobic and aerobic growth conditions. Any viable
      microorganisms detected will be identified both by conventional plating techniques using
      visual identification, and by a commercial laboratory using RNA analysis.
