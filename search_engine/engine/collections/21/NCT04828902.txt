      Methods: Patients will undergo routine, continuous observation for symptoms of delirium by a
      trained nursing staff. Occurrence of delirium, Delirium Observation Screening Scale (DOSS)
      grading, and therapy will by annotated on case record forms (CRFs) every 12 hours.
      Additionally, collected will be known risk factors of delirium: schedule type, age, arterial
      hypertension, atrial fibrillation, body mass index (BMI), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)
      inhibitors / angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) therapy, hearing loss, dementia, peripheral
      artery disease, myocardial infarction, depression, diabetes, corona virus disease 2019
      (COVID19) infection and/or vaccination; and outcome data: hospital-LOS, prolonged sedation,
      antipsychotic therapy, surgical reintervention, hours on mechanical ventilation (HOV), number
      of tracheal intubations, length of consciousness disorders, blood product transfusions,
      cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), renal replacement therapy (RRT), mechanical circulatory
      support (MCS), duration of catecholamine support, ICU readmissions, new antibiotic therapies,
      30-day mortality.

      Statistical methods: Delirium morbidity and risk will be calculated from two-by-two table.
      Associations between delirium and secondary outcome measures will be evaluated by simple and
      logistic regression with use of ANOVA test for continuous variables with homogeneous
      distribution, or Kruskal-Wallis test for continuous variables with non-homogeneous
      distribution, or categorical variables. Significant will be considered results with p<0.05.

      A period of one year was assumed sufficient to draw conclusions on the primary endpoints of
      the study.
