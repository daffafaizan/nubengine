      sequencing of just the protein-coding exons, enrichment and sequencing of methylated DNA and
      RNA or transcriptome-sequencing under the broad category term, Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS).

      The development of rapid and low cost next-generation genome sequencing technologies brings
      the promise of a new era of precision therapeutics to clinical practice, but it is associated
      with significant challenges, including reproducible generation of high-quality sequence data
      and the need for comprehensive data analysis and interpretation that is translatable to
      clinical action. Equally critical are the ethical, legal, and social issues surrounding the
      introduction of WGS testing and its clinical application in multiethnic, multicultural
      populations, particularly those who have historically experienced discrimination or even
      unethical research practices. Of particular concern are issues surrounding the privacy,
      ownership, storage, and use of WGS data.
