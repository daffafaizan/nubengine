      I. To determine differences in prostate tissue steady state concentrations of calcitriol in
      participants treated with a single dose cholecalciferol (200,000 IU) and G-2535 (which
      provides 600 mg of genistein) and those receiving placebo.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the effect of each intervention arm and resulting prostate tissue levels of
      calcitriol on down-stream related biomarkers and related mechanistic pathways in blood and
      tissue.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive cholecalciferol orally (PO) on day 1 and genistein PO once daily (QD)
      on days 1-21 or 1-28. Patients then undergo prostatectomy.

      ARM II: Patients receive placebo PO on day 1 and placebo PO QD on days 1-21 or 1-28. Patients
      then undergo prostatectomy.
