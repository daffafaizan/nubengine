      as medications or behavioral techniques). We plan to enroll women with refractory urge
      incontinence in centers across the US. Study participants will undergo cystoscopy (telescope
      look into the bladder) and injection of either Botox A or placebo. If symptoms are not
      adequately relieved, subjects participants will receive a second injection that is Botox A.
      Participants are interviewed monthly by study personnel to determine symptoms and health
      status.
