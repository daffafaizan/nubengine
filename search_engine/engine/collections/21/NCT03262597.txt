      "hydrate", by measuring fluid retention after ingesting a 1 liter bolus and comparing it to
      water. Drinks with carbohydrates and electrolytes would traditionally be expected to score
      higher on the BHI due to glucose-sodium cotransport at the gut and osmolality approaching
      isotonicity with blood. One recent study reported that an oral rehydration solution (ORS)
      scored better than water, but a "sports drink" did not. No "optimal" BHI beverage composition
      has been described, nor has an optimal osmolality. Recently, a hypotonic amino acid-based
      rehydration beverage was developed to take advantage of amino acid-sodium cotransport, thus
      obviating the need for carbohydrate. However, the BHI of this beverage has not yet been
      assessed. The purpose of this investigation was to assess the hydration potential of this
      novel beverage in comparison to a commercially available carbohydrate-containing sports drink
      and oral rehydration solution.
