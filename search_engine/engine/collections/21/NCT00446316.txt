    
      This is an open-label, single-institution, randomized cross-over, fixed schedule study of the
      effects of Mg-Al-based antacids on Imatinib Mesylate (Gleevec®) pharmacokinetics. Healthy
      volunteers will be recruited to participate in this study such that twelve subjects (6 men /
      6 women) will complete the study. Gleevec® pharmacokinetics will be assessed after oral
      administration of Gleevec® and after oral administration of Gleevec® with concomitant
      administration of magnesium-aluminum hydroxide-based antacid (Maalox). Gleevec® will be
      administered at a dose of 400 mg, and the antacid (Maximum Strength Maalox®Max®
      Antacid/Anti-gas) at a dose level of 20 mL (equivalent to 1600 mg aluminum hydroxide and 1600
      mg magnesium hydroxide). Half of the subjects will receive Gleevec® and antacid on day 15 and
      Gleevec® alone on day 1. The other half will be treated in reverse order, i.e., they will
      receive the combination of Gleevec® and antacid on day 1, and Gleevec® alone on day 15. The
      antacids will be administered 15 minutes before the Gleevec® dose.
