           translation that is independently performed by two bilingual translators. The original
           Italian version is translated into Thai by two Thai native speakers, then the study team
           reviews the Thai-version Cu-Q2oL questionnaire for items comprehensibility and
           integrates the first consensus version which re-translated into Italian by an Italian
           native speaker afterwards. The comparison between the backward Italian version Cu-Q2oL
           questionnaire and the original Cu-Q2oL is carried out to find out whether there are any
           misconception and mistranslation in the intermediary forward version of questionnaire.
           After that, the second consensus version will be tested on 15 chronic urticaria patients
           to detect any misunderstanding points based on patients' comments. Finally, this
           Thai-version of CU-Q2oL questionnaire will be used to investigate the validity,
           reliability, interpretability and minimal clinical important difference.

        2. To investigate the validity, reliability and interpretability of Thai-version of Chronic
           Urticaria Quality of Life Questionaire (CU-Q2oL), the severity of chronic urticaria
           symptoms will be assessed by investigators and patients using the Urticaria Activity
           Score (UAS7), the DLQI and CU-Q2oL questionnaire.
