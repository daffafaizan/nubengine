      regimens have been established in clinical trials for those patients. As many patients are
      still in good performance status and present with low tumor burden after failure of
      first-line chemotherapy, they clearly benefit from second-line treatment.

      Sunitinib inhibits the receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) involved in tumor proliferation and
      angiogenesis, specifically the VEGFR, PDGFR, KIT, FLT-3, and RET. The VEGF pathway has been
      shown to be a significant factor in metastatic gastric cancer.

      The safety and efficacy of Sunitinib as single agent for the treatment of mGC has been
      determined and support the proposed clinical study with FOLFIRI in combination with Sunitinib
      in the treatment of patients with mGC.

      Patients included in this trial suffer from advanced or metastatic adenocarcinoma of stomach
      or lower esophagus. They have failed to respond at least to one standard palliative
      first-line therapy (based on docetaxel and/or cisplatin plus 5-FU). Irinotecan/FA/5-FU can be
      determined as one established second-line treatment to be available for these patients.

      Taken together, treatment of those patients with Sunitinib combined with standard
      chemotherapy FOLFIRI offers the chance to benefit from a new innovative therapy with
      acceptable side effects.
