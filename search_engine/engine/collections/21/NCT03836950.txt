      neurorehabilitation treatment. To date, no rTMS studies have assessed the effect of rTMS on
      cognitive function in PD-MCI. Nor has there been PD neurophysiological studies using rTMS to
      examine neural plasticity in cognitive neural networks. This study seeks to fill this gap by
      conducting a small scaled pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) designed to assess the
      safety and therapeutic effects of rTMS on cognitive outcomes as well as on brain connectivity
      in Veterans with PD-MCI. PD-MCI participants will be randomized to either active rTMS or sham
      rTMS. Participants will complete a standardized neurocognitive battery assessment at
      baseline, endpoint and at a one month follow-up. The primary outcome is change in executive
      function. Secondary outcomes include performance on other cognitive domain tasks and a
      proximal measure of real-life function that captures relevant functional changes related to
      cognitive impairment in PD. Multi-modal neuroimaging, in a subsample of participants, will be
      used to study neural connectivity changes induced by rTMS. Changes in resting state
      functional connectivity, grey matter volume via voxel-based morphometry and white matter
      integrity via diffusion tensor imaging will be assessed at baseline and endpoint. To inform
      how to optimize rTMS treatment in PD-MCI, these changes will be correlated with changes in
      cognitive performance.
