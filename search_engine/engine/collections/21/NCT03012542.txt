      beneficial for Crohn's disease for a period of 8 weeks.

      Initial evaluation will include a clinic visit with physical exam, medication review,
      supplemental documentation, and labs. Patients will be asked about their food allergies and
      intolerances against a master list of all ingredients used in both diets. Patients will then
      be provided with instructions on how to record their baseline dietary intake for two weeks
      prior to the intervention diet.

      At day 0 patients will begin their study diet. All study meals will be provided to the
      subject and an approved snack list for the randomized diet will be provided in a sealed
      envelope with their first week of meals.

      At the conclusion of intervention patients will be asked to resume their previous diet for 4
      weeks and record their dietary intake. Stool and blood will be collected at baseline and at
      4, 8, and 12 weeks. At the conclusion of the study patients will be told which diet they were
      on and will be provided with dietary consultation by a registered dietitian.

      Subjects who withdraw from the study before the 4 week assessment will be asked to provide a
      final stool sample at the time of withdrawal. If more than 2 subjects drop out prior to week
      4, subject replacement will occur.
