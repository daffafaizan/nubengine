      neurosurgical practice. The position of the proximal ventricular catheter is important since
      it influences possible malfunction of the VPS. For the improvement of accuracy in proximal
      VPS placement, navigation-based insertion techniques have been developed. VPS placement using
      stereotactic navigation has shown a high accuracy of catheter placement been developed. VPS
      placement using stereotactic navigation has shown a high accuracy of catheter placement,
      while the main limitations are that for referencing, the head of the patient needs to be
      fixed in a head holder and the preoperative set-up can be time-consuming. US-G VPS placement
      using a burr hole probe was described as an alternate for image-guided VPS placement
      technique. For US-G VPS placement head fixation or preoperative registration is not needed.
      This study is to prospectively compare Ultrasound guided (US-G) Ventriculoperitoneal Shunt
      (VPS) placement to stereotactic navigation in a randomized controlled fashion with the
      surgical intervention time as primary outcome.
