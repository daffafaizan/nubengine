      I. To evaluate whether adjuvant therapy with crizotinib will result in improved overall
      survival (OS) for patients with stage IB >= 4 cm, II and IIIA, ALK-positive non-small cell
      lung cancer (NSCLC) following surgical resection.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate and compare disease-free survival (DFS) associated with crizotinib.

      II. To evaluate the safety profile of crizotinib when given in the adjuvant therapy setting.

      III. To collect tumor tissue and blood specimens for future research.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM A: Patients receive crizotinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-21. Treatment
      repeats every 21 days for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      ARM B: Patients undergo observation.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months if < 4 or 5
      years from study entry, and every 12 months if 5-10 or 6-10 years from study entry.
