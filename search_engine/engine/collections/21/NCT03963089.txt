      variation(SPV) are known to be unreliable for prediction of fluid responsiveness in children.

      The hypothesis is that tidal volume change in mechanically ventilated children undergoing
      anesthesia would affect reliability of aforementioned dynamic variables in prediction of
      fluid responsiveness, especially in the way that reliability increases for high tidal volume.

      In children undergoing cardiac surgery, tidal volume is changed to 6mL/kg, 10mL/kg and
      14mL/kg after closure of sternum, followed by measurement of PPV, SPV. We also measure the
      respiratory variation of aortic blood peak velocity(△Vpeak) via transesophageal
      echocardiography, which is known to best predict fluid responsiveness.

      Afterward, 10mL/kg of crystalloid solution is administered for fluid loading. 'Fluid
      responder' is defined as subjects with increase of stroke volume index more than 15% after
      fluid loading of 10mL/kg.

      With these data, whether the predictability of fluid responsiveness of PPV and SPV changes
      according to change in tidal volume is evaluated by comparing the area under the curve of the
      receiver-operating characteristics curve between themselves and △Vpeak.
