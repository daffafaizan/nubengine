    
      Rheumatoid arthritis is complicated by lung manifestations, such as interstitial lung disease
      which is the most common cause of morbidity and mortality in rheumatoid arthritis patients.
      Rheumatoid arthritis-interstitial lung disease is a progressive fibrotic disease of the lung
      parenchyma that includes a broad spectrum of disorders such as nonspeciﬁc interstitial
      pneumonia, usual interstitial pneumonia , desquamative interstitial pneumonia, cryptogenic
      organizing pneumonia, diﬀuse alveolar damage, acute interstitial pneumonia, and lymphocytic
      interstitial pneumonia . Rheumatoid arthritis-interstitial lung disease in which available
      data indicate that dysregulated inflammatory cascades can elaborate a host of cytokines,
      chemokines, and growth factors that collectively promote epithelial and endothelial cell
      damage, angiogenesis, fibroblast differentiation/proliferation, and lung fibrosis . Given the
      clinical implications of putative signaling cascades involved in these processes, biomarkers
      that can be used to clarify disease pathogenesis and identify factors governing disease
      progression are clearly needed .
