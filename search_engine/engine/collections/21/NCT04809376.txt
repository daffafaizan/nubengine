    
      This is a 2-stage, adaptive, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study
      that will evaluate the dose and treatment effect of PPS in participants with knee OA pain.

      In Stage 1 (dose selection), approximately 468 participants will be randomised 1:1:1:1 to
      receive 1 of 3 PPS dose regimens or placebo for 6 weeks. A minimum of 96 participants (24
      within each dose group) will be assigned to the Pharmacokinetic (PK) subset.

      Participants in Stage 1 will be randomly allocated to receive:

        -  2 mg/kg calculated for ideal body weight (IBW) PPS twice weekly

        -  2 mg/kg IBW PPS once weekly + placebo once weekly

        -  100/150 mg PPS â‰¤65/>65 kg IBW once weekly + placebo once weekly

        -  placebo twice weekly

      In Stage 2, approximately 470 participants will be randomized 1:1 to receive the selected PPS
      dose regimen or placebo for 6 weeks. Approximately 150 participants (75 per group) will be
      assigned to the PK subset.

      Participants in Stage 2 will be randomly allocated to receive:

        -  One of the 3 Stage 1 PPS dose regimens selected by the DMC

        -  placebo twice weekly

      The maximum duration for each participant is approximately 28 weeks, which includes:

        -  4-week Screening Period from Day -28 to Day -1

        -  6-week Treatment Period from Day 1 to Day 39

        -  18-week Follow-up Period from Day 40 to Day 168
