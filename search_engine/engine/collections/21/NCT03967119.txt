      than 19 years and are undergoing laparoscopic surgery for urologic procedures are being
      enrolled in this study. All anesthetic and surgical managements are being performed according
      to the institutional standards. An attending anesthesiologist who is independent from this
      study performs anesthetic managements for the participants including fluid administration.

      Investigators assess and record the following parameters at the following time points.

      The parameters assessed: mean arterial pressure, heart rate, pulse oxygen saturation, SVV,
      PPV, PWV, peak inspiratory pressure, plateau pressure, positive end-expiratory pressure,
      respiratory rate (all dynamic variables are assessed at two levels of tidal volume- 6 ml/kg
      and 12 ml/kg).

      The time points: T0, before anesthetic induction; T1, immediately after anesthetic induction;
      T2, immediately after pneumoperitoneum; T3, 10 min before desufflation; T4, immediately after
      desufflation.

      The desufflation-induced hypotension is defined as more than 20 % decrease in MAP at T4 from
      MAP at T3.
