      the proximal adductor longus insertion is a key finding in the diagnosis of longstanding
      groin pain. "Tightness" or "shortening" of the adductor longus is considered both a cause and
      effect of pain, that can lead to increased tension at the proximal insertion, thus playing a
      role in the persistence of longstanding adductor-related pain. For patients who do not
      respond sufficiently to non-surgical procedures, an adductor longus tenotomy is a surgical
      option that is considered to reduce tension at the proximal adductor longus insertion
      assisting in reduction of pain and return to sport.

      The bent knee fall out test (BKFO) is one of the most commonly used tests to test adductor
      flexibility. This test involves a combined hip movement with hip flexion, abduction, and
      external rotation, and a high result is generally considered to be related to adductor muscle
      "tightness", specifically that of the adductor longus. It is uncertain whether the BKFO test
      is actually measuring adductor muscle flexibility or hip joint range of motion, as the test
      results may also be affected by a femoral head cam morphology. A slightly different test,
      called the Patrick FABER's test, involves a similar movement and is mainly used as a hip
      joint pain provocation test.

      By cutting the adductor longus tendon, thereby removing the effect of potential adductor
      longus "tightness", it will be possible to show if and how much the flexibility of this
      muscle affects the BKFO test results. This will assist in future considerations of what this
      test is actually testing.

      The aim of this study is to investigate the immediate effect of an adductor longus tenotomy
      on the results of the bent knee fall out test.
