      mL. Tranexamic acid (TXA) is frequently administered prophylactically during this procedure
      to reduce blood loss by inhibiting fibrinolysis. Most clinical studies reported potential
      benefit of the treatment demonstrated by less estimated blood loss (EBL), reduced
      hemoglobin/hematocrit (HH) change, and reduced transfused packed red blood cells (PRBC).
      However, bleeding complication may be affected more significantly by the degree of surgical
      trauma and comorbidity of patients than coagulation abnormality. Further, the frequency and
      severity of fibrinolysis during these procedures have not been well studied. Additionally,
      TXA administration may increase the tendency of postoperative venous thrombosis by inhibiting
      fibrinolysis in already prothrombotic patients. The objective of this study is to quantitate
      the degree of fibrinolysis using rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) and investigate the
      role of TXA prophylaxis on clinical outcome in patients undergoing THA in a double-blind
      fashion. Our hypothesis is that fibrinolysis is minimal at most and TXA prophylaxis is not
      necessary during primary THA.
