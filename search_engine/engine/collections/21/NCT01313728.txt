      a split-face model. All subjects will apply Retin-A Micro Gel (tretinoin) 0.1 % Pump, and
      Aczone Gel (dapsone) 5% daily to one side of the face (with 1 hour between applications,
      applying Aczone Gel first) and Retin-A Micro Gel 0.1 % Pump to the other side of the face in
      a randomized scheme for two consecutive weeks. Subjects will return to the study center daily
      for evaluation and for application of both products (weekend applications will be done at
      home). At each visit the subject will be evaluated and scored for irritation and cutaneous
      treatment effects. Subjects presenting with differences in irritation between one side of the
      face and the other will be photographed and have chromometer readings taken. A single
      treatment center is expected to enroll at least 24 subjects.
