      milk protein allergy (CMPA) is clinically abnormal reaction to cow's milk protein (CMP) via
      immune mechanisms triggered by milk protein (Boyce etal.,2010).

      According to European academy for allergy and clinical immunology (EAACI) and the world
      allergy organization (wao) , a hypersensitivity reaction to cow's milk involving the immune
      system can be called as CMPA. There is difference between CMPA and non-allergic cow's milk
      intolerance (e.g lactose intolerance) which occurs as a result of lactase deficiency without
      involvement of the immune system (Venter etal.,2013).

      CMPA is categorized into immunoglobulin IgE mediated , non -IgE mediated ,or mixed CMPA
      (Sicherer etal.,2001).

      1.9% to 4.9% prevalence of CMPA among children with a peak in prevalence (2-3%) in the first
      year of life and prevalence of <1% in children aged >=6 years (koletzko etal.,2012).
