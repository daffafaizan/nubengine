    
      Study design: This is a randomized, multicenter, open-label, Phase 3 study designed to
      compare the safety and efficacy of Ibrutinib versus Chlorambucil in treatment-naive patients
      65 years or older who have CLL or SLL.

      Eligible patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to Treatment Arm A or B:

        -  Treatment Arm A: Oral Chlorambucil 0.5 mg/kg on Days 1 and 15 of each 28-day cycle; the
           dose can be increased, if well tolerated, in increments of 0.1 mg/kg on Day 1 of each
           cycle to a maximum of 0.8 mg/kg; patients receive a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 12
           cycles, in the absence of progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Treatment Arm B: Oral Ibrutinib 420 mg/day Randomization will be stratified on Eastern
           Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (0,1 versus 2); presence of
           advanced Rai stage (yes/no), advanced being defined as Stages 3-4; and geographic
           region: US versus non-US.
