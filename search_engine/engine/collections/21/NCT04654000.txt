      causes painful ischemic skin lesions due to microvascular calcification and thrombosis of the
      dermis and subcutaneous adipose tissue. Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are the
      main target for calciphylaxis. Rheopheresis is a therapeutic apheresis to treat
      microcirculatory disorders. This double filtration plasmapheresis eliminates a defined
      spectrum of high molecular weight proteins from human plasma including relevant factors for
      vascular inflammation and thrombose. We propose a prospective randomized controlled trial to
      compared the efficacy of rheopheresis as adjuvant treatment to the standard of care compared
      to standard care with Sham-apheresis.
