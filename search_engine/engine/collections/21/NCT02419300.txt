      examination after second trimester miscarriage. Then all patients with endometrial mass on US
      will undergo colour Doppler then surgical evacuation and results of histopathology will be
      recorded.

      Now, pathological examination of suction evacuation products is considered the gold standard
      so sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of US and Doppler are the primary outcome
