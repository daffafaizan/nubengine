      syndrome (AWS) in the ICU. End organ dysfunction and extended exposure can increase the risk
      of complications associated with BZDs, which include increased ICU LOS, time on mechanical
      ventilation, and mortality.

      Flumazenil as a 1, 4-imidazobenzodiazepine is a competitive antagonist for the benzodiazepine
      binding site with weak intrinsic or partial agonistic activity on the GABA receptor. Multiple
      studies have confirmed the safety and effectiveness of flumazenil for the reversal of
      sedation. Pilot studies have demonstrated safe reversal of over-sedation and statistically
      significant improvements in patient cooperation and time to extubation. The current standard
      for suspected BZD-associated hypoactive delirium is cessation of benzodiazepine
      administration and supportive care.

      The role of continuous infusion flumazenil for rapid and sustained reversal of hypoactive
      delirium in the ICU has not been evaluated prospectively and therefore remains poorly
      defined.
