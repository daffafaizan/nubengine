      whether a papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (PTMC) will develop to invasive carcinoma.
      Ideally, patients at high risk of progression may undergo immediate surgery instead of active
      surveillance and those with a very low likelihood of tumor progression may be included in an
      active surveillance protocol. Future research should focus on the development of new
      predictive early markers of papillary thyroid carcinoma during patient follow-up. From the
      above, it is clear the need to develop a new marker that raises the suspicion of possible
      thyroid microcarcinoma, if it is not preoperatively detected by the needle biopsy method and
      the patient has the indication for surgery for another benign thyroid disease. To date, there
      are no absolute biological and clinical parameters distinguishing a low risk from a high risk
      PTMC. If the fine needle aspiration shows stage V and VI Bethesda classification, and there
      is a high suspicion of PTMC, then questions such as the extent of the surgery, lobectomy or
      total thyroidectomy are beginning to be raised. The next dilemma is lymphadenectomy. The
      dilemma is greater if there are enlarged cervical lymph nodes (diameter over 1 cm in diameter
      of the small axis) and subsequently micromestases are confirmed. Another entity is when the
      cervical lymph nodes are not pathologically enlarged. This clinical situation is often
      emphasized as 60-80% of PTMC patients have metastases. By correlating a possible difference
      in the microbiome of a participants peripheral blood preoperatively, together with the
      imaging data, there may have been another marker of early PTMC detection and patient
      management planning respectively.
