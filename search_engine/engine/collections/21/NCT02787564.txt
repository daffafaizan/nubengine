      Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ), a questionnaire on variety of fruits and vegetables consumed
      and a 24-h-food-recall questionnaire. All questionnaires will be administered by trained
      interviewers. During the study period, the 24h-food recall questionnaire will be administered
      four more times; two times before the 4-week intervention period and two times after the
