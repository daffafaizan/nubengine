      medical management for the treatment recurrent symptomatic pleural effusions secondary to CHF
      that are refractory to maximal medical therapy. All trial participants will be adults with
      congestive heart failure (CHF) already managed with maximal medical therapy, as determined by
      their cardiologist or primary physician. Patients will demonstrate recurrent transudative or
      pseudoexudative pleural effusions caused solely by CHF that have not been controlled with
      medical therapy alone. Included patients must also show documented subjective symptomatic
      relief with thoracentesis.

      Patients will be randomized to the intervention group or control group. The intervention
      group will receive a tunneled pleural catheter (TPC) in addition to their current medical
      treatment. The control group will continue with medical therapy by their referring physician
      and serial thoracenteses when clinically appropriate. Patients will then be followed over the
      course of once year after enrollment. The TPC will be drained daily for symptomatic relief.
      Several outcomes, including quality of life based on periodic self-survey and healthcare
      utilization determined by chart review (emergency room visits and hospital stays), will be
      studied. Adverse outcomes of TPC insertion and sequelae of frequent pleural space drainage
      will be documented.
