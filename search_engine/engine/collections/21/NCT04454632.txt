      groups were included in the study for 15 sessions of treatment. All individuals received
      basic treatment as ultrasound, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, cold pack,
      stretching exercises, glenohumeral range of motion exercises, scapulothoracic exercises. The
      mirror group bilateral exercised with an affected arm behind the mirror; visual feedback
      group bilateral exercised by seeing both arms in the mirror; control group bilateral
      exercised without a mirror for 10 minutes after every session. Pain severity was evaluated
      with the "Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)", ROM and proprioception were measured with a universal
      goniometer, and functional status was evaluated with "shoulder pain and disability index
      (SPADI)" and "Modified Constant Score". Evaluations were made before, day after the treatment
      and 4 weeks after the treatment by the same researcher. Data analysis was performed with
      SPSS.23.
