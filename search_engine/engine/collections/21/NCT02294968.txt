      subsets of at risk families. To the best of our knowledge, however, little is known about
      effects of universal primary prevention programs.

      The Family Startup Program is a structured format for implementing pre- and postnatal
      parenting support groups that prepare new families for their roles as parents as well as
      focus on enhancing parents' social network. The Family Startup Program gathers couples in
      groups and introduces participants to informal sources of support (e.g. by meeting and
      interacting with other new families) and to a broad range of community resources (e.g.
      financial advisers, child dentist, local solicitors, family counselors) providing them with
      information and parenting skills. The program content includes handling family finance,
      choice of paternity leave, couple communication, breastfeeding, network formation, ensuring
      dental health, sensitivity toward child signals, child rearing discipline, help-seeking
      behavior, home safety, and more.

      A second formulated rational behind the program is that strengthening father involvement,
      social network formation and access to family services will serve to enhance family
      relationships, including parenting, coparenting and couple relationship quality. Through
      participation in Family Startup, families receive a long term connection with a health
      visitor in the community and are introduced to a broad range of community services. This can
      be expected to benefit optimal health service utility and ease access to resources for
      families and children with need. Improved child outcome are the ultimate goal. No scientific
      evaluation of program effects of the Family Startup program on child or family outcome was
      previously conducted.
