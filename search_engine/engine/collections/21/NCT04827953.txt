      very low survival rates mainly due to its rapid progression and diagnosis in advanced stages,
      which makes its treatment extremely difficult.

      Gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel is currently considered the first-line standard treatment for
      advanced pancreatic cancer due to this superiority against other treatments.

      In order to find an alternative to improve survival of advanced pancreatic cancer, this study
      aims to evaluate the efficacy with first-line treatment in combination of two experimental
      drugs, a Hedgehog pathway inhibitor (NLM-001) and a CTLA-4 blocker (zalifrelimab) in
      previously untreated patients with advanced pancreatic cancer.
