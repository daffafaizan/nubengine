      suffer from obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) The majority of them are undiagnosed and untreated
      at this time.

      The current diagnostic gold standard for OSA is in-laboratory, a full night polysomnography
      (PSG). However, PSG is unable to provide information on upper airway structure and anatomy,
      and cannot identify the obstruction sites. OSA can lead to severe health complications
      including hypertension, heart failure, memory impairment, motor vehicle and work accidents,
      decreased work productivity, and increased risk of death.
