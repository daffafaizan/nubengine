      congenital heart disease (CCHD) between 1 day and 12 months of age following their first
      cardiothoracic surgery. Both groups received standard post-operative care. In addition, Group
      1 received a daily 30-minute restricted non-essential direct caregiving time (Quiet Time),
      and Group 2 received a daily 30-minute massage. Interventions continued for seven consecutive
      days. Pain was measured 6 times daily using the Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability Pain
      Assessment Tool (FLACC). Average daily doses of analgesics were recorded. Heart rates (HR),
      respiratory rates (RR), and oxygen saturations (SpO2) were recorded continuously. Daily
      averages and pre- and post- intervention FLACC scores and physiologic responses were analyzed
      using descriptive statistics, generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) for repeated measures,
      latent growth models, and/or regression discontinuity analysis. Fentanyl-equivalent narcotic
      values were used as a time-varying covariate.
