      progress towards the development of an effective pharmacological treatment for cocaine abuse
      has been disappointing. We are proposing to use our laboratory model of repeated dose cocaine
      self-administration to assess the potential efficacy of the novel antipsychotic,
      aripiprazole. Aripiprazole is a partial agonist at both the dopamine D2 receptor and at the
      serotonin 5HT1a receptor, while antagonizing the 5HT2a receptor. By functioning as a partial
      D2 agonist, aripiprazole is hypothesized to function as a D2 antagonist during
      hypodopaminergic states, such as during cocaine use, while functioning as a D2 agonist during
      hypodopaminergic states, such as during cocaine withdrawal. This 42-day,
      outpatient/inpatient/outpatient/inpatient protocol will evaluate the effects of aripiprazole
      maintenance (0, 15 mg/day) on cocaine craving, subjective effects, and self-administration
      using a within-subjects design. Non-treatment seeking cocaine abusers will be maintained
      outpatient for 16 days of dose maintenance prior to inpatient cocaine self-administration
      sessions. During the inpatient phases, volunteers will live on a hospital clinical research
      unit and will participate in laboratory sessions in which they will have the opportunity to
      choose between repeated doses of smoked cocaine and $5. In addition to measuring their
      cocaine self-administration, we will measure the cardiovascular and subjective effects of
      cocaine under each aripiprazole maintenance condition.
