        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose or "comparable dose" of pirfenidone in pediatric
           patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 and inoperable, symptomatic plexiform
           neurofibromas.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the plasma pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine, preliminarily, if this drug could be beneficial for pediatric patients with
           refractory solid tumors.

        -  Assess the quality of life of patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive oral pirfenidone three times daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28
      days for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of pirfenidone until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, before course 4, and then after every 6 courses.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-18 patients will be accrued for this study within 18 months.
