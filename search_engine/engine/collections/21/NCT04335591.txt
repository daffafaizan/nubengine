    
      This is a prospective, randomized, double-blind study. Subjects who have completed the
      6-month Treatment Period in 18-OBE2109-003 - Edelweiss 3 study (herein referred to as main
      study) will be invited to enter the present extension study. Month 6 visit of the main study
      is a decision point for Subjects to either end treatment and enter a post-treatment follow up
      (part of the main study), or to opt for a 6-month treatment extension.

      All subjects will receive once daily either linzagolix 75 mg alone (with ABT placebo) or 200
      mg combined with ABT for 6 months. Subjects who received placebo during the main study will
      be randomized to either linzagolix 75 mg alone (with ABT placebo) or linzagolix 200 mg with
      ABT. Subjects who received active treatment during the main study will continue with the same
      treatment. Double-dummy design will be used in order to maintain the blinding of the study.

      After end of treatment in the extension study (6-month treatment period: from Month 6 to
      Month 12), subjects will enter a post-treatment Follow-Up Period of 6 months with no
      investigational medicinal product (IMP) or - for subjects willing to continue treatment - a
      second extension study will be proposed.
