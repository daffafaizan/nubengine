    
      Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is one of the most common chronic illnesses in children, affecting 1 in
      400,1 with evidence that its prevalence is increasing worldwide.2 The prevalence of T1D in
      adolescents is approximately 70% White, 22% Hispanic, and 8% Black.3-5 Parents of children
      with T1D are responsible for a labor-intensive and complicated daily regimen that has been
      described as an overwhelming experience, requiring constant vigilance.6 Intensive management
      of T1D requires frequent blood glucose monitoring, multiple insulin injections or use of an
      insulin pump, frequent alterations in insulin dose to match changing diet and activity
      patterns, and regular visits to health care providers. This 24/7 attention to their child's
      health manifests in elevated rates of parental perception of stress and increased risk for
      depression and anxiety. The prevalence of anxiety symptoms for parents of children with T1D
      range from 21-59%; depressive symptoms from 10-74%; psychological distress from 29-33%; and
      posttraumatic stress symptoms from 19-24%.7-9 Parental psychological distress has negative
      health implications for the parent, the overall functioning of the family, the psychological
      adjustment of their child with T1D, diabetes management, and child metabolic control.10-14
      The goal of this application is to complete the psycho-educational web-based program for
      parents of adolescents with T1D (Type1Teamwork) which will help to: 1) decrease parental
      perceived stress and distress; 2) promote parental adjustment to the developmental
      transitions in adolescence; 3) support adolescent autonomy and transfer of diabetes
      responsibility from parent to adolescent; 4) decrease family conflict; and 5) maintain
      metabolic control during adolescence. The investigators propose to complete two major Aims in
      Phase II:

      Specific Aim 1: Develop the Type1Teamwork program (for use on computer, tablet, or smart
      phone) based on the activities completed in Phase I. Six content themes have been identified
      as important to parents and providers. Feasibility assessment has provided support of these
      content themes as well as substantive recommendations to ensure content and interactivity is
      engaging and meets the needs of parents of children with T1D as well as health care
      providers. The investigators will use an iterative process of development and evaluation,
      collaborating with our technology team, parent advisors, and clinical consultants to ensure
      development of a quality product and to submit a peer reviewed manuscript for publication of
      the results.

      Specific Aim 2: Evaluate the Type1Teamwork program through a modest randomized clinical
      trial. The investigators will determine the effect of the program on parent psychosocial
      outcomes (stress, depression, and anxiety), adolescent autonomy, parent-adolescent
      responsibility for T1D management, family conflict, and adolescent metabolic control. Results
      will be presented at diabetes meetings, published in top tier journals (to provide clinical
      and scientific evidence of the newly developed program), and widely disseminated per the
      commercialization and marketing plan.
