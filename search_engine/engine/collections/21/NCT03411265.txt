      participant feedback about the intervention; 2) test the impact of RETAIN on knowledge about
      MAT, as measured by the MAT Knowledge Assessment; 3) assess MAT retention rates in patients
      completing the RETAIN intervention; 4) test the impact of RETAIN on knowledge about HCV/ HIV;
      5) test the impact of RETAIN on interest in being tested for HCV/HIV.

      The acceptability of RETAIN will be assessed with a feedback form which includes questions
      about how helpful the intervention was (scale of 1-4), what the patient liked most and least
      about the intervention, and any suggestions for improving it. The average (and standard
      deviation) for the rated helpfulness of the intervention will be derived and the qualitative
      data about what they liked most and least about the intervention and suggestions for
      improvement will be tabulated. Pre-/post-changes in the percent of correct knowledge
      assessment items (i.e., about MAT and HCV/HIV) and interest in HCV/HIV testing will be
      analyzed using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test. The 3- and 6-month retention rates for RETAIN
      participants will be compared, using Fisher's exact tests, to the overall treatment retention
      rates at 3- and 6- months for the UC Health MAT clinics as determined by the retrospective
      chart review.
