      recommendations are to reduce salt intake to 5-6 g/day or less. Many randomised trials have
      shown that this reduction in salt intake has a significant effect on blood pressure, however,
      most previous trials were carried out in white individuals, fewer in blacks, and none in
      Asians.

      Increasing evidence from epidemiological studies in humans and experimental studies in
      animals suggest that that our current high salt intake may have other harmful effects on
      cardiovascular health e.g. a direct effect on stroke, left ventricular hypertrophy,
      progression of renal disease and proteinuria independent of and additive to salt's effect on
      blood pressure. However, no well-controlled trials have studied whether a modest reduction in
      salt intake has beneficial effects on the surrogate markers of target organ damage in
      cardiovascular disease.

      We propose to carry out a double-blind randomised trial to study the effects of a modest
      reduction in salt intake, as currently recommended, on blood pressure and target organ damage
      assessed by the measurements of 24 hour urinary albumin excretion, left ventricular mass,
      left ventricular diastolic function, pulse wave velocity and capillary density, in white,
      black and Asian individuals with hypertension or prehypertension.

      Comparisons: Usual salt intake compared to reduced salt intake.
