      participants meet the criteria, they are randomly assigned to two intervention groups or an
      active control group. In the first session the participants who suffer from chronic
      nightmares are interviewed using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID-I and
      -II) to determine the clinical diagnosis; in addition, they are given questionnaires and
      record sheets to obtain baseline data. They are asked to record their nightmares in a "dream
      diary" up until the next session four weeks later. At that session they learn one of three
      interventions to reduce nightmares. The first group receives imagery rehearsal treatment in
      which participants learn to consciously alter the contents of their nightmares and then to
      visualize the new set of images. The second group is subjected to confrontation treatment in
      which they are instructed to confront their nightmares until habituation. The third group,
      the psychotherapeutic placebo group, just learn an imagination technique, without reference
      to their nightmares. At the end of the intervention session all participants receive written
      instructions on how to perform the learned method at home. They must also record their dreams
      up until the next session. That session and the last one are used for data acquisition. At
      these sessions, the participants are asked to fill in the questionnaires given to them at the
      beginning of the treatment.
