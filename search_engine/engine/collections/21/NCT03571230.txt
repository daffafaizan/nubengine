    
      Helicobacter pylori(H.pylori), which infects about 50% of the global population, has been
      recognized as a main risk factor of multiple gastric pathologies, especially non-cardiac
      gastric cancer. Strongly evidence supports that H.pylori eradication is an effective approach
      to reduce the incidence of those pathologies. Antimicrobial susceptibility test can pick out
      sensitive drugs to kill Helicobacter pylori, and reduce secondary drug resistance. But, there
      is a lack of high quality RCT to compare its efficacy with empirical regimen in the
      first-line treatment.

      Our study aims to assess the efficacy of 10-day antimicrobial susceptibility test guided
      triple therapy for the first-line treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection. Comparing this
      regimen with 14-day Empirical Tailored Therapy to tell which one is better in clinic
      practice. We also want to find whether the 10-day antimicrobial susceptibility test guided
      triple therapy has less intestinal dysbacteriosis with a shorter duration.
