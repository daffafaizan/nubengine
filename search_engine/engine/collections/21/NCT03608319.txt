    
      This is an open-label, randomized, 3-way crossover, food-effect and sprinkle study. On Day 1
      of each period, subjects will receive a single oral dose of A4250 under 1 of 3 conditions:
      fasting, following a high-fat, high-calorie breakfast, or sprinkled on applesauce. Subjects
      will receive A4250 under each condition on one occasion. Blood samples for PK analysis will
      be collected for 18 hours following each study drug administration. There will be a washout
      period of at least 7 days between doses. Study participants will be contacted approximately
      14 days after the last study drug administration to determine if any adverse event (AE) has
      occurred since the last study visit.
