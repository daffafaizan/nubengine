      main therapeutic applications: visual correction, protection of ocular surface, and cosmetic
      or sport purposes. The ophthalmology department of NTUH has set up contact lens special
      clinic as one of our comprehensive refractive services. The investigators provided corneal
      lenses or Rose K lenses for optical correction of keratoconus patients; the investigators
      also fitted large scleral lenses for the correction of irregular astigmatism for
      post-penetrating keratoplasty and post-refractive surgery patients. In addition, contact
      lenses can be an adjuvant therapy for ocular surface disorders as severe dry eye and limbal
      insufficiency. There were researches that proved the inflammatory mediators and neutrophils
      increased after long-termed wear of silicon hydrogel soft lenses or over night
      orthokeratology lenses. They also concluded that lens wear affected corneal epithelial
      proliferation. However, the physiological changes after long-termed wear of large diameter
      scleral lenses are still pending. In addition, we still do not understand the lens effects on
      high order aberration and ocular surface structures. The purpose of our study is to analyze
      the epidemiologic data and treatment results of the patients fitted with specialty lenses in
      our contact lens clinic from Aug 2016 to Aug 2018. Patients will be categorized into
      different groups by the diagnoses and the type of lens wear. After 6 months of follow up, the
      change of visual acuity, visual function related quality of life, the changes of ocular
      surface structures and physiology will be analyzed. The investigators hope to share the
      experiences of specialty contact lens fitting and understand the effects of long-term contact
      lens wear on ocular surface.
