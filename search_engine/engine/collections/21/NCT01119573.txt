        -  To identify microRNA expression patterns associated with lymph node metastasis in
           samples from patients with endometrial cancer.

      OUTLINE: Banked tumor tissue specimens are analyzed for microRNA expression profiling by
      microarray analysis and reverse transcriptase-PCR assays.
