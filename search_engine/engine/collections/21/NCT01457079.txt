      treated with Radiation Therapy. This registry aims to monitor the at least 1,000 keloid
      patients who received radiation therapy to their keloid and to collect epidemiological and
      clinical data about these patients in order to assess the long term safety and effectiveness
      of radiation therapy.

      Radiation is currently being used in the treatment of keloid, thus enabling the
      epidemiological characteristics of patients, analysis of treatment response, modeling the
      influence of risk factors on patientsÂ´ risk of developing long term complications such as a
      cancer, as well as the detailed analysis of the dose delivered, equipment used and radiation
      planning. This study intends to gather data about the long term efficacy and safety of
      radiation therapy and rate of developing secondary cancers in patients who have received
      radiation therapy for treatment of their keloid.
