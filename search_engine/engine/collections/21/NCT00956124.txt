      angiography and optical coherence tomography. any associations of macular pigment
      distribution and fundus autofluorescence with macular anatomic features are analyzed. primary
      outcome measure is the macular pigment distribution in patients with altered fundus
      autofluorescence. Furthermore we will compare the findings between diabetic and inflammatory
      edema.
