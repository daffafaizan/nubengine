      autopsy reports show a prevalence of 11-36% . The prevalence of gallstones is related to many
      factors including age, gender, and ethnic background. Women are three times more likely to
      develop gallstones than man and first-degree relatives have a two-fold increased prevalence .
      However, the etiology of gallstone formation beginning with the change in the composition of
      bile, leading to stones is not clear.

      The association between Helicobacter pylori (H.Pylori) and gallstones has been investigated
      but not clearly demonstrated. H.Pylori is a gram negative and micro-aerophilic microorganism
      that can cause chronic gastritis, gastric and duodenal ulcers, gastric adenocarcinoma and
      lymphoma of gastric mucosa-related lymphoid tissue (MALToma) . Relationship of H.Pylori with
      diseases of organs other than the stomach and duodenum has also been investigated and
      reported . H.Pylori have been detected in the gallbladder mucosa of patients with gallstones
      .

      In this study, the presence of H.Pylori in the gallbladder mucosa of patients with
      symptomatic gallstones undergoing cholecystectomy was investigated. Concomitant H.Pylori
      infection of the gastric mucosa was also investigated to study the relationship of gastric
      H.Pylori infection to gallstones. It was hypothesized that H.Pylori infection of the gastric
      mucosa may have a role in the formation of gallstones.
