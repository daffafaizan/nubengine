    
      Dose ranging study with consecutive cohorts in two subject populations: patients normally
      responding to current anemia treatment (epoetin alfa) ("normoresponders") and patients not
      responding well to current treatment ("hyporesponders"). Normoresponders are randomized to
      study drug FG-4592 or epoetin alfa; hyporesponders are randomized to study drug FG-4592 or
      epoetin alfa or placebo. The study objectives are to demonstrate that FG-4592 is effective in
      maintaining hemoglobin (Hb) levels when converting from epoetin alfa and to establish optimum
      starting doses and dose adjustment regimens for Hb maintenance.
