      perceptive of, sucrose solutions and sweet foods, whereas others have observed the opposite
      pattern of findings or no difference at all. Among those seeking weight loss treatment, one
      investigation found perception and preferences for sweet taste remained unchanged after
      weight loss, and another observed a decreased ability to distinguish sweet taste from other
      taste solutions. Given these discrepancies in the literature, the proposed study will explore
      whether a relationship exists between insulin and leptin resistance, sweet taste
      responsiveness, and adiposity.
