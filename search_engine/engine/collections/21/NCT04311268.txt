      home, it is unanimously agreed by healthcare professionals that the measurement of
      non-invasive body temperature performed both in a hospital setting, in the office, that at
      home is very imprecise, or even false. As a result, temperature is only an indicator and is
      of little interest. Only the rectal thermometer and the telemetric capsule (e-CELSIUSÂ®
      capsule to be ingested that allows a reliable and continuous measurement of gastrointestinal
      temperature without the intervention of the caregiver) are reliable tools, but they remain
      invasive and do not always allow for fully reliable follow-up over time. We propose to
      develop an algorithm integrated in an external, non-invasive cuff, allowing the continuous
      recording of body temperature.

      In addition, body temperature is one of the markers of biological rhythms. The precise
      determination of the functioning of the biological clock for an individual is essential to
      understanding his physiological state at a given time. This condition is dependent on the
      "timing" of its central clock on the time scale (chronotype). The provision of a
      simple-to-use (F2D cuff), non-invasive and time-dependable temperature tool and the creation
      of appropriate algorithms would allow access to the operation of the central clock and open
      up many therapeutic applications.

      This work proposes to validate the tool on the one hand and on the other to use this tool to
      produce the elements necessary for monitoring the functioning of the central biological
      clock.
