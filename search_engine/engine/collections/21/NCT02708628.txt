    
      120 patients who are admitted for the second cesarean delivery, not taking prophylactic
      medication after the first cesarean section, whose scar development and measurements are
      taken will be included in the study. First caesarean section scars will be removed surgically
      for all patients. 60 out of 120 patients (treatment group) will use prophylactic topical scar
      gel 2 times in a day, and remaining 60 patients (control group )won't use. The efficacy of
      the drug will be evaluated by taking strict measurements of the incision and POSAS (The
      Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale) and Vancouver Scales at 6.12 and 24 weeks.

      Steps;

        1. Observation of the primary cesarean scar by taking scar measurements and using Vancouver
           and POSAS scales.

        2. Surgical removal of the primary cesarean scar in the second cesarean section.

        3. 24 weeks topical application of gel containing extract of allium cepae, allantoin and
           heparin(only treatment group).

        4. Observation of the skin incision at 6,12 and 24 weeks by taking scar measurements with
           using Vancouver and POSAS scales.
