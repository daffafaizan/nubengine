      Exercise is an evidence-based effective self-management strategy that benefits all cancer
      survivors (CS). However, the majority of research and the limited development of
      evidence-based clinical or community programs in exercise and cancer has been conducted
      almost exclusively in urban academic and clinical settings, with very limited implementation
      outreach to "hard to reach" CS.

      In this proposed cancer exercise hybrid implementation effectiveness research, over 5 years
      we will use an integrated knowledge translation approach to move the current evidence-base
      that clearly supports the role of exercise in cancer survivorship, into sustainable and
      effective community-based or online settings that will optimize the delivery of exercise to
      rural/remote and underserved CS (RCS). Implementing and evaluating the proposed Exercise
      Oncology Survivorship (EOS) partnership model will result in a sustainable resource to
      support the implementation and delivery of exercise oncology programs in rural Canadian
      communities.

      Investigators will work to develop lasting referral pathways between cancer care clinics and
      local fitness professionals. These fitness professionals will have additional cancer specific
      training to ensure they can effectively and safely deliver the program. Eligible and
      consenting participants will be screened for exercise safety, and following fitness testing
      will be triaged to appropriate exercise programming. If, due to COVID-19 public health
      restrictions, community based programming cannot occur, the exercise sessions will be
      delivered online by fitness professionals.
