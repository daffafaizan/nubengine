      disorders such as Alzheimer's disease are a growing public-health concern with devastating
      effects.

      Referring to animal data, empirical studies, and pilot human trials, dietary modification
      (caloric restriction, omega-3 fatty acids and resveratrol) should improve cognitive functions
      such as learning and memory. To test this hypothesis, the researchers study general brain
      functions in elderly subjects (50-80 years old) with mild cognitive impairment.
