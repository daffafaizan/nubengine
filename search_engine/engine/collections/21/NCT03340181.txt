    
      66 patients scheduled for OPCABG are randomly assigned to a RIPC group(n=33) or a control
      group(n=33). In the RIPC group, 4 cycles of 5-min ischemia(using a blood pressure cuff
      inflated to 40mmHg over the patient's basic blood pressure) and 5-min repercussion are done
      on an upper limb before skin incision. Patients in the control group wear the same cuff on an
      upper limb but no pressure is applied. Anesthetic and surgical techniques are standardized
      during the trial. Serum inflammatory cytokines and cardiac injury markers will be measured
      before and after surgery. Internal mammary artery and saphenous vein tissues will be
      collected during the surgery to assess hypoxia-inducible factor (Hif)-1a and other signalling
      proteins.
