      CYPs occurs. However, no substantial first pass metabolism of VRC has been reported. In
      humans the VRC metabolism has not been studied systematically. It is therefore important to
      assess VRC metabolism on its own and in addition the influence of CYP2C19 genetic
      polymorphisms on the formation of the different VRC metabolites.
