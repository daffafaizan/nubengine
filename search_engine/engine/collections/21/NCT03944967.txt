      but may also precipitate major morbidity and mortality. Despite major improvements in the
      safety of anesthesia and surgery a significant number of elderly patients experience a
      complication after cardiac surgery.

      To determine if postoperative remote monitoring of vital signs can be used to identify
      medication risk factors for vital sign deterioration in older cardiac surgery patients..

        -  Single center pilot study.

        -  100 older patients undergoing cardiac surgery.

        -  Continuous remote monitoring of vital signs starts after ICU discharge

        -  PR, RR and SpO2 will be continuously monitored in all patients.

        -  Patients and healthcare personnel are blinded for monitoring results.

        -  Main study endpoint is vital sign deterioration.

      The study population includes 100 patients â‰¥70 years undergoing elective cardiac surgery.
