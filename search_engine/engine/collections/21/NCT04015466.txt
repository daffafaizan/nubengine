      improved prognosis in locally advanced stage III and IV GC. A therapeutic approach to GC
      based on current histological and image criteria (Tumour Node Metastasis -TNM- stage) is
      insufficient. Although multiple targeted agents are currently under investigation, so far,
      only trastuzumab and ramucirumab have demonstrated efficacy in advanced GC and have a
      regulatory approval. For this reason, the identification of specific targets that could be
      susceptible for drug inhibition, is an urgent requirement. Moreover, most studies and current
      international databases on late-stage/advanced GC are largely based on Asian populations, in
      sharp contrast tumour biology and genome of EU or CELAC populations remain poorly known.

      The primary objective of this study are to:

        1. Characterize a multi-centric cohort including EU and CELAC populations diagnosed with
           advanced GC through a multi-omic approach including proteomics, genomics,
           transcriptomics, microbiome and exposome analysis due to study the determinants of GC.

        2. Identify the regional differences in EU and CELAC populations recruiting patients for
           this study for each omic characterization due to identify the high-risk group
           populations.

        3. Identify and select from the multi-omic approach those biomarkers useful for the
           development of an algorithm to guide the therapeutic approach for advanced GC.
