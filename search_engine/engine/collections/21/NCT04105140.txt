      investigate the effect of oxytocin treatment on prosocial learning. Before the
      self-administration, participants need to finish several questionnaires including IRI, AAS,
      BASBIS, SPSRQ, SES, PTM, STAI, BDI, ASQ and PNAS. They would finish the PANAS again before
      the scanning.

      Participants are informed that they perform the reward learning task either for themselves,
      another (unknown) person or no one (control). In the probabilistc reward learning task,
      associations with two stimuli with different reward probabilities are learned via monetary
      feedback (reward ￥1 or no reward ￥0). After the experiment, participants need to finish the
      PANAS.
