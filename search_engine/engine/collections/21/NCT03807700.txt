      parallel design in healthy participants with a full conventional, acrylic denture in either
      or both dental arches, with a treatment period of 12 weeks. The study will assess the
      effectiveness of an experimental denture adhesive in the improvement of denture-bearing
      tissue irritation related measures, and the participant's oral health related quality of
      life. Participants will be randomized to one of the 2 treatment groups i.e. experimental
      denture arm group and control arm group and will undergo an oral soft tissue (OST)
      examination. Participants with satisfactory dentures, adequate retention and stability and
      who qualify all the inclusion and exclusion criteria will continue in the study. Participants
      will complete the Gum Comfort, OHIP-Edent questionnaires and GOHAI questionnaire. The
      assessments will be made at Baseline, and after 1, 4, 8 and 12 weeks treatment.
