    
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of QR-421a administered
      via IVT in subjects with RP due to mutations in exon 13 of the USH2A gene. Subjects will
      receive one single IVT injection of QR-421a or sham-procedure in one eye (subject's worse
      eye) and will be followed up for 24 months.

      Three dose levels of QR-421a will be evaluated: 50, 100, and 200 µg. Additional dose levels
      (eg, 25 or 400 µg) may be evaluated based on ongoing safety and efficacy data monitoring.

      Initial dose cohorts will include subjects randomized to sham-procedure or treatment with
      QR-421a. Additional subjects may be allocated to treatment with QR-421a in subsequent or
      initial dose cohorts.
