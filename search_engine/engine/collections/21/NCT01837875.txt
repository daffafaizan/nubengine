      local/MUSC Study Coordinators. A unique 'a-la-carte' self-management program will be offered
      to 50 African-American lupus patients participating in an ongoing SLE Clinic Database Project
      at MUSC. The Intervention Coordinator will work with each participant in the intervention arm
      to create an individualized intervention plan (IIP). Each IIP will include 1-4 options,
      including a mail-delivered arthritis kit, addition and access to a listserv, participation in
      a support group, and enrollment in local self-management program(s). Due to the nature of the
      IIP, the proposed intervention will inherently vary by participant. A 'set menu' control
      group of 50 lupus patients will be offered a standardized chronic disease self-management
      program only, and a control group of 50 lupus patients will receive usual care (UC), void of
      intervention components. Validated measures of stress, depression, and quality of life will
      be collected in all patients in each condition before and after intervention activities. To
      ensure intervention integrity, discrete components will follow written protocols and peer
      leaders will complete a standardized checklist for each session/encounter.
