      relatively high and clinical consequences are important. Therefore, secondary prophylaxis
      using oral anticoagulant treatment (OAT) is usually established in these patients. This
      treatment very effectively reduces the risk of recurrences but induces an increased risk of
      bleeding. Major bleeding complications can be expected in ~2% patient-years. Therefore,
      current recommendations limit OAT to a period of 3 to 12 months. After stopping of OAT,
      however, ~10 % of patients with an initial episode of unprovoked DVT will develop a recurrent
      event within 1 year. This group of patients may benefit from prolonged OAT. The results of 2
      independent observational studies showed a significantly higher risk of recurrence in
      patients showing increased levels of D-Dimer after withdrawal of OAT. D-Dimer is a biomarker
      that indicates fibrin formation followed by fibrinolysis. Based on these data we hypothesize
      that D-Dimer testing can be successfully used to tailor the duration of OAT in patients after
      an unprovoked episode of DVT. This clinical trial will investigate this hypothesis using a
      prospective, randomized, and controlled design.
