      and protective efficacy of PfSPZ Vaccine. This vaccine administered at 1.35 times 10(5) PfSPZ
      per injection by the IV route on a schedule of 5 vaccinations was previously shown to confer
      protection in all vaccinated subjects against CHMI performed shortly after last vaccination;
      however there was limited durability of protection in a small number of protected subjects
      who were rechallenged several months later. This study is designed to substantiate the
      initial results with the IV vaccination route for protection against CHMI. Based on the
      potential importance of dose and schedule in optimizing sustained immunity with this vaccine,
      an increase in PfSPZ IV dosage on schedules of 3 to 5 vaccinations will be evaluated for
      protection against CHMI conducted early (about 3 weeks) and late (about 24 weeks) after
      completion of vaccinations. To assess if a higher dose given by another route confers
      protection, one group will receive PfSPZ IM, with half of the amount administered in each arm
      on a schedule with 4 vaccination.

      The primary objectives of the study are related to the safety and tolerability of
      vaccinations by the IV and IM routes of administration and protection against Plasmodium
      falciparum (Pf) challenge performed via a well-established CHMI procedure early (2-4 weeks)
      after completing schedules of 3 to 5 vaccinations. The secondary objective is related to the
      durability of protection at 20-26 weeks after the last vaccination and exploratory objectives
      are related to the immunogenicity of the PfSPZ Vaccine and identifying potential immune
      correlates of protection.
