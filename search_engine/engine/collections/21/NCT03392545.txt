      prognosis. The current strategy for newly diagnosed GBM patients includes surgery,
      chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Unfortunately, after the standard treatmetn,the median
      survival of GBM is only about one year. Once relapsed, there is no standard therapy and
      survival is less than 9 months. Recently, personalized cancer immunotherapy has shown great
      promise in treating different types of cancers. However, effective immunotherapies for high
      grade gliomas, especially after progression, have yet to be established. Newly diagnosed GBM
      patients experience recurrence in five or seven months after standard treatment. We will
      investigate whether combining radiotherapy with intratumoral and systemic administration of
      immune adjuvants will improve the treatment outcome of high grade gliomas. We will use
      several immune adjuvants that activate innate and adaptive immunity.
