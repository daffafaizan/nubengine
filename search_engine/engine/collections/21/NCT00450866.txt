      Primary

        -  Determine the 3-month CNS-progression free survival of patients with CNS metastases
           secondary to breast cancer treated with epothilone B.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the CNS response rate and duration of CNS response in patients treated with
           this drug.

        -  Determine the systemic disease response rate and duration of systemic response in
           patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the overall survival of patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, open-label study.

      Patients receive epothilone B IV over 20 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in
      the absence of disease progression, satisfactory response, or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 55 patients will be accrued for this study.
