      procedures by optimizing the need for speed and accuracy. The system is able to
      simultaneously acquire data from multiple electrodes. In addition, based on user-defined
      criteria, the system is able to efficiently acquire data over multiple cardiac beats. When
      used in conjunction with the Rhythmia Mapping Catheter, the system is able to acquire up to
      hundreds of points per minute leading to fast and detailed map creation.

      Since its market release, physicians and users have gained experience with the Boston
      Scientific Rhythmia Mapping System in the human clinical setting. Improvements to the first
      generation system are in development and include new and improved software features and
      mapping algorithms to enhance the clinical operation. These new and improved software
      features and algorithms require leveraging clinical use data as part of the development and
      iteration process.

      This study will evaluate the performance of potential next-generation software features in a
      low-risk clinical environment by streaming raw signals from a commercial Rhythmia Workstation
      during standard of care cardiac mapping and ablation treatments for tachyarrhythmias,
      specifically atrial fibrillation, atrial tachycardias, and ventricular tachycardia. The data
      will be evaluated on a parallel investigational Rhythmia Workstation using prototype software
      features. These next-generation software features and algorithms will not be available to the
      physician during the case and will therefore have no diagnostic or therapeutic impact on the
      clinical case.
