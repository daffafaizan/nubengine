    
      The primary objective of this study is to determine whether acute supplementation
      (neoadjuvant Vitamin D3), adjusted according to baseline Vitamin D status, can improve the
      clinical PDT response relative to participants receiving PDT alone

      The secondary objective of this study is to determine whether gene polymorphisms in VDR and
      CYP27B1 are predictive for the degree of responsiveness to Vitamin D as a neoadjuvant for
      PDT.

      This study is a non-randomized interventional trial, in which the study group will be
      compared to a baseline cohort of patients from a previous study who received the same regimen
      of PDT, but without any Vit D. It is anticipated that 30 participants will be involved in
      this study.
