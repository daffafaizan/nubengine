      I. To measure the toxicity profile of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) when co-administered with
      full-course RCHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin hydrochloride, vincristine
      sulfate, and prednisone) in subjects with previously untreated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma
      (DLBCL).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess clinical outcomes including response rate, event-free survival, and overall
      survival after MK-3475 + RCHOP induction for subjects with previously untreated DLBCL.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To measure baseline expression of proteins in the programmed death-1 (PD-1) family on
      tumor cells and coexisting immune infiltrates, using archival tissue when available.

      II. To measure peripheral blood T cell subsets before and after treatment using flow
      cytometry, and to measure baseline vitamin D (25-hydroxy, total).

      III. To explore relationships with these parameters and likelihood of response to therapy and
      outcomes.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1 and prednisone
      orally (PO) on days 1-5. Patients also receive rituximab IV, cyclophosphamide IV, doxorubicin
      hydrochloride IV, and vincristine sulfate IV on day 2 of course 1 and on day 1 of subsequent
      courses. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of the study treatment, patients are followed up to 5 years.
