      movement sleep are associated with memory consolidation and can be enhanced with auditory
      stimulation (playing precisely timed brief bursts of quiet noise) to improve memory. The
      investigators will measure differences in sleep and memory performance in epilepsy inpatients
      with implanted hippocampal electrodes and continuous full scalp EEG monitoring under three
      overnight sleep conditions: a baseline night; a memory night during which sleep-dependent
      memory consolidation is assessed with the finger tapping motor sequence task (MST) with
      training prior to sleep and testing the next morning; and a stimulation night during which
      participants train on the MST, have precisely timed auditory stimulation during the sleep
      that follows, and are tested on the MST in the morning.
