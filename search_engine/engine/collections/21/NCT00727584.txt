        -  To examine whether a phase III randomized study comparing a single-fraction of
           radiotherapy with multi-fraction radiotherapy is acceptable to clinicians and to
           patients with metastatic spinal cord compression.

        -  To determine the feasibility of conducting this study in the United Kingdom.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified by treatment center and known
      prognostic factors (ambulatory status at diagnosis, primary tumor type, and extent of disease
      [spinal metastases only vs spinal and non-bony metastases]). Patients are randomized to 1 of
      2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I (multi-fraction radiotherapy): Patients undergo 5 fractions of 20 Gy external-beam
           radiotherapy.

        -  Arm II (single-fraction radiotherapy): Patients undergo 1 fraction of 8 Gy external beam
           radiotherapy.

      Patients undergo assessment of ambulatory status, quality of life, bladder and bowel
      function, and acute toxicity via self-reported questionnaires and telephone follow-ups at
      baseline and weeks 1, 4, 8, and 12.
