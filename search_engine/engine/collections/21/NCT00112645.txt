        -  Determine the toxicity of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, in terms
           of the incidence of grade 3-4 acute graft-versus-host disease, in young patients with
           relapsed or refractory solid tumors.

        -  Determine the incidence of transplant-related mortality at 100 days post-transplantation
           in these patients.

      OUTLINE:

        -  Conditioning: Patients receive busulfan IV or orally 4 times daily on days -8 to -5 (a
           total of 16 doses) and melphalan IV over 15-20 minutes on days -4 to -2. Patients with
           an unrelated donor also receive anti-thymocyte globulin IV on days -4 to -2.

        -  Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SCT): Patients undergo allogeneic
           hematopoietic SCT on day 0.

        -  Post-transplant graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis: Patients who undergo cord
           blood SCT receive cyclosporine and methylprednisolone for graft-versus-host disease
           (GVHD) prophylaxis. Patients who undergo peripheral blood or bone marrow SCT receive
           cyclosporine and methotrexate (short course) for GVHD prophylaxis.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10 patients will be accrued for this study within 4 years.
