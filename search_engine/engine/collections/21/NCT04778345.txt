      informed consent will receive 68Ga-FAPI PET/CT on the 2nd day to 1st week of 18F-FDG PET/CT.
      On PET/CT, omentum, peritoneum, and mesenteric lesions with increased radioactive uptake are
      defined as suspicious peritoneal carcinomatosis. The number of these positive lesions, the
      maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax), median and range will be recorded. Subsequently,
      the patients will undergo laparoscopic exploration, and if radical resection is assessed,
      radical gastrectomy (D2 lymph node dissection) will be performed. If a radical resection is
      not feasible, for patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis detected, one metastasis will be
      taken for rapid frozen diagnosis. After the peritoneal carcinomatosis is confirmed, the
      metastases seen under laparoscopy will be matched with the suspicious peritoneal
      carcinomatosis on the three preoperative imaging examinations. The intraoperative findings
      are used as the gold standard to compare the detection efficiency of the three imaging
      examinations for peritoneal carcinomatosis. Patients with unresected tumors will receive 4
      cycles of conversion therapy or neoadjuvant therapy. After the treatment, 18F-FDG PET/CT and
      68Ga-FAPI PET/CT will be performed again. If necessary, patients will be subjected to a
      second laparoscopic exploration, and radical gastrectomy (D2 lymph node dissection) will be
      performed for appropriate patients. If a radical resection is still not feasible, for
      patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis detected, biopsy of metastases will be performed if
      necessary.
