      who are admitted to the ICU. The accumulation of respiratory secretions in the subglottic
      space is a well-proven cause of VAP. Therefore, prevention should include the aspiration of
      secretions from the subglottic space. Investigators invented a manual method with high-flow
      air produced by resuscitator to impinge secretion from the subglottic space to oral cavity.
      This method has been granted as a patent by Chinese national intellectual property patent
      office, it has been used in investigators' daily work for more than 10 years and more than 20
      Chinese ICUs have used it everyday. Investigators want to compare it with conventional method
      which uses a special intubation tube with an independent dorsal lumen to suction subglottic
      secretion.
