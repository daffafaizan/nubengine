    
      Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is one of the leading causes of female infertility,
      affecting 5-10% of reproductive-age women . This heterogeneous disorder is characterized by
      anovulatory infertility, androgen excess, an increase in the ratio of LH to FSH, and
      morphologic polycystic changes to the ovaries. Obesity and insulin resistance are also
      metabolic factors associated with PCOS that further increase the morbidity in these patients.
      Inducing fertility in patients with PCOS can be a challenge, as it most often involves
      ovulation induction that can lead to ovarian enlargement, hyperstimulation, and
      multiple-birth pregnancies. This study is designed to determine novel effective strategies to
      promote normal cycling in this patient population.
