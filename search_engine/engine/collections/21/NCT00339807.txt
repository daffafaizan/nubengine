      (HTLV-I) infection. In these areas, however, epidemiology of HTLV-I appears to differ.
      Various observations from population-based studies indicate that differences in host immune
      response to virus infection is likely to result in different frequencies of disease
      manifestations across geographic regions. While gender, age and route of infection may partly
      determine host immune response, the observed geographic differences may also reflect, in
      part, host genetic background as evidenced by the distribution of human leukocyte antigens
      (HLA) and presence of other environmental factors.

      The reported differences underscore the need for comparative studies in these endemic areas.
      In addition, analyses of larger, pooled data of HTLV-I carriers from different geographic
      areas are needed to ensure statistical power in studies of gene-environment interactions with
      extended use of molecular markers. However, existing population-based studies from Japan and
      the Caribbean are unfortunately no comparable with respect to the study subject's age and
      gender distributions. In order to address this issue, we proposed a study of blood donors in
      Jamaica, which enrolls a large number of both HTLV-I positive and HTLV-I negative, consisting
      of subjects that are more comparable to existing Japanese study with respect to age and sex.
      The proposed study will provide a basis for a comparative study of HTLV-I carriers in Japan
      and Jamaica and a comprehensive analysis of host genetic background of HTLV-I associated
      illnesses in the Black population.
