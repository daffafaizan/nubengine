      Er+/Her2- cases, we propose to use the PET scan to guide therapy after the first course of
      TEC. Those who drop in SUVâ‰¤5%, will have their treatment modified by using the Oncotype test.
      Those Her2 negative patients whose response to the first 4 courses of induction TEC is less
      than a complete remission, will have their tretment changed to a second line regimen,
      Navelbine-Avastin-Xeloda(NAX), with the intention of capturing a better response prior to
      surgery. Those who are Her2+ will initially also receive TEC but subsequent therapy will
      include Trastuzumab(Herceptin) whether thet respond wellor not to TEC.
