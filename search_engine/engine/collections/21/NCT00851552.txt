      Primary

        -  To determine the overall objective response rate (i.e., complete and partial response)
           in patients with relapsed or refractory, CD20-positive, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma
           treated with bortezomib, pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride, and rituximab.

      Secondary

        -  To assess the toxicity/safety profile associated with this regimen.

        -  To conduct correlative translational research studies.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive bortezomib IV on days 1, 4, 8, and 11, pegylated liposomal
      doxorubicin hydrochloride IV on day 11, and rituximab IV on day 8. Treatment repeats every 21
      days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Tissue and blood samples are collected periodically for correlative studies. Samples are
      analyzed for expression of CD11b/CD18, CD32, CD 33, CD62, CD64, CD69, and CD56 by flow
      cytometric analysis of neutrophils, NK cells, and monocytes; antibody-dependent cellular and
      complement-mediated cytotoxicity; and genotypic analysis of polymorphisms by PCR. Autologous
      neoplastic B-cells derived from tissue samples are used for genetic and protein profiling.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically for 4 years.
