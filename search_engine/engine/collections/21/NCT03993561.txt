      a comprehensive draft TSSP specifically tailored for HNC patients. The investigators will
      pilot this study among 20 head and neck cancer survivors. Once the investigators have the
      feedback from the pilot patients, the investigators will conduct a focus group with the
      members of our head and neck multidisciplinary group to gain input on the TSSP.

      Evaluation of TSSP: The investigators will recruit head and neck cancer survivors with
      curable stage I-IVA head and neck mucosal cancer at a tertiary level cancer center in
      Ontario. Patients will receive a survivorship care plan (TSSPs) intervention. The
      intervention will consist of a survivorship care nurse or radiation therapist counseling
      session coupled with the provision of individualized TSSPs to patients and their health care
      providers. After a baseline telephone or in-person interview, eligible participants will be
      provide with the TSSP.

      The primary outcome will be physician implementation of TSSP care recommendations over the
      course of 12 months, assessed by quarterly patient interviews. Secondary outcomes will
      include adherence to recommended follow-up schedules, quality of life using validated
      measures and patient satisfaction with care.
