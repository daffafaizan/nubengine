    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To define the biodistribution of gallium Ga 68 fibroblast activation protein inhibitor
      (FAPi)-46 (68Ga-FAPi-46) in normal and cancer tissues of patients with various malignancies.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the degree of 68Ga-FAPi-46 accumulation observed by positron emission
      tomography (PET) imaging as opposed to the amount of FAP in excised cancer tissue.

      II. To assess the correlation of 68Ga-FAPI-46 biodistribution with 18F-fluodeoxyglucose
      (FDG), 68Ga-DOTATATE, or 18F-DOPA (FDOPA), depending on the specific indication.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive 68Ga-FAPi-46 intravenously (IV) then 20-90 minutes later undergo
      PET/computed tomography (CT).
