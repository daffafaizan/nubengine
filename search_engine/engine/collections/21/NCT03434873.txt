      repetitive magnetic stimulation on sacral roots. Another twenty Multiple sclerosis patient
      with lower urinary tract symptoms will be receiving repetitive magnetic stimulation on motor
      cortex. Treatment outcome will be assessed and compared between the two groups.

      Twenty trains of 50 stimuli at 5 Hz (train duration: 10 seconds) separated by a 40-second
      pause were delivered for a total of 1000 pulses (total duration: 16 minutes) once a day for
      four consecutive days for two weeks.
