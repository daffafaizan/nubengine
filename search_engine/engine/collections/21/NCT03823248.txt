      which is the key of secondary prevention for gastric cancer. However, no universally
      acknowledged effective therapeutic scheme is available at present. Previously, the
      investigator's research group has carried out clinical trial study based on solving the key
      problems such as diagnostic criteria, mucosal biopsy consistency and therapeutic evaluation
      methodology, and has attained certain achievements. This study had adopted the multi-center,
      randomized and controlled experiment design based on standardized mucosal biopsy and
      pathohistological operation, as well as therapeutic evaluation methodology. Meanwhile,
      patients diagnosed with chronic atrophic gastritis accompanying with low grade
      intraepithelial neoplasia and indefinite dysphasia (grade C2/C3 of Vienna classification)
      confirmed by gastroscopic histopathology were enrolled as the objects of study, while folic
      acid was used as the control. The therapeutic effect and safety of Jianpi Huoxue Recipe
      (Moluodan + Sanchi powder) in intervening the gastric Premalignant lesion were evaluated from
      the points of view of pathology, gastroscopy and symptoms. The elimination rate of
      intraepithelial neoplasia of gastric mucosa was expected to be improved by 9-12%. Moreover,
      high quality evidence-based medical evidence regarding traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) in
      intervening gastric Premalignant lesion would be obtained, which could form the mature,
      propagable and effective scheme. At the same time, molecular and biological indicators,
      including CDX2, SOX2, MUC2, MUC6, MUC5AC and CD10, were detected using the pathological
      tissues, so as to explore the therapeutic mechanism of Jianpi Huoxue Recipe in intervening
      gastric Premalignant lesion, and to construct the model platform for special disease research
      on gastric Premalignant lesion.
