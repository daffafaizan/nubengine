      largely caused by the normal wear and tear that goes along with aging. Although nonsurgical
      treatment relieves pain and improves function in the shoulder, surgical repair for a torn
      rotator cuff is indicated if symptoms persisted or deteriorated after 3 months nonsurgical
      treatments, Recently, arthroscopic repair has become the mainstream of surgical repair for
      rotator cuff tear. However, the healing of a repaired tendon is not always predictable.
      Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are pluripotent cells that can differentiate into multiple
      mesenchymal tissues, including tenocytes, chondrocytes and osteoblasts, as well as being a
      source of multiple growth factors to establish an environment conducive to soft and hard
      tissue regeneration. As bone marrow concentration has high concentration of mesenchymal stem
      cells, some studies have shown that autologous bone marrow concentration can improve the
      healing of tendon grafts in a bone tunnel. Therefore, the goal of this study was to evaluate
      the effect of bone marrow concentration on healing of rotator cuff.
