    
      This study is randomized, double-blind (blinded for the study subject and investigators),
      placebo-controlled international multicenter study in the parallel assignment of the subjects
      to assess efficacy, immunogenicity and safety of the Sputnik-Light vector vaccine in adults
      in the SARS-СoV-2 infection prophylactic treatment

      The subjects will be randomized into two groups in the ratio of 1:3; a control group (1500
      subjects receiving placebo) and a study group (4500 subjects receiving the Sputnik-Light
      vector vaccine against the SARS-СoV-2-induced COVID19 infection).

      For the evaluation of immunogenicity an unbalanced design is adopted of the placebo and
      vaccinated group at a 1:3 ratio. Subsequently the number of subjects in Subgroup A tested
      will be 1076 subjects, distributed as follows: 269 in the placebo group and 807 in the
      vaccinated group, also randomized into two groups in the ratio of 1:3 who will attend for
      assessment of immunogenicity compared to baseline.

      Each subjects will participate in the trial for approximately 6 months after the first dose
      of the study vaccine/placebo and will have at least tree on-site visits, including a
      screening visit to the study clinical site during the study period and several observation
      Phone Call/ Tele-consultation visits during the study
