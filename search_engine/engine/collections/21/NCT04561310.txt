      Facilitation Stretch (PFS) in frozen shoulder. Additionally there is a very limited
      literature on the evaluation of ART in comparison with PFS in adhesive capsulitis of diabetic
      patient. Disease such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), osteoarthritis (OA) etc that cause
      stiffness of the shoulder joint also present with altered muscle activity, that in long run
      becomes one of the main causes of reduces joint range of motion. With this study, we will be
      able to determine the technique that will have better effects in realigning the muscle
      kinematics and to normalize the muscle activity along with reducing muscle stiffness with
      mobilizations techniques. This study will also fulfill that research gap and will provide
      clinicians with an alternative approach in treatment of adhesive capsulitis.
