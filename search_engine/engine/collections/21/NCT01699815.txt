      (IV) acetaminophen and how timing relates to analgesic efficacy as measured by postoperative
      pain scores. A maximum of 138 patients meeting inclusion criteria who present for a scheduled
      total hip replacement under general anesthesia will be randomized into one of two arms: 1)
      the closure group will receive the first dose of one gram of intravenous acetaminophen
      administered upon onset of skin closure, 2) the preemptive group will receive the first dose
      of one gram of intravenous acetaminophen administered within 60 minutes prior to incision.
      Both groups will receive subsequent doses of one gram of intravenous acetaminophen every 6
      hours x 24 hours. The maximum dose in a 24 hour period will not exceed 4 grams according to
      FDA recommendations.
