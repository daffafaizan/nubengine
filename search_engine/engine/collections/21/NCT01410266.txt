      access to it may be impeded by the fact that not all women can afford or want to return for a
      follow-up visit. This often results in a high loss to follow-up rate. Additionally, with
      medical abortions of those women who do return for follow-up, higher costs are borne by both
      the woman and the healthcare system.

      This study compares two methods of follow-up after medical abortion: standard of care versus
      alternative follow-up. The former involves a routine clinic visit two weeks after misoprostol
      administration. The latter consists of a low-sensitivity pregnancy test and a
      self-administered questionnaire. Based on the results of the test and questionnaire, women
      may be flagged as needing in-clinic follow-up or discharged from the study if their abortion
      is complete.
