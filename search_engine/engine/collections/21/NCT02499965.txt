      nurses and medics) to receive a total of two separate IV canulations - one in one arm and the
      other in the other. One IV canulation would be pretreated with Ethyl Chloride topical
      anesthetic (the study product) and the other would be pre-treated with a placebo (sterile
      water in an aerosol can). Both the participants and the nurses, PAs and medics who placed the
      IVs were blinded as to which was the Ethyl Chloride and which was the placebo. After the IVs
      were placed the participants were asked to rate the pain of IV canulation on a scale of 1 to
      10 for each of the pre-treatments, to state which one they believed to be superior in
      reducing the pain of receiving the IV, to state whether or not they would like the
      intervention that they rated as superior to be used on themselves and finally how likely they
      were on a 5 point scale to incorporate the intervention they rated as superior into their
      future practice.
