      ischemic-reperfusion injury. Studies in animal models of acute myocardial infarction suggest
      that an infusion of sodium nitrite, which is nonenzymatically converted to nitric oxide in
      the setting of ischemia, significantly reduces ischemia-reperfusion injury resulting in
      smaller infarcts and improved left ventricular function. The objectives of this phase 2 trial
      are to determine the tolerability and safety of a 48-hour infusion of sodium nitrite in
      patients with an acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction receiving percutaneous
      coronary intervention. The efficacy of a 48-hour infusion of sodium nitrite will be
      determined by noninvasive imaging to determine infarct size and left ventricular function.
