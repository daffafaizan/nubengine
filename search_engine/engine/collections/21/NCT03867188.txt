      morphine equivalent usage postoperatively while maintaining similar pain scores and lengths
      of stay when compared to patients that did not receive intraoperative liposomal bupivacaine.
      Thus, if the use of liposomal bupivacaine proves to aid in pain control and the reduction of
      initial opiate use following soft tissue sarcoma resection, it could be reasonably suggested
      that liposomal bupivacaine become incorporated into a multimodal form of pain management
      following soft tissue sarcoma resection. These results are expected to have a significant
      positive impact; allowing for a reduction in narcotic pain medication usage and its
      associated side effects while decreasing health care expenditures.
