      recurrent or metastatic breast cancer. II. Determine the duration of response and time to
      treatment failure in these patients with this treatment regimen. III. Correlate serum levels
      of nitrocamptothecin and its lactone metabolite with response and toxicity in these patients.
      IV. Correlate topoisomerase I and II levels with toxicity and response in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral nitrocamptothecin daily on days 1-5. Treatment continues
      weekly for 8 weeks. Patients achieving complete or partial response or stable disease
      continue therapy in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are
      followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-43 patients will be accrued for this study within 8-18
      months.
