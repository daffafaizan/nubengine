      ARM I: Between 4 and 72 hours prior to start of HCT conditioning therapy, patients receive
      ustekinumab intravenously (IV). Beginning 8 weeks after receiving IV ustekinumab, patients
      receive ustekinumab subcutaneously (SC) on days 50 (+/- 5 days), 100 (+/- 7 days), and 160
      (+/- 7 days) post-HCT in the absence of grade III-IV acute GVHD, disease relapse or
      unacceptable toxicity. NOTE: HCT infusion takes place on day 0.

      ARM II: Between 4 and 72 hours prior to start of HCT conditioning therapy, patients receive a
      placebo IV. Beginning 8 weeks after IV placebo, patients receive a placebo SC on days 50 (+/-
      5 days), 100 (+/- 7 days), and 160 (+/- 7 days) post-HCT in the absence grade III-IV acute
      GVHD, of disease relapse, or unacceptable toxicity. NOTE: HCT infusion takes place on day 0.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months post-HCT.
