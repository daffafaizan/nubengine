      live microorganisms, which when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on
      the host by passively occupying a niche that may otherwise be colonized by pathogens. This
      tends to limit a pathogen's ability to bind to tissue surfaces and to produce virulence
      factors.8 In the past few years, probiotics have been investigated for periodontal health.
      Studies have shown that certain gut bacteria can exert beneficial effects in the oral cavity
      by inhibiting pathogenic species. Teughels et al., in a study showed that application of
      beneficial oral bacteria subgingivally after scaling and root planing led to a more host
      compatible subgingival microbiota which may also effect the promotion of a beneficial host
      response.10 Studies have revealed that probiotic Lactobacillus strains (L. reuteri, L
      salivarius, L. casei, L. acidophilus) were useful in reducing gingival inflammation and the
      number of black-pigmented rods, including Porphyromonas gingivalis, in the saliva and
      subgingival plaque. Streptococcus sanguinis & S. uberis were found to inhibit the growth of
      periodontopathogens & a strong negative between Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and S.
      sanguinis. Weissella cibaria isolates in the form of probiotic rinse possess the ability to
      inhibit biofilm formation, both in vitro and in vivo.
