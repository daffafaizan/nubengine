      CPT Class A with PHT), moderate hepatic impairment (Group 3 Decompensated CPT Class B), or
      severe hepatic impairment (Group 4 Decompensated CPT Class C). Group 5 will include subjects
      with cholestatic liver disease and Group 6 will include subjects with non-cirrhotic advanced
      fibrosis secondary to NASH (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis). The control group (Group 7) will
      consist of demographic matched subjects with normal hepatic function.
