    
      The primary objective is to estimate the population average exposure to LPV, ABC and 3TC
      provided by the 4-in-1 formulation in HIV-infected children dosed per WHO weight bands.

      The secondary objectives:

        -  To determine the proportion of children overall, and within each weight band, with a
           lopinavir C12 <1.0 mg/L while receiving the 4-in-1 formulation

        -  To evaluate and compare the safety and tolerability of the 4-in-1 formulation versus a
           reference treatment regimen.

        -  To compare the bioavailability of LPV, ABC and 3TC in the 4-in-1 formulation versus a
           reference treatment regimen.

        -  To assess post exposure CD4 and viral load

        -  To assess the factors that contribute to acceptability of the new 4-in-1 formulation.
