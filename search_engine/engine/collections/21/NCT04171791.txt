    
      This is a single arm, open-label, non-randomized study with venetoclax (ABT-199) in CTCL
      patients (subtypes mycosis fungoides and SÃ©zary syndrome only, and excluding transformed
      mycosis fungoides). This study is planned to be conducted in 18 patients, 18 years or older
      in age, undergoing a 5-week dose escalation protocol (per the US FDA package insert
      guidelines of venetoclax for CLL). Safety monitoring will continue throughout the whole
      period of drug administration and the treatment will be discontinued if intolerable toxicity
      (defined in Stopping Rules) or disease progression occurs during this period.
