      of five mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19-including three requiring veno-venous
      extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO)-treated with nebulized in-line endotracheal
      dornase alfa co-administered with albuterol (used to increase delivery to the alveoli),
      between March 31 and April 24, 2020. Data on tolerability and responses, including
      longitudinal values capturing respiratory function and inflammatory status, were analyzed.
