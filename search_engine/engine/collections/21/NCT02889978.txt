    
      This is a prospective, multi-center, observational study with collection of de-identified
      biospecimens and clinical data from at least 15,000 participants from clinical networks in
      the United States and Canada. The study will enroll approximately 10,500 cancer participants
      (CANCER arm) and approximately 4,500 representative participants without a clinical diagnosis
      of cancer (NON-CANCER arm). Clinical information, demographics, and medical data relevant to
      cancer status are collected from all participants and their medical record at baseline (time
      of biospecimen collection), and subsequently from the medical record at intermittent future
      time points, at least annually for up to 5 years.
