      selecting for antibiotic-resistant organisms at the individual and the community level. It is
      estimated that every year, approximately 700,000 deaths are associated with drug resistance
      globally. This places a significant burden on the public health system and the judicious use
      of antibiotics is more important than ever before.

      The proposed masked, randomized controlled trial evaluates the effects of topical antibiotic
      use on the selection of antibiotic resistance determinants at the local and systemic levels.
      The results will provide guidance for antibiotic usage in ophthalmology and may have the
      potential to inform public health policies.
