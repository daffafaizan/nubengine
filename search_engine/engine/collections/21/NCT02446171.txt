    
      This is an open-label, randomized, 4-period, 4-treatment, crossover, single-center,
      single-dose bioavailability study with alternate methods of administration of naloxegol:
      crushed and suspended in water and administered orally (Treatment A),crushed and suspended in
      water administered via nasogastric tube (Treatment B), solution administered orally
      (Treatment C) and tablet swallowed as a whole (Treatment D).

      Alternative ways of administering a tablet may be useful to help patients who, for different
      reasons, have difficulties with swallowing a whole tablet. Administration of dispersed
      (crushed) tablets suspended in water is a common way of administering drugs to these
      patients. A useful method in patients whose condition prevents swallowing is administration
      of dispersed tablets through nasogastric tubes. Additionally a solution formulation may be an
      attractive option for some patients including the pediatric population. The main aim in this
      clinical study is to investigate whether the blood concentrations of naloxegol
      (pharmacokinetic) after each treatment A, B and C is comparable to that after treatment D.
      Additionally, the safety and tolerability shall be assessed.
