      salvage capabilities to determine if they decrease both the volume and rate of allogenic
      blood transfusion in adult patients undergoing multilevel spine surgery for deformity. In
      addition, the ability of these drains to decrease the complications that are associated with
      allogenic blood exposure (postoperative infection, volume overload and transfusion reactions)
      will also be evaluated.
