      asymmetry in children / adolescents and young adults with typical development or hemiplegia.

      The validation involves two stages:

      The first stage, carried out in the clinical setting, provides the use of Actigraphs
      (Actigraph GXT3+ and in a subgroup also FitBit) during the administration of clinical tests
      which are usually performed for the evaluation of the manual dominance in individuals with
      hemiplegia but also suitable for those with typical development.

      This first phase will allow to compare the quantitative measures acquired by the actigraphs
      (e.g. the mean activity of each hand and the asymmetry index i.e. difference between the mean
      activities of the two arms) with those from clinical standardized measures.

      The second phase, carried out in a non-clinical setting, provides the use of Actigraphs
      (Actigraph GXT3+ and in a subgroup also FitBit) in a subgroup of subject involved in the
      first phase for a week in order to measure the asymmetry index during the activities of daily
      living.
