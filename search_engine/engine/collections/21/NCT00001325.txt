      spasms, and idiopathic Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome with serial FDG-PET to elucidate the natural
      history and evolution of metabolic abnormalities associated with such epilepsies. The
      severity of the seizure disorder, and cognitive impairment, when present, will be correlated
      with the presence and extent of focal and global cerebral metabolic abnormalities.
