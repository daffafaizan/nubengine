      incidence of 32.1 per 100,000 in children. Before surgery, many cases of IXT are treated
      using non-surgical interventions, such as part-time alternate occlusion. However, the
      "alternating" occlusion with traditional patches is usually out of control. The investigators
      are uncertain about the amount of "alternating" in patching treatment.

      Here, the investigators introduce controlled intermittent alternating occlusion (CIAO)
      therapy, which is provided by a new electronic device, -liquid crystal glasses. This study is
      to determine the effectiveness of alternate occlusion therapy for the treatment of IXT among
      patients aged 3 to < 11 years old. Children with IXT will be randomized into either an
      observation group or a CIAO therapy group.
