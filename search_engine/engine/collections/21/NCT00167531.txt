      in Australia learn to walk again. Treadmill training with partial weight support is a
      relatively new intervention that is designed to train walking. However, a Cochrane Systematic
      Review (Moseley et al 2003) concludes that there is as yet no definitive answer about whether
      this intervention helps more non-ambulatory patients learn to walk compared to assisted
      overground walking.

      Participants will be 130 stroke patients who are unable to walk independently early after
      stroke. They will be recruited and randomly allocated to a control group or an experimental
      group.

      The control group will undertake routine assisted overground walking training while the
      experimental group will undertake treadmill walking with partial weight support via an
      overhead harness. Duration and frequency of intervention and the amount of assistance from
      therapists will be standardised across groups.
