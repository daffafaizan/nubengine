      factorial design to compare the effectiveness of interventions, alone or in combination, to
      one another. 1505 English and Spanish-speaking patients who are ≥ 50 years old, from a
      federally qualified health center (FQHC) in Chicago, and prescribed ≥ 3 Rx medications will
      be randomized to receive: 1) Enhanced Usual Care (EHR tools), 2) EHR tools + SMS, 3) EHR +
      Portal, or 4) EHR + SMS + Portal.

      The study aims to:

        1. Compare the effectiveness of the UMS EHR tools, with or without SMS and/or Portal
           interventions.

        2. Evaluate the 'fidelity' (reliability) of each strategy and explore patient, staff,
           physician, and health system factors influencing the delivery of the interventions,
           alone and in combination

        3. Assess the costs required to deliver each of the interventions from a health system
           perspective
