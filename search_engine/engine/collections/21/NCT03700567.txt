      compare the change in levels of myocardial injury biomarkers (such as TNI and CK-MB) between
      low temperature contrast group and room temperature contrast group. Based on previous study,
      the incidence rate of PCI-related myocardial injury is 28.7% in UAP patients undergoing PCI.
      And in our study the expected incidence rate of PCI-related myocardial injury is up to 14.3%
      in UAP patients undergoing PCI after treatment with low temperature contrast. Moreover, the
      investigators estimated 10% loss follow-up of these patients in each arm. As a result, a
      total of 330 UAP patients were required, and with 165 patients per group as a ratio of 1:1
      randomization.
