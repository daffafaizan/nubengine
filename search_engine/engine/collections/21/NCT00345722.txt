      to the same extent as first generation statins (cholesterol-lowering drugs). In the on-going
      long-term 'real world' study using this dietary portfolio, only one-third of participants
      were able to achieve similar cholesterol reductions at the end of 1 year. Varying compliance
      has been identified as the main issue why the other two-thirds could not achieve a similar
      level of reduction. We believe the addition of strawberries to this diet, by virtue of their
      beneficial components (fibre and antioxidants)and by replacement of less desirable foods
      (fatty deserts), may further improve the CHD risk profile of a very effective cholesterol
      reduction strategy.

      Method:

      454 g of strawberries per 2000 kcal per day will be provided for a one-month period to
      approximately 40-50 subjects on a long-term dietary portfolio study, all of whom have been on
      the diet for at least 6 months to 1 year. The active dietary components consist of viscous
      vibers (including oat bran), soy products (including soy milk), almonds and plant sterols
      (sterol enriched margarine). Strawberry recipes will be used to enhance compliance of these
      components. Subjects will undergo the study in a randomized crossover design where the
      control will be the dietary portfolio with additional 65 g oatbran bread (without psyllium)
      replacing the strawberries.

      Bloods will be taken at weeks 0, 2 and 4 of each treatment period; and at one month prior to
      and after the 8-week study while on the long-term dietary portfolio.
