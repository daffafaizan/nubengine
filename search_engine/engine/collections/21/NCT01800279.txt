      physiotherapy and deontology protocol to improve pain, quality of life, physical function,
      quality of sleep, depression, anxiety, clinical severity, clinical improvement, and
      diagnostic criteria for research temporomandibular joint dysfunction in patients with
      fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS).

      Background: the results on physiotherapy benefits for temporomandibular joint dysfunction in
      patients with FMS are controversial. Descriptive data and intervention studies are still
      scarce.

      Methods and measures: sixty patients will be randomly assigned to experimental or control
      group. The experimental group will receive 24 sessions (twice a week) of kinesitherapy and
      myofascial release protocol, whereas the control group will undergo to deontology therapy
      (porting a deprogramming occlusal splint every night, an average of 8 hours per day, for 12
      weeks of the treatment). Pain levels, impact of FMS symptoms, quality of sleep, depression,
      anxiety, clinical severity, clinical improvement and diagnostic criteria for research of
      temporomandibular joint dysfunction will be collected in both groups at baseline and 12 weeks
      after 48-hr the last intervention in the experimental and control groups, by an assessor
      blinded to the treatment allocation of the patients. Baseline demographic and clinical
      variables will be examined between both groups independent Student t-test for continuous data
      and Ï‡2 tests of independence for categorical data. Separate 2x2 mixed model ANCOVAs with time
      (pre-post) as the within-subjects factor, group (experimental, control) will be to determine
      the effects of the treatment on pain, function, quality of sleep,depression, anxiety,
      clinical severity, clinical improvement and diagnostic criteria for research of
      temporomandibular joint dysfunction as the dependent variables.
