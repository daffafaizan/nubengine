      Primary Outcome Measure

      In order to maintain an overall type I error rate of 0.05 (2-sided) across the 3 omalizumab
      dose levels, the testing of the primary Outcome Measure was conducted in the following
      hierarchical order. A p-value < 0.05 is only considered statistically significant if
      statistical significance was claimed at the previous stage.

        -  Stage 1: Omalizumab 300-mg group vs. placebo

        -  Stage 2: Omalizumab 150-mg group vs. placebo

        -  Stage 3: Omalizumab 75-mg group vs. placebo

      Secondary Outcome Measures

      A hierarchical analysis of the following secondary Outcome Measures was performed for each
      dose found to be significant in the primary Outcome Measure. A p-value < 0.05 is only
      considered statistically significant if statistical significance was claimed at the previous
      stage.

        -  Stage 1: Change from baseline to Week 12 in the urticaria activity score over 7 days
           (UAS7)

        -  Stage 2: Change from Baseline to Week 12 in the weekly number of hives score

        -  Stage 3: Time to minimally important difference (MID) response in the weekly itch
           severity score by Week 12

        -  Stage 4: Percentage of participants with a UAS7 score â‰¤ 6 at Week 12

        -  Stage 5: Percentage of weekly itch severity score MID responders at Week 12

        -  Stage 6: Change from Baseline to Week 12 in the weekly size of the largest hive score

        -  Stage 7: Change from Baseline in the overall dermatology life quality index (DLQI) score
           at Week 12

        -  Stage 8: Change from Baseline in the overall dermatology life quality index (DLQI) score
           at Week 12

        -  Stage 9: Percentage of complete responders (UAS7 = 0) at Week 12
