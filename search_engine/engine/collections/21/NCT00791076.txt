      pancreas is to produce two hormones: insulin and pancreatic polypeptide. Insulin helps the
      cells to take in glucose. The liver makes glucose and insulin normally acts to decrease or
      shut off the liver's production of glucose. However, in patients whose pancreas no longer
      makes insulin or makes low levels of pancreatic polypeptide the liver cannot perform these
      duties as well. Studies have shown that these important functions of the liver are improved
      for these patients when pancreatic polypeptide is given together with their insulin. Because
      PP increases the liver's sensitivity to insulin and thereby reduces the amount of glucose
      produced by the liver, this will result in fewer swings in blood sugar levels both in the
      upper and lower range. With fewer swings in blood glucose, a patient should decrease the
      amount of insulin used. One of the main benefits of lowering total insulin requirement is a
      reduction in the development of dangerous low blood sugar levels.
