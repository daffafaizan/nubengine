      this drug in patients with Waldenström Macroglobulinemia who have progressed on ibrutinib.

      Patients who fulfill eligibility criteria will be entered into the trial to receive Dasatinib

      After the screening procedures confirm participation in the research study:

      The participant will be given a study drug-dosing calendar for each treatment cycle. In this
      research study, the investigators are planning to give Dasatinib, which is a targeted therapy
      intended to treat cancer by binding to the target protein called BTK.

        -  BTK is believed to be an important target for treatment of patients with specific gene
           mutations. Some patients who have disease progression after taking ibrutinib have these
           gene mutations.

        -  Making treatment decisions based on genetic testing is investigational, and the FDA has
           not approved this genetic testing.

      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved Dasatinib for Waldenström
      Macroglobulinemia but it has been approved for other uses.

      Dasatinib is produced by Bristol-Myers Squibb.
