      over Neoadjuvant chemoradiation (neoCRT) for patients with Esophageal adenocarcinomas (EAC)
      has not been proven in any randomized controlled trials (RCT). Data supporting the value of
      periCTX have all been obtained in studies including mixed patient cohorts with EAC and
      gastric adenocarcinoma (GAC). Due to relevant differences of histologic subtype distribution,
      response to periCTX and survival rates between EAC and GAC there is a clear need to obtain
      evidence concerning the value of periCTX for EAC. As nowadays periCTX is extensively and
      successfully applied in clinical practice in patients with EAC there is an obvious need to
      obtain evidence from a multicentre RCT. Moreover a confirmation of the superior survival
      rates of the recent RCT on neoCRT should be obtained in a RCT conducted exclusively on EAC.
      Therefore, this prospective RCT with the primary objective of longterm patient survival
      comparing periCTX and neoCRT was designed.
