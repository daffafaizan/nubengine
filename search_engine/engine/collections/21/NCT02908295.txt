      myomectomy increases. During this operation, surgeons would deal with hypervascular masses
      with raw surfaces that tend to bleeding. Interventions to diminish bleeding were studied such
      as using misoprostol, vasopressin, transamenic acid along with mechanical intervention such
      as tourniquet and uterine artery ligation. But in Rajavithi hospital, such procedures aren't
      generally used because of fewer cases and also lacks of supporting data. Misoprostol, used in
      gynecologic patients for a long time with a wide safety margin acts at prostaglandin
      receptors of myometrium to stimulate contraction that constricts uterine vessels that lead to
      decreasing amount of bleeding during the operation. This led to the experimental study of
      rectal misoprostol administered at 15 - 30 minutes prior the operation to decrease blood loss
      and also blood transfusion rates. Our study also gather data about adverse effect that
      subject experienced after drug administration.
