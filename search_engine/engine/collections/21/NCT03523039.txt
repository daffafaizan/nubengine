    
      Patients presenting Post-Cardiac Arrest Syndrome (PCAS) in the 24 hours following their
      admission in Intensive Care Unit will be randomly assigned either to a control group
      (standard of care) either to a "Hemoadsorption" group. In the latter, the patient will be
      connected in the 6 hours following randomization to an extracorporeal circuit, in which a
      Cytosorb Â® cartridge will be placed. The circuit will be set up in hemoperfusion mode. The
      therapy will take place for a minimum of 12 hours and a maximum of 24 hours. Anticoagulation
      will be achieved using a regional heparin-protamin regimen.

      Blood samples will be collected at randomization, T1 (6 hours post-randomization), T2 (12
      hours after randomization), T3 (24 hours after randomization), T4 (48 hours after
      randomization) and T5 (48 hours after randomization), to assess change in inflammatory
      cytokine levels.
