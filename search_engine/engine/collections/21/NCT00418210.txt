      node-negative breast cancer treated by breast conserving surgery with negative margins.

      This is a one-arm feasibility study in which the primary endpoint is the feasibility rate for
      APBI using 3D CRT. This is defined as the proportion of eligible patients treated without a
      major protocol deviation. Secondary endpoints include radiation toxicity, cosmetic outcome,
      quality of life, time to ipsilateral breast recurrence, disease-free survival, and overall
      survival.

      Primary objectives: To evaluate the technical feasibility and reproducibility of APBI limited
      to the region of the tumour bed using 3D CRT following breast conserving surgery.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To assess the acute and long term toxicity of APBI using 3D CRT.

        -  To examine the cosmetic outcome of women with breast cancer treated by breast conserving
           surgery and APBI using 3D CRT.

        -  To determine the time to ipsilateral breast recurrence, disease free survival and
           overall survival of women with node-negative breast cancer completely resected by breast
           conserving surgery followed by APBI using 3D CRT.

        -  To assess the quality of life of women with node-negative breast cancer treated by
           breast conserving surgery and APBI using 3D CRT.
