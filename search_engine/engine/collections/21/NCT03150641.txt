      and the mother. The best time to cut the umbilical cord of full term babies is unknown.
      Traditionally, the umbilical cord is cut immediately at birth. There is however, continued
      blood flow from the placenta to the baby after delivery and so there may be a benefit to the
      baby from waiting to cut the cord until one minute after delivery. Studies show that delaying
      cutting the cord until at least one minute after delivery increases a full term baby's blood
      count in first two days of life and increases the baby's iron levels. The impact of delaying
      cutting the umbilical cord on a mother's health is not fully known. Delaying cutting the cord
      has minimal impact on the mother's health when the baby is delivered vaginally, but it is not
      known how delaying cutting the cord impacts the mother's health (and specifically the amount
      of blood a mother loses at delivery) when the baby is delivered by cesarean.
