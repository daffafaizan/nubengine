    
      This is a Phase I /II study on the feasibility / efficacy of adoptive immunotherapy with
      autologous CIK cells for the following 2 groups of patients who have AML or high grade MDS :

        1. Group 1 patients in minimal residual disease state post autologous peripheral blood stem
           cell transplant ( PBSCT ), and

        2. Group 2 patients with untreated high grade MDS or AML, who are not fit for standard
           curative intent chemotherapy.

      The CIK cells will be generated by leukapheresis from patients and cultured in GMP
      facilities. Four repeated infusions will be given for a target dose of 1x10e10 T cell per
      infusion.

      Efficacy will be assessed by

        1. Disease free survival compared to historical control in group 1 given CIK cells post
           autologous PBSCT as adjuvant immunotherapy (n=20 over 3 years), and

        2. Effect on the peripheral or marrow leukemia cell load in group 2 patients given CIK
           cells as alternative therapy in place of chemotherapy (n=10).
