      I. To evaluate efficacy and tolerability of the combination of ofatumumab and lenalidomide in
      patients with recurrent chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).

      OUTLINE:

      Participants receive ofatumumab intravenously (IV) over 4 hours on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of
      course 1, day 1 of courses 2-6, and day 1 of every even course beginning course 8. Beginning
      day 9 of course 1, participants also receive lenalidomide orally (PO) daily. Courses repeat
      every 28 days for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up at 6 months, then every 3
      months thereafter.
