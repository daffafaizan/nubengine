    
      DS-6000a is an antibody drug conjugate that specifically binds to CDH6 on the cell surface of
      target cells, which leads to the internalization of DS-6000a into the cells. MAAA-1181a that
      is released from DS-6000a in the target cells inhibits cell replication and induces cell
      apoptosis.

      This study will evaluate DS-6000a given as a single agent once every 21 days. The dose
      escalation phase will enroll participants with OVC and RCC, and is designed to assess the
      safety and tolerability of DS-6000a and to determine the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD)/recommended dose for expansion (RDE). Following the selection of the RDE, the dose
      expansion phase will be initiated to evaluate clinical activity of DS-6000a.
