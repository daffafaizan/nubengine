      Primary

        -  To test the hypothesis that the immune response in non-small cell lung cancer patients
           treated with photodynamic therapy (PDT) is T cell mediated.

      Secondary

        -  To test the hypothesis that PDT potentially affects survival rates in these patients.

        -  To test the hypothesis that T lymphocytes mediate an immune response that affects
           survival in PDT treated patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients deemed suitable for photodynamic therapy (PDT) are offered PDT. Patients
      are divided into 2 groups according to whether or not they receive PDT. All patients are
      referred to radiation and medical oncology for standard of care adjuvant therapy (beginning
      after completion of this study).

        -  Group 1 (PDT): Patients receive porfimer sodium IV over 3-5 minutes and undergo
           irradiation with red light 48 hours later. Patients receive 2 more treatments at 2-day
           intervals.

        -  Group 2 (non-PDT): Patients undergo a baseline bronchoscopy and a repeat bronchoscopy at
           4 weeks.

      Blood sample, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and tumor tissue are collected after each
      treatment (group 1) or at time of each bronchoscopy (group 2) and assayed for the presence of
      lymphocyte phenotypes Th1, Th2, Treg, and Th17. After completion of study therapy, patients
      are followed at 1 month after PDT and then every 3 months for 3 years.
