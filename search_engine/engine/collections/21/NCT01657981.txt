      14C-labeled YM150 in the morning of Day 1 and remain in the unit for 7 days (6 nights).
      Blood, plasma, urine and feces samples are collected until 120 hrs after dosing for analysis
      of 14C-labeled radioactivity, YM150, YM-222714 and other metabolites. Expired air is
      collected as well for assessment of 14C-radioactivity.
