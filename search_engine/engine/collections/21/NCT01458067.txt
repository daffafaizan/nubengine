      deficiencies. Subjects then continue into the screening phase for Part 1, 2, or 3, as
      appropriate. In Part 1, subjects will then receive a single dose of 25 mg. After analysis of
      24 hour pharmacokinetic (PK) samples, subjects may receive continuous dosing or receive a
      single modified dose. In Part 2, subjects will be enrolled and dose escalation will occur in
      a 3+3 design. Subjects will receive a single dose on Day 1, and then begin continuous daily
      dosing after collection of a 72-hour PK sample. Additional subjects may be enrolled at lower
      dose levels for assessment of pharmacodynamic response. In Part 3, up to two tumor-specific
      expansion cohorts will be enrolled and receive the MTD or BED as defined in Part 2. A minimum
      of 12 and a maximum of 20 evaluable subjects will be enrolled in each cohort. Interim
      monitoring for futility will be incorporated after response data from 12 subjects are
      available. In addition, up to 20 evaluable subjects will be enrolled into Part 3
      -Signal-finding Expansion Cohort at the MTD or BED as defined in Part 2. All subjects in all
      parts/cohorts will receive daily dosing until withdrawal or unacceptable toxicity. All
      subjects in all parts/cohorts will receive daily dosing until withdrawal or unacceptable
      toxicity.
