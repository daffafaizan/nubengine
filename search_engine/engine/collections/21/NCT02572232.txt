      ventilate" scenario in prehospital as well as intrahospital settings and are utilized in
      medical emergency services and emergency departments all over the world, not only for
      anticipated and unanticipated difficult airway situations but also as an airway device used
      by non-anesthesiologists or in situations where only limited practice is possible. Securing
      an airway in a pediatric emergency situation is crucial. Unfortunately, pediatricians usually
      lack the required skills and regular practice to perform endotracheal intubation (ETI, which
      is the gold standard for securing an airway) quickly and safely. SADs would pose a safe and
      feasible alternative to ETI. However, no studies on this topic are available. The
      investigators therefore wanted to evaluate three different SADs (Combitube, Easytube,
      laryngeal mask airway) in simulated difficult airway situations in a pediatric manikin in
      comparison to ETI.
