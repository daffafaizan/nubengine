    
      This is a Phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group,
      multi-center, efficacy and safety trial of AM-111 in the treatment of subjects suffering from
      severe to profound idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss.

      The active pharmaceutical ingredient of AM-111 is a JNK inhibitor (D-JNKI-1), a synthetic
      peptide consisting of 31 D-amino acids, which acts as a c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) ligand.

      The study consists of one treatment visit and a follow-up period until day 91.

      Study participants will receive, after topical anesthesia of the tympanic membrane, AM-111
      0.4 mg/mL or 0.8 mg/mL or placebo, administered into the affected ear. Following the
      administration, subjects will rest in a supine or reclined position for 30 minutes. Study
      participants will have the option for a course of oral corticosteroids.
