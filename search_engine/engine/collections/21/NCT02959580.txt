      unknown etiology.It may present with many findings that clinically and radiologically mimic
      breast cancer.

      Although IGM as a disease has been known for nearly four decades, the optimal treatment
      approach has not been established. Surgical intervention in the form of wide surgical
      excision was the mainstay of treatment before 1980, and is still performed depending on local
      expertise and preference.

      Currently,surgical treatment and systemic steroid treatment are frequently employed. With the
      consideration of side effects of longterm systemic (oral) steroid usage, topical steroid
      without systemic use were assessed and showed satisfactory curative effect. But the data
      concerning the use of topical steroid therapy are still very limited.
