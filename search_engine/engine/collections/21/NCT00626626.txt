      patients unable to tolerate more toxic conventional conditioning regiments. These regiments
      continue to be refined and evolve. No standard regimen is yet agreed upon. The incorporation
      of the newly licenses agent Clofarabine into a non-myeloablative regimen is logical given its
      recognized anti-leukemic activity. This study will assess the safety and efficacy of
      Cyclophosphamide and Clofarabine in promoting hematopoietic engraftment after allogeneic
      transplant of blood stem cells. Patients eligibility will include those with advanced
      hematological neoplasms who might benefit from allogeneic blood cell transplant. Patients
      must have adequate organ function and suitable related or unrelated donors for transplant. In
      Phase I of the study 9-12 patients will be treated in order to establish Cyclophosphamide and
      Clofarabine dose, and to confirm reasonable safety and engraftment efficacy. Phase II will
      treat at total of 20 patients at the selected dose level of Clofarabine and Cyclophosphamide.
      Results will be compared to extensive Penn State Milton S. Hershey Medical Center experience
      using Fludarabine and Cyclophosphamide in a similar patient population. Supportive care,
      including graft versus host disease prophylaxis will be similar to that recently used at
      Hershey Medical Center. Primary endpoints will include survival and engraftment as compared
      to historical results at Hershey Medical Center. Disease specific outcomes for frequent
      diagnoses such as acute leukemia and non-hodgkin's lymphoma will be assessed as secondary
      endpoints.
