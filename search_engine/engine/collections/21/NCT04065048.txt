      inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal tract. Although the precise etiology of IBD is
      not known, evidence suggests that environmental factors, including diet, contribute to its
      pathogenesis. A soy-based diet has been demonstrated to have numerous health benefits. This
      single-center open-label study will compare the effectiveness of a soy-based diet or an
      identical diet without soy to change the gut microbiota composition and fecal butyrate
      concentration to that of baseline (pre-diet) in patients with CD (remission or active
      disease) and healthy control subjects without CD. Participants will follow either a soy-based
      diet or an identical diet without soy to which they will be randomized for 7 days. No data
      collection or other study procedures will take place until the potential participant provides
      written informed consent to participate in the research study. The informed consent,
      screening, enrollment, and baseline data collection which make up visit 1 can occur on the
      same day or be completed across several days.
