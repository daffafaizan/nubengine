        -  Determine the toxicity, including cardiac toxicity, of doxorubicin HCl liposome and
           trastuzumab (Herceptin) in women with advanced HER-2/neu-overexpressing breast cancer.

        -  Determine the efficacy of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive doxorubicin HCl liposome IV over 1 hour on day 1, followed by
      trastuzumab (Herceptin) IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every 21
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study.
