      uncommon, (10%) and the frequency clearly increases with the use of regimens containing
      thalidomide in combination with glucocorticosteroids or chemotherapy especially adriamycin.
      Even with prophylactic anticoagulation, DVT still occurs in 10% of such patients. The use of
      full anticoagulation raises considerable concern of bleeding especially during the post
      chemotherapy thrombocytopenic period. We observed no thromboembolic episodes when Velcade was
      added to thalidomide and adriamycin containing chemotherapy.

      Therefore, we would like to investigate this protective antithrombotic effect of VELCADE in a
      malignancy associated with a hypercoagulable state in a group of 10 patients with
      Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma.
