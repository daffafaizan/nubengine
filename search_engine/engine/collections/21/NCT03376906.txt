      intensity interval exercise (HIIE) on the hemodinamics responses in obese individuals. Twelve
      obese subjects (27 Â± 3.8 yrs) were evaluated, who underwent three experimental sessions with
      a randomized crossover design: one control session (no exercise) and two HIIE sessions with
      the same workload (10 x 1min @92%VO2max / 1[HIIE 1] or 3[HIIE 3] min @0%). Forearm blood flow
      (FBF) and blood pressure (BP) were measured before and after the experimental sessions. Heart
      rate and relative perceived exertion were assessed during HIIE.
