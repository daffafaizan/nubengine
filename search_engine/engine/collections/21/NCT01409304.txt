      transcranial magnetic stimulation (DTMS) in a sample of subjects with treatment-resistant
      depression. To do this, enrolled depressed outpatients will be assigned to receive 4 weeks of
      daily DTMS and will be evaluated at baseline and during week 5. We hypothesize that treatment
      with DTMS will be associated with significant clinical improvements in depressive and anxious
      symptoms, and will be well tolerated.
