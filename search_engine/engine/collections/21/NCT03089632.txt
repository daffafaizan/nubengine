    
      Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a complex and heterogeneous disease that is associated with poor
      outcomes. In studies from referral centers, 50-65% of diabetics reported dyspeptic symptoms.
      In addition, approximately 50% of type 1 DM (T1DM) patients, especially those with
      longstanding disease, have evidence of delayed gastric emptying.

      Dietary modification is one of the treatment pillars for patients with dyspeptic symptoms.
      Further, many individuals in which both symptoms and motility abnormalities improve after a
      GFD have positive anti-gliadin antibodies (AGA), which reinforces the role of gluten-induced
      inflammation/immune activation as a possible cause of motility abnormalities and related
      symptoms.

      Ameliorating UGI symptoms is not only pivotal for improving the quality of life of diabetic
      GP patients, but the improvement in gastroduodenal motility is also needed for a more
      predictable glycemic response. In non-celiac T1DM patients, the role of the GFD in symptom
      improvement, gastroduodenal motility and glycemic control has never been assessed.

      The overall aim of the present study is to improve the knowledge about the role of dietary
      interventions as non-pharmacological treatments for upper-gastrointestinal symptoms and
      underlying motility abnormalities in patients with type 1 diabetes. This will be a
      non-randomized, open label, before and after trial of a 1-month GFD in non-celiac type 1
      diabetics to assess symptomatic, motility and glycemic response changes.
