      (OSCC) tumors can be synergistically stimulated by blocking suppressor endothelial cells and
      their induction of other inhibitory cell populations while also maturing immune inhibitory
      CD34+ cells into antigen-presenting dendritic cells.

      To test this hypothesis, newly diagnosed OSCC patients will be administered the
      cyclooxigenase 2 inhibitor celecoxib and/or Calcitriol for the 3 week duration between cancer
      diagnosis and surgical treatment. The following aims will test the immunological and clinical
      effectiveness of the combination treatment:

        -  1. To block the suppressive activity of endothelial cells and increase the levels of
           dendritic that are stimulatory to T cell reactivity, thereby synergistically increasing
           intratumoral T cell reactivity. These functional immune analyses will use OSCC tissues
           removed from untreated patients or patients treated with celecoxib and/or Calcitriol.

        -  2. To reduce development of OSCC recurrences by synergistically stimulating intratumoral
           T cell reactivity with celecoxib to block suppressor endothelial cell activity and
           Calcitriol to mature CD34+ suppressor cells into T cell stimulatory dendritic cells.
