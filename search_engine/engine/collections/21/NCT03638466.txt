      recruited in this study. The PSAP is a behavioral aggression test used to evaluate behavioral
      response related to impulsive aggression. The task will be combined with functional MRI to
      evaluate the change in brain activity measured as BOLD signal (blood oxygenation
      level-dependent) from baseline to the end of the treatment with SPN-810.

      The level of neurotransmitters Glutamate and GABA will also be measured using magnetic
      resonance spectroscopy (MRS).

      Additionally, the improvement and severity in impulsive aggression behaviors will be assessed
      using validated scales.
