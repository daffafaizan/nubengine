      acetate in African American and Caucasian men with mCRPC. Patients will self-report on race
      and 50 patients will be enrolled into each group. Patients will be treated on open-label
      treatment until evidence of disease progression as defined by Prostate Cancer Working Group
      Two (PCWG2) definition or until two years at which point they will roll over to the standard
      of care at that time. The study agent abiraterone acetate will be administered by the patient
      at a dose of 1000mg orally once daily with prednisone 5 mg BID in 4-week cycles throughout
      the treatment period.
