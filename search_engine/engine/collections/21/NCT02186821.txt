    
      This was an open label study to determine the efficacy and safety of treatment with ceritinib
      in patients with a diagnosis of solid tumors or hematological malignancies that had been
      pre-identified (prior to study consent) to have ALK or ROS1 positive mutations,
      translocations, rearrangements or amplifications and whose disease had progressed on or after
      standard treatment. The study consisted of a treatment phase where all patients received
      ceritinib capsules for a total dose of 750 mg daily for up to 8 cycles of 28 days. Disease
      assessments for clinical benefit were performed every 8 weeks until disease progression or
      end of treatment. Following discontinuation of treatment for any reason, patients were
      followed for safety for 30 days. Survival information was collected every 3 months until 2
      years after the last patient had enrolled into the study. Study was amended to allow for
      discontinuation of survival period if primary endpoint was not met.

      Study was terminated due to low enrollment.
