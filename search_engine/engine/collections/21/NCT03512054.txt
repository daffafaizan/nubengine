      frequently have a tracheotomy. This tracheotomy is often a problem when it comes to find a
      bed in a secondary care unit, which is better adapted to the patient rehabilitation.
      Unfortunately, there is little room to accept this type of patient. It is therefore
      appropriate to do the weaning during the neurosurgery unit stay.

      Bibliographical studies indicate few recommendations as to weaning outside intensive care
      units. In the neurosurgery units at the University Hospital of Bordeaux, during 3 years
      (2014-2016), investigators have practiced 29 decannulations without recannulation, over 37
      brain injury patients, with a multi-professional team (neurosurgeon, physiotherapist, nurse,
      caregiverâ€¦) to produce a weaning process.

      From where investigators hypothesis: using a multi-professional weaning process, checking the
      patient's stability during the different weaning steps, can lead to decide to decannulate or
      not without any risk.
