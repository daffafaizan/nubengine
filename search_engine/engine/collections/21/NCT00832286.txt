      adult subjects over a 6-month period of time. Many questions about the human microbiota
      exist. Previous studies have shown that the differences among individuals are greater than
      the differences among different sampling sites in a single individual. Up to 60 healthy adult
      subjects, ages 18-45 years, from the Baltimore and University of Maryland Baltimore
      communities will be recruited and screened to document their health status. A brief medical
      history, including recent travel and antibiotic use, will be recorded. Subjects will provide
      a stool specimen for genomic analysis of the intestinal microbiome over a 6-month period at
      the following intervals: Day 0, Week 1, Week 2, Week 3, Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, Week 13,
      Week 14, Week 15, Week 16, Week 20, and Week 24. At Week 12, subjects will receive a 3-day
      course of oral Ciprofloxacin 500 mg every12 hours. Weekly stool specimens will be obtained
      beginning with the first day of antibiotic use and for 4 Weeks thereafter. Then monthly
      specimens of stool and other sites will be resumed at Week 16. The primary objective is to
      define the human intestinal microbiome in healthy adults in a longitudinal fashion. The
      secondary objective is to define the re-colonization of the intestine after treatment with a
      broad-spectrum antibiotic using comprehensive genomic techniques. Each subject will
      participate in the study for up to 7 months.
