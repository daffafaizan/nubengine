      for fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) and the whole-colon enema treatment. This tube
      also can serve as a medium for collecting gut microbiota. Fecal Microbiota Transplantation
      (FMT) was identified to be promising for ulcerative colitis (UC). This study aims to
      investigate the dynamic changes of gut microbiota in patients with UC after FMT.
