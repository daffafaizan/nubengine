      previously been associated with a sustained increase in blood pressure (BP).

      In a one-year longitudinal follow-up to the Baseline Double Exposure cohort study, we
      evaluated whether JS and marital cohesion continued to be associated with ambulatory blood
      pressure (ABP) in subjects enrolled with normal or untreated high BP.
