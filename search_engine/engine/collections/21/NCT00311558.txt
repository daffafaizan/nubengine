      Primary

        -  Confirm the tolerance, safety, and maximum tolerated dose of sodium stibogluconate (SSG)
           in combination with interferon alfa-2b in patients with advanced solid tumors, lymphoma,
           or myeloma.

      Secondary

        -  Quantify the effect of SSG on interferon alfa-2b-induced gene modulation and signal
           transduction pathways by measurement of the serum-soluble gene products Î²-2
           microglobulin, immune serum globulin 15, and neopterin.

        -  Define the effectiveness of SSG in inhibiting the protein tyrosine phosphatases src
           homology proteins (SHP)-1 and SHP-2 assayed from peripheral blood leukocytes of patients
           receiving SSG in combination with interferon alfa-2b.

        -  Define pharmacokinetics of SSG in serum at escalating doses.

        -  Assess clinical response to the combination of SSG and interferon alfa-2b.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation study of sodium stibogluconate (SSG).

      Patients receive SSG IV over 15 minutes on days 1, 15-19, and 22-26 and interferon alfa-2b
      subcutaneously daily on days 8-12 and 15-28. Treatment repeats every 6 weeks in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 6 patients receive escalating doses of SSG until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)
      is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients
      experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24 patients will be accrued for this study.
