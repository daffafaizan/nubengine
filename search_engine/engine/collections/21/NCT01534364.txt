      is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. There is no drug or procedure known
      to prevent this loss of renal function. Experimental data suggests, that a preoperative
      caloric restriction might provide kidney protection in this context. This clinical trial
      investigates if this phenomenon is also applicable in humans. Patients with a increased risk
      for a postoperative renal failure due to known chronic kidney disease are randomized in 2
      groups. Patients of the diet group receive a calorie restriction to 60% of the calculated
      daily energy rate from day -7 until day -1 (included) pre-surgery (day 0 corresponds to day
      of surgery). Patients of the control group receive alimentation ad libitum.

      Primary objective is the increase of serum creatinine in mg/dl 24 h after induction of
      ischemia ("cross clamping") in comparison to baseline value obtained in the morning of the
      day of surgery (day 0) in order to analyse if a preoperative calorie restriction as a
      preventive strategy leads to a attenuation of postoperative kidney injury. Hypothesis: A
      seven day calorie restriction reduces the increase of serum creatinine after cardiac surgery
      in patients with known chronic kidney disease.
