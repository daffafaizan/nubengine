      Cohort 1 comprised subjects with "sensitive" disease and Cohort 2 comprised subjects with
      "refractory" disease. Both cohorts received the same treatment regimen consisting of 4 weekly
      IM administrations of ADI-PEG 20 (320 IU/m^2), followed by a 1-week follow-up (1 cycle). No
      dose adjustment was allowed. Additional treatment cycles were permitted in the absence of
      disease progression requiring other therapeutic interventions.

      Each cohort was to be enrolled in 2 stages. In the first stage, 15 subjects were to be
      accrued in Cohort 1 and 12 subjects in Cohort 2. If ≥ 3 subjects met the primary endpoint in
      Cohort 1, then an additional 13 subjects were to be accrued in the second stage. If ≤ 2
      subjects met the primary endpoint in Cohort 1, then the study was to be terminated and
      declared negative for Cohort 1. If ≥ 1 subject met the primary endpoint in Cohort 2, then an
      additional 4 subjects were to be accrued in the second stage. If no subjects met the primary
      endpoint in Cohort 2, then the study was to be terminated and declared negative.
      Additionally, if at any time a death or two grade 4 adverse events (AEs) that were definitely
      related or probably related to the study drug occurred, then the study was to be stopped.
