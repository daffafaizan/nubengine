      the risk factors of the ankle sprain, forming a vicious circle of recurrent sprains. Proper
      and early assessment is the key to breaking down the circle. Smartphones have been utilized
      in the medical field. With built-in sensors, utilizing smartphones as assessment tools can
      provide quantitative data of postural control performance. This study aims to verify the
      training effect of smartphone-based training for CAI subjects.

      CAI subjects were recruited and randomly assigned to App training group, Home training group
      and control group, receiving 6 weeks of intervention. Pre-test was conducted before the
      intervention, and the post-test was conducted after the 6-week intervention. The follow up
      assessment was conducted 4 weeks after the post-test.
