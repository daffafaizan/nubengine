      neointimal proliferation, and thus the limitation of restenosis, which has led to the
      conception and development of drug-coated balloon or "Drug Eluting Balloons" (DEB), releasing
      the antiproliferative drug at the time of expansion. Initially they were applied in the
      treatment of in-stent restenosis. However, DEB may represent a therapeutic alternative in
      other contexts where anatomo-clinical uses are not always therapeutic percutaneous coronary
      revascularization with stent implantation, as is the case of coronary lesions located in
      small vessels.
