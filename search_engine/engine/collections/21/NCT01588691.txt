      parameters. After surgery, each subject will be randomized to Group A or Group B. Group C
      will be completed in the middle followed by the alternate A/B Group. Crossover will occur at
      3 week intervals until subjects complete all three groups. During this period, all subjects
      will receive a subject programmer that will only enable them to activate the "on and off"
      positions and adjust amplitude within the prescribed range.

      After subjects have completed the three pre-defined groups they will select the most
      effective and comfortable setting continuation of the study. The pulse width and frequency
      parameters will be set to the optimal settings identified by the subject. Amplitude will be
      set at a level that produces comfortable paresthesia for the subject.

      Subjects will return to the clinic for programming changes post system internalization at 3
      weeks, 6 weeks, and 9 weeks. Subjects will receive a PET scan at the 3 and 9 week visit.
      Additional follow-up evaluations will occur at 12 weeks, 18 weeks, and 24 weeks.
