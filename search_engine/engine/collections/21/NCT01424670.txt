      orally as 100 milligrams (mg) twice daily (BID) for 2 months followed by 200 mg once daily
      (QD) for 4 months in combination with an optimized background treatment regimen (OBR) versus
      placebo with OBR during the 6-month Intensive Period of MDR TB treatment. Following the
      6-month Intensive Period, OBR was administered alone during the Continuation Period for 12 to
      18 months (from Month 7 up to Month 24). The trial also included a post-treatment follow-up
      period of 6 to 12 months (Month 19 to Month 24 to the end of Month 30). OBR given throughout
      the study was administered as per World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines and national
      treatment norms.

      This trial is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, stratified, placebo-controlled trial
      that was conducted globally in 2 parallel groups at 17 sites in 7 countries qualified to
      treat MDR TB.
