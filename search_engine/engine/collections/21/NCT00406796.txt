      of blindness associated with retinal vascular disease. Macular edema is a major cause of
      vision loss in patients presenting with central abd hemi vein occlusions. Currently, there is
      no proven treatment to address macular edema in these patients. In the past laser
      photocoagulation has been used, but was found to offer no visual benefits over the natural
      history in the treatment of macular edema associated with CRVO. Investigators have
      demonstrated in case reports that intravitreal triamcinolone (Kenalog) may result in the
      reduction in macular edema, leading to visual improvement in some patients with CRVO.
      Triamcinolone is relatively well tolerated in many patients, but its use is associated with
      significant risk of elevated intraocular pressure, cataract, and intraocular infection.

      Ranibizumab (rhuFab V2, an anti-VEGF agent, is a potent inhibitor of vascular permeability,
      with the potential to reduce retinal vascular leakage and diminish macular edema. In
      addition, as an anti-VEGF agent, it may also inhibit neovascularization of the iris, a
      frequent complication of ischemic central retinal vein occlusion. Ranibizumab use as an
      intravitreal agent does carry the risk of intraocular infection but probably carries very low
      risk of glaucoma or cataract formation, making it a potentially safer pharmacologic treatment
      for CRVO associated macular edema as compared to triamcinolone
