      minimum of four clips. The presence of surgical clips was a selection criterion to avoid
      geographic misses. Computed tomography (CT) scanning was performed using 0.3-cm thick-slices
      and a slice spacing of 0.3 cm.

      In patients assigned to APBI arm, the clinical target volume (CTV) was drawn with a uniform
      1-cm three-dimensional margin around the surgical clips. The CTV was limited to 3 mm from the
      skin surface and 3 mm from the lung-chest wall interface. A second uniform, three-dimensional
      1-cm margin was added to the CTV to obtain the planning target volume (PTV). The PTV was
      allowed to extend 4 mm inside the ipsilateral lung and was limited to 3 mm from the skin. The
      ipsilateral and contralateral breast, ipsilateral and contralateral lung, heart, and spinal
      cord were contoured as organs at risk.

      All the regions of interest were contoured according to the International Commission on
      Radiation Units and Measurements reports 50 and 62 recommendations. No respiratory control
      was used.

      Concerning the experimental Arm (accelerated partial breast irradiation), a dose of 30 Gy in
      five fractions at 6 Gy/fraction was prescribed.

      The following constraints were adopted for plan optimization: PTV coverage: 100% of PTV
      covered by 95% of the prescribed dose (V28.5 = 100%); maximal dose to PTV <105% (31.5 Gy);
      minimal dose to PTV 28 Gy; uninvolved breast (i.e., ipsilateral breast without PTV): not >50%
      covered by a dose of >50% of the prescribed dose (V15 <50%); ipsilateral lung: not >20%
      covered by a dose >10 Gy (V10<20%); contralateral lung: not >10% covered by a dose >5 Gy
      (V5<10%); contralateral breast: maximal dose <1 Gy; heart: not >10% covered by a dose >3 Gy
      (V3 <10%).
