      is often marked by both cognitive and motor disorders as well as increased prevalence of
      depression and anxiety. While most studies have focused on improving motor dysfunction, fewer
      have investigated cognitive impairments associated with CP. Dedicating a study to research
      the pharmacotherapeutic effect of Amantadine on cognitive function in adolescents and adults
      with cerebral palsy fills an important gap in development of a potential innovative treatment
      for cognitive deficits. The investigators hope to determine the effects of Amantadine on
      cognitive function in adolescents and adults with CP. The investigators will also evaluate
      secondary goals of improving gross and fine motor skills and mood.
