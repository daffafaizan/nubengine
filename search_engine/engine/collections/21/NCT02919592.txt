      reconstruction with MemoryShape or MemoryGel Breast Implants. Four cohorts will be included:
      primary augmentation, revision-augmentation, primary reconstruction, and
      revision-reconstruction. For the purpose of assessing rheumatological and neurological signs
      and symptoms, a control group of 300 women will be selected from the participating
      investigators' practices, who are undergoing an aesthetic surgery other than breast implant
      surgery. Breast implant patients and the concurrent control group patients will be followed
      for 10 years. Baseline and operative data will be collected at the beginning of the study,
      and follow-up data will be collected annually for 10 years through online questionnaires.
