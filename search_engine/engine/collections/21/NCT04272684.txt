      acquired physical, psychological and cognitive impairments, which have been termed Post
      Intensive care syndrome (PICS). These impairments are common, slow to recover and have
      cumulative effects on patients' personal, social and financial wellbeing. An increasing
      awareness and recognition of PICS has prompted commitments to enhance multidisciplinary
      aftercare with the overall goal of improving patient-centred outcomes and health-related
      quality of life.

      For many adult ICU survivors, resumption of driving is perceived as an important milestone in
      their recovery pathway. Driving is an advanced task reliant on complex physical and mental
      functioning. It also necessitates independence, self-confidence and motivation. As such
      clinicians may view the return to driving as an objective marker of recovery.

      Furthermore, returning to drive accelerates resumption of "normal life", enablement of social
      interactions, hobbies, leisure activities, and most vitally, returning to work. This is not
      only because of its enabling effect on commuting to place of work. Approximately one million
      people in the UK are employed primarily as drivers, or are required to drive or operate
      motorised vehicles as part of their job. Thus driving after ICU is important for the UK
      economy as well as for patients' wellbeing and that of their loved ones. Reducing avoidable
      delay to driving ought therefore to be viewed as a low-cost high-impact intervention to
      enhance health-related quality of life.
