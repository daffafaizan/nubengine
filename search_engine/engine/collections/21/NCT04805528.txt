      therapy can be used in patients with head and neck cancer who have had radiation treatment to
      treat dry mouth. Acupuncture has been shown to help some people with symptoms of dry mouth,
      and low-level electrical stimulation of acupuncture points has been shown to have similar
      results as acupuncture treatment with needles.
