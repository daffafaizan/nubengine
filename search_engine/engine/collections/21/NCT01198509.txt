    
      If you would like to participate in this study, we will first ask you several questions
      regarding the status of your arthritis, the medications you use or have used in the recent
      past, your social and dietary habits, and your medical and surgical history. If your answers
      tell us that you are the right patient for our study, we will go over a consent form which
      describes in more detail how we will study your intestinal and mouth bacteria, the immune
      cells in your blood and other genes, enzymes and proteins that tell us about your disease
      status.

      If you have Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA) or are healthy with no history of arthritis, and would
      like to participate in this study, your participation would involve only one or two visits,
      and no treatment.

      If you have Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), your participation would involve six visits, and you
      would be randomly assigned to receive treatment with the antibiotic doxycycline, or the
      antibiotic vancomycin, or no antibiotic treatment.
