      trial of the investigators ICD PtDAs. The Investigators will use a 6-site stepped-wedge
      design, with implementation guided by normalization process theoryÂ® and evaluation guided by
      the RE-AIM framework.

      The investigators aim to evaluate reach and effectiveness of the ICD PtDAs using a pragmatic,
      stepped-wedge design on decision quality (knowledge and value-concordance) and psychosocial
      outcomes.

        -  Hypothesis 1a: PtDAs will reach over 50% of eligible patients.

        -  Hypothesis 1b: ICD PtDAs will be effective in improving decision quality in real-world
           practice.

        -  Hypothesis 1c: Better informed patients will have lower anxiety, higher rates of
           planning for the possibility of deactivation, and increased identification of a
           surrogate decision maker.

      The investigators propose 3 a priori hypotheses:

        -  The decision aids will have a differential effect on the decisions of participants by
           age (>= 70 years old vs <70 years old);

        -  The decision aids will have a differential effect on the decisions of participants by
           heart failure type (non-ischemic vs ischemic);

        -  The decision aids will have a differential effect on the decisions of participants by
           the type of device they are considering (ICD vs ICD replacement vs CRT-D).

      Along with these hypotheses, we recognize that other important covariates exist, such as
      health literacy and education level.
