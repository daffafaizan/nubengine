      followed by intraocular lens implantation. An average adult cornea has 2000 to 2500
      cells/mm2, a count that diminishes with age with a rate of attrition of approximately 0.3% to
      0.5% per year. Long-term postoperative corneal transparency depends on the morphological
      stability and functional integrity of the corneal endothelium. It is well established that
      all surgical interventions that require entry into the anterior chamber result in some damage
      to the corneal endothelium.

      Endothelial cell loss results in cell hypertrophy to maintain continuity, resulting in a
      change in endothelium cell density and morphology. Many studies have assessed the impact of
      various surgical techniques on endothelial damage and numerous studies have investigated the
      factors influencing endothelial cell loss after phacoemulsification. The goal of this study
      is to investigate the correlation of postoperative corneal edema with the reduction of
      endothelial corneal cell density after phacoemulsification.
