    
      This national survey study and questionnaire was approved by the institutional ethics
      committee of Istanbul University, Cerrahpasa Medical School (approval nr. 261075, date
      07.07.2017).

      An electronic survey form consisting of 34 questions was generated with google forms
      (https://docs.google.com/forms) after a literature search with search words "sedation" and
      "practice" and "survey".

      The first part of the form included questions about demographics, intensive care, and
      hospital characteristics. The second part contained questions on choices and routines of
      sedation administration, which multiple choices could be indicated.

      The questions were first pilot tested for misunderstandings with the ICU physicians in two
      intensive care units, and the link for the survey was posted to all email addresses
      registered in the Turkish Society of Intensive Care member database (1700 members) on
      2.8.2017. A second notification was sent to same email addresses on 16.10.2017 with a notice
      of not to reply the survey if it was replied after the first email. Participation in the
      survey was voluntary and anonymous, and there was no compensation for participation.

      Accepting responses to the survey was stopped in 01/11/2017, and answers were downloaded from
      the web site.

      Statistical Analysis The answers were analyzed using Excel spreadsheets (Microsoft
      Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA). The demographic data are expressed as mean (Â±SD) and counts
      and percentages. The answers regarding sedation practices are expressed as counts and
      percentages. No statistical comparisons had been made as this was a descriptive study.
