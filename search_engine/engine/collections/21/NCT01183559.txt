      patients with esophageal cancer-overexpression is associated with a worse prognosis. Review
      of the literature demonstrates presence of EGFR expression in up 90% of cases of esophageal
      cancer. Additionally, Vascular Endothelial Growth factor (VEGF) is commonly overexpressed in
      esophageal cancer (especially adenocarcinoma) and is linked to the transition from Barrett's
      esophagus to invasive adenocarcinoma. Esophageal cancers with overexpression of VEGF are
      associated with a worse prognosis and poorer response to conventional chemoradiation.

      Therefore, we feel it would be valuable to add an inhibitor of EGFR and VEGFR to the therapy
      of esophageal cancer to increase the rate of pathologic complete response and thus improve
      overall survival. In current trials of ZD6474 in combination with chemotherapy, the dose has
      been 300mg. We will perform a phase I trial in which we will dose-escalate ZD6474 to
      determine if this drug is tolerable in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy and external
      beam radiation therapy. This would be the first trial in humans in which f these three
      modalities would be combined. We will determine the maximum tolerated dose of ZD6474 in this
      small trial and then hope to perform a larger phase II trial, perhaps in the context of the
      Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG).
