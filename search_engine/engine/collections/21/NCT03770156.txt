      now better structured and organized. The efficacy of debriefing or of defusing has been and
      is still debated, sometimes bitterly. The aim of the present study is not to demonstrate
      utility or futility of such approaches, but to i) evaluate their global improvement over the
      past three years. ii) to list the type of support that the victims were seeking in their
      attempt to get rid of the symptoms which appeared after the terrorist attack of November 2015
      in Paris.

      iii) to collect their opinions about the way the CUMP (emergency medico-psychological unit of
      Paris, France) managed the support to the victims.

      Participating subjects registered on the occasion of their first contact with the CUMP 75 by
      phone during the week following the attack
