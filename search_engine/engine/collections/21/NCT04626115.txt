      urinary tumor, and the mortality rate is up to 40%. At present, diagnostic techniques such as
      ultrasonography, CT examination and MRI examination are widely used in Clinical practice,
      which greatly improves the detection rate of asymptomatic renal cell carcinoma. Compared with
      enhanced MRI and enhanced CT, contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) has outstanding advantages,
      including spatial, temporal and contrast resolution, continuous real-time visualization,.
      Sonazoid, the second generation ultrasound contrast agent, is composed of microbubbles
      containing chemically stable and insoluble perfluorobutane (PFB) gas and phosphatidylserine
      sodium hard shell (diameter 2-3Î¼m) wrapped by outer layer. These microbubbles can generate
      stable nonlinear oscillation in low-power sound field, and generate echo at the second
      harmonic frequency of transmitted pulse. Sonazoid has the advantages of long-time development
      and good stability, which may improve the accuracy of distinguishing benign and malignant
      renal space-occupying lesions, especially small lesions. In addition, the characteristics of
      long-time development are also helpful to extract more imaging information to assist the
      clinical staging of renal tumors.
