      sensitive for early pathological changes. Perfusion measurement has been shown to improve
      sensitivity and predictive value for tumor grading and prognosis, also as a predicator of
      recovery with reperfusion in patients of acute ischemic stroke.Our research aims to reveal
      whether the low b-values distribution and the number of NEX for each b value will influence
      the accuracy of pseudodiffusion parameter derived from IVIM in brain.
