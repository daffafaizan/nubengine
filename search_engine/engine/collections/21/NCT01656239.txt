      developed for the treatment of Nocturia.

      The antidiuretic effect of V2 receptor stimulation in the kidneys is well established through
      the use of the peptide agonist, desmopressin, which shows clinical benefit in diabetes
      insipidus, primary nocturnal enuresis and Nocturia.

      Nocturia, defined as the complaint that the individual has to wake at night one or more times
      to void, is a common complaint and shows an age-dependent increase in both prevalence and
      severity (number of Nocturnal Voids). It is the most bothersome symptom of benign prostatic
      hypertrophy (BPH) and has been linked to an age-dependent loss in circadian release of
      endogenous nocturnal vasopressin and consequent over production of urine at night (Nocturnal
      Polyuria).

      The purpose of this Phase IIb study is to determine the efficacy of different doses of
      fedovapagon in reducing the number of times subjects with Nocturia void during the night
      together with other parameters including increasing the time between going to bed and waking
      to first void. By establishing the effective doses of fedovapagon on these clinical
      endpoints, the data from this study will determine the most appropriate dose(s) of
      fedovapagon for the treatment of Nocturia to be taken forward into further studies.
