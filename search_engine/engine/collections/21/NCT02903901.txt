      delirium has been linked with inflammation in the brain. Delirium has been hypothesized to be
      a central nervous system response to systemic inflammation during a state of blood-brain
      barrier (BBB) compromise.

      Studies have shown a rise of inflammatory cytokines and fall of anti-inflammatory cytokines.
      Vice-versa, external cytokine administration has been shown to lead to delirium. Melatonin is
      known for its strong anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, this should account for
      its preventive properties in post-operative delirium. It has also been hypothesized that
      post-operative delirium in elderly is caused by circadian rhythm disturbances secondary to a
      relative lack of melatonin.

      Keeping in mind the above two possible pathophysiology for delirium, investigators are
      expecting melatonin supplementation should be able to reduce the incidence of post-operative
      delirium particularly in elderly population.
