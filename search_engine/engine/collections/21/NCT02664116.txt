      or urgent care setting. This is due to the minimal efficacy of PO treatments once migraine is
      severe, and therefore the need for parenteral treatments. IM Ketorolac is one mainstay of
      parenteral treatment. There is an unmet need for effective at-home treatment regimens for
      severe migraine. Despite FDA approval of Cambia for acute migraine treatment, insurance is
      reticent to cover the treatment due to higher cost in comparison to generic diclofenac
      tablets, despite superior efficacy of Cambia in comparison to generic diclofenac tablets
      (Diener, Cephalalgia 2006). One objective of this study would be to provide rationale to
      justify the insurance coverage of this treatment in comparison to generic tablets, because at
      home treatment is less costly than office visit or emergency department visit to receive IM
      ketorolac.

      A previous study of Cambia demonstrated that this formulation of diclofenac potassium for
      oral solution is effective in reducing pain intensity within 30 minutes, which may be related
      to the 15-minute Tmax associated with this formulation. The rapid-onset benefits were
      sustained through 24 hours post-treatment (Lipton, Cephalalgia 2010)
