    
      This is a multicentre, randomized, double blinded, placebo controlled trial to intended to
      evaluate safety and tolerability of oral administration of Yaq-001 therapy.

      70 Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis patients will be randomized (1:1) to:

        -  Standard medical treatment + Yaq-001 (8 g/ day) - n= 35

        -  Standard medical treatment + placebo-control (placebo for 8 g of Yaq-001/ day) - n= 35

      Study patients will be dosed daily with Yaq-001 (or an equivalent quantity of placebo) for 48
      weeks.

      Assessment of DSMB will take place when 15 Yaq-001- and 15 placebo-treated patients have
      completed 12 weeks of dosing.

      Investigational centres specialized in the management of patients with Non-Alcoholic
      Steatohepatitis will participate in the study.

      For each patient, the study duration will be up to 54 weeks, including the screening (up to
      45 days), treatment (48 weeks) and 7-day follow up period.

      The total study duration is estimated to be approximately 18 months from screening of first
      patient until study completion of the last patient.

      innovation programme.
