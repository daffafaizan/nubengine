      1960s. Secretin is produced in and secreted form small intestinal S cells. In the 1970s, the
      primary endocrine effects of secretin were unequivocally confirmed, namely potentiation of
      bicarbonate and pepsin secretion from the pancreas as well as stimulation of bile production
      in the liver. In the 1990s, the biosynthesis of secretin was delineated and its receptor was
      discovered. In the 2000s the pancreatic regulation of intestinal pH was shown to be
      secretin-mediated. As of last year, new insight into the function of secretin was brought
      about as rodent studies showed secretin to possess potential body weight-regulating effects.
      In these studies, secretin was shown to increase non-shivering thermogenesis in brown adipose
      tissue (BAT), decrease meal size and promote meal discontinuation.

      The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of a 5-hour intravenous infusion with
      the naturally occurring hormone secretin on ad libitum food intake (primary endpoint)
      compared to a double-blinded placebo (isotonic saline) infusion in 25 healthy young males.
