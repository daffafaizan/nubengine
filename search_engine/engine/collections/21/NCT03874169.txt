      the US and accounts for 300,000 hospitalizations per year with a death rate of 5%.
      Qualitative assessments of blood tests monitoring patients with or are thought to have GI
      bleeding can lack accuracy and objectivity, delaying conformation of the bleed through
      endoscopy. Early endoscopies have been linked to more favorable outcomes for patients with
      heavier GI bleeding and earlier discharge times for patients with less severe GI bleeding.
      Additionally, laboratory values are not documented at regular intervals, which makes
      identifying when GI bleeding exactly occurred difficult. In this study, the investigators aim
      to improve methods of monitoring and diagnosing GI bleeding via the E4 wristband, a biosensor
      watch. Using data from the E4 wristband, the investigators will train a model to recognize GI
      bleeding through analyzing the heart rate and skin conductance of both patients with GI
      bleeding and who may have GI bleeding while they are not bleeding and while they are
      bleeding. Monitoring both types of patients while they are and are not bleeding will help the
      model discern which vital signs are critical. Additionally, the investigators will be using
      blood tests and other traditional methods of diagnosis to create a standard for vitals that
      characterize GI bleeding. If the E4 wristband is successfully able to accurately identify
      when a patient is experiencing GI bleeding, then speed of GI bleeding detection and the
      ability to monitor GI bleeding will dramatically increase, leading to quicker discharge
      times, reduced risk of rebleeding, and a lower death rate for afflicted patients.
