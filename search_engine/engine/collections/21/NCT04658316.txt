      physiological mechanism by which humans take in water and nutrients. It is a vital activity
      for individual survival. The physiological mechanism of swallowing has four major stages,
      oral preparation, oral cavity, pharynx, and esophagus. Each stage has its physiological
      mechanism, which depends on the different nerve and muscle structures. In the oral stage, our
      tongue plays an important role. Whether in the formation or transition of the food bolus, it
      must rely on the tongue to perform its normal functions. The main topic of the research is to
      explore the strength of the tongue when swallowing. The purpose is to discuss the influence
      of gender and age on swallowing tongue pressure. We expect to recruit 80 subjects and divide
      them into three groups according to their age: 20 to 39 years old, 40 to 59 years old, and 60
      to 79 years old, with 13 to 14 males and females in each group, using Iowa Oral Performance
      Instrument measures the subject's maximum tongue pressure, average swallowing tongue
      pressure, and the ratio of the maximum tongue pressure used when swallowing, to explore
      whether age and gender affect tongue strength when swallowing.
