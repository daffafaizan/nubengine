      episodes of pneumonia result in hospitalization. It is the leading cause of
      community-acquired infection requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission. In pulmonary
      infections, the release of cytokines and other inflammatory mediators from alveolar
      macrophages serves as a mechanism by which invading pathogens are eliminated. However, this
      reaction of the innate immune system can be potentially harmful when excessive release of
      circulating inflammatory cytokines causes damage to the patient, particularly the lung.
      Interest in the role of corticosteroids in the pathophysiology of critical illness has
      existed since the early part of the 20th century. On ICU, early treatment with
      corticosteroids to attenuate systemic inflammation is widespread. At the same time, outside
      the ICU little evidence is available on the effect of treatment with corticosteroids in
      patients diagnosed with CAP. Theoretically, early initiated administration of corticosteroids
      in the course of a CAP can lower systemic and pulmonary inflammation. This may lead to
      earlier resolution of pneumonia and a reduction of complications (sepsis, mortality).
