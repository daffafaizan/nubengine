      participants where there is a plan to receive a blood and marrow transplant, enzyme therapy,
      or gene therapy in the future. Participants are then followed according to a schedule set out
      by the study protocol after the procedure. There are no experimental therapies on this study.

      The goal of this study is to learn more about: (1) outcomes from the treatment of SCID in the
      modern era of medicine (2) what factors lead to the best long-term outcomes, such as best
      donor, conditioning regimen, timing of transplant, etc., and (3) what impact newborn
      screening and the early diagnosis of SCID has had on the long-term outcomes following BMT or
      gene therapy. Information is also being gathered on how and when the immune system recovers
      after bone marrow transplant (BMT), quality of life for long-term survivors, and about
      whether children develop normally after treatment.

      This natural history study is the largest coordinated prospective study of participants with
      SCID ever performed. Information that investigators will learn, both now and in the future,
      will help doctors and other health professionals to better treat children with SCID.
