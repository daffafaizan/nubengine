      second group of OCD subjects receiving sham treatment (sham coil). The treatment group will
      receive 5 weeks of daily DTMS treatments followed by 4 treatments in week 6, for a total of
      29 treatment sessions. The control group will receive the same treatments with a sham coil.
      Subjects may continue to take SSRI medications (if prescribed) and any other antidepressant
      medications will be tapered down prior to the first treatment. SSRI medications approved for
      OCD include Fluoxetine (Prozac, Sarafem, Symbyax), Fluvoxamine (Luvox, Luvox CR), Paroxetine
      (Paxil, Paxil CR, Pexeva) and Sertraline (Zoloft). Efficacy will be assessed using the
      Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale score (YBOCS), as well as other efficacy scales. Safety
      will be assessed by monitoring of adverse events, vital signs, physical and neurological
      examination and using certain safety questionnaires.
