      for patients undergoing amputation of a limb. The information we obtain from this study will
      help to decide the most effective manner to provide pain relief for patients in the future.
      The primary outcome of interest is post-operative pain relief as measured by the amount of
      pain-relieving medications (opioids) required by patients prior to discharge home. The
      secondary outcomes of interest will be pain-relieving medications (opioid) requirements
      during the operation, length of stay in the hospital, time required for mobility, and patient
      satisfaction- measured by a survey given while in hospital and 3 months later.
