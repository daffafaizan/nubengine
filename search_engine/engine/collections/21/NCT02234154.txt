      "TOPS"). TOPS is an alternative to spinal fusion and is designed to stabilize but not fuse
      the affected vertebral level to alleviate pain stemming from degenerative spondylolisthesis
      (abnormal/excessive movement of the vertebrae causing pain in the lower back and legs) and
      spinal stenosis (narrowing of the spinal canal resulting in compression of nerves producing
      symptoms of pain, numbness and tingling in the legs).
