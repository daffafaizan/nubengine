      general adult population. They usually present as painful or annoying lumps that are palpable
      and often visible in the subcutaneous tissue. Many subcutaneous lipomas are asymptomatic and
      are removed for non-medical reasons. However, they may cause the subject pain or discomfort
      or interfere with normal activity.

      Spontaneous remission of lipomas has not been reported. A lipoma, once it presents itself,
      remains there for the lifetime of a person who carries it and may stay small or become
      larger. Alternative treatments of the lipoma are surgery or liposuction. If a large excision
      is performed there is the problem of having a very large scar and the accompanying issues of
      healing a large scar, or possible formation of a hematoma followed by consolidation of the
      hematoma and the remnants of a mass of scar tissue. This is often painful and more
      problematic than the original lipoma. liposuction also has the potential for hematoma
      formation followed by scar mass residual.

      To avoid the complications listed above, a non-invasive method of treatment, such as enzyme
      mediated disassociation of adipose tissue, would be desirable. The primary aim of this study
      is to perform a step-wise approach in dosing to evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      clostridium histolyticum as a non-operative treatment for lipoma.
