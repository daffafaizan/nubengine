      analgesia in patients with rib fracture, open thoracotomy, breast surgery. The present study
      is aimed to investigate the intraoperative hemodynamic responses, anesthetic and analgesic
      consumption, and postoperative recovery quality of erector spinae plane block in patients
      with knee prosthesis. After approval, patients enrolled in the study are divided into two
      groups by computer-based randomization technique as control and study group. After standard
      monitorization, anesthesia induction and tracheal intubation, erector spinae plane block is
      performed to study group and no intervention to control group.

      In the intraoperative period, 10 mg / kg paracetamol and 0.05 mg / kg morphine will be used
      for postoperative analgesia. After surgery, all patients will be given 10 mg/kg paracetamol
      every 8 hours and will be fitted with a patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) device (Tramadol
      HCL). PCA device bolus dose will be set to 20 mg, lock time will be set to 10 minutes and the
      number of buttons per hour will be set as 3.for postoperative analgesia.After surgery, VAS
      scores of the patients will be evaluated (in the recovery room, 1,3,6,12 and 24 hours,
      Patients with VAS≥4 will be given 0.03mg / kg morphine as salvage analgesia.After 30 minutes,
      the patients' VAS will be re-evaluated,If VAS≥4 the same dose will be repeated.
