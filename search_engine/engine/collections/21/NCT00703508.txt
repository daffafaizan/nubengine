      age, i.e., 3.5-5.5 million women in the United States. PCOS is the most common endocrine
      disturbance of young women and the major cause (75%) of anovulatory infertility in the United
      States. We hypothesize that women with the polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) who have the G/G
      genotype of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)_ rs8111699 in STK11 will exhibit a
      significantly greater response to metformin, in terms of ovulation, compared with women with
      either the C/G or C/C genotype. Specifically, we anticipate the frequency of ovulation
      (defined by number of ovulations/9 months/subject) to be at least 2-fold higher in women with
      the G/G STK11 genotype compared with women with either the C/G or C/C genotype.

      To test this hypothesis, we will obtain DNA for STK11 genotyping in 36 women with PCOS who
      are treated with metformin and carefully monitored for ovulation for 9 months. STK11 genotype
      status will be determined, and the ovulation rates in the G/G, G/C and C/C genotype groups
      will be compared with one another. Our goal is to identify the genes that predict or modify
      response to commonly prescribed medications that will allow physicians to better choose among
      existing therapies and individualize treatment. While metformin has been shown to increase
      ovulatory frequency in PCOS and is widely used in clinical practice to treat infertility, a
      substantial number of women either do not respond or are slow to respond to metformin
      treatment.

      Knowing that a specific STK11 genotype predicts the effect of metformin on ovulation would
      facilitate more efficient and effective treatment of infertility in PCOS.
