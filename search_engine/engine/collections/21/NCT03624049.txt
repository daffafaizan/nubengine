    
      PRIMARY HYPOTHESES: In community-dwelling ambulatory older adults (age â‰¥50 years)
      participation in a community-based group program will improve the Duke Social Support Index
      (DSSI) score by four points measured after six to eight participation in the program when
      compared to the DSSI score prior to participation in the program. This increase will be
      sustained at 26 week follow-up.

      SECONDARY HYPOTHESES: Participants in the community-based group exercise activities will have
      decreased fall risk when measured after six to eight weeks participation in the program when
      compared to pre-participation as based on responses to the fall risk questionnaire.
      Cedars-Sinai patients who participate in the community-based programs will have a decrease in
      health care utilization (as measured by physician visits, Emergency Department visits, and
      hospitalizations) in the 26 weeks after program enrollment compared to the 26 weeks prior to
      program enrollment.
