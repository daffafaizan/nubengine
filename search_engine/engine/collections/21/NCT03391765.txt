    
      This study (M15-563) was a Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, multiple-dose, multicenter,
      long-term extension of NCT 02985879 (Study M15-562) in participants with progressive
      supranuclear palsy (PSP). Those who completed the 52-week Treatment Period in Study M15-562
      and met all entry criteria were eligible for enrollment into this study. This study planned
      for a Treatment Period of up to 5 years and a post-treatment follow-up visit approximately 20
      weeks after the last dose of study drug (including participants who prematurely discontinued
      treatment). All participants received ABBV-8E12 as follows: those who received placebo in
      Study M15-562 were randomized, in a 1:1 ratio, to either 2000 or 4000 mg; those who received
      ABBV-8E12 at a dose of either 2000 or 4000 mg in Study M15-562 continued on the same dose in
      this study.

      This study was prematurely discontinued because the program for progressive supranuclear
      palsy was discontinued due to lack of efficacy.
