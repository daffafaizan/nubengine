      utility of health information technology (IT) educational tools to reduce these events. The
      results of this project will be invaluable in gaining a better understanding of the
      limitations and potential for use of a patient-centered mHealth patient safety educational
      intervention in high-risk individuals with CKD.

      The study will evaluate the perceived eHealth literacy of patients with CKD and its relation
      to medication errors in the CRIC cohort. The hypothesis is that a novel mHealth-based patient
      safety curriculum designed to address a wide-range of e-literacy will be effective in
      attenuating the identified Digital Divide adversely affecting many CKD patients, and will
      reduce adverse safety events common in this population.

      Study Aims:

        1. Examine the association between surveyed perceived e-literacy and medication errors in
           individuals with CKD

           Hypothesis 1: Medication error rates will be higher among CRIC participants with low
           eHealth literacy.

        2. Assess the acceptance and feasibility of a novel mHealth-based patient safety curriculum
           to improve patient safety risk knowledge among individuals with CKD and determine its
           efficacy in increasing patient safety risk awareness.

      Hypothesis 2a: A low literacy mHealth patient safety curriculum will improve patient safety
      risk awareness among high risk individuals with CKD.

      Hypothesis 2b: Medication error rates will be higher among CRIC participants with low patient
      safety risk awareness.
