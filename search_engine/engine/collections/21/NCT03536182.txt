    
      To compare the efficacy of carbon ion-based chemo radiotherapy with x-ray-based chemo
      radiotherapy for the treatment of locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma by comparison of
      overall survival at 2 years following treatment.

      Patient has 2 in 3 chance of receiving Arm A and 1 in 3 chance of receiving Arm B.

      Arm A (chemoradiation takes place in Japan):

      CIRT in 12 fractions/treatments plus concurrent gemcitabine, followed by 4 cycles of
      gemcitabine + nab-Paclitaxel, or until progression or intolerance of therapy

      Arm B:

      IMRT in 28 fractions plus concurrent gemcitabine or capecitabine, followed by 4 cycles of
      gemcitabine + nab-Paclitaxel, or until progression or intolerance of therapy

      Per investigator discretion, patients may receive either:

        1. Definitive treatment :

        2. Neoadjuvant treatment:

      Adjuvant chemotherapy 4 cycles of gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel or FOLFIRNOX, Gemcitabine alone
      if these regimens are unavailable
