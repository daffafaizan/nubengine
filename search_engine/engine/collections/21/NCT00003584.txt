      metastatic and/or recurrent renal cell carcinoma. II. Obtain pilot data exploring the value
      of anti-inflammatory treatment in the management of severe systemic symptoms and improvement
      of treatment tolerance in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to number of risk factors (0,1 versus 2 versus 3).
      Patients receive vinorelbine IV on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 28, and 35. Patients also receive
      estramustine orally twice per day on days 1-7 and an increased dose on days 8-42. A tapered
      dose of oral prednisone is given to patients with an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate.
      A course of treatment consists of 6 weeks of treatment followed by 2 weeks of rest. Patients
      with stable disease may receive up to 4 courses of treatment. Patients who achieve a partial
      response may undergo surgical resection followed by up to 2 additional courses of treatment
      or an interleukin-2 treatment regimen. Patients with a complete response receive 1 additional
      course of treatment. Patients are followed until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 35 patients will be accrued for this study.
