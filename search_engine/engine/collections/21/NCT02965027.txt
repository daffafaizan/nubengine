      can be refractory to standard therapies, and may persist and worsen to become a debilitating
      chronic pain syndrome. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the centrally acting alpha-1
      adrenoreceptor (AR) antagonist drug prazosin as a prophylactic treatment for chronic
      posttraumatic headaches (PTHAs). The impetus for this study comes from a large open-label
      case series in Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans with mTBI and PTHAs and data from a
      placebo-controlled trial evaluating use of prazosin for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
      in active-duty Servicemembers (SMs). Findings from these studies showed that in addition to
      decreasing PTSD-related symptoms and improving sleep quality, prazosin decreased the
      frequency and severity of headaches, which were common in the study populations.

      Study Objectives, Specific Aims, and Hypotheses: The objective of this study is to evaluate
      the efficacy of prazosin as a prophylactic treatment for persistent PTHAs, which will be
      accomplished by conducting a randomized placebo-controlled double blind trial of prazosin vs.
      placebo in active-duty SMs and Veterans who were in military service at any time from October
      7, 2001 to the present with persistent PTHAs.

        -  Specific Aim 1: To determine the effect of prazosin compared to placebo on headache
           frequency, headache severity and duration, use of abortive/analgesic medications, and
           headache-related disability.

        -  Specific Aim 2: To determine the effect of prazosin on sleep disturbance, PTSD symptoms,
           depressive symptoms, alcohol consumption, global cognitive function, health-related
           quality of life, and global clinical status.
