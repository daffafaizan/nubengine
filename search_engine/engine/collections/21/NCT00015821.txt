      I. To investigate whether thalidomide, a potent inhibitor of angiogenic and fibrogenic growth
      factors, is an effective therapeutic agent in patients with MMM. Specifically, to assess
      whether thalidomide improves anemia and/or organomegaly in patients with MMM.

      II. To assess the effects of thalidomide on the myelofibrotic stroma with respect to
      microvascular architecture and angiogenesis, collagen and reticulin deposition, and the
      expression of the mediating growth factors bFGF, TGF-b, and PDGF, and their respective
      receptors.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral thalidomide once daily for 1 year in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with stable or responding disease may receive 1 additional
      year of therapy.

      Patients are followed every 6 months until 5 years from study entry.
