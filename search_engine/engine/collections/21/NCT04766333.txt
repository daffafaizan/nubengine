      cost of: (1) the healthcare worker focused outreach intervention strategy versus (2)
      community organization led outreach working with community based organizations. The
      investigators explore contextual factors (individual, family, and community) affecting
      COVID-19 testing implementation outcomes and scalability. The primary outcome is uptake of
      COVID-19 testing using the novel Rutgers Clinical Genomics Laboratory/RUCDR saliva test, the
      first FDA authorized diagnostic test using saliva to detect SARS-CoV-2 for non-invasive, home
      based self-testing. To compare participation rates in the two arms, our primary outcome, the
      investigators will use data on the number of tests performed per month up to a 12 month study
      period. For each intervention, the start time is the date of first attempted contact with
      potential participants and the end date is either the end of the study period, or the date at
      which the 1000th individual was tested (whichever comes first).
