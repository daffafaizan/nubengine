    
      This Study is designed to assess the effects of Zavesca® as immunomodulatory therapy on
      anti-rhGAA immune responses in patients with Pompe disease, as well as their health and
      disease progression. Subjects will either receive Zavesca® at 100 mg or 300 mg dosing levels
      during study participation (n=3 @ 100 mg dosing; n=3 @ 300 mg dosing).

      The first 3 subjects enrolled will be prescribed 100 mg Zavesca® 60 minutes prior to ERT
      infusion. The subsequent 3 subjects enrolled will be prescribed 300 mg Zavesca® 60 minutes to
      ERT infusion.

      Eligible participants are on standard ERT for Pompe disease and have a history of infusion
      associated reaction. Travel to the study site in Gainesville, Florida is required for 3
      visits. Participants are prescribed medication Zavesca® and have blood tests, punch muscle
      biopsy, physical exams, and answer questionnaires over 3 months study participation.
