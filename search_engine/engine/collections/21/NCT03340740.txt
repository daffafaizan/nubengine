    
      This is a prospective randomized, placebo-controlled trial to look at the effect of
      cetirizine on bronchoconstriction in patients with allergic rhinitis who present to the
      Pediatric Emergency Department with wheezing. Oral second generation antihistamines such as
      cetirizine are already the standard of care for allergic rhinitis. Wheezing pediatric
      patients with allergic rhinitis who are not already on this therapy will be randomized to
      receive either age-appropriate-dosed cetirizine or placebo in addition to standard asthma
      therapy at the discretion of the treating clinician, and will be monitored every 30 minutes
      with asthma scores and FEV1 measurements. At the conclusion of 3 hours, each patient who
      received placebo will receive a dose of cetirizine, and each patient who received cetirizine
      will receive a placebo medication dose, such that initiating therapy for allergic rhinitis is
      delayed by no more than 3 hours.
