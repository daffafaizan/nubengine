      growth factors, cytokines, and hormones; it has been reported to reduce oxidative stress and
      reactive oxygen species generation and upregulate the expression of various antioxidant
      enzymes. PRP is used in a variety of clinical applications in cell therapy. Based on World
      Health Organization guidelines, azoospermia is diagnosed when the absence of sperm is
      observed in two semen samples. Based on World Health Organization (WHO), cryptozoospermia is
      diagnosed when spermatozoa cannot be observed in a fresh semen sample; however, it is found
      after an extended centrifugation and microscopic search. All patients require a clinical
      work-up with physical examination, endocrine evaluation (follicle stimulating hormone (FSH),
      luteinizing hormone (LH) and testosterone) and genetic analysis. Scrotal and transrectal
      ultrasounds will be performed as indicated. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP), with its rich growth
      factor composition, has proven beneficial in regenerative therapy. The potential therapeutic
      role of PRP has not been studied in testis for non-obstructive azoospermia and
      cryptozoospermia. The investigators will investigate sperm parameters in non-obstructive
      azoospermic and crypotozoospermic patients treated with PRP.
