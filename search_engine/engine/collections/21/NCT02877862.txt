      care to a new level among ovarian cancer survivors. Using the Fogg Behavioral Model31 (FBM),
      developed from the concept of persuasive technology, this study proposes to develop the
      Mobile Application for Genetic Information on Cancer (mAGIC) week-long intervention to
      motivate ovarian cancer survivors to undergo genetic counseling.
