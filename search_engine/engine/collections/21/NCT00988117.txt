    
      Participation in this study requires four visits: a screening visit to ensure eligibility, an
      initial/baseline visit where the medication is distributed at a dosage lower than the optimal
      recommended dosage, a four week follow-up visit where the dosage of the medication is
      increased to the optimal amount, and a final twelve week follow up visit.

        -  In the screening visit the patient will undergo a neurological exam (including a review
           of their medical history and short physical exam), electrocardiogram ( a painless
           procedure that measures electrical activity of your heart), cognitive testing (such as
           memory and thinking tests), and a blood draw.

        -  At the Baseline/Initial visit the patient will receive a brief physical exam, additional
           cognitive testing, and an MRI scan. Afterwards, the study drug will be distributed.

        -  At the four week follow up visit the patient will be asked to do some abbreviated
           cognitive and neurological testing and the study drug will be re-distributed at the
           target dosage.

        -  At the final twelve week visit the patient will receive additional cognitive and
           neurological testing, and an MRI scan.

        -  Study compliance and adverse events will be reviewed every two weeks throughout the
           study, whether in person or over the phone.
