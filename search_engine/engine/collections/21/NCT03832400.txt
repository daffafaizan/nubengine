      active mucosal inflammation and observe its safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK),
      pharmacodynamics (PD) and clinical efficacy as compared to placebo. The goal is to define the
      parameters for dose-dependent engraftment of MET-2 commensal bacteria for the treatment of
      mild to moderate ulcerative colitis not fully responsive to conventional therapy.
