    
      Study design: Investigator-blinded, prospective, randomized controlled trial

      Subjects

        1. Entry criteria: Adult outpatients(at least 18 years of age, under 65 years) who undergo
           scheduled colonoscopy for screening, cancer surveillance or want procedure with/without
           non-specific gastrointestinal symptoms.

        2. Exclusion criteria:

      age under 18 years, elderly patients(>65 yrs), pregnancy, breast feeding, patient with bowel
      obstruction, and other structural intestinal disorders, gut hypomotility(chronic
      constipation(< 2 bowel movement/week for 1yr), hypomotility syndrome, megacolon, idiopathic
      pseudoobstruction), renal failure, congestive heart failure, liver failure, pre-existing
      electrolyte disturbance(hypercalcemia, hyperphosphatemia); refusal of consent to participate
      in the study.

      Sampling design: Consecutive recruitment of consenting patients

      Variables Predictor: split dose of PEG and sodium phosphate Primary Outcome: Quality of bowel
      preparation (Ottawa scale) Secondary Outcome: Tolerability (preparation completion, side
      effect) Confounding variables: age, gender, BMI, experience of colonoscopy, surgical history,
      bowel movement, comorbidity, indication, presence of GI symptoms, medication

      Statistical issues

      Hypothesis: Split dose bowel preparation with PEG will provide a better quality preparation
      and similar tolerability than that with sodium phosphate for morning colonoscopy.

      Sample size.: Improving rate 20% in bowel cleansing efficacy(Ottawa scale), study power 80%,
      alpha-error(level of significance, P-value) 5%, mean value scale=5, effect size 1, SD=2.5->
      sample size= 100/100
