      with ischemic coronary syndrome but with the advancement of medical intervention to eligible
      patients for this procedure are those with more comorbidities where conservation and
      palliative therapies have been tried without success.

      Patients undergoing CABG often develop pulmonary complications such as atelectasis,
      restrictive ventilatory defect, decreased lung compliance, increased shunt and changes in gas
      exchange leading to probable hypoxemia. In an attempt to reduce the harmful effects and
      pulmonary complications arising from surgical procedures is instituted extensive
      physiotherapy program that tracks and monitors such patients from the preoperative to the
      postoperative immediate transfer to the ward and hospital discharge.

      The objective of this study is to assess whether there is a difference between a care
      protocol with the use of incentive spirometry (Voldyne Â®) and another with the application of
      NIV (non invasive ventilation with single-level pressure) as a form of therapy. The main
      focus of the study is to determine the incidence of pulmonary complications in each
      technique.
