      with skills for independent and effective use. Suboptimal or disuse of the wheelchair results
      in substantial social costs such as reduced engagement in meaningful activity, social
      isolation, and higher caregiver burden. This represents a poor use of financial resources,
      including the cost of wheelchair acquisition and demands for attendant care. Access to skills
      training is constrained by the cost and limited availability of skilled therapists, the
      demands of patient and clinician travel, and lack of programs designed specifically for the
      needs of older adults. Enhancing Participation In the Community by improving Wheelchair
      Skills (EPIC WheelS) is an individualized home-training program that optimizes learning for
      older adults while limiting the demands on expert clinician trainers. It is delivered using a
      portable computer tablet that allows interactive learning, customized updating, and
      communication with an expert trainer. A monitored, home program that is effective and
      efficient for older adults has potential application for other target groups as well,
      particularly those with limited access to rehabilitation services in rural and remote
      locations.
