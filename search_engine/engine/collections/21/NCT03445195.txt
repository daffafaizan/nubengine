      efficacy of IV ETX2514SUL in patients with cUTIs who are otherwise relatively healthy.
      Patients with Acute Pyelonephritis may also be enrolled. Approximately 80 patients will be
      randomized to receive either 1 g ETX2514/1 g sulbactam IV or matching placebo every 6 hours
      (q6h). All patients will receive background therapy with 500 mg IV imipenem/cilastatin q6h.
