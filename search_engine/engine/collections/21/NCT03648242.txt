    
      The primary specific aims of this study are to:

        1. To assess the impact of EHR-based tools for pediatric obesity in primary care.
           Hypotheses: EHR-based clinical decision support tools that interrupt but support
           clinical workflow will (1) improve measures of pediatric obesity care quality delivered
           by clinicians (e.g., addition of obesity to the problem list, recommended screening for
           comorbidities, and follow-up/referral plans) and (2) result in a reduced rate of BMI
           increase over one year among children with obesity.

        2. To utilize a mixed methods approach with surveys and semi-structured qualitative
           interviews with clinicians to (1) examine the extent to which the EHR tools positively
           impact clinicians' awareness, knowledge and adherence to expert guidelines for pediatric
           obesity management, and (2) to explore the barriers to and facilitators of clinicians'
           use of the EHR tools and factors that influence adoption.
