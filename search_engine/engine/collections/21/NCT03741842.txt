    
      A randomised controlled trial will be conducted to determine the effectiveness of a programme
      "Coaching Ongoing Momentum Building On stroKe rEcovery journeY" ("COMBO-KEY"), a home
      visiting and phone coaching programme, on community-dwelling stroke survivors' self-efficacy,
      outcome expectation, and engagement in stroke self-management behaviours. An estimated sample
      of 134 stroke survivors will be recruited. COMBO-KEY will be underpinned by Bandura's
      constructs of self-efficacy and outcome expectation. It will be delivered by trained coaches.
      Outcomes will be measured at baseline and immediately after completion of the programme.
      Generalised estimating equations model will be used to assess the differential changes in
      outcome variables from pre-test to post-test between the intervention and control groups with
      adjustment for their baseline levels.
