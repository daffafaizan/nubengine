    
      Primary Aim: To determine whether subjects instructed with a specific flossing technique have
      less gingival inflammation as evidenced by bleeding on probing (BoP) than subjects without
      flossing instructions.

      Secondary Aim: To compare the effect of flossing by a dental professional with a patient's
      self-flossing following instruction in removing interdental plaque.

      Secondary Aim: To compare the completeness of plaque removal by the subjects instructed
      during the initial visit (Group A [test]) with their completeness at the final (fourth)
      visit.

      Secondary Aim: To compare the clinician's completeness of plaque removal at the fourth visit
      with the completeness of plaque removal by the subjects in both groups (Groups A [test] and B
      [control]). Each group will be analyzed separately. In Group A, a comparison of the plaque
      removal by the subjects and by the clinician will made with respect to the completeness at
      the first visit versus the final visit.
