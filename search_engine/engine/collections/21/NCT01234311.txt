    
      This is a Phase 3 randomized, double blind, placebo controlled study of tasquinimod in
      asymptomatic to mildly symptomatic patients with metastatic CRPC to confirm the effect of
      tasquinimod on delaying disease progression compared with placebo.

      Approximately 1200 eligible patients with metastatic CRPC will be randomly assigned in a 2:1
      ratio to 1 of 2 treatment groups: Treatment Group A (tasquinimod 0.25, 0.5, or 1 mg/day;
      n=800) or Treatment Group B (placebo; n=400).
