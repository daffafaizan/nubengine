      Green Hospital and other Scripps Clinic locations. Only patients who have indications for
      traditional cardiac rhythm monitoring will be enrolled in the study. Patients 18 years or
      older with suspected arrhythmias capable of providing informed consent will wear both a
      traditional Holter monitor for up to 48 hours and a Zio® Patch for up to 14 days. Both
      devices will be initiated at the same time as they do not interfere with one another. This
      will also allow a direct comparison of the same initial up to 24 hour monitoring period
      between the two devices. As the Zio® Patch is worn for up to 14 days instead of only 24
      hours, it will be assessed if in the physician's opinion (referring physician), waiting for
      the extended time hinders being able to provide medical care and/or diagnosis for the
      patient.
