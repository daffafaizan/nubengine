    
      Design:

      Prospective, single-arm, open-label, feasibility and safety Phase IIa study.

      Study Population:

      10 total ischemic stroke patients all treated with rt-PA (0-3 hour or 0-4.5 hour according to
      each site's local standard) and IA; age of 18 years or older; proximal (intracranial) artery
      occlusion as imaged by CT-angiogram (CTA).

      Treatment:

      All patients will receive standard-of-care intravenous rt-PA (0.9 mg/kg; maximum 90 mg) and
      IA. Before the end of the 1 hour rt-PA infusion, a 3.0 mcg/kg/min continuous infusion of
      Argatroban, preceded by a 100 mcg/kg bolus will be administered over 3-5 minutes. Infusion
      will be titrated to achieve an aPTT of 2.25 times baseline (not to exceed 10 mcg/kg/min) for
      a maximum of 12 hours.

      Assessments:

        1. Baseline: History and physical exam, vital signs, CBC, liver function tests, PT/INR,
           PTT, non-contrast head CT, CT-Angiogram, NIHSS, mRS, concomitant medications.

           Laboratory results must be reported before study drug administration.

        2. 0-24 hours: Vital signs, aPTT (scheduled 2, 6, 12 hours), NIHSS (24-hours), conventional
           angiography as part of usual care intra-arterial therapy. Repeat parenchymal brain
           imaging (non-contrast head CT or MRI) at 24 hours from rt-PA bolus. Laboratory testing
           work (same as baseline).

        3. Day 7/Discharge (whichever occurs first): Vital signs, mRS, NIHSS

        4. Day 90: mRS (obtained by certified rater).
