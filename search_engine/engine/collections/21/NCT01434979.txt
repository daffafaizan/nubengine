      responses of controls to standardized exercise under thermoneutral and thermally challenged
      conditions and responses of exertional heat stroke (EHS) subjects under a thermal-challenged
      environment to develop unique biosignature panels to predict those at risk for exertional
      heat illness (EHI) and guide return to duty following an episode of EHS.

      Research Design: This is a prospective cross-sectional study.

      Methodology/Technical Approach: The proposed study will examine multiple biomarkers in a
      group of 100 individuals who have not had an episode of EHS and a prospective study of 50
      persons who have had an EHS event. Control subjects will have biomarker assessments before
      and after an exercise challenge under thermoneutral (TTT) and thermally challenged conditions
      (heat tolerance test/HTT); differences in the responses to the two tests will be attributed
      to the heat. In EHS subjects, blood will be obtained at time of injury and then followed up
      at 6 weeks according to non-EHS controls. In addition, EHS cases will be prospectively
      followed at 3, 6, 12, and 18 months after the 6-week post assessment. If they are heat
      tolerant at 6-weeks as determined by a HTT, subsequent measures will include only blood
      samples and questionnaires, whereas if they are heat intolerant (HIT) at 6-weeks, subsequent
      measures will include additional HTTs, along with blood samples and questionnaires. As our
      previous data indicate, approximately 20% of non-EHS persons are HIT; we will test 100
      non-EHS and 50 EHI persons in this study. Thus, data will be evaluated with regard to
      thermotolerance. Importantly, all control participants will undergo two test sessions (HTT
      and TTT); to control for an order effect, we will randomize the tests.
