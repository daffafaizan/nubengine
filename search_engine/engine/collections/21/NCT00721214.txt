      study participants will have a bone marrow test to evaluate the effect of the 5-azacytidine
      on the Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS). Participants continue to get cycles of 5-Azacytidine
      until 2 bone marrow tests show the MDS has stopped responding to the treatment. At that time
      they will undergo a transplant if a donor is available.
