      multiple diet-induced weight loss attempts. On the other hand, severly obese patients have
      also a high risk of both intra- and post-operative complications. Pre-operative weight loss
      can reduce these risks but no optimal pre-operative weight loss strategy has been
      investigated. Very-low-calorie diets (VLCDs) were proven to results in higher metabolic
      improvements in the short-term than balanced, hypocaloric diets. Therefore, the aim of the
      study is to investigate whether a VLCD results in lower intra-and post-operative
      complications compared to a hypocaloric diet. However, to achieve a optimal compliance in
      patients having experienced multiple dietary intervention failures, administration of the
      intervention will be performed by the enteral route using a naso-gastric feeding tube.
