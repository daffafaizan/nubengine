      the inspiratory muscle strength and endurance increase. The investigators will be able to
      study the impact on the weaning time of IMT performed with the best protocol.

      The investigators are going to conduct a randomized trial with intention-to-treat analysis.
      Following 18h of invasive mechanical ventilation in a controlled mode, the failure of the
      first single breathe trial of 2 hours and the presence of sevrability criterias defined by
      the European consensus conference in 2007, 88 participants will be included. Participants
      will be randomizesd to receive one of the 3 protocols of IMT, 2 times per day, 7 days per
      week, from the inclusion to the extubation.

      The ratio of randomization will be 1:1:2 for a better evaluation of EDRIC's group wich
      propose a new IMT protocol.
