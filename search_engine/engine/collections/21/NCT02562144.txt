      the left or right-handedness is reduced by randomizing the arms of the subjects in the
      placebo group or xylocaine group. The subject will get before xylocaine spray is placed, the
      intervention-arm, one intravenous cannulation in one of the elbows, the other intravenous
      cannulation is placed in the other arm before placebo spray is placed, the control arm. The
      pain score during insertion of the cannulation, the incidence of adverse events and the
      success rate and degree of difficulty to place an intravenous cannulation. The subjects and
      the one who place the cannulations will be blinded to the treatment.
