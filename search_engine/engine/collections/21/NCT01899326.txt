      I. To study efficacy, safety, harvest kinetics and engraftment kinetics of patients
      undergoing autologous stem cell mobilization, mobilized with a combination of granulocyte
      colony-stimulating factor (GCSF) (filgrastim) with desipramine (desipramine hydrochloride)
      (G+D).

      II. To analyze polymorphisms of adrenergic receptor beta 2 (ADRB2) and adrenergic receptor
      beta 3 (ADRB3) genes that correlate with mobilization efficiency.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive desipramine hydrochloride orally (PO) daily on days -3 to +4 and filgrastim
      PO twice daily (BID) on days 1-4. Stem cell collection begins on day 6.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up 1 week after completion of stem
      cell collection.
