      an incubator (KSI) on the early growth of very preterm infants.

      Patients and methods: Sixty six newborns â‰¤32 weeks of gestational age at birth received KS
      delivered 3 times/day during KP or in an incubator. They were randomized when the infants
      were considered eligibleto initiate KMC which was part of the routine care for all newborns
      in the Neonatal Care Unit (NCU). The primary outcome were the weight gain (g/kg/day) between
      randomization, 5, and 15 days after the start of the intervention and weight at 40 weeks of
      gestational age (term). The secondary outcomes were the same measures according to the
      chronological age (days of life) of the infant at randomization.
