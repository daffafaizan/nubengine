           University of Rochester Women's Health Practice or Highland Woman's Health and report
           significant depressive symptoms will be randomized to either PSP (Personal Support for
           Progress) or ESR (Enhanced Screening and Referral). Participants assigned to PSP will
           work with a patient navigator to prioritize their concerns, develop a personalized care
           plan, and implement their plan. Participants assigned to ESR will receive a personalized
           report of community resources that may be helpful for their identified needs.

        -  The investigators will use a simple 1:1 randomized design with treatment assignment
           being conducted using a random number generator. All analyses will follow an
           intent-to-treat protocol, such that all participants randomized will be followed for
           data collection and analyzed according to her randomized condition

        -  Each participant will be assessed 4 times for outcome changes: at baseline, post
           treatment (4 months), and two follow up ( at 7 and 10 months).

        -  Assessments are self report on iPads and they are linked directly to a Red Cap database.
