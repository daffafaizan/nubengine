      guidelines recommending stopping eating solids and drinking clear fluid 6 hours and 2 hours,
      respectively before anesthesia. However, hunger and thirst exacerbates patients' anxiety,
      adversely impacts the patient's comfort and satisfaction, and enhances pain response leading
      to additional need for analgesia.

      Patients undergoing non-invasive procedures requiring no or light sedation may benefit from
      non-fasting recommendations. The need for preoperative fasting in patients undergoing
      cataract surgery under topical anesthesia remains controversial. Patients are not fasted
      before standard cataract surgery under local anesthesia in many cataract centers, in
      accordance with the UK national guideline published in 2012. However, this practice is not
      supported by a high level of evidence from prospective clinical trials. So far, the lack of
      international professional consensus on the matter, local practices are based on
      institutional recommendations obviating the need for starvation in routine cataract surgery
      under topical anesthesia.
