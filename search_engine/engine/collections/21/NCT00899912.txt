    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Demonstrate the feasibility of acquiring specimens, both frozen and paraffin-embedded,
           to yield RNA of adequate quality to perform DNA microarray studies on markers of
           radiotherapy outcome in patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Compare the gene expression results from frozen tissue and paraffin-embedded tissue to
           see the correlation between the 2 methods in patients treated on the brachytherapy alone
           arm of protocol RTOG-0232.

        -  Find genes that are expressed differentially before and after radiation therapy in
           patients treated on the brachytherapy plus external-beam radiation therapy arm of
           protocol RTOG-0232.

        -  Find gene expression patterns in patients treated on either arm of protocol RTOG-0232
           who have significant associations with biochemically as well as clinically apparent
           local and distant failure.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, pilot study.

      Frozen and paraffin-embedded tissue samples are studied for biomarker/laboratory analysis.
      DNA microarray analysis is performed on the samples to assess markers of radiotherapy
      outcome.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 156 patients will be accrued for this study.
