      with mother in a more secure way by use of a CBM procedure. A secure attachment-related
      processing bias can causally increase children's trust in mother's availability. The present
      study tests whether intranasal administration of oxytocin can increase the effect of a secure
      cognitive bias training. Oxytocin is a neuropeptide that is involved in human attachment and
      bonding. Intranasal administration of oxytocin can increase trust among people. After
      oxytocin or placebo administration, children are either trained to interpret ambiguous
      interactions with mother in a secure way or receive a neutral training unrelated to
      interpretation of maternal behavior. Pre- and post-intervention children's trust in mother,
      support seeking behavior and interpretation of maternal behavior is assessed. Moreover,
      possible oxytocin side-effects will be monitored.
