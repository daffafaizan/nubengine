      increased risk of cancer, endometriosis and associated infertility, and unique tumor biology
      and response to treatment. The goal of this protocol is to further determine the mechanisms
      of these mutations, such as the KRAS-variant, and their associations with human health, such
      as cancer. The investigators will collect saliva samples from individual patients who are
      eligible and choose to enroll in these studies, to test for the KRAS-variant and/or other
      mutations under study. With specific permission, the investigators will keep excess DNA to
      further investigate and discover additional similar mutations. The investigators purpose is
      to have participants answer questionnaires about lifestyle factors in an ongoing manner, to
      understand the impact of different factors on cancer risk for patients with these mutations.
