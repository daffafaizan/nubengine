      inhibition in the motor cortex in focal dystonia. Sensory tricks or Geste antagoniste, are
      various manoeuvres used by dystonic patients to transiently diminish their spasms. Many of
      these manoeuvres involve motor as well as sensory input and here we use the term 'tricks' to
      refer to both phenomena. Little is known of this unique feature that is an evidence for the
      abnormality of sensorimotor integration in focal dystonia. The relief of dystonic symptoms by
      the application of tricks suggests its potential as a clue to the understanding of the yet
      unclear mechanism of dystonia. There is evidence that surround inhibition, a cortical
      phenomenon that functions to suppress unwanted movements in surrounding muscles during
      voluntary actions, is impaired in dystonia. Since tricks transiently relieve the dystonic
      symptoms, we hypothesize that the mechanism of tricks is the normalization of surround
      inhibition which is defective in dystonia.
