      who meet screening criteria and are interested in participating in the study. Eligible
      patients will be examined preoperatively to obtain a medical history and to establish a
      baseline for ocular condition. Baseline measurements will include successful use of an
      external telescope.

      Postoperatively, patients will undergo ophthalmic evaluation at regular intervals as
      specified in this protocol and will be required to return for 6 to 10 additional visits for
      vision training with a low vision specialist.
