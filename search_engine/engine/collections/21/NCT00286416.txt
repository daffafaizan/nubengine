    
      60 patients with Aspirin Exacerbated respiratory Disease will be screened to determine if
      they also have allergic respiratory tract disease as a co-morbid complication. This will
      involve history, allergy skin tests and a serum IgE level. They must also have been
      desensitized to aspirin and be taking aspirin 325 or 650 mg morning and night.

      40/60 patients will receive omalizumab injections every month for the next 4 months and the
      other 20 patients, via a random program, will receive placebo injections.

      Monthly visits with the nurse co-ordinator will involve the following assessments: daily
      symptom scores, daily use of medications (particularly prednisone and rescue albuterol
      inhalers), lung function tests, nasal breathing test, measurement of smell and quality of
      life scores pre and post study.
