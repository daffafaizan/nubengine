      individual) has long been considered the gold standard for lumbar spine fusion procedures.
      Unfortunately, there are complications involved with autograft harvest such as donor site
      morbidity, increased operating time, and limited supply. Therefore, the use of allograft
      (bone taken from one body and placed into another individual) as a graft extender has become
      an acceptable practice, especially in fusions of more than one level where larger quantities
      of graft material are needed.

      In this study, comparisons will be made between patients who are randomized to having fusion
      with an allograft material (Optecure, Exactech, Inc.) mixed with an autograft to those
      patients who are randomized to having fusion with autograft alone.
