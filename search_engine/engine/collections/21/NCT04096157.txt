      least 30 days between investigational product (IP) administrations in each period.
      Participants will be randomized to 1 of 2 sequences. Participants will be admitted to the
      clinical unit on day -1 of each period and will be residential for 5 days/4 nights.
      Participants will receive a single dose of isavuconazonium sulfate IV solution via NG tube
      (test formulation) or isavuconazonium sulfate capsules for oral administration (i.e., oral
      capsules administered to nonintubated participants) (reference formulation) under fasting
      conditions on day 1 of each period. Participants are to remain semirecumbent and avoid lying
      on either the left or right side for 4 hours postdose. Correct placement of the NG tube will
      be confirmed using X-ray radiography. Pharmacokinetic samples will be collected predose on
      day 1 of each period and at multiple time points postdose. Standard safety and tolerability
      assessments will be conducted. Participants will be discharged from the clinical unit on day
      4 of each period on the condition that all required assessments have been performed and that
      there are no medical reasons for a longer stay in the clinical unit. Participants will return
      for ambulatory visits to collect pharmacokinetic samples on days 8, 11, 15 and 21 of each
      period.

      The study will be completed with an end-of-study visit (ESV). The ESV will take place 5 to 9
      days after day 21 of period 2 or at early discontinuation from the study.
