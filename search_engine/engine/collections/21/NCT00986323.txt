      chemical and combined methods aiming to reduce airborne allergen levels have shown little or
      no effect in reducing asthma symptoms in people who are sensitive to perennial allergens.Aims
      and objectives: This study aims to investigate treatment with Temperature controled Laminar
      Airflow (TLA) with a very low particle concentration directed to the breathing zone in
      subjects with allergic asthma during night sleep. The hypothesis is that the decreased
      allergen exposure during the night will have an effect on quality of life and bronchial
      inflammation.

      Method: This is a multicentre, double blind, randomized 52 week parallel trial comparing
      active TLA treatment with Placebo. For ethical reasons the randomization is 2 to 1 for active
      and placebo treatment, respectively. A 2 weeks run-in period is inserted between inclusion
      and randomization, during which the patient shall get familiar with the use of the patient
      asthma diary and to adhere to the requirements of the study participation. First 12 weeks an
      unchanged maintenance medication will be kept and week 13-52 medication will be modified to
      obtain asthma control according to international guidelines (GINA). After inclusion, run-in,
      randomization and baseline measurements active/placebo treatment with AA will be implemented
      over 52 weeks.
