      I. To estimate the mean difference in oxygen saturation (%sO2) between healthy and malignant
      inguinal lymph nodes using ultrasound-guided photoacoustic imaging (PAI) in cancer patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To examine the role of ultrasound-guided PAI in detecting metastases in the inguinal lymph
      nodes and ultrasound features of lymph nodes such as the size, shape of the lymph nodes.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo standard of care ultrasound of the lymph nodes, then undergo
      ultrasound-guided PAI over 3-5 minutes. Patients then undergo standard of care
      ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (FNA) or biopsy a suspicious lymph node.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up for 3 months.
