      underwent PCI are eligible for this study. The bone marrow derived AC 133+ and MNC would be
      intracoronary injected to the patients during PCI procedure. The control group would be
      received just serum during PCI. The patient would be followed every month and at the end of
      6th and 18thmonth the case and control groups will be evaluated by stress echo and Tc99 scan.

      The totality of evidence from trials investigating autologous whole bone marrow infusion into
      patients following myocardial infarction supports the safety of this approach in terms of
      efficacy
