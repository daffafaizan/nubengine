      receive intrauterine infusions of platelet rich plasma or a placebo of embryo culture media
      prior to their embryo transfer. All patients will undergo a blood draw to obtain 60ml of
      blood from which 0.5ml of platelet rich plasma will be obtained. Those randomized to receive
      the platelet rich plasma will have platelet rich plasma placed into the uterine cavity at
      least 48 hours prior to the embryo transfer, while those randomized to receive placebo will
      have embryo culture media placed into the uterine cavity at the same point in time. Those
      randomized to the placebo group will have the opportunity to be placed into the treatment
      group if no pregnancy was attained. Transfer outcomes including implantation rate, pregnancy
      rate, and live birth rate, will be recorded.
