      tooth bleaching is one of the most requested cosmetic dental procedures asked by patients who
      want and aesthetically more pleasing smile. The American Dental Association (ADA) has advised
      patients to ask the dentists to adamant the most suitable bleaching treatment, especially for
      those complaining of tooth sensitivity, dental restorations, extremely dark discolorations,
      and single dark teeth.

      Tooth sensitivity (TS) is the most common clinical side effect of tooth bleaching. Tooth
      sensitivity (TS) caused by bleaching procedures usually results in mild and transient pain;
      however, it can occasionally cause significant discomfort that is a main deterrent to
      patients successfully completing bleaching treatments. Considering that TS has been reported
      as a common side effect, affecting more than 60% of the patients that undergo this cosmetic
      treatment. Greater tooth sensitivity has been reported with in-office bleaching with adjunct
      light compared with no light. Existing literature reveals that activation of bleaching agents
      by heat or light may have an adverse effect on pulpal tissue. It was already reported that
      the use of intense lights does elevate bleach temperature, but it results in increased
      intrapulpal temperatures, which may further impact patient sensitivity and pulpal
      health.Hence, in this study different light intensities bleaching protocol will be used
      aiming at overcoming this complication.
