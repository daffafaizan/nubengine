      administration of autologous cord blood in neonates with severe encephalopathy (hypoxic
      ischemic encephalopathy or cerebral infarction). It is hypothesized that the administration
      of autologous cord blood will be safe and well tolerated in neonates with severe
      encephalopathy. If a neonate is born with signs of moderate to severe encephalopathy and
      cooled for the encephalopathy, the neonate will receive their own cord blood. The cord blood
      cells are divided into 3 doses and infused at 24, 48, and 72 hours after the birth. Infants
      will be randomised to treatment with autologous cord blood and hypothermia or hypothermia
      only and followed for safety and neurodevelopmental outcome up to 18 months. All infants in
      both groups will be treated with hypothermia for 72 hours started within 6 hours of delivery
      and infants who allocated to hypothermia and xenon will also receive autologous cord blood in
      24 hours from birth through a purpose designed delivery system. Additionally, postnatal
      neuro-developmental outcomes in neonates with encephalopathy after autologous cord blood
      therapy will be measured; HIE injury to the neonate/infant brain post autologous cord blood
      therapy by imaging will be characterized; MRI's will be obtained per clinical routine; serum
      levels of selected cytokine and neurotrophic factors in neonates with HIE before and after
      autologous cord blood therapy will be compared and immune cell phenotype and function in
      neonates with HIE before and after autologous cord blood therapy will be compared.
