      currently indicated for use in patients with HER2 over-expressing metastatic breast cancer.
      Serum increases in TGFα can have growth potentiating effects on distant sites of metastatic
      disease. Palliative irradiation paradoxically may promote distant tumor growth; blocking
      shedding of TGFα from irradiated tumors may prevent this effect and improve the therapeutic
      index of radiation therapy.
