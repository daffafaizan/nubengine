    
      Evaluation of the marginal and internal adaptation using silicon replica technique, which
      will be measured by digital microscope and clinical Performance using modified USPHS scoring
      system of Endo-crowns fabricated from Nano-ceramic Hybrid and Lithium di-silicate ceramic
      materials.

      Primary outcome: Marginal gap of the two groups will be measured using Silicon replica
      technique, Each replica will be sectioned bucco-lingually and mesio-distally into four
      segments named (MB, DB, ML, DL) and each segment has five reference points assigned at
      different positions, An overall of twenty reference points will be measured in each replica
      sample using a digital microscope.

      Secondary outcome:

        -  Internal gap of the two groups will be measured using Silicon replica technique, which
           will be measured by digital microscope.

        -  Clinical Performance of the two groups will be evaluated using modified USPHS scoring
           system. (Color match, Marginal discoloration, Surface texture and Gross fracture)
