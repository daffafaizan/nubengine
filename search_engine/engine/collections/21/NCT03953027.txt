      I. To prospectively estimate the proportion of National Cancer Institute (NCI) Community
      Oncology Research Program (NCORP) community practices that experience a cancer care delivery
      problem attributable to a drug shortage of infusional therapeutic oncology drugs.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To prospectively estimate the rate of cancer care delivery problems attributable to a drug
      shortage of infusional therapeutic oncology drugs for patient populations treated with: a)
      all cancer drugs, b) all cancer drugs in shortage, and c) each individual cancer drug in
      shortage.

      II. To assess strategies practices used during drug shortages (e.g., manage costs, stockpile,
      hire staff).

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess practice factors (e.g., case mix, size, practice type) associated with the
      likelihood that a practice reports cancer care delivery problems.

      II. To describe how practice-level strategies in response to drug shortages vary by practice
      characteristics.

      III. To describe the possible effects on clinical trials (e.g., unable to enroll a patient or
      changing to an alternative treatment).

      IV. To characterize cancer care delivery problems attributable to a shortage of supportive
      care agents.

      V. To characterize cancer care delivery problems attributable to a shortage of oral
      anti-cancer agents.

      OUTLINE: Practice sites complete a Baseline Drug Shortage Survey, Drug Shortage Incident
      Reports in real time as cancer care delivery problems occur, and the Quarterly Follow-Up
      Survey every 3 months for one year (4 total).
