      suspension 1.3%-13.3 mg/mL) when used as a post-excision adjunct to the standard of care
      bupivacaine HCl 0.25% (2.5 mg/mL) with Epinephrine (5mcg/mL), will decrease the patient's
      post-tonsillectomy experience of pain intensity, especially for the first three days after
      surgery, and correspondingly reduce the requirement for pain medications and improve
      outcomes.
