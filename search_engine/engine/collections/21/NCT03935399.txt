      of Aβ and of Aδ fiber sensitivity in injured skin following ultraviolet B (UVB) burned skin.

      For the primary goal - to examine the effects of oxytocin peripheral nerves after tissue
      injury - the investigators chose the controlled ultraviolet sunburn model.

      The investigators propose a randomized, blinded, cross over design with treatment with
      oxytocin one day and placebo on another. Following baseline measures on each of the two study
      days, participants will receive an intramuscular injection of oxytocin (Pitocin®) in its
      indicated dose of 10 IU (17 μg) or an equivalent volume of saline.

      In order to determine the highest frequency that Aβ nerve fibers can respond to, the
      investigators will use a device that produces an oscillatory / vibratory stimulus which can
      be used on the hand.

      Pain threshold to punctate stimulation within the area of irradiation will be determined
      using calibrated von Frey filaments and an up-down sequential method which efficiently
      estimates median thresholds.

      Thermal heat testing will also be performed by the surface of the skin of the forearm or leg
      is heated to 45°C using a computer controlled thermode for a period of 5 minutes.
