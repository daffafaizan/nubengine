      underdiagnosed. Men with KS are more prone to a wide range of diseases including thrombotic
      disorders. Also, neurocognitive function is impaired in KS. The background for the increased
      thrombosis proneness is not understood, and also it is not understood how testosterone
      treatment affects the thrombosis risk in KS. The effects of testosterone treatment on
      neurocognition in KS is also not completely understood. However, it is speculated that
      testosterone treatment at an early point could help improve the overall neurocognitive
      performance.

      In this study 30 males with KS receiving testosterone treatment, 30 males with KS not
      receiving testosterone treatment and 60 matched healthy male controls are included. After
      initial examination including blood testing and neurocognitive testing, the subjects are
      followed for 18 months and examined a second time. After initial examination the group of
      previously untreated KS males will be put on standard testosterone treatment according to
      current guidelines.

      Groups will be compared by measuring and array of markers for coagulation and fibrinolysis,
      including thrombin generation and fibrin structure analysis, to assess the haemostatic
      balance. Also, a wide array of neurocognitive tests and brain fMRI is applied to compare the
      neurocognitive function between the groups.
