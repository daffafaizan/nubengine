      or other infections in burn patients, however, these reports are largely untested. In order
      for incorporation of infection biomarker assessment to become the standard of care,
      validation of these markers in a multi-center prospective study is necessary. As the majority
      of these biomarkers have been chosen because of success in other patient populations, or ease
      of measurement, it is possible that the best biomarkers of infection have not yet been
      discovered in this patient population. Prospective identification and validation of novel
      biomarkers may also improve early identification of infections in burn patients. Early
      treatment of infections and sepsis directly correlated with improved survival and reduced
      costs of care.

      In this prospective, multi-center study, 200 patients from four participating Texas burn
      hospitals will be enrolled from admission to discharge. The clinical research study team will
      collect approximately 11 serum samples and clinical data related to sepsis and infection
      predictors from severely burned adult patients, ages 18-80 years old. All serum samples from
      participating sites will be shipped to the lead site, University of Texas Medical Branch. The
      University of Texas Medical Branch will then validate previously identified biomarkers while
      simultaneously identifying novel biomarkers through discovery proteomics.
