      metabolic syndrome in Tehran, Iran. Phase one of the study is a cross-sectional study, while
      the second phase is a prospective cohort. In phase one of study, the prevalence of any
      metabolic disorder will be estimated in the study population and the association of
      biochemical variables, behavioral and environmental variables with each metabolic disorder
      will be investigated. Afterwards, through the phase two, those with any component of
      metabolic syndrome will be followed to record the incidence of diabetes, vascular
      complications of diabetes, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, (NAFLD), cancers, mortality
      rate and finally estimation of economic burden of metabolic syndrome and its components in
      study population. Participants will be recruited from four health surveillance centers
      located at East, West, North and South of Tehran, the capital city of Iran. The latitude of
      Tehran is 35°41' North, and 51°25' East. Participants will be followed for at least 10 years
      and we plan to extend this time if possible. Anthropometric, biochemical, behavioral and
      meteorological measurements will done on scheduled timeline.
