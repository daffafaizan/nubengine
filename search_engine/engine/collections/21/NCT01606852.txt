      time on mechanical ventilation, can reduce anxiety symptoms better with PCS than their
      caregivers while reducing over-sedation, duration of mechanical ventilation and length of ICU
      stay will require hundreds of subjects enrolled on a multi-day protocol. However,
      patient-controlled sedation has been used in less than 20 patients and only for less than 24
      hours. Therefore this study is designed to:

        1. Establish the feasibility of subject recruitment and protocol adherence in a randomized
           pilot trial that compares patient-controlled sedation (PCS) using dexmedetomidine to
           usual sedation practice in mechanically ventilated patients. Feasibility will be defined
           by: a) number and proportion of patients or proxies who consent to enrollment, b)
           proportion of eligible subjects enrolled on Days 1,2,3,4 etc, of mechanical ventilation,
           c) number of days on protocol, up to five days, that subjects successfully use the PCS
           device, d) ability of ICU nurses to adjust the pump and adhere to the infusion rates of
           the PCS protocol.

        2. Develop and refine the study protocol including: a) improving the proportion of patient
           daily assessments actually completed such as anxiety and delirium scales, b) develop a
           protocol to reliably determine when the subject is not able to self-manage their
           sedation due to weakness, confusion or severe illness; c) create rules for suspending
           PCS therapy and d) develop a post-ICU symptom interview.

        3. Estimate effect sizes on key variables to inform the design of a future randomized trial
           to compare: a) sedative exposure, anxiety levels, and delirium occurrence between
           groups, b) adverse event rates and protocol violations related to the drug, pump or
           both; and c) duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU stay.
