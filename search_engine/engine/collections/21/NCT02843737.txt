      failure. During this last decade, several indicators of sleep fragmentation were introduced
      but none of them seems to take into account the succession of sleep stages. To tackle with
      this problem, The investigators used the Shannon entropy index for modelling sleep stages
      diversity from an hypnogram and for assessing more accurately sleep quality by quantifying
      its fragmentation. The investigators developed a new tool we called Sleep Diversity Index
      (SDI).

      In a retrospective study, the investigators calculated Sleep diversity index for 55 healthy
      subjects and 56 patients with suspected sleep apnea syndrom. Using the receiver operating
      characteristic (ROC) curves the threshold of fragmentation was determined at 20%. If SDI is
      lower than 20%, then sleep is considered as non-fragmented and otherwise, sleep is considered
      as fragmented.

      To validate our SDI it is necessary to compare this diagnosis tool to a "gold standard" based
      on the clinician diagnosis and a mathematical diagnosis index created from objective criteria
      of polysomnography. The investigators propose a multicenter study to validate the SDI as a
      diagnosis tool of sleep fragmentation.
