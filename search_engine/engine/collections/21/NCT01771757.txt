      volunteers under conditions of controlled, reduced ambient and oxygen partial pressure in the
      pressure chamber of the Aeromedical Institute FAI in DÃ¼bendorf, Switzerland. Obtaining
      evidence of the adaptation behavior of the retinal vascular system in controlled, short-term
      hypoxic changes.
