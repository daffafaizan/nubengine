      overweight/obese children. Since there appears to be a diet-by-microbiota interaction for
      optimal effects on adiposity, it will be important to administer the probiotics within the
      context of increased fruit/vegetable (F/V) intake and decreased fat intake. Because changes
      in diet alone can also induce changes in the gut microbiota, this study will use a
      double-blind, randomized, placebo-control design to determine whether changes in gut
      microbiota are greater with the addition of probiotics (High F/V diet + Probiotics) compared
      to diet alone (High F/V diet + Placebo). The primary aim is to test the effect of these 2
      arms on changing the gut microbiota, fat mass, and inflammation in children. The study will
      also examine the acceptability of taking probiotics and changes in other physiologic
      measures.

      The Specific aims of this proposal are:

        1. To examine the effect of diet high in F/V +/- probiotics on change in gut microbiota,
           adiposity, and inflammation (measured by C-reactive protein, TNF-a, and IL-6);

        2. To examine the effect of diet high in F/V +/- probiotics on physiologic measures
           including blood pressure, fasting insulin and glucose, and adiponectin;

        3. To determine the acceptability and feasibility of taking daily probiotics over a 12 week
           period.
