    
      AIS-A02 is a Phase 1b open-label study of ALPN-101 administered to adult subjects with
      steroid-resistant or steroid-refractory acute graft versus host disease (aGVHD).

      It will be conducted at approximately 10 US sites. Up to 72 subjects will be enrolled in Part
      A (dose escalation) and up to 25 subjects will be enrolled in Part B (dose expansion).

      In each Part, safety and efficacy assessments will be performed throughout the dosing and
      follow-up periods, and multiple PK and PD samples will be collected.
