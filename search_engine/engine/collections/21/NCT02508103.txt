    
      Purpose: The primary objective of this pilot study is to use functional neuroimaging
      techniques to begin to identify the central brain networks that may contribute to impairment
      in emotion regulation, interpersonal relationships, and marital and family function in women
      with premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), particularly for those women who also have a
      history of early life abuse (ELA).

      Based on the evidence that the mammalian neuropeptide oxytocin (OT), best known for its role
      in lactation and parturition, plays a seminal role in social affiliation, emotion regulation,
      attachment, maternal behavior, trust, and protection against stress; and because OT neural
      pathways and receptors are prominently expressed in brain regions involved in emotion
      regulation and maternal/affiliative behavior; the study will: 1) use intranasal OT
      administration as a probe to assess whether it modifies activation of brain regions involved
      in emotion regulation in response to an emotional processing task; and 2) whether daily
      intranasal OT administration during the premenstrual phase improves symptoms in women with
      PMDD with or without a history of ELA.
