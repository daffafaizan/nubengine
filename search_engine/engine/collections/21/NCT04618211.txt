      of PHA-022121 at the study center to assess pharmacokinetics (the way the body absorbs,
      distributes, and gets rid of the drug) and safety. In Part II of the study, patients
      self-administer blinded study drug at home to treat three HAE attacks with PHA-022121 or
      placebo (cross-over).
