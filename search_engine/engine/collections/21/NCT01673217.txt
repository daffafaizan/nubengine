      I. To determine the safety of 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (decitabine) in combination with
      immunization with NYESO-I protein mixed with montanide and granulocyte-macrophage colony
      stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in patients scheduled to receive liposomal doxorubicin for
      recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal carcinoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate NY-ESO-l specific cellular and humoral immunity by determination of NY-ESO-I
      specific antibody, CD8+ and CD4+ T-cells following immunization with NY-ESO-l protein mixed
      with montanide and GM-CSF in combination with 5-aza-2' -deoxycytidine (decitabine) in
      patients receiving liposomal doxorubicin for recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or
      primary peritoneal carcinoma.

      II. To determine the impact of 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine on NY-ESO-I specific expression,
      NY-ESO-l promoter methylation, and global DNA methylation.

      III. To compare the time to progression (ttp) for the proposed therapy with the ttp for
      standard therapy (historical studies).

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of decitabine.

      Patients receive decitabine intravenously (IV) over 3 hours on day 1, pegylated liposomal
      doxorubicin hydrochloride IV on day 8, and NY-ESO-1 peptide vaccine emulsified in incomplete
      Freund's adjuvant and sargramostim subcutaneously on day 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days
      for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 6 months.
