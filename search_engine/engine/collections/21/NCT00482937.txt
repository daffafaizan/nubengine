      an open-label study in cohorts of four (4) subjects (entered two subjects at a time) with the
      primary objective of establishing the safety of CD-NP. The second phase, "MTD confirmation
      phase", will be conducted under randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled conditions in a
      larger cohort of subjects (10 subjects). The primary objective of this phase will be to
      confirm the safety and pharmacodynamic findings at the apparent MTD.

      Secondary objectives include evaluation of the effect of CD-NP on: mean arterial pressure
      (MAP), heart rate (HR), urinary sodium and potassium excretion (UNaV and UKV, respectively),
      urinary flow rate (UV), and creatinine clearance. Plasma concentrations of CD-NP, angiotensin
      II, and aldosterone, and the urinary excretion rates of cGMP and CD-NP will also be
      determined.
