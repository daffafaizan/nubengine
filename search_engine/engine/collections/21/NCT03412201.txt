    
      STRONG-HF is a multicenter, randomized, parallel group study designed to evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of up-titration of standard of care medical therapy including
      beta-blockers; angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi), angiotensin receptor blocker
      (ARB) or angiotensin receptor neprolysin inhibitor (ARNi); and mineralocorticoid receptor
      antagonist (MRAs), on morbidity and mortality when initiated and up-titrated early during
      hospitalization for acute heart failure (AHF). Optimal safety conditions will allow
      physicians to introduce and/or continue oral HF therapies during this "vulnerable phase" in
      AHF patients. Patients admitted for AHF with clinical signs of congestion and elevated
      circulating N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and who are not treated
      with optimal doses of oral heart failure (HF) therapies within 2 days before hospital
      discharge for AHF and who are hemodynamically stable will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to
      either usual care (named "usual care" arm) or intensification of treatment with
      beta-blockers, and ACEi (or ARB) or ARNi and a MRA (named "high intensity care" arm). In the
      latter arm, repeated assessments of clinical signs and symptoms of heart failure, routine
      clinical laboratory measures including potassium, sodium, and creatinine as well as NT-ProBNP
      will foster, encourage and ensure the safety of the optimization of oral heart failure
      therapies. AHF patients who were screened but did not meet inclusion criteria, including low
      circulating NT-proBNP at visit 2, will be followed for 90-day outcome. Randomized patients
      will be contacted at 180 days to assess outcomes.
