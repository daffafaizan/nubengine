      (docosahexaenoic acid) of the omega-3 series and AA (arachidonic acid) of the omega-6 series
      are building blocks of all cell membranes and are found in high concentrations in retina and
      brain. Food sources of LA and ALA are vegetable oils, nuts and seeds. Since low conversion
      rates from ALA to DHA are a characteristic of human metabolism, adequate dietary provision
      with the long-chained omega-3 molecules depends primarily on individual eating habits. While
      AA is abundant in meat and dairy products, EPA and DHA are found in noteworthy concentrations
      only in certain species of fatty fish, such as salmon or mackerel.

      The study investigates whether participants receiving an omega-3 supplement over a period of
      4 month, perform better on a series of cognitive tests, than the participants allocated to
      the placebo group.
