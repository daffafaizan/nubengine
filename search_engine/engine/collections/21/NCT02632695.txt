      leg ulcers. The aims are to compare two versions, one of which is enhanced (FOOTFIT+), to
      determine which has the greatest impact on physical activity adherence, patient-provider
      communication, and leg function. FOOTFIT and FOOTFIT+ share three components: 1) a low-cost,
      tri-axial BluetoothÂ® enabled highly sensitive accelerometer and tracking device (BEAT) worn
      on the foot during, 2) phased conditioning activities for lower leg function (CALF) tracked
      by a, 3) Smartphone that captures signals from BEAT, provides motivational messages, CALF
      instruction, and automated feedback on progress. Forty patients will be targeted in this
      six-week study, 20 of which will receive FOOTFIT and 20 FOOTFIT+.
