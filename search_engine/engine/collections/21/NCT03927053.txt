      discover evidence that provides the basis for understanding the complex and at times
      conflicting roles for marijuana in chronic inflammation in HIV-infected youth. To achieve the
      goal, a systems biology approach with two aims is designed:

      Aim 1. To identify inflammatory immune pathways perturbed by recreational marijuana with or
      without concomitant use of tobacco products by applying a deep sequencing approach to define
      global transcriptome of peripheral blood cells from HIV-infected virally suppressed youth.

      Aim 2. To develop biomarker profiles associated with pro- or anti-inflammatory pathways
      perturbed by marijuana and to discover biomarker profiles linked to neurocognitive impairment
      that are impacted by marijuana and tobacco use by YWH
