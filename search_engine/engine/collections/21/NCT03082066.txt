    
      Retrospective observational single centre study: Soft tissue and bone diameters are assessed
      in MRI and CT scans of patients. Data is compared with recommendations of intraosseus needle
      producers to assess whether the information provided by the producers can be optimised. Study
      sites are head of humerus bone, distal femur, proximal and distal tibia in accordance with
      recommended intraosseus access sites. Data is gathered from patients who undergo either MRI
      or CT scanning for any disease and where bone at the IO puncture site is accessible for
      measurements required for this study.

      Primary and secondary outcome parameters will be assessed at one time only, i.e. when the
      patient has received MRI or CT scan for the diagnostic work up of their primary disease. Data
      collection for a given patient in this study can be completed within one session, e.g. 5-10
      minutes. No additional investigation is required for this
