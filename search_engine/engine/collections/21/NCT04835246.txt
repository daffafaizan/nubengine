      IMDx system in detection of gastric cancer and precancerous lesions in subjects with
      suspected gastric intraepithelial neoplasia who are undergoing upper gastrointestinal
      endoscopic procedures.

      The Spectra IMDx system comprises a laser system, a spectrometer, a computer with an analysis
      algorithm installed, and other ancillary parts. The Spectra IMDx system also comprises a
      Raman probe that can be connected with the main system. The Raman probe is an assembly of
      optical fibres and optical components arranged for maximal transmission of light energy. When
      in use, the laser system will emit a 785nm near infra-red laser that will be transmitted
      through the Raman probe to the distal end. When the laser is interrogated upon a tissue
      surface, the light energy is absorbed and reflected. The reflected energy is then collected
      from the distal end of the Raman probe, transmitted back to the main system, and passed
      through the spectrometer. The collected signal is then processed to obtain the clean Raman
      signal, which is then parsed through the analysis algorithm to evaluate its risk for cancer
      (high/low). Feedback will then be generated on the GUI in real time.
