      States. In the knee it can cause severe pain, reduced functionality and increased stiffness
      thus, a treatment that would reduce pain, increase function and reduce stiffness would be of
      benefit to many people.

      This study will collect and disassociate adipose tissue and inject the stromal vascular
      fraction into the knee of the same patient. The study is controlled, randomized and
      double-blinded with 2 SVF treatments (high and low dose) and a placebo control.
