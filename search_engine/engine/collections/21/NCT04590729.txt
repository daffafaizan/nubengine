      Each participant will undergo the three conditions in a random order. The first protocol
      involves 3 minutes of cycling on a stationary bike at moderate intensity every 30 minutes for
      6 hours, totaling 36 minutes of cycling exercise. The second protocol involves 3 minutes of
      cycling on a stationary bike at moderate intensity every 15 minutes for 3 hours to match the
      total exercise duration in the first protocol. Participants will remain seated for 3 hours to
      match to the total time spent in the lab. For the control condition, participants will remain
      seated. For each condition, participants will be provided with two meals, one before the
      protocol and another one in the middle of the protocol. The meals will be purchased from the
      cafeteria on campus based on the participant's own choice as long as carbohydrates account
      for 55-65% of total calories. Participants will eat identical meals across the three
      conditions.
