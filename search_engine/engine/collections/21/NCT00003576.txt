        -  Compare the complete response rate, disease-free survival, and overall survival of
           patients with resectable (nonmetastatic) stage III or IV squamous cell cancer of the
           head and neck treated with surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy versus concurrent
           chemo-radiotherapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified according to primary site of
      disease (oral cavity/oropharynx vs larynx/hypopharynx vs others) and nodal status (node
      negative vs positive).

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo resection of the tumor, followed no more than 6 weeks later by
           radiotherapy to the primary tumor and upper neck once a day, 5 days a week, for 6 weeks.

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo radiotherapy in addition to chemotherapy with fluorouracil and
           cisplatin. Radiotherapy is given once a day, 5 days a week, for 6.5 weeks to the primary
           tumor and upper neck. Fluorouracil and cisplatin are administered by continuous infusion
           for 4 days beginning on day 1 of the first week of radiotherapy. A second course of
           fluorouracil and cisplatin is given on day 28.

      Patients who have failed or are suspected to have failed chemo-radiotherapy should be
      considered for salvage surgery.

      Patients are followed once a month for the first year, every 2 months for the second year,
      every 3 months for the third year, and every 6 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 200 patients will be accrued over a 4-5 year period.
