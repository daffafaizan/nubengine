      as corticosteroids and platelet rich plasma. These injectables work by positively affecting
      cartilage cells, also known as chondrocytes, and the cells of the joint lining tissue, also
      known as synoviocytes. Platelet rich plasma is an autologous derived blood product, i.e. a
      joint injectable made from the patient's own blood at the time and location of injection with
      simple blood centrifugation. Studies in the bench-top laboratory setting have provided
      in-vitro evidence that platelet rich plasma decreases synoviocyte production of metallometal
      proteases, an inflammatory protein with negative effects on cartilage and decreases the
      effects of inflammatory proteins.
