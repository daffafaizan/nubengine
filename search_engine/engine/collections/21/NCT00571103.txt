      gambling (PG), it is reasonable to ask whether acamprosate (calcium acetylhomotaurine;
      Campral), also FDA approved for the treatment of alcoholism, can be used effectively to treat
      PG. Acamprosate is not an opioid antagonist; rather, it is assumed that its therapeutic
      effects are due to actions on GABA receptors. Acamprosate is structurally related to
      1-glutamic, which is an excitatory neurotransmitter. It has been proposed that acamprosate
      decreases the effects of the naturally-occuring excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate in the
      body. Because chronic alcohol consumption disrupts this system, and the changes last many
      months after alcohol ingestion is stopped, it is possible that acamprosate restores the
      glutamate system towards normal. Regardless, acamprosate decreases the pleasant "high"
      associated with alcohol consumption, and thus decreases the frequency of relapse during
      abstinence. We hypothesize that acamprosate will have similar actions in persons with PG.
