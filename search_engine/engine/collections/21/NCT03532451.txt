    
      Bladder cancer (BC) is the 6th most common malignancy in the United States with an estimated
      79,030 new cases and 16,870 deaths in 2017. It is the 4th most common cancer in men and there
      are presently >500,000 BC patients alive in the US. It accounts for about 5% of all new
      cancers in the US. It is also the most expensive cancer to treat from diagnosis to death.
      Almost a third of BC patients present with MIBC.

      This is a Phase Ib open-label clinical trial for patients that are either
      cisplatin-ineligible or refuse cisplatin-based chemotherapy and have MIBC (T2-T4a, N0-N1,
      M0).Neoadjuvant treatment must start within 10 weeks of transurethral resection of the most
      recent transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) that showed muscularis propria
      invasion.

      Patients must have sufficient baseline tumor tissue. Tumor tissue content for CD8+ T-cell
      density assessment must be qualified as sufficient (â‰¥ 20% tumor content in the specimen) for
      analysis and must be documented by the local pathologist prior to registration.

      The first 12 patients will be enrolled into Cohort 1 and treated with nivolumab before a
      planned RC (Completed November 20, 2019).

      In the absence of the occurrence of high rate of treatment related Adverse Events (AEs) with
      nivolumab, the study will proceed with enrollment into Cohort 2 with the combination of
      nivolumab/lirilumab before a planned RC.

      Each group will receive a total of 2 doses (week 0 and 4) of nivolumab (Cohort 1) or
      nivolumab/lirilumab (Cohort 2) therapy followed by RC with bilateral (standard or extended)
      pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND).

      Mandatory tumor tissue at Screening (archived tumor tissue from Transurethral Resection of
      Bladder Tumor [TURBT] may be used) and at time of RC. Peripheral blood and urine samples are
      also required.
