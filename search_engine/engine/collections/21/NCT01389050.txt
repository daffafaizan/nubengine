      anatomical located deep within the abdominal area and thus pose challenges to surgical and
      radiotherapeutic management of the patient. As a result, the local control and overall
      survival for patients with retroperitoneal sarcomas (RPS) are worse than STS from the
      extremities. Current treatment strategy involves pre-operative radiotherapy followed by
      surgery. Use of intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) in RPS had allowed for more conformal
      treatments with the aim of sparing normal tissues from high doses of irradiation. Yet the
      accuracy and coverage of IMRT depend highly on target motion, and little is known about the
      motion of RPS during the course of radiotherapy. As well, RPS are commonly in close proximity
      to sensitive organs for which the long-term toxicity and effect on quality of life secondary
      to radiation is unknown. The current study seeks to evaluate the extent of tumor motion
      during radiotherapy and the impact of radiotherapy to patient toxicity and quality of life.
      At the conclusion of this study, our results will hopefully identify the optimum PTV, the
      importance of different normal tissues and their dose-volume constraints, the role of image
      guidance, and the potential for dose escalation in the treatment of RPS.
