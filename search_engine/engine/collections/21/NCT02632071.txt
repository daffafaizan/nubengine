      women. Women with hormone receptor-negative tumors that are associated with symptomatic
      visceral metastases, or hormone receptor-positive tumors that are refractory to endocrine
      therapy require cytotoxic chemotherapy for disease control. The standard of care for patients
      with metastatic breast cancer includes single agent taxane-based chemotherapy. Combination
      chemotherapy generally provides higher rates of objective response and longer time to
      progression, compared to single-agent chemotherapy. However, it is associated with increased
      toxicity and is of little survival benefit. There remains an unmet need for combination
      regimens incorporating new, effective and oftentimes less toxic targeted agents together with
      standard chemotherapy.
