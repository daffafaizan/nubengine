    
      The proposed study is a randomized, single-blind, crossover trial, it will be conducted at
      the Richardson Centre for Functional Food and Nutraceuticals (RCFFN), University of Manitoba.
      The study design will consist of 4 phases with 30 days per phase, each phase will be
      separated by 4-week washout periods. Participants will consume a recommended
      weight-maintaining diet (35% energy from fat, 50% carbohydrate, 15% protein) supplemented
      with the following novel Muffin and cookies: (a) control food containing butter, sunflower
      and safflower oil comprised largely of saturated fat with substantial levels of n-6 linoleic
      acid, and refined wheat flour common to current North American intakes, (b) food containing
      high oleic canola oil and docosahexaenoic acid (HOCO-DHA) and refined wheat flour, (c) food
      containing high molecular weight barley B-glucan and a combination of sunflower, safflower
      oil and butter, (d) food containing combination of HOCO-DHA and high molecular weight barley
      Î²-glucan. Treatments will be isocalorically incorporated into muffin and cookies consumed in
      equal parts at breakfast and supper.
