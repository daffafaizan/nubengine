    
      This is a multicenter (study conducted at multiple sites), randomized (the study medication
      is assigned by chance), double-blind (neither investigator nor the patient knows the
      treatment that the patient receives), placebo-controlled (an inactive substance that is
      compared with the study medication to test whether the study medication has a real effect in
      clinical study), dose-ranging study (study carried out at different doses) to evaluate the
      analgesic efficacy, safety, and tolerability of multiple doses of JNJ-42160443 in patients
      with neuropathic pain, followed by a double-blind safety extension and an open-label (all
      people know the identity of the intervention) safety extension. The study will consist of 5
      sequential phases: 1) screening, 2) a 12-week double-blind efficacy, 3) a 40-week
      double-blind safety extension, 4) a 52-week open-label safety extension, and 5) a 26-week
      post-treatment/follow-up. After the screening phase, patient randomization will be stratified
      by current pain medication use (patients who are currently using or who are not currently
      using permitted pain medication). The planned doses for the double-blind efficacy phase and
      double blind safety extension phase are placebo, JNJ-42160443 1, 3, or 10 mg administered as
      a single, subcutaneous injection every 28 days. Safety assessment will include adverse
      events, injection site evaluations, clinical laboratory tests, electrocardiogram, vital
      signs, physical examinations, neurological examinations, and joint safety which will be
      monitored throughout the study. The total study duration (including all the 5 phases) will be
      approximately 131 weeks.
