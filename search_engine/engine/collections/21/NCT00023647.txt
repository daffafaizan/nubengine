      DNA vaccine in patients with stage IV melanoma. II. Determine the immune response of patients
      treated with this vaccine. III. Determine the clinical response of patients treated with this
      vaccine.

      OUTLINE: This is dose-escalation, multicenter study. Patients receive Synchrotope TA2M
      plasmid DNA vaccine intranodally continuously over 96 hours beginning on days 0, 14, 28, and
      42. Treatment continues for up to 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 8 patients receive escalating doses of Synchrotope TA2M
      plasmid DNA vaccine until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined
      as the dose at which no more than 2 of 8 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 16-24 patients will be accrued for this study within 12
      months.
