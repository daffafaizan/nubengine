      decisions that involve ambiguity through the use of self-report and behavioral measures.
      Specifically, the investigators will examine how individuals with OCD minimize risk at the
      expense of monetary profit under conditions of ambiguity (relative to risky but unambiguous
      options) compared to non-psychiatric controls utilizing a series of judgment and
      decision-making (JDM) tasks.
