      a low volume bowel preparation, and if the time of dosing (single dose night before vs split
      dose) of the bowel preparation results in better bowel cleansing in participants undergoing
      colonoscopy. Eligible participants undergoing colonoscopy with conscious sedation will be
      randomly assigned to one of two bowel preparations and one of two dosing schemas of bowel
      preparation. Participants not eligible for conscious sedation and are undergoing colonoscopy
      with general anesthesia will be randomized only to the single dose arms of the study.
      Participants will complete a questionnaire while drinking the bowel preparation to determine
      timing and tolerability of the bowel preparation.
