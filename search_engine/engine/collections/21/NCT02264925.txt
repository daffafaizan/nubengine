      4% in the general population. Although several medications (primidone, beta-adrenergic
      blockers, benzodiazepinesâ€¦) are commonly used, few of them are truly effective for
      controlling the severe forms of ET. Since 1987, an alternative has emerged with the
      development of high frequency deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the thalamic nucleus ventralis
      intermedius (VIM). This surgical technique now represents the gold standard treatment for
      tremor-disabled ET patients. Although VIM-DBS is clearly effective for treatment of essential
      tremor (ET) a partial loss of DBS effectiveness may occur over time in some patients. This
      loss of DBS effectiveness could be related to an adaptation of the local neuronal network to
      chronic stimulation (changes in synaptic plasticity). In order to avoid this problem,
      investigators plan to develop a intermittent mode of VIM stimulation using a new Medtronic
      device combining a DBS system with local field potential (LFPs) sensing capability. First,
      investigators propose to analyse VIM LFPs in order to define a tremor biomarker in 10
      patients operated for severe ET. Thereafter, investigators will automatically detect this
      biomarker using a specific algorithm and use it to trigger stimulation at the onset of tremor
      only. Thus, this project will allow us to optimize DBS therapy in ET, by improving the
      longevity of implantable devices and avoiding the loss of efficacy previously reported
