      anti-inflammatory properties, revealed that this drug improves insulin sensitivity, mediated
      by the reversal of chronic subclinical inflammation. Amongst the numerous pathogenetic
      factors, oxidative stress and apoptosis of hepatocytes initiate many inflammatory processes
      and are involved in the progression of Non alcoholic fatty liver disease.

      Aims:The aim is to evaluate the effect of treatment with diacerein in improvement of glycemic
      parameters (mean glycated hemoglobin, fasting blood sugar) and reduction of liver fat
      fraction.

      Methods:Two-hundred patients will be randomly allocated either to treatment with diacerein
      plus their usual therapeutic regimen or to placebo for 24 months. Clinic, laboratory
      evaluation (including glycated hemoglobin, fasting blood sugar, creatinine, ferritin,
      aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), g-glutamyl transpeptidase,
      alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, albumin, prothrombin time, platelet count, total
      cholesterol, high-density and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides and
      urinary albumin excretion rate no 24-hour urine collection) will be performed before and
      every 3 months until the end of study. Pro-Inflammatory cytokines, adiponectin and
      cytokeratin-18 were measured before, at 12 months and at the end of study. Liver fat fraction
      measurement using controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) by transient elastography.
      (Fibroscan) will be performed before and after the 12 and 24-month treatment, with the
      observers blinded to the allocation group.
