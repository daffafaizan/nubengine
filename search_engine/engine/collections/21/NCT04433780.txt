      safety of of Doravirine (DOR) in combination with Lamivudine (3TC) and Tenofovir Disoproxil
      Fumarate (TDF) administered over 48 weeks in women of reproductive potential living with
      HIV-1 switched from Efavirenz or Dolutegravir-based antiretroviral therapy. The metabolic and
      neuropsychiatric outcomes among women (and their infants) in a representative African female
      population of reproductive potential will be investigated.

      Approximately 100 women aged between 18 and 49 years old will be administered a once-daily,
      fixed-dose combination of doravirine 100 mg, lamivudine 300 mg, and tenofovir disoproxil
      fumarate 300 mg (DOR/3TC/TDF). The study includes screening and baseline visits, 4 study
      visits from Week 4 to Week 36, and an end of study visit at Week 48.
