      types. While quadriceps tendon has been investigated a fewer times. And to our knowledge
      there is no control study that compare quadriceps tendon-patellar bone autograft with
      Quadriceps Autograft and Hamstring Autograft as control randomized study.

      All of the patients will be examined before of the surgery and 3, 6, 12, 24 months after the
      surgery to compare the outcome of differnt graft types. While a secand aim of this study is
      to examen the effect of rehabilitation protocol on the short and long term within all of the
      clinical and the functional outcomes.

      The rehabilitation protocol will contain one phase before the surgery and four phases after
      the surgery.The goal of the first phase will be pain and inflammation control, increase ROM
      and muscle strength will be during the second and the third phases.In the last phase all of
      the players have to achieve maximum muscle strength and neuromuscular control.
