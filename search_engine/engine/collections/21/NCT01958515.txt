      natural history of any immunologic response in HPV-associated OPSCC, the timing of the
      venipunctures reflect the goal to sample throughout the course of CTRT (chemoradiation
      therapy)and will permit some variability based on the number of radiation fractions
      delivered. It also reflects considerations of time points that lend themselves to both the
      venipuncture and tumour biopsy based on the toxicity and response profile of the
      chemoradiation in the HPV-associated OPSCC patient. As such, 10 subjects with HPV-associated
      OPSCC and 10 subjects with non-HPV associated HNSCC seen by the respective disciplines of
      otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, radiation oncology, or medical oncology as clinically
      indicated will be enrolled on this clinical protocol. Importantly, clinical therapeutic
      recommendations, radiation treatment plans, and therapeutic drugs will not be altered by
      enrollment in this protocol. Tumors which are directly visible through in office
      laryngopharyngoscopy and easily accessible (i.e. oropharyngeal tonsil) will be directly
      biopsied (non-percutaneously) and analyzed as detailed below.
