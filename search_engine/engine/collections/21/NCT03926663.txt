      nasal surgery by using local anesthesia.The combination of local anesthetic infiltration,
      directly in the surgical field, with general anesthesia provides beneficial analgesic effects
      by blocking nociceptive pathways, and there by it reduces the need for systemic analgesics.

      The use of α-2 Adrenergic receptor (adrenoceptor) agonists in anesthesia were the focus of
      interest for their sedative, analgesic, and perioperative sympatholytic and cardiovascular
      stabilizing effects with reduced anesthetic requirements. α-2 agonists, inhibit substance P
      release in the nociceptive pathway at the level of the dorsal root neuron; in addition, α-2
      adrenergic receptors located at nerve endings may have a role in the analgesic effect of the
      drug by preventing norepinephrine release.

      In this study, the combined effects of dexmedetomidine with bupivacaine as local anesthetics
      vs bupivacaine, will be investigated in septoplasty to determine the need for rescue drugs as
      propanlol and nitroglycerine, as hypotensive agents,for bloodless surgical field and optimal
      procedure for pain control
