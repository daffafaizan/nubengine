      one of the most common manifestations of it . On the other hand, there is evidence that
      vitamin D and its analogs have known immunosuppressant properties and profound effects on
      glomerular mesangial cell proliferation. Moreover much literature such as animal studies
      suggests it as a therapeutic intervention in autoimmune disease. The investigators plan to
      conduct a double blind randomized control clinical trial to study effects of calcitriol on
      progress and activity of lupus nephritis. Fifty patients with clinically quiescent SLE and
      biopsy-proven glomerulonephritis will be recruited. They will be treated with calcitriol for
      1 year. Proteinuria, renal function, lupus disease activity, serum inflammatory markers will
      be monitored.
