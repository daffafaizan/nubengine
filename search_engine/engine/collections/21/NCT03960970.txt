      and scheduled cesarean deliveries account for at least 40% of all cesarean deliveries every
      year. A significant decrease in cesarean delivery associated maternal morbidity has been
      achieved with preoperative prophylactic single-dose cephalosporin given within 60 minutes of
      skin incision. Also, on laboring patients and/or with rupture of membranes, several studies
      suggest that adding azithromycin to standard cephalosporin prophylaxis is not only
      cost-effective but reduces overall rates of endometritis and wound infection. Azithromycin
      provides effective coverage against Ureaplasma, commonly associated with increased rates of
      endometritis. Although two-drug regimen has been suggested for laboring and/or patients that
      undergo cesarean delivery, no studies have investigated the potential benefits of two-drug
      regimen in non-laboring patients. No increase in neonatal morbidity was noted with adjunctive
      azithromycin prophylaxis, including adverse events.
