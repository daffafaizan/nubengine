    
      Randomized, controlled pilot study with a convenience sample of 45 adult cardiac surgical
      patients. The main intervention to be studied will be the use of a neurocognitive training
      program (Lumosity) for 10 days preoperatively, and then for four weeks postoperatively. The
      prescribed regimen of training will focus on the areas of cognitive function most commonly
      affected in the postoperative period, including working memory, attention, and processing
      speed. Patients in the control arm will undergo current standard cardiac surgical
      postoperative care and will be asked to refrain from obtaining a Lumosity account.
