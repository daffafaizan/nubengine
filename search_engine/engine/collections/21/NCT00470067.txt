      Primary

        -  Estimate the response rate in patients with recurrent or stage III or IV primary
           endometrial carcinoma treated with doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome and carboplatin.

      Secondary

        -  Determine progression-free survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome IV over 1 hour on day 1 and carboplatin
      IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 8 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 6 months and then every 3
      months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 37 patients will be accrued for this study.
