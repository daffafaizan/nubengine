    
      This is a placebo condition controlled double blind randomized prospective study where the
      study team plan to acquire clinical, neurocognitive and imaging data in schizophrenia
      patients and healthy controls. Those who are eligible for the study will be consented, and
      will be randomized into either group A or B. The length of the study is four weeks. Subjects
      in both groups will undergo the same procedure, except that while subjects from group A
      unbeknownst to them will receive only a sham stimulation of tDCS (placebo condition), the
      subjects from group B will receive real tDCS stimulation. Real tDCS stimulation will involve
      ten 20 minute stimulations daily (at 2 mA anode over the left DLPFC while cathode over the
      right suborbital region) on 5 weekdays of two consecutive weeks, while sham will contain 20
      minute sessions as well, but only the first minute will be with 2mA, then unbeknownst to the
      subject, the unblinded research assistant will turn off the stimulation. The subjects will be
      told that they can be given either a sham or real stimulation and will be asked at the end of
      the experiment to fill out a visual analog scale indicating their guess about being in the
      real or sham arm. Following the first two weeks of the study, there will be a follow up
      period of two weeks when no stimulation or sham will be administered. Subjects, raters,
      clinicians and most of the research persons will all be kept blind in regards to their
      placebo or stimulation status until the end of the study. Research persons analyzing
      neuroimgaing data will break blindness after subject leaves the study, to continuously
      monitor neuroimaging findings.
