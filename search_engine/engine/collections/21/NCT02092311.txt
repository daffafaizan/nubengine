      treatment of varicocele. Most of them were diagnosed after being evaluated for infertility.

      All of them were operated by a single experienced and expert microscopic surgeon.

      Informed consent is received from all of the possible candidates in accordance to national
      and Declaration of Helsinki guidelines.

      Selection of patients for undergoing Combined varicocelectomy was done during the operation
      due to the nature of including criteria.

      In this method after making an incision at inguinal level, veins are evaluated and if the
      including criteria is existed, only external spermatic vein is ligated at the depth of the
      inguinal canal and other veins are left alone for prevention of damage to the artery. Then
      another mini incision is made at high inguinal level and the rest of surgery is conducted by
      retroperitoneal approach.

      The incidence rate of major complications (recurrence, testicular atrophy, hydrocele) of
      experimental group is compared to the incidence rate of the same complications of the
      patients in control group that were operated with currently common inguinal and subinguinal
      microscopic varicocelectomy accompanied by testicular delivery, an approach that is suggested
      by Goldstein and associates.

      The study hypothesis is that using this method will lead to less major complications
      including recurrence, hydrocele and also less incidental injuries to the arteries that will
      result to less testicular atrophy.
