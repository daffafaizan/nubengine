    
      Prospective randomized, controlled, investigator-initiated trial which consists of two
      specific consecutive(overlapped) phases:

      "Morbidity trial" (APAF-CRT morbidity). Small size (280 pts), follow-up 24 months. Primary
      endpoint: combined of mortality due to heartfailure, hospitalization for heart failure or
      atrial fibrillation or worsening heart failure. Predefined subgroup analysis for patients
      with ejection fraction ≤35% versus >35%

      "Mortality trial" (APAF-CRT mortality). Large size (pts included in morbidity trial plus
      additional ~1500 pts, long-term follow-up (at least 4 years). Primary endpoint: total
      mortality. Predefined subgroup analysis for patients with ejection fraction ≤35% versus >35%
