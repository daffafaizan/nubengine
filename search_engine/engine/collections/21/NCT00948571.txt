      prone horizontal or head tilted down (40Â°) position. Half of the patients with head down
      position will have surgery in laparoscopic technique (including gas insufflation to achieve a
      pneumoperitoneum). Measurements are performed on the day prior to surgery, on the morning of
      surgery, 30 - 45 minutes, 2 hours, and 24 hours after extubation.
