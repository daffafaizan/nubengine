      anesthesia and for use as adjunct to other anesthetics. Intravenous ketamine is being
      developed and tested for the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

      All subjects will be administered the study medication by the study anesthesiologists and
      under the direct supervision of the investigator or designee. On all dosing days, all
      subjects must remain at the clinical site until at least 4 hours post-dose (or longer if
      required for study procedures) and will be accompanied by a responsible adult when discharged
      from the clinical site. The end of study will occur when the last subject in the trial
      completes his/her last study assessment.
