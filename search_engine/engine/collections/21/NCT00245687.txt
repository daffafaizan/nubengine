      of infections and a reduced hospital stay, however it is controversial whether enteral
      feeding via small bowel feeding tubes offers an advantage over gastric feeding tubes in terms
      of reducing aspiration risk, improving feeding tolerance or ensuring quicker attainment of
      nutritional goals. The advantages of a small bowel feeding tube over a gastric feeding tube
      is thought to be related to its post pyloric position, however the insertion of small bowel
      feeding tubes is technically challenging (most studies report a success rate of 15-30%), can
      take time and has complications not unlike those of the gastric feeding tube. Our hypothesis
      is that the small bowel feeding tube offers an advantage to the gastric feeding tube due to
      its ability to achieve post pyloric placement. Specifically we chose to compare the standard
      gastric feeding tube (Dubhoff) to a small bowel feeding tube which offers the advantage of
      having alternating flaps which allows the gut to drag this tube into the small bowel.
