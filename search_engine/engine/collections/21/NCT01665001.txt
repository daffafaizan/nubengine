      protocol attempts have been made to individualize treatment. In particular, stratification to
      high and standard risk group was based on both conventional clinical criteria and the level
      of MRD after induction and consolidation. Patients with unsatisfactory response were referred
      for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT). Interim analysis showed
      significant improvement compared to previous PALG 4-2002 protocol with regard to both overall
      survival and leukemia-free survival. The reasons of failure were relapses and non-relapse
      mortality (NRM) associated with alloHSCT.

      In the current protocol we intend to further adjust the therapy for individual patients
      needs. We assume that this way we will be able to reduce the risk of relapse and NRM and
      improve the cure rate. All patients will receive multiagent induction and consolidation
      chemotherapy. The type and intensity of the therapy, as well as indications for allogeneic
      and autologous HSCT will depend on age, status of MRD, immunophenotype and the presence of
      BCR/ABL fusion gene.
