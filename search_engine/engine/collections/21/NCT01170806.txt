      Obesity is a chronic condition, associated with premature death, co-morbidities, risk factors
      for main cardiac disease, stigmatization and significant economic costs. The causes of
      obesity are complex and include the interplay of environmental, social, economic and genetic
      factors. Besides fat-rich diets also play a significant role in the etiology of obesity.
      Correct diet orientation associated with physical exercise usually did not lead to expected
      result in weight loss and maintenance. Pharmacological therapy has been proposed as an
      adjunct to achieve the ideal weight. Orlistat acts in reduction of lipids absorption by
      inhibition of gastric and pancreatic lipases in gastrointestinal tract leading to sustained
      weight loss. This is a double blind study, randomized, of 2 weeks. The aim of this study was
      evaluate the intestinal lipase blockade by decrease of fat absorption of fecal fat after
      treatment with two commercials formulations of Orlistat in obese patients.
