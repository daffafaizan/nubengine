      promising antidiabetic agents on the market with potential to preserve renal function are
      endogenous glucagon like peptide (GLP-1) agonists and selective sodium-glucose cotransporter
      2 (SGLT2) inhibitors. The LEADER trial demonstrated that treatment with liraglutide (GLP-1
      agonist) resulted in 22% lower risk of renal composite outcome. The EMPA-REG trial
      demonstrated that treatment with empagliflozin (SGLT2 inhibitor) reduced the same renal
      composite outcome by 39%.

      Previous studies have mainly focused on glycaemic parameters when combining a GLP-1 agonist
      and SGLT2 inhibitor. From a renal perspective, it is of major interest to investigate if a
      stepwise initiation of semaglutide or placebo added to ongoing empagliflozin therapy would
      complement or have an additive effect on renal parameters.

      In a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, parallel trial we will include 80
      patients with type 2 diabetes and albuminuria. Patients will start in a run-in phase of 26
      weeks with empagliflozin 25 mg alone. After that, the patients will be randomised 1:1 to an
      active treatment period with semaglutide of 26 weeks or placebo for 26 weeks.
