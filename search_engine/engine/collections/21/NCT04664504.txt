      surgery can improve the curative effect. Rectal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used
      to stratify the risk of locally advanced rectal cancer before treatment. In this study, we
      planned to use rectal MRI parameters and the possibility of patients with anal preservation
      to group, and to observe the R0 resection rate and disease-free survival rate of patients
      with stage II / III rectal cancer after individualized preoperative radiotherapy and
      chemotherapy combined with radical surgery.
