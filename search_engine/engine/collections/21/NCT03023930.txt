      wedge design. The study will be conducted at four EDs with a high prevalence of patients with
      untreated opioid use disorder (OUD). The four sites will receive the same sequence of
      evaluations and interventions: the baseline evaluation period after the standard
      dissemination practice, the IF phase, and continuation of facilitation into the IF evaluation
      period. The timing of initiation of the study activities at each site will be randomly offset
      by ~ 3 month increments to accommodate logistical constraints of simultaneous implementation
      at all sites. The study populations will include (1) ED providers and staff involved in the
      treatment of patients with OUD; (2) Community opioid treatment provider and program staff
      involved in providing care for patients with OUD referred from the ED; and (3) ED patients
      with moderate to severe OUD.

      Exploratory analyses have been added to assess the impact of COVID-19 and social distancing
      guidance on drug use and drug supply; access to medications for opioid use disorder; and
      COVID19 disease from the perspectives of patient participants and ED leadership.
