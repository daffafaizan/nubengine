      Primary

        -  The primary outcome of the study is the change in bone mineral density following a year
           on letrozole vs. a year on placebo.

      Secondary

        -  Compare the safety, acceptability, and adherence to letrozole vs placebo in
           postmenopausal women at increased risk for the development or recurrence of breast
           cancer based on elevated plasma estradiol levels through evaluation of menopausal
           symptoms (including hot flushes, weight changes, sexual functioning, and genitourinary
           effects), blood lipid levels, markers of bone turnover, and multidimensional quality of
           life.

        -  Determine the effect of letrozole-induced reduction of plasma estradiol levels on
           mammographic percent breast density.

        -  Obtain background information for a future large chemoprevention trial to address the
           question of whether a reduction in plasma estradiol levels can reduce the risk of breast
           cancer in postmenopausal women.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study.
      Patients are randomized to 2:1 (experimental treatment: placebo arms).

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 110 patients (73 for arm I and 37 for arm II) will be accrued
      for this study.
