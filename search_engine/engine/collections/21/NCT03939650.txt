      increase the quality of medical consultations by providing physicians with an exhaustive,
      high-quality, standardized anamnesis and differential diagnosis. In this study, the
      investigators aimed to establish whether an AMHTD of interest, "Diaana", allowed the
      physician to establish a more precise differential diagnosis.

      A single-center, unblinded, 2:1 parallel pseudo-randomized efficacy trial will be performed.
      A consultation follow-up is organized at 4-6 weeks, were the gold-standard diagnosis is
      established by the senior physician. The study will take place in the emergency outpatient
      unit of La Colline Hospital (Geneva, Switzerland) and include patients suffering from
      symptoms covered by Diaana.

      Patients in the intervention group will fulfill Dianna. Then, the resident physician will
      read Diaana summary, perform his consultation, and fulfill case report form, including his
      differential diagnosis. Then, the senior physician will see the patient and establish the
      gold-standard diagnosis. In the control group, the residents will directly establish a
      differential diagnosis, without the help of Diaana.
