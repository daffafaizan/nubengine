      the circulation and the regeneration processes of the human gingiva.

      The primary aim is to determine the effect of a short term disruption of the blood flow in
      the gingiva next to an implant and the contralateral tooth, in order to compare the
      functionally active collateral circulation in the attached gingiva at these respective
      regions. Using Laser Speckle Contrast Imaging technique (LSCI), which provides blood
      perfusion data, the investigators will have the possibility to detect functional alterations
      in gingival microcirculation during and after a short term compression of the gingiva. The
      secondary aim is to assess and compare the time course of the restoration of the circulation
      on the affected areas. Further aims are to observe if the compensation capability of the
      circulation is influenced by gingival thickness (biotype) and patient's gender.
