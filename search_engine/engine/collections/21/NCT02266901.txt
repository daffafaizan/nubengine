      underwent endoscopic drainage and debridement of abdominal abscesses secondary to bariatric
      surgery leaks . The decision for endoscopic treatment was made by the medico-surgical team in
      charge of this type of surgery, who had to weigh the high risk of mortality in case of
      re-intervention, along with endoscopic access to abscesses via the transluminal or
      percutaneous route based on abdominal imaging.

      Data collection will lead to the evaluation of the technical success rate, the clinical
      success and potential complications.
