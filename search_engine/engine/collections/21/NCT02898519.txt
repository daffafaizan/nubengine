      The risk of mucocutaneous contact with contaminated media remains important due to highly
      aqueous environment.

      Cured subjects that have been infected for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or 7 years will be enrolled. The
      qualitative and quantitative humoral immune response to leptospirosis infection will also be
      evaluated to determine whether they still get protective immunization. Leptospirosis
      immunization will be evaluated using micro-agglutination test.

      Graded immune responses related to the severity and the length of the infection will also be
      investigated.

      Finally, 3 methods used for leptospirosis diagnosis will be compared. It is expected from
      this study to evaluate the appropriate conditions in which new vaccination could be required
      to prevent further leptospirosis infection in cured subjects.
