    
      The STAR Trial is a prospective, randomized, multi-center device trial intended to assess
      safety and efficacy of subcutaneous administration of Celution processed ADRCs into fingers
      of patients with hand dysfunction due to scleroderma.

      Following informed consent and screening evaluations, eligible subjects will undergo
      pre-operative testing. Subjects will then undergo fat harvest through small volume
      liposuction under local anesthesia. Lipoaspirate will be processed in the Celution System to
      isolate and concentrate ADRCs for immediate subcutaneous administration under local
      anesthesia. Subjects will be randomly assigned to receive ADRCs (40 million cells) or a
      visually-matched placebo in a 1:1 ratio. All subjects will receive subcutaneous
      administration of test substance (ADRC or placebo) into all fingers of both hands. Following
      completion of all 48 week visits and database lock, placebo treated subjects will be offered
      treatment with their ADRCs cells should they continue to qualify according to the
      inclusion/exclusion criteria and should they wish to be treated with ADRCs and agree to the
      fat harvest procedure.
