      currently available HIV medications, they still have at least a 10-year shorter life
      expectancy than the general population and are at higher risk for diseases associated with
      accelerated aging including cardiovascular disease and non-AIDS-defining cancers. Persistent
      inflammation and immune activation are believed to drive this increased risk. Despite
      suppression of viral replication in peripheral blood by effective HIV medications, HIV may
      continue to be expressed at low levels by T cells in the lining of the gut and may also
      result in translocation of bacterial products across the lining of the gut, driving
      persistent inflammation. We believe that decreasing inflammation directly in the gut may
      decrease both of these potential causes of chronic inflammation, potentially resulting in an
      immunologic benefit. Mesalamine is an oral anti-inflammatory drug used to treat patients with
      inflammatory bowel disease, acts locally on the gut tissue to decrease inflammation, and is
      associated with very few side effects. If mesalamine therapy reduces immune activation and
      inflammation in our study, it would prompt larger studies to see if mesalamine decreases
      clinical outcomes like cardiovascular disease, cancer, and mortality in this setting.
