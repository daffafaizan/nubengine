      program (HIEP) to improve health insurance and cost-related literacy among the Hispanic
      community in Utah. This study will be conducted in conjunction with the Utah Health Policy
      Project, which has long been active in the Hispanic community and has been instrumental in
      reducing the number of uninsured adults and children in Utah. Initially, community and
      key-informant feedback on how to best adapt this intervention to the Hispanic community,
      including what topics are most important, and how the intervention should be delivered, will
      be obtained. After the HIEP is adapted accordingly, it will be investigated to see if it
      improves participants' health insurance and cost-related literacy.

      Upon enrollment, participants will fill out a survey containing questions about their current
      health insurance, employment, demographics, acculturation, preferred language and health
      insurance knowledge. Participants will then receive 4 educational sessions surrounding health
      insurance use and laws (four sessions total occurring approximately every two weeks). These
      educational sessions will be conducted, in person, over video conference calls, or over the
      telephone, and will cover:

        -  Overview of health insurance options and understanding of insurance and costs

        -  Learning about types of insurance coverage and how to select/access coverage

        -  Navigating one's coverage plan

        -  Managing care costs

      These sessions will be 30 minutes, with one session done each week over a four week period.

      After completing the HIEP participants will be given a second survey including similar
      questions to those in the first survey. After the post survey is complete, participants will
      also be given brief open-ended interview questions to obtain feedback on the acceptability of
      the content and potential implementation issue areas, as well as any discordance in cultural
      values, beliefs, or feelings about health insurance.
