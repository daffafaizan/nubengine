      dialysis. Fluid management of dialysis patients is solely based on body weight differences
      before and after dialysis. Patients can suffer from either hypotension if too much fluid is
      eliminated by dialysis or from fluid-overload symptom (e.g. shortness of breath, edema) if
      not enough fluid is eliminated.

      In this study a mobile non-invasive NMR-MOUSE setup (a nuclear magnetic resonance
      spectroscopy measurement) is used to measure the hydration status of the skin.
