    
      The primary objective is to demonstrate the superiority of SKY0402, compared with bupivacaine
      HC1, with respect to the extent and duration of the analgesic effect achieved by a single
      intraoperative administration of the study drug via local infiltration in subjects undergoing
      total knee arthroplasty (TKA).

      The secondary objectives are to evaluate additional efficacy parameters and characterize the
      safety profile of SKY0402 in comparison with bupivacaine HCl.
