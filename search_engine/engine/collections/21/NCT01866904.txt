      study which will include stable CAD patients with history of MI 1-3 years ago and high risk
      of developing atherothrombotic events in a real world setting. The follow-up period is 3
      years.

      Patients will undergo clinical assessments and receive standard medical care as determined by
      the treating physician. Patients will not receive experimental intervention or experimental
      treatment as a consequence of their participation in the study.
