      trial to assess real-time feedback, an intervention that utilizes wireless technology via an
      electronic pill container device ('Wisepill'), and investigating the mechanisms by which the
      intervention operates using quantitative and qualitative research methods. 120 patients will
      be enrolled in a HIV clinic in Nanning, capital of Guangxi province, a border province with
      high rates of HIV and IDU. Enrolled patients will be randomized to intervention vs.
      comparison group for the 6-month intervention. The study will follow all patients for an
      additional 3 months to determine sustainability of intervention impact. In addition to
      adherence and clinical data, quantitative and qualitative data will be collected using survey
      instruments, focus groups, and in-depth interviews. Analysis of these data will enable
      achievement of the specific aims and contribute to the scientific evidence base on effective
      approaches to promoting ART adherence among IDU and other patients.
