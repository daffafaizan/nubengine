      to 85% of cancer patients at autopsy. Complications of bone metastases include pain,
      functional limitation, decreased quality of life, pathological fracture, spinal cord
      compression and cauda equina syndrome.

      External beam radiotherapy is the current standard treatment for patients with painful
      uncomplicated bone metastases. Unfortunately up to 30 % of patients treated with radiotherapy
      do not respond to therapy, and 30% of responders have their pain recur at some point after
      treatment. Radiotherapy re-treatment is also limited by cumulative doses delivered to
      sensitive structures. Ablative techniques such as cryotherapy and percutaneous radiofrequency
      ablation are not similarly limited by cumulative effects, however, they are invasive
      procedures that place patients at risk of complications.

      MR-guided high intensity focused ultrasound (MR-HIFU) is a non-invasive, outpatient modality
      being investigated for the treatment of cancer. In MR-HIFU, a specially designed transducer
      is used to focus a beam of ultrasound energy into a small volume at a specific target site in
      the body. The focused beam produces therapeutic hyperthermia in the target field but only
      harmlessly warms the immediately surrounding tissue. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is used
      both to focus the ultrasound beam on the target field in the bone (the metastatic lesion and
      adjacent periosteum containing the nerves and vasculature for the tumor) and to perform
      real-time thermal mapping at and around the target. The mechanism of action of pain response
      is thought to be thermal periosteal denervation and / or thermal ablation of the tumor mass
      that diminishes pressure on the surrounding tissue.
