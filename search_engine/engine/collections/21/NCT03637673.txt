      population. Moreover, the pathophysiological processes underlying KC have not been fully
      elucidated with proposed mechanisms to include proteolytic degradation in the corneal stroma,
      oxidative damage, epithelial mechanical injury, immunological factors, and genetic factors.
      However, Hormonal imbalances may be associated with KC as it affects the corneal metabolism.
      Furthermore, thyroid gland dysfunction (TGD) can frequently associated with eye diseases such
      as Graves disease. Previous studies investigated the association between TGD and KC.
      Interestingly, thyroxine (T4) is important for corneal dehydration and transparency during
      embryonic development and regulates the synthesis of keratin sulfate proteoglycan in the
      chicken. T4 receptors (T4Rs) have been found in the lacrimal gland, confirming that the tear
      producing gland is a target organ of T4. T4 level was elevated in the tears of patients with
      KC. Hence, in this study, we aim to investigate the clinical association between TGD and KC.
