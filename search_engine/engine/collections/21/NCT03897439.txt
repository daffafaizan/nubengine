      usual care (UC) treatment for smoking cessation. African American smokers randomized to OPT
      (n=196) will receive high intensity smoking cessation counseling, nicotine patch (NP), and up
      to two pharmacotherapy optimizations [varenicline (VAR), bupropion (BUP) plus NP, ] based on
      verified smoking status at Weeks 2 and 6. African American smokers randomized to enhanced UC
      (n=196) will receive the same high intensity counseling and NP with no optimizations in
      pharmacotherapy. Pharmacotherapy and counseling in both groups will last for 18 weeks with
      long-term follow-up through Week 26. The primary outcome is biochemically-verified smoking
      status at Week 12.
