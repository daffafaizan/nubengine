      intravenous ibuprofen (n=40) groups. Patients will receive 100 mL of physiologic saline with
      1 g IV paracetamol or 800 mg IV ibuprofen 30 minutes before the end of the operation and
      postoperatively 6, 12 and 18 hours after PCNL in the paracetamol and ibuprofen groups,
      respectively. Patients in both groups will receive intravenous tramadol with patient
      controlled analgesia device (PCA).

      The visual analog scale (VAS) will used to evaluate pain intensity scores in the
      postoperative period.

      Total tramadol consumption, mean VAS score in the 1, 8 and 24 hours, demographic variables,
      operative variables, and side effects will record.
