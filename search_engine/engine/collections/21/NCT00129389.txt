    
      Patients will be randomized to:

        -  Fluorouracil, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide (FAC) x 6 (cycles): 5-fluorouracil 500
           mg/m2 + doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 + cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 day 1, every 3 weeks, for 6
           cycles.

        -  FAC x 4 (cycles) â†’ Paclitaxel x 8 (cycles): 5-fluorouracil 500 mg/m2 + doxorubicin 50
           mg/m2 + cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 day 1, every 3 weeks, for 4 cycles, followed by 8
           administrations of weekly paclitaxel 100 mg/m2

      Premenopausal women with hormone receptor positive tumors must receive tamoxifen 20 mg daily
      for 5 years, after the end of chemotherapy.

      Postmenopausal women with hormone receptor positive tumors are allowed to receive aromatase
      inhibitors as initial adjuvant hormone therapy or after tamoxifen.

      All patients with breast conservative surgery must receive radiotherapy.

      Estimated 5-year disease-free survival in the control arm (FAC x 6) is expected to be 80%. It
      is expected that disease-free survival will increase by 5% in the experimental arm
      (FAC-paclitaxel). 906 patients per arm must be recruited, to detect this difference with an
      alpha error of 0.05 and 80% power. Assuming a 6% post-randomization drop-out rate, 960
      patients per arm are needed, 1920 in total.
