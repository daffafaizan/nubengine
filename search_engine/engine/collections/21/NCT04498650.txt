      1:1:1 between PQ912 300 mg BID, 600 mg BID, and placebo. When the 90th patient has completed
      the week 24 treatment visit, the DSMB will decide on the dose of PQ912 to be continued. The
      decision is based on safety findings only, no efficacy data will be considered. After the
      DSMB has reached a decision on the dose to be continued, all subjects randomized to receive
      PQ912 will be reallocated to this dose (1:1). The duration of Subjects participation in the
      study is either 48, 60, 72, 84 or 96 weeks of treatment (depending on time of randomization).
      Subjects recruited early into the study will be kept on treatment for 96 weeks or until the
      regular, scheduled study visit which is closest to the scheduled week 48 visit of the last
      subject recruited in the study, whichever comes first.
