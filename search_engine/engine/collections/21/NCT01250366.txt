    
      This is a multi-center, sequential-cohort, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple
      ascending dose, 7-day treatment study in chronically-infected genotype 1 HCV, treatment-naïve
      subjects.

      Primary Objectives include:

      Safety

      • to evaluate the safety of ascending oral doses of INX-08189 given once a day for seven (7)
      days in chronically-infected genotype 1 HCV, treatment-naïve subjects

      Pharmacokinetic

      • to characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of multiple ascending oral doses of
      INX-08189 in chronically-infected genotype 1 HCV, treatment-naïve subjects

      Pharmacodynamic

      • to evaluate the relationship between the metrics of the reduction from baseline in serum
      HCV RNA and PK parameters of INX-08189 and the metabolite INX-08032

      Efficacy

      • to measure the maximal reduction in plasma HCV RNA by ascending oral dose level of
      INX-08189 given once a day for seven (7) days in chronically-infected genotype 1 HCV,
      treatment-naïve subjects
