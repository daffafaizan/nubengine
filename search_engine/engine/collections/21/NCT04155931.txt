      Perioperative heat loss is higher in pediatric patients than in adult patients. One of the
      most common side effects of general anesthesia is nausea and vomiting. The aim of our study
      was to investigate the effects of changes in body temperature in the perioperative period on
      postoperative nausea and vomiting.We planned to perform prospectively in 80 children with ASA
      I according to the American Society of Anesthesia (ASA) Anesthesia Risk Scale between 6
      months and 7 years of age in both sexes who underwent inguinal hernia, undescended testes and
      hydrocele surgery. In all patients, heating blanket was placed on the operation table and
      standard heat was used. After the placement of the LMA, a nasopharyngeal heat probe was
      placed for central body temperature measurement and monitored throughout the operation. Mean
      arterial pressure, heart rate and body temperature were recorded. Demographic data, type of
      operation, duration of operation and intraoperative fentanyl requirement of all cases were
      recorded. Analgesic and antiemetic requirements, presence of nausea and vomiting (according
      to numerical sequence scale) were recorded in the recovery room at 6, 12 and 24 hours
      postoperatively
