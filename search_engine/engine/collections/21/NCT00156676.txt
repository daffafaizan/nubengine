      (MS). New treadmills that provide body weight support and even robotic assistance to the
      lower limbs have recently been developed and are now commercially available. These treadmills
      allow the subject to execute the integrated process of walking in a task-specific manner that
      is repetitively reinforced in a normal pattern. Data from studies using these body-weight
      supported treadmills (BWSTT) in spinal cord injury and stroke patients suggest that intensive
      task-specific gait rehabilitative training may help to restore a normative gait pattern,
      improve overground walking and enhance quality of life in multiple sclerosis patients with
      neurological gait impairment. In this study, we propose a series of prospective longitudinal
      clinical studies to collect pilot data on the use of task-specific BWSTT +/- Lokomat on
      improving ambulation, motor function and quality of life for MS patients with mild to
      moderate gait difficulty. Pilot data will also be collected for the effect conventional
      rehabilitation has on ambulation and motor outcomes as well as how these outcomes change
      during usual care. Our clinical research goals are to capture the initial pilot data (mean
      changes and variances in ambulation, motor, fatigue and quality of life outcomes) to
      facilitate the design of a larger clinical trial to test efficacy if these preliminary data
      are promising. The planned studies will study the effect of two forms of task specific
      training (BWSTT alone and BWSTT combined with Lokomat) compared to conventional gait
      rehabilitative methods and usual care
