      lower limb operations, such as total knee arthroplasty (TKA), anterior cruciate ligament
      repair, tibial osteotomy and patellar surgery. It provides superior pain relief, faster
      ambulation, shorter hospital stays and less risk of side effects in comparison to patient
      controlled analgesia (PCA), local anesthetic wound infiltration, or single shot femoral nerve
      block (FNB).

      Stimulating catheters were introduced in 1999 to provide an objective end point to guide
      continuous nerve block catheter position by maintaining the desired evoked muscle response
      with nerve stimulation (NS). The main advantages of stimulating catheters are faster onset of
      sensory and motor block and reduction of local anesthetic drugs consumption. In recent years
      the precise insertion of continuous catheters has improved especially with the introduction
      of ultrasound (US)-guided imaging to regional anesthesia practice and advances in scanning
      techniques. That led to a call to reduce cost by switching to non-stimulating catheters.
      However, most studies comparing both catheters lacked anesthetic technique standardization
      and adequate sample size.

      In this prospective randomized controlled trial, we compared postoperative analgesic efficacy
      and opioids consumption in patients having cFNB insertion using US alone and that of US
      combined with NS.
