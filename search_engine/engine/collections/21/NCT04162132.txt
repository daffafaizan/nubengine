      app (DynamiCare Rewards) for patients with substance use disorder (SUD) who are in active
      treatment and recovery at BrightView (www.brightviewhealth.com). Patients performed
      self-tracking of their recovery behavior (e.g., counseling attendance, abstinence from drugs
      and alcohol) addiction recovery behavior using the DynamiCare app, which follows Contingency
      Management (CM) model of incentivizing positive behavior.

      CM is shown as a highly effective, evidence-based methodology for improving substance use
      disorder (SUD) outcomes. It does so by activating the brain's reward and inhibitory systems
      through both positive and negative reinforcement using immediate, concrete incentives in a
      progressive reinforcement schedule. CM involves setting frequent (>1/week), objective goals
      (usually abstinence or participation in treatment), which patients can achieve to earn
      tangible rewards (such as cash or vouchers). The DynamiCare smart phone app (iOS/Android)
      uses CM to incentivize patients to attend scheduled appointments and to submit negative
      alcohol and drug tests as they are rewarded for these behaviors. The intentions of this
      project were to assess whether use of the smartphone app as an add-on to treatment as usual
      could increase treatment retention, increase the percentage of appointments that were kept,
      and if substance use could be reduced for patients using the app.

      Patients were enrolled in the study on a rolling basis from Jan 25, 2019 to March 29, 2019
      until the desired cohort group # was reached (n=108). The intervention period (period of time
      when patients actually used the DynamiCare app) lasted four months from the date of their
      enrollment.
