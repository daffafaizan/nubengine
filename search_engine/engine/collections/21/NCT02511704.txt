      inhaled vapour or "vaping". At present, e-cigarettes are becoming increasingly popular among
      smokers worldwide. However, knowledge about e-cigarette nicotine pharmacology remains
      limited.

      The aims of this study are 1) to determine the pharmacokinetics of nicotine after multiple
      dose administration by electronic cigarette and 2) to compare the acute effects of multiple
      dose of nicotine administrated by electronic cigarette compared with those obteined by
      cigarette.
