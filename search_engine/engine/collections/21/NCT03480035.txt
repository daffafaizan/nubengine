      angle to bend when performing endotracheal intubation with lightwand. For ease of procedure,
      the assistant has to lift the patient's lower jaw or perform a neck extension.

      However, there is no report on the position of the lightbulb when the light passes through
      the front of the airway and neck and appears bright in the midpoint.

      The prodcedure is as follows.

        1. FOB examination and check position of light below 1cm from vocal cord

        2. lightwand intubation aimed at checkpoint

        3. measurement of distance from thyroid cartilage/cricoid cartilage to light point
