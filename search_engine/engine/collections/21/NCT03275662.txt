      has been linked to numerous chronic diseases that are driven by inflammation. It is likely
      dietary changes in the last half-century consistent with adoption of the Western diet have
      had an adverse impact on the gut microbiota. A critically important next step in this field
      of research is to identify how different dietary interventions can potentially restore
      healthy features of the gut microbiota in alignment with the optimization of human health.
      Dietary interventions that target the microbiota and reduce inflammation may reverse or
      prevent chronic diseases including obesity, metabolic syndrome, and inflammatory bowel
      disease. This study is designed to elicit and contrast inflammatory markers in blood with the
      amount of increase in microbiota diversity and related metabolic output achievable by two
      dietary approaches commonly available to the general population. The results could contribute
      to dietary recommendations for reversing the chronic disease epidemics of Westernization.
