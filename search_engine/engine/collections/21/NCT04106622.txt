      ≥1 accessory pathways between the atria and the ventricles pre-disposing patients to
      arrhythmias. Anterograde conduction through the accessory pathway leads to preexcitation of
      the ventricles and a delta wave in the ECG. The prevalence of preexcitation in the general
      population has been estimated to be 1 to 3 in 1000 individuals. Although most asymptomatic
      patients with pre-excitation have a good prognosis, there is also a lifetime risk of
      malignant arrhythmias and SCD, estimated to be 0.1 % per patient year.

        -  More worrisome is the fact that this event can be the first manifestation of the disease
           in up to 53 % of patients.

        -  Atrial fibrillation (AF) can be a life-threatening arrhythmia in the WPW syndrome if the
           AV AP has a short anterograde refractory period (RP), allowing too many atrial impulses
           to be conducted to the ventricle.

        -  This will result in very high ventricular rates with possible deterioration into
           ventricular fibrillation (VF) and sudden death.

        -  Parameters proved to indicate high risk AP include AP effective refractory period <240
           ms, shortest preexcited RR interval <250 ms

        -  Certain Locations were thought to be associated with higher risk of the accessory
           pathway like Septal localization which was significantly more frequent in patients with
           VF when compared with individuals with no VF but the overall number of patients is
           limited . .

      These debatable relations between AP location and its risk stratification was not extensively
      studied in larger scale studies….
