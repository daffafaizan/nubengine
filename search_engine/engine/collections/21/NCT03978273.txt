    
      The present study is the first evaluation of the efficacy of the virtual-brace on scoliotic
      patients.

      The efficacy of rehabilitation will be estimate on the correction of the posture of scoliosis
      patients over 6 months by comparing 2 groups: a control group of patients conventionally
      treated with a night-time brace (G0 group_conventional) and an experimental group of patients
      wearing a night-time brace, doing postural rehabilitation exercises with the virtual brace
      and follow-up visits with a physiotherapist (G1 group_virtual-brace).
