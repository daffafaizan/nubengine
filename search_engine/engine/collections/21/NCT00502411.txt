      The radiation treatment and chemotherapy will start around 4-6 weeks after surgery. During
      the study, you will receive radiation treatments 5 days a week for 6 - 61/2 weeks. On Day 1
      of each week of radiation therapy, you will be given doxorubicin through a continuous
      injection into a vein for 4 days in a row. A special tube is placed into a large vein in the
      neck or chest region or through a large vein in the arm. This is called a central venous
      line. A small pump is then used to give the drug. This pump is about the size of a pack of
      cigarettes. You will receive appropriate instructions for the maintenance of the pump. The
      doxorubicin and radiotherapy will be given on an outpatient basis at M. D. Anderson.

      If the disease gets worse or you experience any intolerable side effects, chemotherapy and/or
      radiation therapy may be stopped and you may be taken off the study. At that time, your
      doctor will discuss other treatment options with you.

      Before the start of each week of treatment, you will have a physical exam and blood tests
      (around 2 tablespoons). You will also have a MRI to check on the status of the disease.

      After the study, you will have follow-up visits at M. D. Anderson every 3-4 months for the
      first 2 years after the study then every 6 months for the next 3 years. After that you will
      have follow-up visits once a year for the rest of your life to check on the status of the
      disease. At every follow-up visit you will have ultrasound scans. You will have a MRI at the
      first follow-up visit then only when the doctor feels it is necessary.

      This is an investigational study. Doxorubicin is FDA approved and is commercially available.
      Up to 30 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.
