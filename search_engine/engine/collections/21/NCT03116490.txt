      morbidity.But,seldom practice can be done to improve this condition.For a long time,whether
      anesthesia type could influence the prognosis after surgery is controversial.Several studies
      have confirmed regional anesthesia may be better for patients for its fewer complications.But
      most studies are retrospective,and information may be less convincing .Besides,as a matter of
      fact,patients of different anesthesia type may have different status,so,a scoring system may
      be need for comparing the status of patients of different groups.

      Our study is a prospective observational trial.Patients needing hip fracture surgery are
      divided into two groups according to the anesthesia type during surgery:Regional Anesthesia
      group(RA),General Anesthesia group(GA).To evaluate the status of patients before surgery,we
      use Orthopedic POSSUM scoring system.It consists of 12 physiological factors and 6 operative
      severity factors.Then,we will observe outcome of the two groups and record every complication
      after surgery.Finally,the initial and adjusted morbidity and mortality according to
      Orthopedic POSSUM scoring system of the two groups are compared.
