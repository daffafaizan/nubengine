    
      This is an open label, non-randomized study in patients with advanced solid tumours including
      malignant glioma. The study will be performed in two phases - a dose escalation phase
      following a standard "3+3" design to establish dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and a safe dose
      of 2-OHOA followed by two expanded safety cohorts (approximately 10 of whom have malignant
      glioma and approximately 10 of whom have other advanced solid tumours that are suitable for
      biopsy) treated at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). If the MTD is well tolerated in the
      expanded safety cohorts, that dose becomes the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). During each
      dose cohort, at least one week must elapse between the first and subsequent patients
      receiving treatment with 2-OHOA. Patients may receive palliative localized radiotherapy, if
      needed (however, this lesion cannot be a target lesion for evaluation of the treatment
      response).

      Safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics and efficacy will be evaluated during the
      study at pre-defined timepoints
