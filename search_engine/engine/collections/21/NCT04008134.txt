      Intervention for 7 Days (CHoBI7) demonstrated that this intervention was effective in
      significantly reducing symptomatic cholera infections in intervention households, and had
      significant sustained impacts on hand washing with soap behaviors and improved water quality
      12 months post intervention. Next steps to transition to scale were: (1) Develop and evaluate
      scalable approaches to integrate the CHoBI7 intervention into the services provided for
      hospitalized diarrhea patients at health facilities in Bangladesh; and (2) Evaluate the
      ability of the CHoBI7 intervention to lead to a sustained uptake of the promoted hand washing
      with soap and water treatment behaviors and significant reductions in diarrheal disease over
      time.
