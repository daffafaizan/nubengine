      have a biopsy-proven rejection episode and who had a serum creatinine level < 2.0 mg/dL 6
      months after transplantation, 55 were of the CsA group and 63 were of the TAC group. We
      assessed patient and graft survival, acute rejection episodes, and adverse events 5 years
      after transplantation.
