      frequency that may result in ICD oversensing. Oversensing may in turn result in false
      detection of a ventricular arrhythmia and for the ICD to discharge. Because of this
      possibility, patients frequently have their ICDs inactivated prior to the procedure.

      Although oversensing appears to be highly unlikely in clinical practice, vast resources are
      utilized in the process of deactivating and reactivating ICDs for surgeries. In addition,
      there are reports of deaths from failure to reactivate ICDs following elective surgery.

      In this study we intend to document the incidence of oversensing, identify procedures with a
      higher likelihood of oversensing and evaluate the ability of dual chamber ICDs to
      discriminate electromagnetic oversensing.
