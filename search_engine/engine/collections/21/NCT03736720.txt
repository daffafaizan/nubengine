    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the objective response rate liposomal irinotecan (nanoliposomal irinotecan
      [Nal-IRI]) + fluorouracil (5FU) and leucovorin in patients with refractory advanced high
      grade neuroendocrine cancer of gastrointestinal (GI), unknown or pancreatic origin.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine overall survival, progression-free survival, time to treatment failure,
      safety, clinical response and, quality of life (QOL) changes resulting from the combination
      treatment of nanoliposomal irinotecan (Nal-IRI) + fluorouracil (5FU) and leucovorin.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Genetic profiling for mutations will be conducted on all pre-study tumor samples and
      compared to changes in immune response.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive liposomal irinotecan intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes, leucovorin IV over
      30 minutes, and fluorouracil IV over 46 hours on days 1 and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days
      for in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days, then every 2
      months thereafter.
