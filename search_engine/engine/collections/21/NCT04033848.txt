    
      Starting 05/01/13 patients with complex ankle fractures, older than 17 years, who sustained
      the injury less than 14 days before surgery and giving informed consent are consecutively
      enrolled. A complex fracture is defined as either an isolated malleolar fracture in
      combination with ligamentous instability, or a bi- or trimalleolar fracture. An unstable
      ligamentous injury is defined as either a disruption of the deltoid ligament leading to
      increased medial talar tilt, or an unstable syndesmotic injury assessed by the external
      rotation test both after osteosynthesis of all fractures. Exclusion criteria are isolated
      unimalleolar fractures, pilon fractures, open fractures, multiple injuries, mental illness,
      incompliance or pregnancy.
