      I. Evaluate the response rate (complete response and partial response) in patients with acute
      myeloid leukemia treated with PXD101.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the overall survival of these patients. II. Evaluate the duration of response in
      these patients. III. Evaluate the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate molecular response to PXD101.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive PXD101 IV over 30 minutes on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 21 days for
      6-12 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Blood and bone marrow samples are obtained before and after study treatment for laboratory
      studies.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 1 year.
