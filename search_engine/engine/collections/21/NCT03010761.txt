      be enrolled for the following 8 week double-blinded placebo controlled trial. The groups will
      be divided into three groups. Outcome measures include BQ use condition, addiction severity
      rating scale, emotional rating scale including Beck Anxiety Index (BAI), Beck Depression
      Index (BDI), Hamilton Depression Scales (HAMDs), and urine BQ metabolites.
