    
      Conscientious objection (CO) is emerging as a growing barrier to abortion care, and evidence
      suggests that it is being incorrectly used as a justification for public sector medical
      providers and institutions to exempt themselves from their duties to provide essential
      reproductive health services for women. Given this, it is essential to better understand and
      address this misuse of CO and find ways to improve women's access to safe abortion services
      to prevent them from using unsafe methods which risk their health and lives.

      This study will conduct formative research to more fully understand the problem of CO in
      Mexico and South Africa and use these findings to develop interventions and strategies to
      mitigate the impact of CO on women's access to safe abortion care using a user-centered
      design approach. Rapid randomized controlled trials will then be used to assess effectiveness
      of the interventions. The specific aims of this study are:

        1. Improve our understanding of CO and its impact on access and quality of abortion care
           from providers' and facility mangers' perspectives in Mexico, and South Africa.

        2. Develop strategies and interventions to mitigate the impact of CO on women's access to
           safe abortion care. Using the data collected, a multi-disciplinary Innovation Team will
           develop strategies and interventions to respond to the challenges posed by CO using a
           user-centered design approach.

        3. Rapid-test intervention prototypes. We will test selected strategies (prototypes) in
           Mexico, and South Africa with assessments to determine successes, and the feasibility of
           scaling up these approaches.
