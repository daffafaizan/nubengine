      women with depression will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either online PDA or a control
      condition comprising an online set of publicly available standard resources. The study will
      be stratified by preconception vs. pregnant, and by province.

      The study is based at Women's College Hospital (Toronto) but participants will be recruited
      from across Canada, as the online intervention does not require any in-person study visits.
      Participants will be recruited via social media (ex. Facebook, Twitter, mommy/baby blogs) and
      by provider referrals.

      Participants will be given a series of online questionnaires with various measures collected
      at baseline, 4 weeks post-randomization, in each trimester of pregnancy, and at 1, 3, 6 and
      12 months postpartum. Participants who are planning pregnancy will enter the longer-term
      (pregnancy and postpartum) follow-up phase once they become pregnant; those who do not
      conceive by one year post-randomization will be sent a final set of questionnaires and exit
      the study. A process evaluation will also be conducted to gain insights around trial conduct,
      and perspectives on potential for (or barriers to) scale-up. This, along with the planned
      economic evaluation, will inform clinical and policy decisions around adopting the PDA into
      real-world practice.
