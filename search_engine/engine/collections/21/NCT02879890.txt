      and preferences for health states. It is expressed as the "desirability or preference that
      individuals exhibit for the condition". This health utility state can be measured indirectly
      using health-relation quality of life questionnaires.

      Chronic diseases such as OA are known to be associated with impairment of quality of life.
      Given that OA prevalence increases with age, OA is often associated with other diseases
      (comorbidities). A cross-sectional study showed that comorbidities are associated with lower
      health utility state in OA. Investigation of longitudinal impact of comorbidities on health
      utility state change is need.

      Main objective: Determine the impact of comorbidities on change in health utility state among
      patients with lower limb OA.

      Secondary objective: Determine the Minimal Clinically important Difference in health utility
      state among patients with lower limb OA.

      The COMUTAR study uses longitudinal data from the Knee and Hip Osteoarthritis Longitudinal
      Assessment (KHOALA) cohort study. Health utility state is measured indirectly using Medical
      Outcome Study Short Form-36 quality of life questionnaire Comorbidities are assessed using
      the Functional Comorbidity Index
