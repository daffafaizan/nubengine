      treat pediatric participants who have moderately to severely active UC.

      The study will enroll approximately 120 patients.

      Participants will receive 3 doses of vedolizumab IV infusion at Day 1, Week 2, and Week 6
      based on their baseline weight in the Induction Period:

        -  Participants ≥30 kg, Vedolizumab 300 mg

        -  Participants >15 to <30 kg, Vedolizumab 200 mg

        -  Participants 10 to 15 kg, Vedolizumab 150 mg

      At Week 14, participants who achieve clinical response will be randomized in the 1:1 ratio to
      2 double-blind dose groups (high dose and low dose) within each of the 3 weight groups and
      will receive respective treatment up to Week 46 in the Maintenance Period as:

        -  Participants ≥30 kg, Vedolizumab 300 mg

        -  Participants ≥30 kg, Vedolizumab 150 mg

        -  Participants >15 to <30 kg, Vedolizumab 200 mg

        -  Participants >15 to <30 kg, Vedolizumab 100 mg

        -  Participants 10 to 15 kg, Vedolizumab 150 mg

        -  Participants 10 to 15 kg, Vedolizumab 100 mg

      At the discretion of the investigator, participants receiving the low dose (150 or 100 mg) of
      vedolizumab IV may be escalated to the high dose (300, 200 or 150 mg) or receive rescue
      therapy with corticosteroids, if the participants demonstrate disease worsening.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted worldwide. The overall time to participate in this
      study is up to 3 years. After the Week 54 visit, participants may be eligible to participate
      in extension study. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic for the first 72
      weeks, and then will be contacted by telephone up to 2 years after last dose for a long-term
      follow-up assessment.
