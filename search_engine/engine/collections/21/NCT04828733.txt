      primary surgical treatment for morbid obesity. The total fundoplication is the gold standard
      for treating GERD. Morbid obesity and GERD require simultaneous surgical treatment. We
      hypothesize that total fundoplication can not only treat GERD but also prevent the return of
      weight like a banded gastric bypass.

      The aim study is to compare bariatric and antireflux results after OAGB/MGB plus suture
      cruroplasty (SCP) with and without total fundoplication.

      Adult participants (n=100) are randomly allocated to one of two groups:

      Experimental surgical bariatric procedure in the first (A) group: patients (n=50) undergo the
      laparoscopic one anastomosis gastric bypass with the total wrapping of the fundus of gastric
      excluded part and suture cruroplasty (OAGB + SCP + TF group); Active comparator surgical
      bariatric procedure in the second (B) group: patients (n=50) undergo the laparoscopic one
      anastomosis gastric bypass with only suture cruroplasty (OAGB + SCP group). All patients are
      then followed up 12, 24, 36 months after surgery where record the changing body mass index
      and change of GERD symptoms (GERD-HRQL).
