      untreated is associated with microvascular disease. Most people with type 1 diabetes are
      treated with a combination of long-acting (basal) insulin and short-acting (prandial) insulin
      administered prior to meals. This necessitates multiple daily injections (>3) which is a
      significant barrier to long-term compliance and treatment. Intranasal administration of
      insulin has been developed in an effort to overcome the need for insulin injection prior to
      meals. The pharmacokinetic properties conferred to insulin by this route of administration
      suggest that postprandial glucose disposal may be stimulated leading to lower glucose
      concentrations in comparison to dosing via other routes. We propose to study postprandial
      glucose turnover in healthy volunteers with Type 1 diabetes to determine the effect of
      intranasal insulin on glucose disposal. We wish to do so in order to develop a greater
      understanding of how the different bioavailability timing of intranasal insulin might alter
      postprandial glucose disposal and suppression of endogenous glucose production. In order to
      address these questions we will address specific aims:

        -  Peak postprandial glucose disposal is higher and occurs earlier, in the presence of
           intranasal insulin administration than it is in more conventional forms of insulin
           dosing.

        -  Peak suppression of endogenous glucose production is greater and occurs earlier, in the
           presence of intranasal insulin administration than it is in more conventional forms of
           insulin dosing.
