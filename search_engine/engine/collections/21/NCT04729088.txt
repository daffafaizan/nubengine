    
      This is a Phase I trial to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and safety of Isosorbide Mononitrate
      gel for intra anal administration. For the current study 2g of a 0,5% gel will be used (as
      part of a safety investigational profile with doses up to 2% in other studies).

      The investigational product will be administered to the participants by the study physician
      as a single dose. Blood samples will be collected prior dose and up to 36:00 hours to
      characterize the pharmacokinetic profile.

      Safety parameters, including adverse events, will be monitored by the study team during
      confinement (up to 24 hours post dose), at the 36 hour sample collection (ambulatory basis)
      and as reported by the subjects or verified at the discharge visit, up to 15 days after
      dosing.
