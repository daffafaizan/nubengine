      9-13 year-old children in the early stages of puberty (N=120). It will assess changes in bone
      material and geometric properties using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and peripheral
      quantitative computed tomography (pQCT). Cognitive function will be measured by the National
      Institute of Health's Toolbox. Participants will be randomized to one of 3 treatment (i.e.,
      whole egg powder, whole milk powder, or gelatin) groups, and instructed to consume the food
      projects 10 times/week in substitute for other similar food products in their diet for
      9-months. Five product choices per treatment group will be provided. The food products were
      developed specifically for this study by the University of Georgia's Food Product Innovation
      and Commercialization center and consumer tested. Additionally, these food products will be
      micro-tested prior to distribution to participants. We hypothesize that children consuming
      whole egg products will have enhanced bone outcomes and cognitive abilities in comparison to
      those consuming whole milk powder or gelatin.
