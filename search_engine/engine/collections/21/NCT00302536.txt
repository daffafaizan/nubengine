      kidney function in 50% of patients over 10 years. Steroids, which are currently used to treat
      the disease, are effective in part of patients. Over the past decade, a number of studies
      have reported therapeutic efficacy for treatment with Cyclosporine-A (CSA) in patients with
      FSGS. Recent studies suggest that immunosuppressive therapy targeted against the calcineurin
      pathway of T-helper cells, for example, tacrolimus, may be effective in the treatment of
      primary FSGS. The experience with Tacrolimus (FK506) in the treatment of patients with FSGS
      has been limited to uncontrolled trials in adult patients.
