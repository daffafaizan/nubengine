      allergy and cockroach exposure is one of the most important factors contributing to the
      dramatic increase in asthma morbidity seen in inner city children with asthma. Therefore, a
      major goal of the Inner City Asthma Consortium (ICAC) is to evaluate the efficacy of
      cockroach immunotherapy in inner city asthma.
