      arthritis). It acts on structures on inflammatory cells, known as P2X7 receptors. Blocking
      these receptors reduces the release of important inflammatory chemicals which exists within
      the body and are thought to play an important role in promoting inflammatory pain.

      This study will start with a very low dose of study drug, which will then be gradually
      increased in subsequent doses. This is known as dose-rising and is the way to assess safety
      and tolerability (any side effects that make taking the drug unpleasant). Effects will be
      compared to those seen when a placebo (a "dummy" drug) is taken. Up to 4 groups of 8 healthy
      male or female volunteers will be enrolled into the study. In addition, part of the study
      will be used to check if there is a difference in the blood levels of the study drug when
      taken with or without a high fat meal.
