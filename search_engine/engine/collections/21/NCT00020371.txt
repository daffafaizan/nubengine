      recommended phase II dose of BMS-247550 in patients with refractory neoplasms.

      II. Evaluate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of this drug in these patients.

      III. Determine the occurrence of response in patients treated with this drug.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive BMS-247550 IV over 1 hour
      on days 1-5. Treatment continues every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 1-6 patients receive escalating doses of BMS-247550 until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). Once the MTD is determined, additional
      patients are accrued to receive BMS-247550 at the recommended phase II dose.

      If neutropenia is identified as the DLT, a second dose escalation is performed to identify
      the MTD of BMS-247550 with the addition of filgrastim (G-CSF) in cohorts as above. Patients
      receive fixed-dose G-CSF 72 hours after final BMS-247550 dose, and continuing until blood
      levels return to normal.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL:

      A total of 45 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-18 months.
