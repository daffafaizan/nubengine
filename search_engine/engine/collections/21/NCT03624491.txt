      unequivocally that tidal volume (VT), plateau pressure (PPLAT) and PEEP (positive
      end-expiratory pressure) influence ventilator induced lung injury. Clinicians, however, have
      struggled in the attempt to find a single indicator of safety and risk. Recent analyses of
      the large multi-center randomized trials database suggest that Airway Driving Pressure (ADP)
      and Trans pulmonary Driving Pressure (DTP) are the variables of greatest importance and
      therefore the best single parameters on which to focus. In attempting to define their optimal
      values and their correlation between each other in the setting of intra-abdominal
      hypertension, we would like to compare standard of care mechanical ventilation (control) with
      mechanical ventilation guided by DTP and ADP (intervention) in patients undergoing abdominal
      laparoscopic surgery.
