      Hernia Society recommends the use of prophylactic mesh when the stoma is constructed. So far,
      there're no trials comparing the methods to prevent the parastomal hernia.

      Prestoma Trial is designed to compare the most researched retromuscular mesh (Parietene Macro
      by Medtronic) with two different types of intraperitoneal meshes (Parietex Parastomal by
      Medtronic and Dynamesh IPST) in parastomal hernia prevention after laparoscopic or
      robotic-assisted abdominoperineal resection for rectal adenocarcinoma.
