    
      The specific aims of this clinical study are:

        1. To optimize the data collection technique and establish an examination procedure;

        2. To collect data necessary for assessing the performance of BUSS sensors;

        3. To evaluate the probe ergonomic design and participant tolerance to probe application;

        4. To assess the clinical suitability of the software interface in data collection;

        5. To adjust the BUSS diagnostic algorithms using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA)
           data as a "gold" standard in osteoporosis detection and characterization;

        6. To evaluate BUSS performance including ease of use and consistency.
