      checked every two minutes during CPR for cardiac arrest patients. Also it is very important
      to stop compressing the chest in less than 10 seconds when checking heart rhythm and pulse.

      However, manual palpation, which is used as a standard for return of spontaneous
      circulation(ROSC), has been reported that the accuracy is not high in several studies. It is
      quite often necessary to perform pulse palpation for longer than the 10 second recommended by
      the guidelines to make a judgment.

      Ultrasound is a key technique that guides to discern and treat causes of cardiac arrest
      patients. Recently, a case study was published in which the presence of spontaneous
      circulation was confirmed by evaluating the carotid artery compressibility and pulsatility
      with an ultrasound probe when checking the rhythm of cardiac arrest patients.

      However, this is just a case study. There has been no clinical study on actual cardiac arrest
      patients whether it is possible to accurately determine the ROSC by evaluating the carotid
      artery compressibility and pulsatility by ultrasound. Also there has been no clinical studies
      on actual cardiac arrest patients comparing the time taken to evaluate the ROSC of carotid
      ultrasound and manual palpation.
