      treat patients with poorly controlled neocortical epilepsy refractory to pharmacological
      treatments as a continuation of our previous study (1.0 Hz TMS in 24 patients with refractory
      partial epilepsy). Previously, we observed that 1.0 Hz rTMS reduced seizure frequency during
      the first 2 weeks after TMS, although the difference did not reach statistical significance.
      However, the results suggested that patients with neocortical temporal foci would have a
      better response than those with mesial temporal foci. We wish to see whether rTMS leads to a
      significant reduction in seizure frequency in neocortical epilepsy considering the depth of
      magnetic field. The design will include two parallel groups, one receiving active treatment,
      and one sham stimulation directed away from the epileptic focus. The patients and the rating
      physicians will be blinded to the treatment. 1.0 Hz TMS is a rate proven to induce long term
      depression in animal models and reported to decrease the excitability of both human and
      animal cerebral cortex. Our preliminary controlled study showed a trend for reduced seizure
      frequency after 1.0 Hz stimulation. The main outcome measure will be a reduction in seizure
      frequency over two weeks after stimulation.
