        -  Period 1: one coated tablet of eplerenone 25mg in fasting

        -  Period 2: one coated tablet of eplerenone 50mg in fasting

        -  Period 3: two coated tablets of eplerenone 50mg (100mg of eplerenone) in fasting
           Formulations will be administered in a single dose, orally in each period. Trial
           subjects will be admitted in three different periods of 24 hours each, when
