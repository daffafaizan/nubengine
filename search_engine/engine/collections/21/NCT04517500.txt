      for patients with COPD. PLB can ease shortness of breath and reduce stress and anxiety. This
      study will develop a mindful PLB module to compliment an already developed home based
      pulmonary rehabilitation program. In this study, patients will be randomized to either a
      group that does the home based pulmonary rehabilitation with the mindful breathing module and
      health coaching or a group that does the home based pulmonary rehabilitation with health
      coaching without the mindful breathing module. Both groups will do the home based pulmonary
      rehabilitation for 12 weeks. In addition there are questionnaires and the wearing of an
      activity monitor when you sign up and at 3 and 6 months.
