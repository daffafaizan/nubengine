      the progression of disease was also reported a prevalence of 34-77% of pain symptoms in these
      patients. A review observed a higher score in pain intensity/interference associated with
      multiples pain locations of COPD patients. Several studies reported that comorbidities, GOLD
      grade, and breathlessness may contribute to a higher pain prevalence in COPD patients because
      of the systemic inflammatory process and lung hyperinflation. Pain in chronic diseases may
      appear to result from abnormalities in pain processing and alteration of sensitization due to
      the damage and/or inflammation of peripheral structures.
