      Determine uptake, effectiveness and safety of IFN-free, DAAs among "real world" patients,
      including those with multiple comorbidities, in the primary care setting.

      Secondary Objective(s):

        1. Demonstrate the transformation of the cascade of Hepatitis C Care at 3 primary care
           clinics in terms of changes from baseline in rates for rates of access to HCV care
           including HCV screening, evaluation, treatment consideration, treatment uptake,
           completion, loss to follow-up, and treatment success rate.

        2. Advance understanding of hepatitis C related decision-making in the era of Interferon
           (IFN)-free Direct acting agents (DAAs) by examining the context, needs, motivators,
           barriers, and preferences among patients and providers to the delivery of hepatitis C
