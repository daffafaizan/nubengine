      Patients complete questionnaires over 10 minutes about physical symptoms, activity level, and
      emotional well-being and have their medical records reviewed at baseline, 1, 3, and 6 months
      after starting index treatment, and at start of a new systemic treatment. Patients also
      undergo collection of blood samples over 1-2 minutes at baseline and at 1 month after
      starting index treatment, or at a treatment change visit if new therapy has not started.
