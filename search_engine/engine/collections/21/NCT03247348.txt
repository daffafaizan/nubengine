      sedentary behavior and less time in light physical activity experience greater clinical pain
      and overall impact of FM, irrespective of time spent in moderate to vigorous physical
      activity. To date, no studies have investigated the potential impact of reducing sedentary
      behavior on key clinical and physical function outcomes in FM. The overall objective of the
      pilot project is to design and evaluate the feasibility of an 8-week behavioral intervention
      designed to replace sedentary behavior with light physical activity in veterans with FM.
      Mixed (quantitative and qualitative) methods will be used to evaluate the behavioral
      intervention, which is based on constructs from social cognitive and self-regulatory theories
      that consistently identify important drivers of behavior change as: education, goal-setting,
      self-monitoring and behavioral prompts to move via an activity tracker and phone app, and
      feedback on behavior via weekly meetings.
