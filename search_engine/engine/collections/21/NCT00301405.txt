      most common diagnosis in older men. In Chronic Prostatitis (CP) or Chronic Pelvic Pain
      Syndrome (CPPS), men have lower urinary tract symptoms, pelvic pain, sexual dysfunction and
      decreased quality of life. Little is known about the cause of CP/CPPS and no definitive
      therapy exists.

      Thalidomide is an immunomodulator (a drug that alters the immune system) and it may also
      interfere with the development of tiny blood vessels that help support tumor growth.
      Therefore, in theory, it may reduce or prevent the growth of cancer cells. Thalidomide is
      approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for a leprosy skin condition, but not for
      the treatment of CP or CPPS.
