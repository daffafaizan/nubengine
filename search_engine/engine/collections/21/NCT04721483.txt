      hyperhidrosis, there has been a continuous quest to find a way to reduce its most unpleasant
      side effect: compensatory hyperhidrosis (CH). Following the idea of minimizing the surgically
      induced damage to the sympathetic chain, Wittmoser introduced in 1992, the ramicotomy
      technique. It entailed the selective lesion of the rami communicantes, both white and gray,
      from T2 to T4-T5. This surgical technique was not as selective as expected because it damaged
      the sympathetic input for the lungs and heart, and the head and face. Wittmoser described
      this surgical technique but never published any results. Gossot4 in 1997 compared this
      technique with the sympathectomy of the same ganglia in 54 patients. He found that CH's
      incidence was the same in both groups, but the severity was less in the ramicotomy than in
      the sympathectomy group. The recurrence rate was more prominent in the first than in the
      second group (5% ramicotomy versus 0% sympathectomy). Other researchers have confirmed these
      results.

      More studies compared the sympathectomy with the ramicotomy in the following years,
      confirming that ramicotomy has a lower incidence of CH5-10, with less dry hands but with some
      recurrences.

      In a step forward, Coveliers et al.11 lesioned only the T2 T3 and T4 gray rami communicantes,
      not touching the sympathetic chain or the white rami communicantes, with CH dropping to 7.2%
      and no recurrences. Akil et al.12 reported the lesion of the T2-T5 gray rami communicantes
      with no CH and again with no recurrences. Both studies entail a more extensive lesion,
      including T2, and one of those studies, T5. There is an agreement to avoid lesioning T2 in
      many previous reports to reduce the incidence and severity of CH.
