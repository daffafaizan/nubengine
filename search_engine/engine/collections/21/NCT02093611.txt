      the study. The participants will be randomly assigned to either placebo supplementation or to
      400 mg ATP per day for 14 days. The supplements will be taken in the morning and the last
      dose will be taken 30 min prior to testing on the last day. Testing will be performed at
      baseline and after the 14 days of supplementation. Ten successive sprints will be conducted
      on the Wingate apparatus as this has been previously demonstrated to decrease muscle
      excitability. After the sprints, muscle excitability, reaction time, and vertical jump power
      will be measured. In addition a blood sample will be obtained before and after
      supplementation and complete blood hematology and chemistry analyses will be performed. It is
      expected that ATP supplementation may help maintain muscle excitability and power after the
      successive sprint sessions.
