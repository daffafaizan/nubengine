      sequence intubation when receiving paralytic drug delivery via intravenous or intraosseous
      vascular access from the perspective of the medical professional performing rapid sequence
      intubation. The investigators believe that medical professionals will find equal intubating
      conditions for intravenous and intraosseous drug delivery.
