      currently involve prescription opioids. Surgical patients often experience moderate-to-severe
      pain is common after major surgery, and surgery is associated with a 14-fold increased risk
      of opioid dependency compared to non-surgical controls, even after minor surgery.
      Furthermore, mood disorders (e.g., depression) are independently associated with persistent
      opioid use postoperatively, and signs of postoperative depression are common after major
      surgery. Thus, given these risk factors, surgical patients are at particularly high risk for
      opioid dependency postoperatively. Interventions that (1) reduce opioid burden, and (2)
      improve mood and neuropsychological function may mitigate the risk of postoperative opioid
      dependency. Preliminary laboratory and clinical findings demonstrate that caffeine may reduce
      pain after surgery, which may translate to lower opioid requirements. The study tests the
      hypothesis that intraoperative caffeine administration will improve opioid consumption, pain,
      and neuropsychological recovery in patients undergoing surgery. Through validated assessment
      measures, the research team will study the effects of caffeine in relation to postoperative
      opioid requirements, pain, and neuropsychological (e.g., cognition, depression, anxiety)
      trajectory after surgery.
