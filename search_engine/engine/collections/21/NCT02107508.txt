      analysis (BIA) with Inbody 720 (Biospace, Seoul, South Korea). Anthropometric dimensions will
      be recorded for all participants according to standard procedures. Height will be recorded to
      the nearest 1.0mm by using a field stadiometer (Seca Corporation, Germany). FitMate metabolic
      system (Cosmed, Rome, Italy) will be used to estimate AEE. Subjects will be tested in a
      10-minute submaximal exercise test using the FitMate systems while taking cycling test at 50
      Watts on an electrically braked bicycle ergometer. Each subject will be connected to a
      calibrated respiratory gas analyzer, a portable metabolic analyzer designed for measurement
      of oxygen consumption during exercise via a face mask. Heart rate will be simultaneously
      measured with the use of a Cosmed wireless HR monitor to track the participant's heart rate
      level.
