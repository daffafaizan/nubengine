      outside the uterine cavity. This tissue proliferates and causes chronic inflammation
      resulting in pain and excessive menstrual bleeding. Conventional treatment includes surgical
      and pharmacological therapy aiming at reducing painful symptoms. However, there is an unmet
      need in finding optimally safe and effective treatment. This study aimed to evaluate the
      effect of V-Endo on pain levels in women with endometriosis, focusing on reducing
      inflammation by immunotherapeutic intervention.
