      Primary

        -  To evaluate the response rates in patients with relapsed follicular non-Hodgkin lymphoma
           treated with short-duration rituximab and combination chemotherapy (R-chemo) followed by
           rituximab and yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan.

      Secondary

        -  To evaluate the duration of response in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  To evaluate the quality of response in order to determine the conversion rate from
           partial response to complete response in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  To evaluate the toxicity of yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan when administered after 3
           courses of R-chemo.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

        -  Chemoimmunotherapy (R-CHOP or R-CVP): Patients receive R-CHOP comprising rituximab IV,
           cyclophosphamide IV, doxorubicin hydrochloride IV, and vincristine IV on day 1 and oral
           prednisolone on days 1-5. Alternatively, patients who have already been exposed to prior
           tolerance doses of anthracyclines receive R-CVP comprising rituximab IV,
           cyclophosphamide IV, and vincristine IV on day 1 and oral prednisolone on days 1-5.
           Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to 3 courses.

      Patients with objective evidence of response on CT scan or those with < 25% bone marrow
      involvement and no signs of bone marrow hypocellularity (< 15%) on bone marrow biopsy proceed
      to radioimmunotherapy.

        -  Radioimmunotherapy: Four to 6 weeks after completion of R-CHOP or R-CVP, patients
           receive rituximab IV followed no more than 4 hours later by yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab
           tiuxetan IV over 10 minutes.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically for up to 5 years.
