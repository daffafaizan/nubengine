      : 25 people will do the "classical rehabilitation" and the other 25 will have a treatment
      with virtual reality.

      Each group (virtual reality and "classical rehabilitation") is going to follow 12 weeks of
      rehabilitation, at a rate of 2x 30 minutes per week. In "virtual reality group", each session
      will be divided in two parts : 15 minutes of virtual reality exercises and 15 minutes of
      exercises from "classical program". Exercises suggested in the classical program have been
      chosen among evidence based exercises described in literature.

      Before the beginning of rehabilitation sessions, participants will be assessed at the
      Laboratory of Human Motion Analysis of the University of Liege. At this place, EMG activity
      of periscapular muscles (upper trapezius, lower trapezius and serratus anterior) (Delsys
      Trigno) , 3D scapular kinematics (Codamotion) will be assessed on the painful side when doing
      shoulder elevations in sagittal and in frontal planes. Maximum isometric strength will also
      be assessed using handheld dynamometer (MicroFet2) in 3 different positions (SeatedU90°,
      SeatedU125°, Prone-v-thumbs up)

      This first evaluation will be done after the 12 week of rehabilitation too, with the same
      method.

      Participants will also have to complete Dash (Disability of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand)
      questionnaire 3 times during the study (at the beginning, at 6 weeks and at the end of the
      study). Moreover, pain score will be asked to participants at each rehabilitation session.
