      centers in the province of Barcelona: Hospital El Carme Badalona, Sanitary Center of Les
      Corts and Sarri√†.

      The therapy sessions are conducted by an expert in group therapy (from the sponsor Pasqual
      Maragall Foundation) and the social worker of each of the centers. The study takes place for
      four months and consists of weekly therapy sessions of an hour and a half each (14 sessions
      in total), based on cognitive and behavioral theory. The participants and the control group
      are evaluated at the beginning and at the end of the study in terms of mood, quality of life,
      anxiety and depression.

      This study aims to demonstrate that Alzheimer's patient's caregivers can benefit from group
      counseling, resulting in an improvement in their emotional state, perceived burden, quality
      of life and a more positive attitude coping with the new situation.
