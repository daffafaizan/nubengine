      term of clinical presentation(display) and evolutionary profile. The therapeutic
      coverage(care) of the patients would thus be personalized Such an approach remains still in
      its infancy in 2017. Better know the factors which determine the evolutionary clinical
      subcategories is a major question of the current researches on the Parkinson disease.
      Nigrostriaial inflammation is an interesting candidate. Microglia activation is closely
      associated with the degenerative process.

      Development of the molecular imaging allows to study nigrostriatal inflammation in vivo in
      human by positron emission tomography (PET) by using the radiotracer of the protein of
      translocation of 18KDa ( TSPO), considered as a marker of microglia activation Some studies
      showed an increase of the inflammation in the striatum and in the substantia nigra, the sites
      of the dopaminergic degeneration (The lesional core of the Parkinson disease is the damage of
      the dopaminergic nigrostriatale way). However data remain rare and concern small number of
      patients. Some data are inconsistent because of problems of specificity of the ligands used
      and variation between populations of studied patients (duration of disease evolution).

      In this study, investigators suggest studying by imaging TEP using a ligand new of the TSPO,
      [18F]DPA-714, microglial brain activation in the early stage of the Parkinson disease and
      determine wether it is predictive of speed of disease progression.
