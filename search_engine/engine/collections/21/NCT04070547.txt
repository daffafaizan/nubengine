      indicates that a large number of individuals are at high risk for cognitive impairment from
      many causes as they age. In order to preserve and enhance positive cognitive health outcomes
      by targeted efficient preventive and therapeutic strategies, it is important to understand
      potential mechanisms and predictors of cognitive health and impairment. Withdrawal of vagal
      (parasympathetic) activity has been proposed as one of the biological pathways involved in
      cognitive impairment. Transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS) has shown potential as
      noninvasive and safe therapeutic treatment due to its direct influence on brain systems
      involved in cognition. However, the role of vagal modulation in cognitive functioning and
      impairment and the influence of tVNS, particularly long-term tVNS, on cognition are not yet
      completely understood. Here the investigators aim to investigate the effect of long-term
      (14days) intensive transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation on cognitive functions in
      relatively healthy young-to-older adults.

      Little work has been done investigating the effect of long-term tVNS in healthy men and
      women. In light of preventive medicine, the question is whether increased vagus nerve
      modulation and long-term tVNS improve memory and executive functioning and potentially help
      to prevent healthy person vulnerable to cognitive impairment from manifesting cognitive
      deficits. Or if they can slow down the process of cognitive aging inevitable for every human
      being.
