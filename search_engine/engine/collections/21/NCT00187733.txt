      carrier frequency of disease-causing alleles of OCTN2, or of more common functional
      polymorphisms in this gene. To address these issues, we screened for genetic variants in the
      OCTN2 coding region by direct sequencing of the exons and flanking intronic region of OCTN2
      in a large sample (n = 276) of ethnically diverse subjects. In addition, we established
      lymphoblastoid cell lines from subjects homozygous for either allele of the previously
      identified promoter region variant, -207G>C. We found eight amino acid sequence variants of
      OCTN2, of which three (Phe17Leu, Leu144Phe, and Pro549Ser) were polymorphic in at least one
      ethnic group. When assayed for functional activity by expression in human embryonic kidney
      293 cells, using as probes both the endogenous substrate (l-carnitine) and the organic cation
      tetraethylammonium, three variants showed functional differences from the reference OCTN2
      (Phe17Leu, Tyr449Asp, Val481Phe; p < 0.05). Further studies of the Phe17Leu polymorphism
      showed a reduced V(max) for l-carnitine transport to approximately 50% of the reference
      OCTN2. Confocal microscopy studies using an OCTN2-GFP fusion protein showed that Phe17Leu had
      distinct subcellular localization from the reference OCTN2, with diffuse cytoplasmic
      retention of Phe17Leu, in contrast to reference OCTN2, which localized specifically to the
      plasma membrane. Lymphoblasts from subjects homozygous for the -207G allele showed increased
      l-carnitine transport compared with the -207C/C homozygotes (p < 0.05). This study suggests
      that although loss-of-function mutations in OCTN2 are likely to be rare, common variants of
      OCTN2 found in healthy populations may contribute to variation in the disposition of
      carnitine and some clinically used drugs.
