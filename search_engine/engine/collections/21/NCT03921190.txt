      technique to anesthetise maxillary posterior teeth is buccal infiltration with a local
      anesthetic agent. The technique described in the literature focuses on the location of
      injection, the direction of the needle insertion in relation to the root apex, the direction
      of needle bevel in relation to the cortical bone plate, the size of needle and the type and
      amount of the local anesthetic agent used. However, there is no mention to whether the
      patient should open their mouth or maintain their teeth in intercuspation during the
      injection procedure.

      Aims: This research aims to a) compare two techniques of injection (open and closed-mouth
      techniques) in terms of the discomfort experienced by patients during the injection procedure
      and b) evaluate the dentists' preference in performing either of the two techniques.
