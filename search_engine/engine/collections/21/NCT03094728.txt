      January 2016 at in Ain Shams Center for Organ Transplantation (ASCOT) .

      HLA Typing and Mismatch:

      Preoperative blood samples from all recipients and donors were collected. The serological
      tissue typing for HLA was performed by a SSP-PCR (sequence-specific- primer). HLA-A, HLA- B,
      and HLA-DR loci were examined and used to calculate mismatch scores. The locus-specific type
      of HLA mismatch, as well as the degree of HLA mismatch, was then assessed. For each locus
      individually, the mismatch number was scored as 0, 1, or 2, on the basis of the number of
      donor alleles not shared with the respective recipient. Each patient was assigned an overall
      total score depending on the total number of mismatches at the 3 loci, ranging from 0 (no
      mismatches at any loci) to 6 (mismatches at all loci)

      Cross matching (total and autocross):

      Crossmatch involves placing recipient serum (potentially containing donor-specific anti-HLA
      antibodies) onto donor lymphocytes (containing HLA antigens).A cytotoxic reaction (deemed
      'positive') suggests the presence of preformed DSAbs (donor specific antibodies).

      Autoantibodies are generally IgM rather than IgG antibodies. To establish if autoantibodies
      are responsible for the result an auto-crossmatch should be performed. In this assay,
      recipient serum is crossmatched against recipient (rather than donor) lymphocytes. Second,
      the original crossmatch should be repeated with the addition of the agent Dithiothreitol
      (DTT). DTT reduces the disulfide bonds in IgM thereby preventing IgM antibodies from
      generating a positive result. IgM antibodies are generally regarded as having no pathological
      significance in transplantation.
