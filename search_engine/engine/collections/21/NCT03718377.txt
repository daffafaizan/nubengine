      reduce surgical stress in terms of operation technique, which is video-assisted thoracoscopic
      surgery. Although it has reduced postoperative pain and complications compared with
      thoracotomy, VATS is still quite painful operation.

      Serratus plane block is a novel technique which provide analgesic effect for lateral chest
      wall by blocking lateral branch of intercostal nerve. It has been reported to be used for
      pain management including rib fracture, herpes zoster, and postoperative pain. It has become
      a popular analgesic modality because it is easy to perform and relatively safe. However, the
      effect of serratus plane block during intraoperative period has not yet been studied.

      In this study, therefore, the investigators decided to assess the effect of serratus plane
      block on intraoperative opioid consumption, emergence time and hemodynamic stability in
      patients undergoing video-assisted thoracic surgery.
