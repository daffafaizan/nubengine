    
      Thirty (30) intrabony defects are randomly divided in two treatment groups: test (n = 15) and
      control (n = 15). The intrabony defects are filled with A-PRF+ (n=15) in the test group,
      respectively treated with open flap debridement in the control group, and fixed with sutures
      to ensure wound closure and stability.
