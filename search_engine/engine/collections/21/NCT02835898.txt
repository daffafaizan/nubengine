      periodontal pocket depth (PPD) and clinical attachment level (CAL) were registered at the
      biopsy site, for all study participants. Following the registration of the clinical
      parameters, gingival biopsies were obtained from the periodontally-healthy individuals during
      crown lengthening surgery or surgical removal of wisdom teeth. In the periodontally-diseased
      group, biopsies were harvested from two sites: healthy site and periodontally-involved site.
      After harvesting of biopsies, patients with periodontal disease underwent scaling and root
      planing.

      Two weeks after periodontal treatment: Clinical parameters were registered and gingival
      biopsies were harvested (from two sites) for the periodontally-diseased group only, to
      evaluate if the epigenetic patterns (DNA methylation) were altered by conventional
      periodontal therapy, in comparison to the patterns observed at baseline for both diseased and
      healthy groups.

      Two months after initial periodontal treatment: Clinical parameters were registered and
      gingival biopsies were harvested (from two sites) for the periodontally-diseased group only,
      to evaluate if the epigenetic patterns were still altered by conventional periodontal
      therapy, in comparison to the patterns observed at baseline for both diseased and healthy
      groups, and at 15 days for the diseased group.
