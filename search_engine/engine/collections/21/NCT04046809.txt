      proven effective therapy involves reduction of intraocular pressure (IOP). Although treatment
      effect is quite large, a significant proportion of patients show disease progression with
      apparently controlled IOP. Given the similarities with other neurodegenerative diseases -
      particularly in the mechanisms of cell death -neuroprotective treatments have been tried also
      in glaucoma. Interesting results from experimental studies and weak evidence from human
      glaucoma trials have been published in recent years. Citicoline is one of the promising
      molecules with a putative neuroprotective action and has been tried on patients with a number
      of neurodegenerative diseases with encouraging results. Pilot studies on glaucomatous
      patients showed a possible effect of citicoline in reducing progression of visual field
      changes, though these findings need to be confirmed by larger randomized clinical trials.

      The aim of this randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled, cross-over study is to test
      whether the intake of NeurotidineÂ® (citicoline free acid in oral solution) can be associated
      with an improvement of quality of life in patients with glaucoma.
