      determine whether they carry SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The blood test data will be collected as
      allowed by the EUA using the CoronaCideTM COVID-19 IgM/IgG Rapid Test and the Premier Biotech
      COVID-19 IgM/IgG Rapid Test. Both COVID-19 IgM/IgG Rapid Tests are intended for
      Over-The-Counter/Professional use as a screening aid in the diagnosis of primary and
      secondary SARSCoV-2 infections, and are only for use under the FDA's EUA.

      The RNA test data will be collected via a nasopharyngeal swab and processed using the Abbott
      ID NOW COVID-19 diagnostic test.
