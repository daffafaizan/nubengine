      nutrition education on, and short-term partial feeding of, specific plant foods high in the
      antioxidant glutathione will impact total glutathione status, gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT)
      activity, glucose control or insulin sensitivity in people with type 2 diabetes. Dietary
      education will include information on plant sources of glutathione, as well as, cooking
      methods to reduce glycation and lipid peroxidation during cooking, which may indirectly alter
      glutathione status by reduce demand for elimination of these compounds. Participants will be
      randomized to one of two groups: the educational intervention plus partial feeding of two
      small meals per day vs. a wait list control group that will receive standard advice on
      nutrition for diabetes. After 12 weeks, the intervention group will no longer receive foods,
      but will be followed for 12 additional weeks to determine if lasting effects are achieved.
      After 12 weeks, the control group will receive access to the educational materials, but will
      not receive study foods, to see if the educational intervention alone impacts food/nutrition
      choices. Both groups will have lab measures (as described above) again after this additional
      12 weeks, for a total duration of 24 weeks in the trial.
