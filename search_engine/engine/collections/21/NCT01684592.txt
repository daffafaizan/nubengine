      postpartum, highlighting a need for effective postpartum continuing care that supports women
      through the challenging postpartum period when stress is high and motivation to stay quit may
      decline. Existing relapse prevention interventions (typically delivered during pregnancy)
      have been found to be of little benefit during the postpartum period, suggesting the need for
      a more formal continuing care approach. Phone-based protocols for smoking cessation have been
      widely disseminated and effective because they address the need for flexible access, but are
      passive and not typically utilized by women in the postpartum period.

      The proposed pilot study will develop and test a Phone-based Postpartum Continuing Care
      (PPCC) model that draws from existing evidence-based protocols--the 5 A's and Recovery
      Management Checkups (RMC)-- shown to be effective with other populations. The experimental
      PPCC will reinforce the importance of abstinence, relapse prevention, and reduced smoking
      through proactive re-intervention (i.e., RMC) with the 5 A's at times when postpartum women
      are more likely to relapse, and provide education and monitoring of the infant's direct and
      indirect exposure to nicotine through breastfeeding and secondhand smoke. We will evaluate
      PPCC's effectiveness relative to a passive referral to a 24/7 hotline, which is current
      standard care.

      Approximately one hundred thirty women in their first or second trimester of pregnancy who
      were nicotine-dependent in the past year, currently smoke, or quit within the past 90 days
      will be recruited at their first prenatal appointment at the Maryland Women's Center (MWC) in
      Baltimore, Maryland. All women will receive the clinic's standard of care for smoking
      cessation--the 5 A's --during pregnancy from their physician. Half will be randomly assigned
      to an experimental group getting PPCC for 6 months postpartum and half to a control group
      receiving only a referral to a passive 24/7 state quit line postpartum. It is expected that
      in the 6 months following childbirth women in the experimental PPCC (relative to those in the
      control group) will: a) smoke fewer cigarettes, b) smoke fewer days, c) go longer before
      postpartum relapse, d) have less time between relapse and talking to a health professional
      about smoking, e) have less time between relapse and resumption of abstinence , f) smoke
      fewer times while breastfeeding, g) smoke fewer times while in the same room as the infant,
      and h) reduce their infant's cotinine levels.

      The aims of this pilot project are to develop PPCC from existing evidence-based approaches,
      demonstrate the feasibility of implementing the PPCC intervention with at least 80%
      compliance and at least 80% follow-up at each wave, and evaluate the effect size associated
      with receiving standard care vs. standard care + PPCC in order to understand the promise of
      and appropriate power required for a larger clinical trial.
