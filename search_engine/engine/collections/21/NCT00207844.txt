      multiple organ failure, is a public health issue because of its frequency (> 1/1000
      inhabitants per year), its cost and its 45% mortality rate, remaining high despite all the
      improvements made in ICU for the past 20 years. His physiopathology is better understood with
      increasing data supporting the key role of free radicals, and a more than 40% plasma selenium
      concentration decrease that maybe associated with increased morbidity and mortality.
      Meanwhile, for the past 30 years, researches have been conducted on the essential trace
      element selenium for its requirement for key antioxidant enzymes, through the 21st aa
      selenocystein, and also for its potentially toxic, pro-oxidant properties. In septic shock,
      both properties may be useful, antioxidant enzymatic to increase cell defense especially
      endothelial cells, and direct pro-oxidant action to decrease the genomic response, especially
      on phagocytic cells.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the effects of a high dose of selenium
      administration, such as selenite, at pro-oxydant initial dose followed by anti-oxidant dose
      in severe septic shock patients with documented infection. The initial dose was chosen as the
      highest dose of selenium, as sodium selenite, estimated without severe adverse effects in
      healthy people for a one-day ingestion. The patients are randomized to receive either the
      placebo or the selenite at this high initial dose followed by lower doses on a 9-day period.
      The efficacy will be evaluated by the weaning time of catecholamines, with a special
      attention to the 6-month mortality rate as first secondary end point.
