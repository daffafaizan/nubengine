      of generating postanesthetic delirium and behavioral changes in the postoperative period up
      to 67% of cases.

      For the management of preoperative anxiety there are pharmacological and non-pharmacological
      treatments. Within the first group there's the use of benzodiazepines of short half life like
      midazolam, however, the use of this medication is not exempt of risks such as paradox
      reactions, respiratory depression, among others. This is why the non pharmacological mesures
      have taken force and every day there is more evidence regarding its effectiveness.

      There are no reports in Chile or latin america regarding the use of this tools, this is why
      the investigators designed this study to prove the effectiveness of audiovisual distraction
      measures in reducing preparatory anxiety compared to premeditation with midazolam.
