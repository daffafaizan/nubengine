      assessment of ECG and saturation, the investigators would like to estimate muscle relaxation
      by using two different methods: a TOF-Cuff which additionally allows to measure inoperative
      blood pressure and TOF-Scan with different sensor. Our aim is to compare two different
      methods of muscle relaxation monitoring in patients who will administer muscle relaxant -
      mivacurium. After receiving painkillers and hypnotics, when the patient is falling asleep,
      the standard dose of mivacurium 0.2 mg / kg body weight will be administered. Then, painless
      simultaneous stimulation with TOF-Cuff and TOF-Scan devices will begin. Until intubation,
      measurements will be made in every 30 seconds and then every 5 minutes until extubation.
      Extubation will take place according to the guidelines when the TOF-Cuff measurement on the
      arm is greater than 0.9 - this is the value at which the patient is considered ready to start
      breathing on his own. The following will be documented: the initiation of drug
      administration, intubation, possible repeated doses of mivacurium 2 mg, antagonization,
      extubation, possible side effects (e.g., transient cardiac disturbances, reddening of the
      skin, lowering blood pressure, bronchospasm, erythema, urticaria) and technical problems.
