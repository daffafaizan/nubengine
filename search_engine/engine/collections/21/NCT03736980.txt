      independent study groups will be conducted. The number of subjects, testing procedures and
      dose of psilocybin for each group are as follows: group 1 (20 subjects, EEG, questionnaires,
      0.200 mg/Kg body weight), group 2 (30 subjects, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI),
      questionnaires, 0.200 mg/Kg body weight), group 3 (10 subjects, fMRI, questionnaires, 0.215
      mg/Kg body weight), study group 4 (80 subjects, blood serum and saliva parameters,
      questionnaires, fMRI (only in 20 subjects from this group), 0.315 mg/Kg body weight). The
      groups 1, 2 and 3 involve healthy volunteers. The group 4 involves healthy volunteer
      long-term and short-term meditators during a 5-day group meditation retreat. Together, 140
      subjects will participate in the study.
