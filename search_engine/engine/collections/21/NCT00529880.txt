    
      -  A second course of induction chemotherapy can be given to the patient when a partial
           remission but less than a complete remission is achieved after the first course. At
           least 4 weeks should be apart between start of the first course and start of the second
           course.

        -  G-CSF (Lenograstim) 250 g/day will begin to be administered after the confirmation of
           hypocellular bone marrow with blasts less than 5% on day 14 or later until absolute
           neutrophil counts are 1,000/l or more.

        -  For the patients who achieve a complete remission, consolidation therapy will be given
           as follows:

             -  Two more cycles of the same chemotherapy will be given to the patients who achieve
                a complete remission after single induction course. Allogeneic or autologous
                hematopoietic cell transplantation could be also considered.

             -  In patients who relapse after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation, donor
                leukocyte infusion will be done without consolidation chemotherapy.

             -  In patients who had extramedullary relapse(s), local radiotherapy can be given to
                the relapse site(s).
