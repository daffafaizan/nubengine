      center will be enrolled in this study. Eligible patients had active UC with a Mayo score of
      6-12 points (moderate or severe disease activity). The investigators will evaluate whether
      CMV-specific cell-mediated immune response at admission will predict the risk of active
      cytomegalovirus infection (true pathogen versus bystander).
