      changes in the ADC factor, in the onset of tumor recurrence or progression in patients
      showing no residual tumor at the end a treatment by chemoradiotherapy for squamous cell
      carcinoma of head and neck seat.

      compare the characteristics of diffusion MRI, such as ADC coefficient, between patients with
      residual tumor and patients with no residual tumor after chemoradiotherapy for squamous cell
      carcinoma of head and neck location.
