      hernias often require a complex abdominal wall reconstruction including creating tissue
      advancement flaps. Complex abdominal wall reconstructions are associated with up to 20% rate
      of wound complications including skin flap necrosis and wound breakdowns. Prevention of skin
      necrosis and ischemia would significantly reduce the morbidity associated with these
      procedures.
