    
      This research study is for patients who have relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma
      following treatment such as radiotherapy, immunotherapy, chemotherapy, or radioimmunotherapy.
      Chemotherapy agents such as gemcitabine, cytarabine, chlorambucil, fludarabine, or the
      immunotherapeutic agent, rituximab, may be proposed. Thus, the aim is to search for new
      treatments that may improve the prognosis of patients with relapsed mantle cell lymphoma.

      The present clinical study aims at determining if lenalidomide is safe and active in patients
      with mantle cell lymphoma who are refractory to their treatment or have relapsed once, twice
      or three times. Enrollment goal was met on March 7th 2013 and thus enrollment was stopped.
