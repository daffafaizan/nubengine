      experimental work has administered alcohol to individuals in isolation. This study will
      examine the effects of alcohol in social groups and test whether these responses predict the
      escalation of alcohol use and development of alcohol use disorder symptoms. Participants will
      also complete smartphone surveys querying subjective responses to alcohol in their daily
      lives.

      N=400 male and female young adults will participate in a laboratory session with two other
      participants and will consume either a moderate dose of alcohol or placebo beverage.
      Subjective and objective responses to alcohol will be assessed. Participants will also
      complete surveys on their smartphones; these will occur during drinking episodes and at
      random times throughout the day. Follow-up sessions will occur at 6-months and 12-months, to
      collect information about drinking habits and potential alcohol-related problems.
