      be measured in urine, for children under the age of 3. Sleep and behavioral questionnaires
      will be completed by parents and/or teachers. This study involves an optional, 1-year
      melatonin treatment sub-study, in which the children will take 0.1 - 3mg daily. A second
      optional sub-study involves a study of the child's sleep through polysomnography, in order to
      identify possible sleep disorders.
