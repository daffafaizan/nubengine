      means of manipulating energy expenditure and potentially anti-obesity and anti-diabetic
      properties of the tissue. This is well established in rodent studies and explained as due to
      the specific brown fat uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1). Despite increasing evidence that
      indicates a metabolic regulatory role of BAT in humans, BAT activation/recruitment is not
      fully understood and even less is known about the endocrine capacities of human BAT.

      Cold induced brown fat activity will be assessed with PET/MR scans and validate an infra-red
      thermography camera, as well as perform a proteomic screening using blood samples under these
      two intervention days.

      15 healthy lean male subjects will serve as their own control in a cross-over randomized
      control study, including a pre-examination day, a thermoneutral-day and a cooling test-day
      with cold exposure followed by a PET/MR scan to determine BAT activity. An extra cooling day
      is applied for the external validation of the infrared thermography camera. Blood samples and
      abdominal fat-biopsies will be taken at thermoneutral condition and under cold stimulation of
      brown fat.
