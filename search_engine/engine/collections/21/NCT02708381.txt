    
      This is a multicenter study to test a real time consultation system using the Total Cancer
      CareTM database (TCC) cohort at the H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, Florida, USA. The
      purpose is to make Moffitt's expertise available to private practice oncologists throughout
      Florida. An oncologist seeing an older patient with a difficult case could send key patient
      parameters to a senior adult expert at Moffitt. The TCC concierge would extract from the TCC
      database patients with similar characteristics. The oncogeriatric information team (OGIT)
      would review those cases and provide a summary report of treatments received and outcomes.
      The treating oncologist could then use that as an on-demand case series to help in the
      decision making. In order to pilot and build up the large scale intervention, several steps
      are necessary. The first step was a scenario testing with vignettes, which allowed tracing
      the most effective way of retrieving and formatting the information. The next step will be a
      pilot testing of the intervention in real time with one private practice.

      Primary Aims:

      To assess which format of expert-vetted database consultation and patient selection is the
      most useful to a private practice oncologist. We will test a model of approach and gain
      feedback on subjective utility and objective treatment modification profiles, in order to
      target a future study towards the stakeholders most likely to benefit. Impact of the
      consultation on treatment plan (per pre-post e-mails). Availability of similar patients in
      the TCC database.
