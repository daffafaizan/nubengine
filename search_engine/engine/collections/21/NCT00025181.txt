        -  Determine the safety and adverse event profile of anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated
           antigen-4 monoclonal antibody combined with tyrosinase:368-376, gp100:209-217, and
           MART-1:26-35 peptides emulsified in Montanide ISA-51 in patients with resected stage III
           or IV melanoma.

        -  Determine if this regimen causes antigen-specific T-cell activation in these patients.

        -  Determine the clearance profile of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Assess the development of host immune response in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4
      monoclonal antibody (MDX-CTLA4).

      Patients receive tyrosinase:368-376, gp100:209-217, and MART-1:26-35 peptides emulsified in
      Montanide ISA-51 subcutaneously followed by MDX-CTLA4 IV over 90 minutes at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
      8, and 11 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of at least 6 patients receive escalating doses of MDX-CTLA4 until the maximum
      tolerated dose is determined.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 2 years, and then
      annually thereafter until disease progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18 patients will be accrued for this study.
