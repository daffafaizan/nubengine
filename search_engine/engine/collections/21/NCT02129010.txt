      value of the CSF-biomarkers tau-proteine and amyloid-β 40 and 42 in patients with
      aneurysmatic subarachnoidal hemorrhage are investigated. Intracranial opening pressure will
      be measured in patients requiring CSF-diversion for acute hydrocephalus and correlated with
      the incidence of Terson syndrome tested by an opthalmologic exam (group A: Terson syndrome
      positive, group B: Terson syndrome negative). CSF samples from external ventricular drainages
      are obtained at day 0, 2 and 6 and concentration of tau-protein and amyloid-β 40 and 42 are
      determined and correlated to secondary outcome measures such as delayed cerebral ischemia,
      clinical vasospasm, re-bleed, necessity for surgical intervention secondary to raised
      intracranial pressure or CSF-diversion. Outcome in terms of Glasgow-Outcome-Scale-Extended
      and Euro-Qol-5 will be assessed at 3, 6 and 12 months.

      CSF from patients undergoing diagnostic or therapeutic tapping of their internal ventricles
      for normal pressure hydrocephalus or shunt diagnostics serve as a reference for
      CSF-biomarkers concentration in healthy individuals.
