      brought negative effects on human health, such as rapid increasing incidence of obesity,
      metabolic cardiovascular diseases, and mental disorders. The first line of prevention and
      therapy for these diseases is proper diet and lifestyle interventions. A series of studies
      conducted in vivo and vitro have shown that high-fiber diets and time-restricted eating
      present benefits in weight loss, reducing cardiovascular disease risk, and improving
      cognitive function. While, there is also a randomized controlled trial do not observe the
      effects of time-restricted eating on weight loss and decrease of metabolic risks. Meanwhile,
      few studies have examined the effects of high-fiber diets or time-restricted eating on
      executive function. Additionally, previous studies on high-fiber diets and time-restricted
      eating focused on middle-aged or elderly populations with some features of metabolic
      syndrome, while the effects on healthy young populations are unclear. More importantly, there
      are a small amount of studies exploring the combined effects of time-restricted eating and
      physical activity on metabolism and cognitive function. Therefore, our study is to estimate
      the effects of diet (high-fiber diets and time-restricted eating) and exercise
      (rope-skipping) interventions on body weight, cardiovascular metabolic markers, executive
      function, and intestinal flora among undergraduate students, as well as the underlying
      mechanisms.
