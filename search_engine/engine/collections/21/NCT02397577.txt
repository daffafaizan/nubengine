      a 13C-sodium acetate breath test. Healthy volunteers (n=75) will eat a solid test meal of
      scrambled eggs and toast containing 13C-octanoate. 13C-content of exhaled air will be
      measured at baseline and followed for the next 4 hours. One week later, the healthy
      volunteers (n=75) will drink a standardized nutritional shake (Ensure Plus Vanille, Abbott)
      containing 13C-sodium acetate. 13C-content of exhaled air will be measured at baseline and
      for the next 4 hours. Estimated gastric emptying time will be calculated using established
      algorithms.
