    
      Evaluation of the safety and performance of Centaflow as routine antenatal assessment of
      placental vascular function as predictor of fetal growth restriction is performed by
      randomizing singleton pregnant women with ultrasound-based gestations for either standard
      care (SC) or SC and Centaflow (CF).

      The subjects will be randomized in ratio 1:1 in both groups and examined in pregnancy weeks
      27-29, 34-36 and 37-39.
