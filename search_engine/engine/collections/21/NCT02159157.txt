    
      This is a prospective, randomized, single institution feasibility trial. The efficacy of an
      exercise intervention during chemotherapy for sedentary breast cancer patients will be
      tested. The investigators goal is to recruit 120 women and men. Assuming 20% attrition rate,
      96 will be randomized to two arms, comparing patients assigned to a physical activity program
      plus general health education materials versus patients assigned to receive standard general
      health education materials only. Study measures will be obtained before intervention, at 24
      weeks, and at the end of the intervention, approximately week 32.
