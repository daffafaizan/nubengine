      is associated with a marked increase in the likelihood of developing invasive breast cancer.
      Since DCIS tends to be associated with microcalcifications, it is detected with an increased
      frequency in patients being screened with mammographic techniques. The treatment of DCIS is
      based on a number of parameters; local treatment depends on the size of the lesion, grade and
      margins. The only systemic treatment currently available is in the form of endocrine therapy;
      it depends on the expression of estrogen receptor (ER). Randomized trials have shown that the
      treatment of DCIS with breast conserving therapy and radiation is as effective as simple
      mastectomy.

      The efficacy of tamoxifen in reducing the incidence of further invasive or non-invasive
      breast cancer has been established. In addition to surgery (with or without radiation),
      patients with ER positive disease also receive anti-estrogen therapy. Current guidelines do
      not recommend any additional therapy for ER-negative DCIS.

      The rationale for the proposed study is based on the observations that HER2 is expressed at
      high levels in higher grades of DCIS, which typically lack ER. In addition, an inverse
      relationship between ER expression and the expression of EGFR has also been demonstrated.
      Lapatinib is active against both these receptors and may have therapeutic action in ER
      negative DCIS.

      We propose to treat the patients with drug in the interval between biopsy diagnosis and
      definitive surgery.
