      Quality Diets for Better Health (QDBH) is a European Union-funded project led by the
      International Potato Center (CIP), in partnership with People in Need (PIN), Emory University
      and with support of governmental organizations and local universities. The 54 month-project
      strives to improve diet quality, primarily of women and young children, through the promotion
      of vitamin A-rich orange flesh sweetpotato (OFSP) production and nutrition education in 41
      kebeles (communities) in SNNPR, reaching an estimated 15000 households. In addition,
      households in a subset of communities will receive a Healthy Baby Toolkit, consisting of a
      marked bowl, slotted spoon, and illustrated counseling card. The Healthy Baby Toolkit is
      designed to promote optimal complementary feeding practices of infants and young children 6
      to 23 months, namely meal volume, meal frequency, and meal thickness.

      As part of this project, Emory University will conduct a longitudinal, cluster randomized
      controlled trial in 20 kebeles to test the effect of the project on vitamin A and energy
      intake, including any added value of the Healthy Baby Toolkit.
