    
      This is a randomized, open-label, active comparator, multiple oral dose study to evaluate the
      safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and anti-hepatitis B virus (HBV) activity of NCO-48
      Fumarate in treatment-naive adults with chronic HBV infection. This study will evaluate the
      safety, viral kinetics, and antiviral activity of 2 different doses of NCO-48 Fumarate over
      28 days of therapy. In addition, the study will evaluate the antiviral activity of an optimal
      dose of NCO-48 Fumarate versus 25 mg tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) over 28 days of therapy.
