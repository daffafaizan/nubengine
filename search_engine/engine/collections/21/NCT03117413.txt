      However, about 2/3 of patients have some residual hearing and these patients usually combine
      two types of auditory information (electrical and acoustical). It is important to know how
      the brain is processing during two distinct stimulations and how it is related to the
      auditory level of performance.

      Patients and controls will undergo a positron emission tomography scan brain imaging session
      during a simplified voice/non-voice discrimination task. For each tasks and brain imaging
      sessions, patients will be stimulated either with the non-implanted ear (acoustical
      stimulation), the cochlear implant (electrical stimulation) and using both modalities in a
      binaural condition.
