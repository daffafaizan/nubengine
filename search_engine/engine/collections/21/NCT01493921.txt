      involving SR-T100 topical gel developed against skin lesions such as AK. Furthermore,
      evaluation of SR-T100 efficacy & tolerability in treating AK lesions are developed as
      secondary objective in this clinical study. Patients with at least two clinically visible,
      discrete, non-hyperkeratotic, non-hypertrophic AK lesions on the arms, shoulder, chest, face
      and or scalp and at least one lesion of greater than or equal to 4mm in diameter within a
      total of 25 cm squared contiguous or non-contiguous treatment are expected to be enrolled.
      Candidate pool is then divided into two groups with random assignments of treatment group or
      placebo group. This randomization scheme will be generated by biostatistics and produced by a
      computer software program that incorporates a standard procedure for generating random
      probabilities. Study procedures include laboratory testings, analytical readings as well as
      clinical assessment practices for treatment efficacy and safety evaluations.
