    
      This study is an open-label study aiming at evaluating the long-term safety and the efficacy
      profile of ABX464 given once a day (o.d) at 50 mg in subjects who have been previously
      enrolled in the ABX464-103 clinical study (induction study) and who are willing to continue
      their treatment. All subjects will receive ABX464 given at 50mg o.d regardless of their
      previous treatment and dose received in the ABX464-103 study (i.e. ABX464 100mg, ABX464 50mg,
      ABX464 25mg or Placebo). The enrolment in this follow-up study will be based on the
      willingness of the subject to carry on his/her participation. Subjects will be treated with
      ABX464 for an overall period of 48 weeks. Subjects will be followed up on a monthly basis.
