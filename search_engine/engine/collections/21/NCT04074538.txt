    
      NCRCC study is a large-scale multicenter study which includes 16 hospitals and research
      centers, establishing a national cohort which consists of two subcohorts (CRC Screening
      Cohort and Colorectal Cancer Patient Cohort).

        1. To assess risk factors for colorectal cancer and evaluate risk prediction model of
           colorectal cancer to identify the high-risk population.

        2. To discover, test and validate new biological markers (e.g. genetic, epigenetic,
           transcriptomic, metabolomics, proteomic and metagenomics biomarkers) for early
           diagnosis, prediction of clinical outcomes (e.g. therapeutic response, toxicity,
           surgical complications) and survivorship endpoints (e.g. recurrence, survival, quality
           of life, second primary cancer).

        3. To estimate associations of epidemiological determinants (e.g. medication and supplement
           use, diet, lifestyle pattern) with clinical outcomes and survivorship endpoints among
           CRC patients.
