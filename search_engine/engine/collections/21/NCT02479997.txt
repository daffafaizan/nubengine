      identify the first lymph node(s) along the lymphatic drainage pathway from the primary tumor
      in the breast to the axillary lymph node basin.

      Last pilot study, sentinel lymph node was successfully identified by using dual method of ICG
      and RI in 5 patients. In this study, when radiolabeled colloid is used, a gamma probe
      identifies radioactivity in the lymph nodes in the axilla. If ICG, RI both used, Near
      infrared fluorescence camera visualized during surgery.

      As investigators measure node detection time from axillary approach moment, investigators are
      going to compare detection rate. (ICG+RI or RI only). And determine the accuracy.

      Sentinel lymph node mapping with both ICG and radiolabeled colloid mapping agents was
      recommended to maximize the likelihood of SLN identification and to minimize the possibility
      of missing SLNs, which could result in a false-negative event.The protocol required that 130
      patients who receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

      In this study investigators expects using mixture of indocyanine green (ICG) with
      radioisotope (RI) has potential to improve sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping in breast cancer
      patients who receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
