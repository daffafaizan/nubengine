      different PCEA protocols in 250 parturients who receive CSE for labor pain. Any patient with
      failed epidural, delivery within 2 hours of epidural insertion, or Cesarean section will be
      excluded from the study. Each patient will be assigned to one of five groups (A - E),
      depending on the day of admission for delivery, excluding Friday and Saturday (observed
      religious holidays). Each group will have 50 patients.
