    
      Hypotheses:

      We hypothesize that patients receiving TPN who develop hyperglycemia experience higher
      morbidity (infections, systemic sepsis, cardiac complications, acute renal failure, length of
      stay) and mortality compared to TPN patients with euglycemia.

      Specific Aim:

      To determine the impact of hyperglycemia on clinical outcome (infection, systemic sepsis,
      cardiac complications, acute renal failure, length of stay, mortality) in patients receiving
      total parenteral nutrition.
