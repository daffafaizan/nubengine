        -  To manage and oversee determination of genome-wide genotypes using common laboratory
           methodologies for young patients with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia
           (ALL).

        -  To provide a mechanism for storing, distributing, and tracking usage of blast and
           germline genomic information for approved projects.

        -  To facilitate research for childhood ALL using genome-wide germline and blast data to
           identify genetic variations associated with important phenotypes: treatment response
           (e.g., relapse risk, minimal residual disease status), adverse effects (e.g.,
           osteonecrosis, infection risk, neurotoxicity), risk of ALL, and risk of ALL subtypes
           (e.g., TEL/AML1, BCR/ABL, T-cell).

        -  To provide a data resource, that can be linked with additional tumor cell information,
           to better characterize the biology and subtypes of childhood ALL.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      DNA from previously collected and banked blood and bone marrow samples is utilized for
      genome-wide genotyping.

      Genotype data is only used to examine specific questions related to the epidemiology and
      etiology of leukemia, response of leukemia to treatment, risk of recurrence, risk for
      development of side effects, and complications related to treatment.
