      which were derived from three cancer-testis antigens, URLC10, CDCA1, and KIF20A, as targets
      for cancer vaccination against lung cancer. In this phase I trial, the investigators examine
      using a combination of these three peptides the safety, immunogenicity, and antitumor effect
      of vaccine treatment for HLA-A*2402-positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients who
      failed to standard therapy.
