    
      Introduction Selective Laser Trabeculoplasty has been shown as a relatively safe and
      effective treatment modality for lowering IOP in various forms of open-angle glaucoma (Latina
      et al). It lowers IOP by increasing aqueous outflow through its effect at cellular level
      possibly either (1) through migration and phagocytosis of trabecular meshwork debris by
      macrophages or (2) by stimulating the proliferation of healthy trabecular and endothelial
      cells.

      Cases who don't achieve target IOP following SLT therapy need additional treatment in form of
      topical medications. Conventionally common topical antiglaucoma medications to treat glaucoma
      after SLT therapy either suppress aqueous secretion (B-blockers or carbonic anhydrase
      inhibitors) or enhances uveoscleral aqueous outflow (Prostaglandin analogues). Since
      Selective Laser Trabeculoplasty acts on outflow pathway, further additional IOP reduction can
      be achieved more effectively by a class of drug which acts on different pathway; on aqueous
      secretion by aqueous suppressants like Cosopt. In contrast drugs acting on outflow pathway
      like prostaglandin analogue ( Xalatan etc) will possibly be less additive in further reducing
      IOP after SLT since SLT also has effect on the same pathway- outflow pathway.

      Previous studies (Fechtner et al. J Ocul Pharmacol Ther. 2005 Jun;21(3):242-9 and Fechtner et
      al. Acta Ophthalmol Scand. 2004 Feb;82(1):42-8.) have shown equal efficacy of Cosopt and
      Latanoprost in reducing IOP in treatment of glaucoma. But to our knowledge, no long term
      prospective study has evaluated aqueous suppressants (Cosopt) and prostaglandin analogues
      with respect to their comparative efficacy in treatment of uncontrolled glaucoma status post
      SLT therapy.

      OBJECTIVE The primary objective of this study is to compare the IOP lowering efficacy of
      aqueous suppressants (Cosopt) and prostaglandin analogues (Xalatan) when used status post SLT
      in the management of Open Angle Glaucoma or Ocular Hypertension.

      INCLUSION CRITERIA 1. Adult subjects of either sex, of any race, eighteen years of age or
      older. 2 Diagnosis: Primary Open Angle Glaucoma, Pseudoexfoliation Glaucoma, Ocular
      Hypertension.

      3. Mild to moderate glaucoma only: Pattern standard deviation (PSD); more than 1DB and less
      than 6 DB on Humphrey Visual Field.

      3. Subject may be;

        -  A newly diagnosed glaucoma or

        -  A pre-existing glaucoma on not more than two topical antiglaucoma medications. 3 On no
           systemic medications known to increase IOP (e.g. steroids) 4 Visual acuity equal or
           better than 20/200 in the study eye 5. IOP less than 35 mm Hg in the study eye 6 No
           previous intraocular surgery within last 6 months, except laser PI greater than 3 months
           ago.

      EXCLUSION CRITERIA Pigmentary OAG, Proliferative diabetic retinopathy, History of chronic or
      recurrent severe inflammatory eye disease (i.e. scleritis, uveitis, herpes keratitis), known
      allergy to COSOPT or any of Prostaglandin Analogues, Chronic Obstructive Airways Disease
      (COPD), sinus bradycardia (heart rate < 60 beats per minute), second or third-degree
      atrioventricular block, overt cardiac failure. Pregnant and nursing mothers.

      STUDY DESIGN: Single site, unmasked, prospective, randomized study STUDY PROCEDURE

      Visit 1 Visit 2 Visit 3 Visit 4 Visit 5 Visit 6 Screening Phase SLT Treatment Phase Safety
      check 2 weeks after SLT RANDOMIZATION 4 to 6 weeks after SLT Follow up visit, 6 weeks after
      randomization Last Visit 3 months after randomization Determine eligibility by doing routine
      eye exam including IOP check by Goldmann applanation tonometer, Gonioscopy, fundus exam,
      Humphrey Visual Field (if HVF not done within last 6 months).

      Subjects, who fulfill the eligibility criteria and give consent for participating in study,
      will be scheduled for SLT. All eligible subjects will receive SLT. Pre-existing glaucoma
      cases already on antiglaucoma medications will discontinue all the antiglaucoma medications
      since the day of SLT treatment and will be off the drops for next 4 to 6 weeks. Similarly
      newly diagnosed glaucoma will not be on any antiglaucoma medications. for next 4 to 6 weeks.
      Each subject will have IOP check at 2 weeks after SLT treatment. It will be done to rule out
      any unusual IOP spike following SLT. Each subject will have routine eye exam including IOP
      check at this visit. The subjects with uncontrolled IOP despite SLT therapy will be
      randomized to receive either COSOPT or Prostaglandin analogue (XALATAN). IOP check and
      routine eye exam. IOP check, routine eye exam including fundus exam and Humphrey Visual
      Field.

       If IOP is uncontrolled at the visit 5, a stepped drug therapy will be initiated based on
      following protocol:

        1. For patients who are in Cosopt group after randomization. Sequence of additional
           medications will be following:

           First Step: Alphagan (Brimonidine) Second Step: Prostaglandin Analogues

        2. For patients who are in Xalatan group after randomization. Sequence of additional
           medications will be following:

      First Step: Alphagan (Brimonidine) Second Step: Dorzolamide (Trusopt)

      Note: IOP will be measured using a Goldmann Applanation Tonometer at 8 AM and 10 AM at
      visits: Visit I, Visit IV, Visit V and Visit VI. A ± 30 minute window will be allowed for
      each measurement recording.

      IOP measurement at Visit II (SLT treatment phase) and Visit III (safety check) can be done at
      random time.
