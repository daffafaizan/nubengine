      and minerals, has shown during clinical observation the effect of raising energy levels in
      people aged 45-65. It is believed that the mechanism of action is based on enhanced
      production of ATP by mitochondria.

      In this study subjects will be assigned by chance to either the active product group or the
      placebo group. Subjects will take the product for three weeks. Then there will be a two week
      wash out period followed by subjects being crossed over to the other group for a three week
      period. Subjects, assessors, and health providers will be masked as to who is in the active
      product group and who is in the placebo group. Subjects will meet with the primary
      investigator three times during the study, will fill out very short questions once a week,
      and receive phone calls once a week from study personnel.

      This study is a randomized, placebo controlled, triple-blinded, cross-over study that tests
      the hypothesis that OPC Factor produces a response rate of 70% in the active product phase
      versus a 30% response rate during the placebo phase. A response is defined as at least a 20%
      absolute increase on the Energy subscale of the Activation-Deactivation Adjective Check List.
