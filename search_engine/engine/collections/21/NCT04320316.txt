      inhibits the activity of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), leading to an increase in serum
      phosphorus levels. There are multiple disorders (each with a unique underlying cause) that
      result in unusually high circulating levels of FGF23, which in turn result in renal phosphate
      wasting and reduced (or aberrantly normal in relationship to elevated FGF23) levels of
      1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D (1,25[OH]2D). Across these disorders the clinical symptoms are
      similar and often include osteomalacia (and, in children, rickets), muscle weakness, fatigue,
      bone pain, and fractures. KRN23 has been studied in one of these disorders, X-linked
      hypophosphatemia (XLH). In single- and repeat-dose clinical studies in subjects with XLH,
      subcutaneous (SC) administration of KRN23 consistently increased and sustained serum
      phosphorus levels and tubular reabsorption of phosphate (TRP) without a major impact on urine
      calcium levels or vitamin D metabolism. Positive results were also observed in a nonclinical
      pharmacology model of XLH. It is hypothesized that KRN23 may provide clinical benefit in this
      patient due to the common underlying feature in this patient and in patients with XLH -
      abnormally elevated FGF23 in the context of low age -adjusted serum phosphorous levels.
