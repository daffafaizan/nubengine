        -  Determine whether telephone support for patients, provided through a Prevention Care
           Manager (PCM), can increase breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer screening rates
           among minority and low-income women.

        -  Measure the amount of PCM time required to improve early cancer detection provided to
           age-eligible ethnically diverse women seen in community health centers in the New York
           City area.

        -  Learn barriers faced by this population in obtaining indicated services (mammograms, Pap
           tests, fecal occult blood testing, and sigmoidoscopy).

        -  Assess at baseline and follow-up the office environment and work processes in each
           participating center (in PCM randomized controlled study only).

        -  Develop and implement the PCM intervention to help patients overcome barriers.

        -  Evaluate the impact and costs of the PCM in a randomized controlled efficacy trial.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, controlled, single-blind, multicenter study. Patients are
      randomized according to participating center.

        -  Part 1: Some patients undergo a series of structured interviews about the obstacles to
           early cancer detection. Participating sites are assessed for study eligibility.

        -  Part 2: Pilot testing, training, and competency testing of the Prevention Care Managers
           (PCM) are conducted.

        -  Part 3: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 intervention arms.

             -  Arm I: Patients are offered health education and follow-up services by telephone
                with a PCM.

             -  Arm II: Patients receive usual care.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 2,729 (1,413 for PCM randomized controlled study and 1,316 for
      pilot study) patients will be accrued for this study.
