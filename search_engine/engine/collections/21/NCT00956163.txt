      I. To evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of whole-body fluorine F 18 sodium fluoride
      PET/CT scan in detecting bone metastases in patients with high-risk prostate cancer using
      bone scan as the reference standard.

      II. To evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of whole-body MRI in detecting bone
      metastases in patients with high-risk prostate cancer using bone scan as the reference
      standard.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo technetium Tc 99m methylene diphosphonate bone scan, fluorine F 18 sodium
      fluoride PET/CT scan, and whole-body MRI for the detection of bone metastases. Patients with
      discordant imaging results (negative bone scan and positive PET/CT scan and/or MRI) undergo
      additional imaging at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months.
