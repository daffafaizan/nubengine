      experiences occurred in children after general anesthesia (GA). Previous study reported that
      the patient who had marked EA tended to have new-onset of postoperative maladaptive
      behavioral changes.Both pharmacologic and non pharmacologic interventions such as
      preoperative video information, hand held video games were used to reduce preoperative
      anxiety, EA and Post operative behavioral changes. In term of memory creation, short term
      memory (STM) was created. Later that the formation of memory trace requires time, and that
      this trace remains fragile until the long term memory formation process has been completed.
      In this study, the investigators hypothetize that long term memory created by preoperative
      video information can reduce the incidence of post operative behavioral changes.
