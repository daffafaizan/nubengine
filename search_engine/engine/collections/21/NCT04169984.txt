      obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) have been developed in recent years. Myofunctional
      orofacial therapy (MFT) is one of these alternatives and consists of exercises that improve
      mobility and increase muscle strength of the orofacial structures that contribute to the
      etiopathogenesis of OSAS. To date, any study to treat sleep apnea patients under this therapy
      has been conducted in Spain. Moreover, its long-term effect has not been evaluated worldwide.

      Main objective: to compare the reduction in the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) in patients with
      mild to moderate sleep apnea without daytime sleepiness after 12 months of myofunctional
      therapy exercises with respect to the placebo group (the placebo group will be instructed in
      simulation exercises that do not alter the function or morphology of the upper airway)
      Methodology: A 12-month, randomized, parallel-group, clinical trial will be conducted.
      Patients with an AHI â‰¥ 5 events per hour assessed by a respiratory polygraphy (RP) will be
      randomized to a MFT treatment branch or to another placebo exercises branch. A speech
      therapist will instruct patients to perform the exercises in both groups for three months. At
      the end of this period, a RP will be performed on both groups and the same treatment that
      they were doing will be maintained at home. One year later, a new RP will be performed and
      changes in AHI, oximetry parameters and snoring will be compared in both groups, as well as
      sleepiness, quality of life and the degree of adherence to the treatment.
