    
      Approximately 10 subjects with Alzheimer disease (AD) and 8 healthy control (HC)subjects will
      be recruited to participate in this study. All subjects will undergo written informed consent
      and a screening evaluation including baseline clinical laboratory testing, a baseline
      physical and neurological evaluation and baseline cognitive evaluations. Subjects will be
      asked to undergo a bolus injection of [18F]-FMH3. Subjects will undergo serial PET imaging
      scans and plasma sampling for measurement of [18F]-FMH3 in plasma (both protein bound and
      free) over a period of up to 8 hours. The primary imaging outcome measure will be the brain
      regional distribution volumes expressed as a brain tissue to plasma ratio of the radioligand,
      [18F]-FMH3.

      At least 2 weeks following the initial imaging visit, subjects may be asked to return for a
      second injection and scanning procedure to evaluate the reproducibility of the imaging
      measure using this procedure. Subjects may decline to participate in the second scan.
