      PD-1 inhibitor, in cohorts of patients with autoimmune disease. Two cohorts of patients will
      be enrolled, based on autoimmune disease type as outlined below. Entry into cohorts 1 and 2
      will start simultaneously and enroll independently.

      Cohort 1: Rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, giant cell arteritis/polymyalgia rheumatica,
      systemic lupus erythematosis Cohort 2: Other autoimmune diseases (ulcerative colitis, Crohn's
      disease, multiple sclerosis). Patients must be discussed with PI prior to enrollment.

      Patients will be screened within 28 days prior to the start of dosing. Eligible patients will
      be enrolled in either of the two cohorts. Patients will receive treatment every two weeks, in
      an outpatient setting. One cycle is a 28-day period, with Nivolumab given on days 1 and 15 of
      a 28-day cycle. Subjects will be permitted to continue treatment beyond initial RECIST 1.1.
      For each cohort, all patients will be dosed at 240 mg IV. There will be no dose de-escalation
      or escalation from this dose level.

      Participants will be followed with telephone follow up for two years after removal from
      protocol therapy or until death, whichever occurs first. Phone calls will be placed every six
      months and survival follow up obtained. Participants removed from protocol therapy for
      unacceptable adverse event(s) will be followed until resolution or stabilization of the
      adverse event, in addition to the follow up for two years after removal from protocol therapy
      or until death, whichever occurs first.
