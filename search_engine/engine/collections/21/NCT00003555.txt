      in patients with recurrent or refractory solid tumors. II. Assess tumor response rate and
      survival in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of paclitaxel. Patients receive amifostine IV over 5
      minutes or less on day 0, followed by paclitaxel IV over 1 hour once a week for 6 weeks
      followed by 2 weeks of rest. Patients with complete or partial response may receive
      additional courses of therapy. Cohorts of 3-5 patients each receive increasing doses of
      paclitaxel. The maximum tolerated dose is defined as the dose level prior to the cohort at
      which 1 of 3-5 patients experience dose limiting toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 20 patients will be accrued for this study.
