      participate in this randomized controlled trial of LISA premedication. Written informed
      parental consent is acquired from all of the participants. After the consent, individuals
      needing the LISA will receive premedication as follows: caffeine (in case of gestational age
      <32 weeks and not already given), glycopyrrolate, and randomly either ketamine or fentanyl.
      The investigators and medical staff are blinded to the fact which study medication is given.
      This study is a pilot study and 20 patients are recruited for both groups. Randomization is
      done in the blocks of four.

      S-ketamine (Ketanest-S 5 mg/ml) or fentanyl (Fentanyl-Hamel diluted to 5 μg/ml) is used as a
      masked study drug. Both study drug solutions appear equally transparent. Drug administration
      is started with glucopyrrolate (Robinul 0.2 mg/ml), which is given intravenously at a dose of
      5 µg/kg. Thereafter, the masked study drug is administered intravenously slowly in one to two
      minute injection of 0.2 ml/kg. In this way, doses of S-ketamine 1 mg/kg or alternatively
      fentanyl 1 μg/kg is received. After five minutes (from the beginning of administration of the
      study drug), videolaryngoscopy is started. If the study drug does not have sufficient effect,
      the study drug may be repeated with the same dose. If study drug fails to give appropriate
      conditions to LISA procedure, midazolam 0,1 mg/kg can be used as an additional drug.
