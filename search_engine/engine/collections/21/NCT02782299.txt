      make decisions that more align with patients values and goals. Decision aids are validated
      instruments that provide unbiased information and guide patients through questions that allow
      patients to clarify patients goals.

      Older adults with distal radius fractures have increasing evidence of ability to tolerate
      residual deformity with little to no functional deficits, which has called into question the
      indications for surgery. In situations where the operative indications are not clear, it is
      important to engage the patient in the risk and benefits of the decision.

      This trial is a prospective trial with two groups, one standard of care, and one with the
      decision aid.
