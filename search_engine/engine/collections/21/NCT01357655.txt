           Study Design and Duration as current described are no longer applicable since enrollment
           was prematurely concluded due to a decision by the sponsor. Subjects currently enrolled
           in the trial will continue to receive dasatinib alone at a starting dose of 100 mg QD
           for:

             1. a maximum of 5 years after entry into the study

             2. until progression by Investigators determination/judgment

             3. intolerance to Dasatinib

             4. the study is terminated due to safety concerns or

             5. other administrative reasons as communicated by the sponsor

        2. Research Hypothesis :

      The research hypothesis and primary objective of this study as originally designed are no
      longer applicable as subjects enrolment has been terminated due to administrative reasons by
      the sponsor. The objective of the altered design of this study is to describe the safety
      profile and tolerability of dasatinib
