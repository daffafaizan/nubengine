    
      Secondary endpoints:

      Phase I (Remission induction):

        -  The proportion of patients on MTX/HCQ/GC in remission, defined as DAS28<2.6, at week 12
           or week 24 after start of treatment.

        -  The proportion of patients on MTX/GOL in sustained remission, defined as DAS28<2.6 with
           max 4 swollen joints of the 44SJC at 2 consecutive visits 3 months apart, at week 24
           after start of GOL treatment.

        -  Predictors of remission upon treatment with MTX, HCQ and a single injection of i.m. GC
           (e.g. smoking status, BMI, alcohol use, sex, disease duration, DAS28, Rheumatoid Factor
           (RF) -status, Anti-citrullinated protein antibody (ACPA) -status, presence of erosions)

        -  Predictors of remission upon treatment with MTX and GOL (e.g. smoking status, BMI,
           alcohol use, sex, disease duration, DAS28, RF-status, ACPA-status, presence of erosions)

      Phase II (Tapering):

        -  The proportion of patients in sustained remission, defined as DAS28<2.6 with max 4
           swollen joints of the 44SJC at 2 consecutive visits 3 months apart, at week 48 after
           start of tapering MTX first, then GOL or GOL first, then MTX.

        -  The proportion of patients in drug-free sustained remission, defined as DAS28<2.6 with
           max 4 swollen joints of the 44SJC at 2 consecutive visits 3 months apart while off
           anti-rheumatic treatment, at week 48 after start of tapering

        -  Mean disease activity, using the disease activity score assessing 28 joints (DAS28), at
           week 24 and week 48 after start of tapering

        -  Mean functional ability, using the Dutch consensus health assessment questionnaire
           (HAQ), at week 24 and week 48 after start of tapering

        -  Mean quality of life, using the visual analogue scale (VAS) of the EuroQol 5 dimensions
           (EQ5D) questionnaire, at week 24 and week 48 after start of tapering

        -  Mean anxiety and depression (using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)), at
           week 24 and week 48 after start of tapering

        -  Mean fatigue (using the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy Fatigue
           (FACIT-F)), at week 24 and week 48 after start of tapering

        -  The proportion of serious adverse events (SAEs) in the two tapering strategies after 24
           and after 48 weeks.

        -  The time until remission (DAS28<2.6) after retreatment with the last effective dose upon
           flare while tapering MTX/GOL.

      Phase III (Follow-up):

        -  The proportion of patients in drug-free sustained remission, defined as DAS28<2.6 with
           max 4 swollen joints of the 44SJC at 2 consecutive visits 3 months apart while off
           anti-rheumatic treatment, at week 48 after discontinuation of both MTX and GOL

        -  The time until remission, defined as DAS28<2.6, after retreatment in clinical care upon
           flare

        -  The proportion of serious adverse events (SAEs) in the two tapering strategies at week
           24 and week 48.

      Phase II and III:

        -  Cost per extra patient in remission up to week 96 after start of tapering (end of phase
           III)

        -  Cost per Quality Adjusted life Year (QALY) gained up to week 96 after start of tapering
           (end of phase III)

      Overall:

      - The sensitivity and predictive value of the patient reported Routine Assessment of Patient
      Index Data 3 (RAPID3) to detect remission and flare
