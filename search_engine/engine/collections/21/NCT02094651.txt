      Disorders (ASD) that can be considered important biomarkers of cortical dysfunction in these
      disorders. They may represent a measure of the excitatory-inhibitory imbalance posited to be
      involved in the pathogenesis of the disorder. Treatment of epilepsy is always indicated, but
      treatment of isolated epileptiform EEG (i.e. in the absence of clinical seizures) is frankly
      controversial. Since data suggest that these epileptiform discharges are associated with
      deficits in attention, language and behavior, the investigators believe that they may
      represent an important and novel treatment target in this population. The proposed study
      brings together a group of investigators long interested in this problem in order to
      investigate the efficacy of using an anticonvulsant medication with spike suppression
      capabilities (VPA in the form of divalproex sodium) to treat children with ASD and isolated
      epileptiform EEGs. Recruiting from 3 large autism centers (Boston Children's Hospital (BCH)
      and Vanderbilt University (VU) and University of Louisville (U of L)) with very large
      pediatric epilepsy units, the investigators propose a 26 week randomized placebo controlled
      cross over study of VPA in 4-8 year old children with ASD with frequent epileptiform EEG
      discharges.
