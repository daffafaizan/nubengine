      and produce antibodies against the virus. Antibodies are natural proteins made by the body's
      immune system that attack viruses and other germs. These antibodies are found in plasma,
      which is the yellow, clear part of the blood. There have been other studies using plasma to
      treat other types of viruses that showed some positive results. Human plasma containing
      antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 virus is an option for prevention and treatment of COVID-19.
      This type of treatment, known as passive antibody therapy, could be rapidly available when
      there are sufficient numbers of people who have recovered from infection and can donate
      antibody-containing plasma. In contrast to vaccination strategies, which begin to provide
      protection weeks after administration, antibody-containing plasma would provide its
      protective benefits immediately. Additionally, passive antibody therapy may be the only way
      to provide immunity for some immunocompromised patients who do not respond to vaccines.

      This research will evaluate the safety of administration of plasma containing antibodies to
      the SARS-CoV-2 virus (i.e., convalescent plasma). The research will also measure the level of
      anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in patient's blood after the administration of the convalescent
      plasma.
