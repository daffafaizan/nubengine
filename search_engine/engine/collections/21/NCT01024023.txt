      amputee to start to walk again as early as 5 days post amputation (Lein S. 1992). An EWA has
      many benefits including a reduction in oedema (Reith et al, 1992) early gait and balance
      training in preparation for using a prosthesis. The two EWA's most commonly used in the UK
      for transtibial amputees are the Pneumatic Post Amputation Mobility aid (PPAM) and the
      Amputee Mobility Aid (AMA). A comparison of the PPAM aid and the AMA undertaken by Longmore T
      (1997) reported no significant difference in energy cost, comfort or ease of use. Scott et al
      (2000) found the AMA to have higher interface pressures than the PPAM aid. There is however
      no known published evidence on whether an articulated EWA improves active knee control
      following prosthetic delivery and therefore shortens rehabilitation time. In addition there
      is no known published evidence of the effect on quality of life with the two different EWA's.

      Hypothesis: An articulated Early walking aid has benefit to the transtibial amputee compared
      to a non- articulated EWA.

      The purpose of this proposed research is to investigate whether there are any benefits to
      patients in using an articulated EWA.

      The study will use EMG and gait analysis to determine the potential of each of the two EWA's
      to re-educate gait in a way that is comparable with the gait exhibited when the subject
      subsequently begins to use a prosthesis thus shortening rehabilitation time. Quality of life
      indicators will be used to determine the impact on the patient and, in addition, the length
      of time taken to full rehabilitation will be considered.
