      within tumor lesions. Tumour load in NET patients can be measured with
      fluorine-18-L-dihydroxyphenylalanine positron emission tomography (18F-DOPA-PET) scan.

      This aim of the study is to investigate heterogeneity between tumor lesions within patients
      with intestinal NET by determining the differences in tracer uptake measured on a 18F-
      DOPA-PET scan in retrospect.
