      patients, presenting with moderate to severe forehead wrinkles, with sweating ability who had
      never undergone previous BoNT-A injections were enrolled. There were two randomizations, one
      related to the dose-equivalence (2:1U and 2.5:1U), both reconstituted in the same volume of
      0.02 mL per point and another related to the forehead side (left or right) for application of
      the tested drugs. Baseline, twenty-eight and 112 days later, clinical and photographic
      assessments, MinorÂ´s test, and electromyographic (EMG) evaluations were performed.
