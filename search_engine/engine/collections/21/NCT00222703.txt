      protocol deviations will be used to examine the primary aim of this project. The sample will
      consist of 80 consenting smokers prospectively recruited during hospitalization. Subjects
      will be randomly assigned by equal allocation to an intervention group or an enhanced usual
      only group. A baseline adaptive randomization procedure will adjust the random equal ratio of
      treatment assignment to maintain sampling balance of the groups for race (White/Black/Other),
      gender (male/female), and three comorbid categories (only tobacco related illnesses/ tobacco
      related and unrelated to tobacco illnesses/ unrelated to tobacco illnesses). All subjects
      will receive enhanced usual care, which will consist of receiving a supportive message to
      quit smoking and smoking cessation materials. Subjects assigned to the intervention group
      will receive 9 intervention sessions with a nurse aimed to enhance their self-efficacy in
      self-management of tobacco abstinence. These sessions will occur over 12 weeks following
      hospital discharge. All but the initial session will occur by telephone. Subjects will be
      asked to participate with follow-up activities 12 weeks and 24 weeks following their hospital
      discharge, which requires the measurement of exhaled carbon monoxide and the completion of
      questionnaires by self-administration and interview with study personnel. Subjects will exit
      from study following the 24-week follow-up.
