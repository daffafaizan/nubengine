      improvement. Previous manipulative therapy for PFPS (with and without exercise) has been
      limited to the patellofemoral joint alone. However, literature suggests additional
      manipulative therapy with exercise and soft-tissue treatment may give a better outcome.
      Further research is needed.

      Therefore, this project is a pilot study to inform a future randomized controlled trial to
      determine if chiropractic adjusting of the full lower extremity (lumbosacral through foot)
      combined with exercise and soft tissue treatment (Protocol and group A) is superior to
      chiropractic adjusting of the knee (alone) combined with exercise and soft tissue treatment
      (Protocol and group B) in the treatment of patellofemoral pain syndrome. We will use the
      Anterior Knee Pain Scale (AKPS) and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) as valid and reliable primary
      outcome measures, a functional measure (step-ups, step-downs and squats) and a Patient
      Satisfaction Scale (PSS - discharge or refer) as secondary outcome measures. This study will
      help establish the feasibility of conducting quality research at Cleveland Chiropractic
      College Los Angeles.

      In this pilot study there will be two groups of 10 subjects each

        1. Group A will receive CMT to the knee only, exercise and soft tissue treatment (Graston
           Instrument Soft Tissue Mobilization hereafter GISTM)

        2. Group B will receive CMT to the lumbosacral, sacroiliac and (all) lower extremity
           joints, exercise and soft tissue treatment (GISTM).

      Enrolled subjects will receive a total of 6 treatments. The primary endpoint will be a 2
      month follow-up after the 6th treatment.
