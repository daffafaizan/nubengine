      catheterisation with propofol (N = 22) or sevoflurane (N = 18) with ethic committee approval.
      Base excess, pH and lactate were measured by blood gas analysis at the beginning, during and
      at the end of the procedure. Changes relative to baseline were analysed by paired t-Test with
      correction for multiple testing. The study was powered to detect a difference of 1.5 mmol/l
      for base excess and lactate.
