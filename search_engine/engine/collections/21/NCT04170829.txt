      of the candidate ChAdOx1 MERS vaccine in healthy Middle Eastern adult volunteers aged 18-50.
      The first-in-human trial is now being conducted in Oxford in UK healthy adult volunteers. The
      vaccine will be administered intramuscularly.

      Volunteers will be recruited and vaccinated at the King Abdulaziz Medical City, M-NGHA,
      Riyadh. There will be 3 study groups and a total of 24 volunteers will be enrolled. Staggered
      enrolment will apply for the first three volunteers within each group. Volunteers will be
      first recruited into Group 1 and subsequently into Groups 2 and 3 following interim clinical
      safety reviews. Volunteers will be allocated to a study group by selecting eligible
      volunteers for enrolment in the order in which they were deemed eligible, following
      screening.
