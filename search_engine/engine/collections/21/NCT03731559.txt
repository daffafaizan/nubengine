    
      This is a Stage II, randomized, open-label study describing the efficacy and safety of DTG 50
      mg OD with food and DTG 50 mg BID plus 2NRTIs in HIV/TB co-infected patients receiving RIF
      based anti-TB therapy. The study will be conducted in approximately 200 HIV-1 infected
      individuals who are ART-na√Øve and newly diagnosed with probable or confirmed pulmonary,
      pleural, or lymph node (LN) Mycobacterium TB (MTB) taking RIF-containing first-line TB
      treatment. Subjects should have confirmed RIF-sensitive MTB infection as determined by
      GeneXpert (or equivalent approved molecular test) or mycobacterial culture.

      The study is comprised two different stages:

        1. Stage1, investigators will test the safety and tolerability, as well as Pharmacokinetics
           (PK), of two different doses of dolutegravir co-administered with standard anti-TB
           treatment. Overall, 40 HIV/TB patients will be enrolled. They will be randomized to 2
           groups (DTG 50 mg with food and DTG 50 mg BID). Intensive PK of DTG will be performed at
           week 4. Interim analysis will be performed if all 40 cases completed 12 weeks and 24
           weeks. Premature study termination will be set for

             1. proportion of HIV RNA < 50 copies/ml at week 24 between 2 group is different > 20%

             2. DTG 50 mg with food has geometric mean DTG Ctrough < 0.3 mg/L If there is no
                premature study termination met, the study will move to stage 2. Stage 2 will only
                be recruited if two different doses of dolutegravir are well tolerated and safe.

        2. Stage 2: 160 HIV/TB patients will be enrolled. They will be randomized to 2 groups (DTG
           50 mg with food and DTG 50 mg BID). DTG concentration will be performed at week 4 and
           48. Interim analysis will be performed if all 200 cases completed 24 weeks.
