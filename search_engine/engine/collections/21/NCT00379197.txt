      Primary

        -  Determine the efficacy of naltrexone in women with hormone-refractory, metastatic breast
           cancer as measured by serial fludeoxyglucose F 18 positron emission tomography-CT scans.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the safety of naltrexone in these patients.

        -  Determine the median time to event (first time when maximum specific uptake values is
           higher than that at baseline) within 1 year of study entry.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.

      Patients receive oral naltrexone once daily for 8 weeks in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity. After 8 weeks, patients may continue naltrexone off study at the
      discretion of the physician.

      Patients undergo fludeoxyglucose F 18 positron emission tomography-CT scans at baseline, week
      4, week 8, and periodically thereafter.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for up to 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 35 patients will be accrued for this study.
