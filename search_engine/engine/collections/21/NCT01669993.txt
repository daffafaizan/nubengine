      consensus and institutional guidelines. The investigators preliminary experience (Dr.
      Sadhasivam PI: IRB No. 2008-0848) with the pharmocogenetic study, studying the phenotypic and
      genotypic influences of pain and use of opioids in patients undergoing tonsillectomy
      indicates that a significant number of patients scheduled as outpatients experience prolonged
      recovery phases in the PACU, some of whom are admitted or re-admitted following discharge.
      The identification of those factors that are, predictive of adverse events in tonsillectomy
      patients and the development of a prototype prediction model in this single-center study to
      support clinical decision-making. The rationale of this project is that developing a model to
      predict postoperative adverse events will not only lead to improved clinical outcomes and
      enhance patient safety, but also reduce family psychosocial distress associated with
      unanticipated hospital visits or re-admission, while reducing the burden on the health care
      system.
