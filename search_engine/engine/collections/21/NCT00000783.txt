      although still a small percentage of the total number of reported cases, is the most rapidly
      growing category. The rate at which HIV is transmitted between heterosexual couples and the
      factors that may impede or enhance heterosexual transmission are important to understanding
      and slowing the worldwide HIV epidemic.

      This epidemiologic study is composed of three parts. PART A: In a prospective study,
      heterosexual couples who are discordant with respect to HIV infection will be evaluated at
      6-month intervals to determine whether HIV transmission has occurred and to identify
      biological and behavioral factors associated with HIV transmission from the infected partner
      to the uninfected partner.

      PART B: A case-control study will compare behavioral and biological data from heterosexual
      couples who are concordant for HIV infection at study entry with data from appropriate
      discordant couples enrolled in the prospective study. "Cases" will be HIV-infected secondary
      partners (from concordant couples) and "controls" will be uninfected secondary partners (from
      discordant couples).

      PART C: In a cross-sectional study, semen and cervico-vaginal washings will be collected from
      HIV-infected men and women in Parts A and B and evaluated for presence of HIV by virologic
      and serologic methods.

      Members of each couple will be interviewed separately by different interviewers. Demographic,
      sexual behavior and drug use history, and psychosocial information will be obtained.
      Participants will undergo clinical examination and various diagnostic laboratory tests (e.g.,
      blood tests, urine screening, and gynecological tests). They will receive post-test
      counseling.
