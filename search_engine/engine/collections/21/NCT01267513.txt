      patients admitted to the pulmonary ward of Meir Hospital who are being monitored in
      conventional manner. Normal volunteers will also be tested, under the following conditions:
      at rest, while running, while performing calisthenics, and while crawling on the ground. If
      non-inferiority of the new sensor is established compared to the standard clinically used
      sensors, then additional studies will be performed on acutely ill patients, such as patients
      admitted with multi-trauma.
