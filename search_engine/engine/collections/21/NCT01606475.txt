      labile diabetes mellitus in patients who do not meet standard inclusion/exclusion criteria
      for any other islet transplant trials in the US and are not good candidates for a pancreas
      transplant. We expect that this will include patients who have surgical diabetes (total
      pancreatectomy) rather than type 1 diabetes, patients who are highly sensitized (PRA>20%),
      and patients who have had prior failed pancreas transplantation. These patients may have
      equally severe hypoglycemia, glucose lability, and/or severe microvascular complications, but
      are excluded from standard islet transplant trials currently available in the U.S.
