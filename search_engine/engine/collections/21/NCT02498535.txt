    
      This is a multi-center, randomized, placebo controlled, phase II clinical study comparing an
      investigational drug to a placebo control. Screening data will be reviewed to determine
      subject eligibility. All subjects including screen failure subjects will be recorded on
      screening logs at their respective sites. Upon successful completion of all screening
      procedures, a subject will be considered eligible for enrollment. The subject will be
      enrolled and randomized in as close a time proximity to the first treatment application as is
      possible in order to minimize the possibility of dropout while enrolled but before undergoing
      treatment. With a 1:1 investigational treatment to placebo control, subjects will be
      randomized to one of the two arms. Subjects in the investigational treatment arm will be
      administered doses of NO (0.5% NO in 99.5% nitrogen) diluted in room air by inhalation four
      times daily (30-minute inhalations at least 3 hours apart) for 7.5 days on Days 1, 2, 3, 4,
      5, 8, 9, and 10 (three treatments on Days 1 and 10). Subjects in the placebo arm will breathe
      100% nitrogen diluted in room air in the same proportion as the investigational arm. Subjects
      will remain in the clinic for 30 minutes after completing the last treatment of each day. All
      subjects will be asked to return to the clinic for additional evaluations on Days 15 and 36.
