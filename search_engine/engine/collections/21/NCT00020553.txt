      better as a family in the areas of communication, togetherness, and overall increased ability
      to cope when a parent is newly diagnosed with cancer. II. Determine if participation in this
      program decreases stress-related illness in the well members of the family. III. Determine
      the safety of this program. IV. Determine patient/family and medical provider satisfaction
      with this program.

      OUTLINE: This a randomized study. Adult parent participants and spouses undergo a baseline
      assessment over approximately 1 hour comprising completion of a self-assessment form followed
      by an interview. Families are then randomized to one of two arms. Arm I: Adult parent
      participants receive a video support program comprising 3 videotapes (parent tape, adolescent
      tape, and child tape) and a parent guidebook. The parents are encouraged to screen the
      videotapes and decide whether to have their child and/or adolescent view the program. Arm II:
      Adult parent participants receive no video support material. Families may view the video
      program after study completion. Adult parent participants in both arms complete follow-up
      assessments at 6 and 12 weeks. This clinical trial is being conducted at the locations listed
      below. If you are interested in this clinical trial but unable to visit these locations,

      study.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 230 families will be accrued for this study.
