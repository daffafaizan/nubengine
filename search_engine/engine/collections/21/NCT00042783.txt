        -  Determine the feasibility of treating patients with stage IV melanoma with
           D1/3-MAGE-3-His fusion protein with SB-AS02B adjuvant.

        -  Determine the clinically confirmed response rates (partial and complete responses) of
           patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the 6-month progression-free survival rate of patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxic effects of this regimen in these
           patients.

        -  Determine immune responses in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive D1/3-MAGE-3-His fusion protein emulsified in SB-AS02B adjuvant
      intramuscularly once every 3 weeks for a total of 12 weeks (4 injections). In the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, patients receive a second 12-week course
      beginning at week 16.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 25-45 patients will be accrued for this study within 5-9
      months.
