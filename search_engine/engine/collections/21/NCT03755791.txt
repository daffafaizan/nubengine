    
      This is a multicenter, randomized, open-label, controlled Phase 3 trial of cabozantinib in
      combination with atezolizumab versus sorafenib in adults with advanced HCC who have not
      received previous systemic anticancer therapy in the advanced HCC setting. The primary
      objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of cabozantinib in combination with
      atezolizumab on the duration of progression-free survival (PFS) and duration of overall
      survival (OS) versus sorafenib. The secondary objective is to evaluate the activity of
      single-agent cabozantinib compared with sorafenib in this patient population.
