      pathways, Lisch nodules, palpebral involvement by plexiform neurofibromas, orbital dysplasia,
      etc. With the emergence of multimodal imaging in ophthalmology a new ocular involvement has
      been described: choroidal hyperreflective areas. They are located in the most superficial
      layers of the choroid, adjacent to the retinal pigment epithelium, visible only on infra-red
      imaging of the fundus. These areas are frequently observed, about 90% in adults and 70 to 80%
      in children. With a sensitivity of 0.83 and a specificity of 0.96, these lesions would have
      their place as a diagnostic criterion for neurofibromatosis type 1.

      In parallel, two successive studies have evaluated the function of the retinal pigment
      epithelium using electro-oculograms; they showed in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 a
      significant increase in the Arden ratio, reflecting hyperactivity of the pigment epithelium.

      The objective of this study is to study the function of the pigment epithelium in patients
      with neurofibromatosis type 1, using electro-oculogram to confirm these abnormally high
      values, but also to correlate this hyperactivity of the pigment epithelium to the presence
      and total area of choroidal lesions observed in infra-red imaging of the fundus.

      The hypothesis of the study is that the function of the pigment epithelium measured by the
      electro-oculogram correlates with the surface of the choroidal hyperreflective areas.
      Finally, the potential consequences of a supra-normal function of the pigment epithelium on
      the global retinal function are not known. A full-field electroretinogram will evaluate the
      global neurosensory retinal function.
