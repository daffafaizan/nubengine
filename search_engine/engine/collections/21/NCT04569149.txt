    
      The goal of this registry is to collect information on individuals with Microcephalic
      Osteodysplastic Primordial Dwarfism Type II (also called MOPDII) and other forms of
      microcephalic primordial dwarfism. The registry will enable detailed natural history studies
      of MOPD II and associated conditions. The study team hopes that identification of risk
      factors will allow for preventative treatments and thus a better quality of life for
      individuals with these diagnoses.

      This study is limited to chart review, after signed informed consent obtained. There will be
      no additional visits or time in clinic because of participation in this registry. This study
      involves only the collection and storage of data extracted from the medical record. Records
      that may be requested and reviewed as a part of this study include but may not be limited to:
      specialist evaluations, surgical reports, results of blood and urine tests, genetic testing,
      x-rays, CT/MRI/MRA imaging. There are no special procedures, visits, or expectations of the
      individual as a result of participation in this registry. No one will be asked to have any
      specific testing for the sole purposes of this research.
