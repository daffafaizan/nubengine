      of pain and pain-related disability in older adults with chronic pain, negative emotions, and
      cognitive impairment. We propose that emotion regulation is the mechanism of change through
      which PATH-Pain improves pain and pain-related disability (outcomes). This pilot study will
      provide initial evidence of the: a) feasibility and acceptability of PATH-Pain; b) effects of
      PATH-Pain on emotion regulation (mechanism of change) and outcomes (pain and pain-related
      disability); and c) mediating effect of emotion regulation (mechanism of change) on outcomes
      (pain and pain-related disability). We will randomize 120 older adults (60 years or older)
      with chronic non-cancer related pain and negative emotions to PATH-Pain vs. Usual Care with
      Education (UCE). PATH-Pain will be administered by licensed mental health clinicians.
      Research assessments will be conducted at the Wright Center at study entry (baseline), and at
      6, 12 (end of treatment), and 24 weeks.

      Additionally 20 providers of patients will be interviewed for feedback regarding the
      intervention.
