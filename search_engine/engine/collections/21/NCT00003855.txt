      Primary objectives:

      Long term: To assess whether overall survival for patients randomized to Arm 2 (no immediate
      ALND) is essentially equivalent to (or better than) than that for patients assigned to Arm 1
      (completion ALND).

      Short term: To quantify and compare the surgical morbidities associated with SLND plus ALND
      versus SLND alone.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. After segmental mastectomy and sentinel lymph node
      dissection, patients are stratified according to age (50 and under vs over 50), estrogen
      receptor status (positive vs negative), and tumor size (no greater than 1 cm vs greater than
      1 cm but no greater than 2 cm vs greater than 2 cm). Patients are randomized to one of two
      treatment arms.
