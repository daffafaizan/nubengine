    
      This is phase 1, single-arm, multicenter, open-label study in patients with relapsed or
      relapsed/refractory MM. The study employs a sequential group dose-escalation design to
      determine the DLT and MTD of ACY-1215 in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone, all
      administered orally (PO). The safety, tolerability, single- and multiple-dose PK,
      pharmacodynamics, and anti-tumor activity of ACY 1215 in combination with lenalidomide and
      dexamethasone also will be evaluated.

      Each cohort will enroll 3 patients. Study drug doses will be escalated sequentially after the
      Safety Review Committee (SRC) reviews safety data collected in C1 (28 days) from patients
      enrolled at the current dose level as well as emerging data from ongoing studies of ACY-1215.
      If there are no DLTs (as defined in Section 5.2.6) during C1 or concerns based on data from
      other ongoing studies, the study will proceed with dose escalation to the next cohort
      following safety data review by the SRC. If 1 of 3 patients has a DLT, then up to 3
      additional patients will be enrolled in that cohort; if none of the additional 3 patients
      experience a DLT during C1, escalation may then continue to the next cohort following SRC
      review. If 2 or more patients have DLTs during C1, the DLT dose level will have been reached.

      The MTD is defined as the dose level immediately below the DLT dose level. A total of up to 6
      additional patients may be enrolled at the MTD or other appropriate dose level to obtain
      additional AE, PK, pharmacodynamic, and anti-tumor activity data on ACY 1215 in combination
      with lenalidomide and dexamethasone.
