      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of safingol when administered with cisplatin
           in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the clinical pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine, preliminarily, the therapeutic activity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine a safe dose (i.e., near the MTD) for phase II evaluation of this regimen in
           these patients.

        -  Determine, preliminarily, the role of ceramide and S1P, relative to response and
           apoptosis, in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, non-randomized, dose-escalation study of safingol.

      Patients receive safingol IV over 1 hour and cisplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1. Courses
      repeat every 21 days* in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      NOTE: *Patients receive safingol on days 1 and 8 and cisplatin on day 8 for course 1 only;
      course 1 is 28 days in duration.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of safingol until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, 10 additional
      patients are treated at that dose level.
