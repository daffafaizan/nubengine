      the tests established in the protocol. In addition, all subjects will develop a program of
      strength, polyarticular, individualized and progressive exercises in which the main muscle
      groups are worked. The program will be held three days a week (36 sessions). Subsequently, a
      statistical analysis will be performed with the variables measured in the study to obtain
      results.
