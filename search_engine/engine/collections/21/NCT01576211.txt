    
      OBJECTIVES:

        -  What is the frequency of loss of imprinting at birth (in the cord blood and placenta) in
           a relatively healthy birth cohort?

        -  Does deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation levels at imprinting genes have a direct
           association to the gene expression?

      OUTLINE: Archived tumor tissue, cord blood, and placenta samples are analyzed for DNA
      methylation, single nucleotide polymorphism, and gene expression by polymerase chain reaction
      (PCR), pyrosequencing, and quantitative real-time PCR. Information regarding gender and age
      of the samples are also collected, if possible.
