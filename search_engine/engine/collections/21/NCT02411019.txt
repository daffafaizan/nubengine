    
      This is a follow-up study to investigate the change of immunogenicity and lesion condition in
      subjects with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 3 who have enrolled and participated
      GX-188E phase II trial(GX-188E_CIN3_P2).

      Subjects will make visits 7 times for about three years from the last visit of GX-188E phase
      2 trial (GX-188E_CIN3_P2).

      The endpoints are to evaluate the change of immune response, involved lesion and infection
      status compared to that of the final visit in phase 2 trial (GX-188E_CIN3_P2).
