      have assessed efficacy with AAs. Racial/ethical differences in smoking are well documented.
      AAs smoke less than White smokers but experience disproportionately greater smoking disease
      and death.

      Past studies by the researchers in this study looked at how effective other smoking cessation
      methods are in AAs. These methods included nicotine gum, nicotine patch and buproprion
      sustained release. This study will be evaluating varenicline in both AA and White smokers.
      There has not been a study conducted yet to prospectively research AA-White differences in
      smoking cessation and also to examine potential causal pathways explaining AA-White
      differences in quitting.
