    
      This is an open-label Phase 2 clinical trial. The study will have a duration of 12 months and
      involve a potential total of four macrobead implants for each enrolled patient, with the
      implants being no less than three months apart.

      The RENCA macrobeads are implanted intraperitoneally, using laparoscopic surgical procedures.
      The macrobeads remain permanently within the peritoneal cavity, even if patients withdraw
      from the study and/or begin new therapy (e.g. chemotherapy). After the formal phase of the
      trial is completed, subjects will be followed for life.

      The intent of this Phase 2 trial is to assess efficacy, safety, and tolerability of RENCA
      macrobeads. Screening occurs within 28 days prior to first implantation. Enrolled patients
      are treated with a dose of 8 RENCA macrobeads per kilogram of body weight and observed for a
      minimum of 3 months prior to the next implantation. A maximum of 4 implantation procedures is
      possible. Day 0 is the day of implantation.

      Prior to the start of the study, the Investigators ensured that the protocol and any
      attendant documentation were approved, in writing, by the Institutional Review Board. The
      study was conducted in compliance with the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) of
      Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use Good Clinical
      Practice Guidelines (E6 [R1]) for conducting, recording, and reporting studies, as well as
      for archiving essential documents.

      The Investigators, the Medical Monitor of the sponsor, and the Data Safety Monitoring Board
      were responsible for monitoring safety parameters collected in the study. They, collectively,
      provided oversight and monitoring of the safety of the participants in the study.
