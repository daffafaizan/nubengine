      to research participants with self-identified back pain persisting longer than 12 weeks.
      Participants will be randomized in a multiple crossover design to receive Swedish massage
      in-home by a commercial wellness service, yoga instruction in-home by a commercial wellness
      service, and no intervention/usual care. Participants will evaluate their pain intensity,
      pain interference, fatigue and stress daily through self-reported questionnaires. Online
      screening and enrollment methods, text-message reminders and questionnaire prompts, and
      wearable devices will be employed to collect data. At the end of the study, participants will
      receive a personalized report summarizing their observed data in each treatment period.
      Participants will evaluate the system usability of Personalized Trials, will debrief their
      experience with a member of the research team, and will share their overall satisfaction with
      Personalized Trials.
