      tumor-associated proteins that have been found in several tumor types. Clinical trials using
      adoptively transferred T-cells directed against NY-ESO-1/LAGE-1a have shown objective
      responses. Letetresgene autoleucel (GSK3377794) is the first generation of NY-ESO-1 specific
      T-cell receptor engineered TCR T-cells. This protocol investigates letetresgene autoleucel
      treatment in Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA)*-A*02+ participants with NY-ESO1+ advanced
      metastatic non-small cell lung cancer as second line treatment.
