    
      This protocol has three purposes:

        1. to evaluate non-treatment seeking participants for inclusion or exclusion from other
           NIAAA protocols. Non-treatment seeking participants includes individuals with no current
           or past alcohol use disorder, as well as individuals who meet the DSM IV criteria for
           alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence (alcohol use disorders (AUD) but are not seeking
           treatment;

        2. to provide a common set of descriptive information that will be available on all NIAAA
           research participants;

        3. to collect blood samples from participants for the purpose of genetic analyses

      Information collected will include such items as psychiatric diagnoses, genotypes of several
      neurotransmitter-related and brain growth-related candidate genes, presence or absence of
      brain, liver or other organ damage, history of the amount of past alcohol consumption, other
      substance use and family history of alcoholism. This information will allow investigators to
      determine for which, if any, NIAAA research studies a subject is eligible. It will also allow
      investigators to examine the relationship among various candidate genes and brain structure
      and/or function in alcoholism.
