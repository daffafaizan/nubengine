      I. To compare the relative efficacy of 5-FU + LV + Oxaliplatin (FLOX) with that of 5-FU + LV
      (FL) in prolonging DFS.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the relative efficacy of FLOX with FL in prolonging S.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours and fluorouracil IV (administered
      after 1 hour of leucovorin calcium) weekly for 6 weeks.

      ARM II: Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on days 1, 15, and 29 and leucovorin
      calcium and fluorouracil as in arm I.

      Treatment in both arms repeats every 8 weeks for 3 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 6, 9, and 12 months; every 6 months for 4 years; and then annually
      thereafter.
