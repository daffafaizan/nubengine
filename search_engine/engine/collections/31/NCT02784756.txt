      transplantation recipients and remains the most common opportunistic viral infection in these
      patients. Standard CMV prevention strategies include universal prophylaxis and pre-emptive
      therapy with viral load monitoring. However, neither of these strategies has been successful
      in eliminating CMV disease as seen by high rates of viremia, incidence, and CMV recurrence
      despite treatment. Recently, the Quantiferon-CMV assay has been shown to predict late CMV
      reactivation after prophylaxis and to be predictive of viral progression and the need for
      antiviral therapy in organ transplant recipients who develop low level CMV viremia. The
      purpose of the current study is to test the clinical strategy of using the Quantiferon-CMV
      assay in guiding the duration of primary CMV prophylaxis in solid organ transplant patients.
