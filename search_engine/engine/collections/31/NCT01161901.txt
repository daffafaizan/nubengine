      biomarkers specific to ARDS damages : the soluble form of the receptor for advanced glycation
      end products (sRAGE), the surfactant protein D (SP-D), Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor type 1
      (PAI-1) and Soluble Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1 (sICAM 1) in the two pulmonary
      morphologies of ARDS on CT scan : lobar and non lobar.

      Patients under mechanical ventilation and with ARDS criteria for less than 24
      hours(American-European Consensus Conference, 1994) will be enrolled.

      Within 24 hours of enrolment, 10ml of blood sample will be collected and stored at -80Â°C.
      Plasmatic biomarker concentrations will be determined through ELISA method.

      Within 48 hours of enrolment, patients will have a pulmonary CT scan without injection (end
      of expiration and ZEEP), a classical practice in this pathology.

      Nine university hospitals will take part in this study.
