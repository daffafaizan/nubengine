      reduction by taxanes. This is a dual-arm open-label randomized multicenter phase II clinical
      trial with 2:1 randomization evaluating the efficacy of SU11248 versus nil in patients with
      metastatic breast cancer after objective response to taxane chemotherapy. Patients randomized
      to the placebo arm (Arm B) will be offered the opportunity to receive open-label SU011248
      treatment upon development of RECIST-defined disease progression
