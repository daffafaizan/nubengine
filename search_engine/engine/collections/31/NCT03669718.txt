      with HPV16 positive OPC, when combined with cemiplimab, an investigational anti-PD-1 antibody
      being developed by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals. ISA101b is a therapeutic cancer vaccine that
      induces specific immune responses to the oncogenic E6 and E7 antigens from HPV16. Trials in
      HPV16 driven malignancies indicate it has activity in HPV16 driven malignancies including
      oropharyngeal and cervical cancers. Cemiplimab, also known as REGN2810, is in late stage
      trials and appears to have similar activity to approved anti PD-1 antibodies in a number of
      malignancies .
