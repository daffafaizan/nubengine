      pancreatic cancer receiving external beam irradiation and weekly paclitaxel. II. Determine
      the median survival after this treatment in these patients. III. Evaluate the acute and late
      treatment morbidity of paclitaxel in these patients. IV. Correlate p53 status with treatment
      response to this treatment in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is a open label, multicenter study. Patients are highly recommended to undergo
      laparoscopic surgical staging prior to protocol to exclude peritoneal and hepatic metastases.
      Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours weekly for 6 weeks beginning on day 1 followed
      1.5 hours later by external beam radiotherapy daily 5 days a week for 5.5 weeks beginning on
      day 1. All patients are restaged with an abdominal CT scan 6 weeks following completion of
      chemoradiotherapy. If there is marked response to treatment at this time, curative surgery
      may be attempted at the discretion of the attending surgeon. Patients are followed every 3
      months for 1 year, every 4 months for the second year, every 6 months for years 3-5, and
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 100 patients will be accrued into this study over 12 months.
