      insulin to manage their diabetes. This may be because they are worried about giving an
      injection and do not know enough about insulin to make an informed choice. This research is
      important because it will help researchers and health care providers better understand the
      feelings and educational support that patients need when they are thinking about starting
      insulin. This can help health care providers to better tailor the care they give to patients.
