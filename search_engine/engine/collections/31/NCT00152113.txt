        -  To estimate 1-year overall and event free survival after transplantation. An event is
           defined as toxicity (graft failure, death, grade III/IV acute GHVD), or a sickle-related
           event (stroke, acute chest syndrome, pain crisis).

        -  To obtain preliminary information regarding donor engraftment among different cell
           subsets, including unsorted mononuclear cell, and lymphoid fractions during the first
           year after transplant.

        -  To observe the rate of acute and chronic GVHD during the first year after transplant.

        -  To assess the proportion of research participants who experience poor graft integrity
           and therefore require additional donor stem cells or lymphocytes.

        -  To document the effect of stem cell transplant on the central nervous system as defined
           by radiological imaging and neuropsychological testing.

        -  To investigate immune reconstitution after transplantation
