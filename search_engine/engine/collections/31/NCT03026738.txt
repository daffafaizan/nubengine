    
      Rectal prolapse is a disabling condition, which is more common in females and increases in
      frequency with age.

      There are two types of rectal prolapse; external and internal. External rectal prolapse is a
      circumferential protrusion of all layers of the rectum through the anal sphincter. Internal
      rectal prolapse, also referred to as rectal intussusception.

      The majority of patients with a RP suffer from symptoms of fecal incontinence and
      constipation, causing a significant negative impact on quality of life.

      The aims of the surgical treatment are to correct the anatomical abnormality and to cure the
      accompanying symptoms of incontinence, constipation and pain, with the lowest rate of
      complications as possible and an acceptable rate of recurrence.

      Since the emergence of minimally invasive surgery, laparoscopic techniques for the treatment
      for RP have been applied in patients of all ages.
