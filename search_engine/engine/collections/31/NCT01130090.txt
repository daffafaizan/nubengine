    
      Eligibility: patients under home bi-level pressure support ventilation for obesity
      hypoventilation in a stable clinical condition, aged over 18

      Methods:

      Three consecutive sleep studies in a randomised sequence with usual parameters Inspiratory
      Positive Airway Pressure(IPAP), Expiratory Positive Airway Pressure (EPAP) and change of only
      back up respiratory rate (RR): one night in a spontaneous mode, one with an intermediate RR,
      and one with a RR above that of the patient

      Endpoints:

      Quality of sleep and sleep structure (polysomnography), patient-ventilator synchronisation
      and respiratory events under NIV, efficacy of ventilation: oxygen saturation measured by
      pulse oxymetry (SaO2); transcutaneous capnography (PtcCO2), and comfort.
