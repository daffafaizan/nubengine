      crossover study with five single-dose treatment periods. The washout period between doses was
      15±2 days. For each of the five treatment periods, volunteers were to be admitted at the UFH
      on the day before the treatment day. On each treatment period, the pre-dose assessment were
      to be completed, BIA 3-202/Placebo was to be administered concomitantly with the dose of
      Sinemet® 25/100 and post-dose assessments were to be completed. Subjects were discharged 30 h
      post-dose. Subjects should attend five treatment periods and were to receive a different dose
      of BIA 3-202 or placebo during each of these treatment periods.
