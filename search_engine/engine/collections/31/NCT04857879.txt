      of process implementation and effectiveness of the Good Life with Osteoarthritis in Denmark
      (GLA:D) program in individuals with osteoarthritis of the knee (KOA). Specifically, the study
      will examine the feasibility and acceptability of the GLA:D program in individuals with KOA.
      This study will also assess the magnitude of changes in self-reported knee pain and
      functional impairments as well as physical performance in individuals who receive GLA:D
      compared to those who receive control interventions consisting of disease-specific education
      and exercises for KOA.
