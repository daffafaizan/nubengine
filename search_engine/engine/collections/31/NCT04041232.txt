      protein that activates the transcription of molecular chaperones in response to ER stress.
      Patients harboring mutations in ATF6 present with decreased retinal function and are
      diagnosed with achromatopsia. The investigator's research group has previously demonstrated
      that administration of glycerol phenylbutyrate (PBA), a fatty acid compound that facilitates
      protein folding, can lead to enhanced retinal function in mice that are homozygous for the
      ATF6 mutation. This study will investigate the effects of PBA administration in two patients
      who carry ATF6-/- mutations and a diagnosis of achromatopsia. Enrolled subjects will undergo
      a minimum of 3 clinic visits that consist of a complete ophthalmic examination
      (best-corrected visual acuity, intraocular pressure, anterior segment examination, slit lamp
      and binocular fundus examination), a visual functioning questionnaire, color vision tests,
      contrast sensitivity tests, retinal imaging (optical coherence tomography, short wavelength
      autofluorescence and near-infrared autofluorescence), a macular sensitivity test (Nidek
      microperimetry) and full-field electroretinogram (ffERG). A blood draw will be performed at
      each visit to test for any indications of adverse effects from drug use. Subjects will be
      instructed to take 3 doses of PBA per day, totaling to a dose of 4.5 to 11.2 mL/m2/day (5 to
      12.4 g/m2/day).
