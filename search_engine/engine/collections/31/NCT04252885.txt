      who are novel coronavirus positive are planned to be recruited. These cases are randomized
      into 3 groups: in group A（Standard treatment+lopinavir/ritonavir）, 50 cases are given
      ordinary treatment plus a regimen of lopinavir (200mg) and ritonavir (50mg) (oral, q12h,
      every time 2 tablets of each, taking for 7-14 days). In group B（Standard treatment+arbidol） ,
      50 cases are given ordinary treatment plus a regimen of arbidol (100mg) (oral, tid, 200mg

      baseline (day 0) and day 2, 4, 7, 10,14, 21 after receiving indicated treatment. The primary
      observed indicators include viral nucleic in acid nose / throat swab, body temperature,
      respiratory rate, oxygen saturation of blood, chest imaging. The secondary observed
      indicators include but not limited to blood pressure, heart rate, blood routine test, liver
      and kidney function, myocardial enzyme, flow cytometry classification and counting,
      cytokines, other infection indicators, conditions and parameters of auxiliary respiration,
      the total days in hospital, exacerbation and mortality.
