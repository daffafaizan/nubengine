      carbohydrate-based conjugate Shigella vaccine) is safe and effective in the prevention of
      Shigella infection. This will be a phase 2b, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-center
      study, involving a vaccination phase and a challenge phase. The vaccination phase will
      consist of study participants that will be 1:1 randomized to receive either the vaccine or
      placebo. Two doses of blinded study product will be given by intramuscular route of
      administration, separated by approximately 4 weeks. The challenge phase will consist of an
      inpatient stay of approximately 12 days during which eligible study participants will ingest
      an oral inoculum of wild-type S flexneri 2a strain 2457T and then be monitored for illness
      and treated with antibiotics when the primary endpoint is reached or upon 5 days
      post-challenge, whichever comes first, or when deemed necessary. Upon satisfying discharge
      criteria, study participants will complete outpatient clinic follow-up visits through ~7
      months after last dose of blinded study product (Day 237). The efficacy study will be
      enrolled through three cohorts of participants, each cohort consisting of approximately 30
      subjects that will be involved in the vaccination phase and 22 subjects that will proceed
      with the challenge phase. There will be a fourth cohort of participants, consisting of 12
      subjects, that will receive the vaccine in an open-label design-this cohort will provide
      serum samples which are intended to be used for generating serum standards for laboratory
      assays, as a part of ongoing and future clinical development of Shigella vaccines.
