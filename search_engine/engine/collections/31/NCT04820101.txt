      NICU (neonatal intensive care unit), and informed consent will be obtained as soon as
      possible. Eligible babies for LISA procedure (dyspneic and FiO2 > 0.30 on CPAP pressure of at
      least 6 cmH2O) undergo sedation with dexmedetomidine 1 mcg/kg, administered slowly iv in 10
      minutes, together with non pharmacological techniques. After the step of sedation LISA is
      performed. Before/during and after the procedure pain will be assessed by the NIPS scale and
      the quality of intubation will be evaluated; then other events related to the procedure will
      be strictly collected for the first 24 hours. Babies will then be managed in usual NICU way
      and clinical data will be unregistered on respiratory, neurological and hemodynamic outcomes
      during the hospital stay, and especially at discharge.
