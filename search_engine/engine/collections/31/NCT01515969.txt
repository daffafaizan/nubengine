    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To characterize the safety and tolerability of the combination of erlotinib (erlotinib
      hydrochloride) and dovitinib (dovitinib lactate), assessing for toxicity using the Common
      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0.

      II. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the combination of erlotinib and
      dovitinib.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate overall response rate (ORR), progression free survival (PFS), and overall
      survival (OS) of patients receiving the combination of erlotinib and dovitinib, although this
      phase will allow for patients who received any number of prior treatments, including prior
      treatment with erlotinib.

      II. To evaluate the potential impact of dovitinib on erlotinib pharmacokinetics (PK).

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive erlotinib hydrochloride orally (PO) once daily (QD). Starting on day 15,
      patients also receive dovitinib lactate PO QD on days 1-5 of each week. Treatment continues
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 12 months.
