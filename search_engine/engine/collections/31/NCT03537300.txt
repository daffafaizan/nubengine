      prevalence is high. The Daily job of a school teacher involves head down posture while
      reading, writing, etc., exposing them to risk of developing NP. Deep cervical flexor (DCF)
      muscles have been shown to have lower endurance in patients with cervical impairment which
      has been associated with disability. There is limited evidence that reports efficacy of DCF
      muscles training in occupational NP. This study was done to see the effect of DCF muscles
      training using pressure biofeedback on pain, muscle endurance and functional disability in
      school teachers with NP. 65 teachers, aged between 25 to 45 years with experience of more
      than 5 years were agreed to participate in this study. Subjects were randomly divided into
      two groups, experimental (EG) and control group (CG). In EG, subjects received DCF muscles
      training using pressure biofeedback in addition to conventional exercises for neck pain while
      in CG subjects received only conventional exercises. Pain, muscle endurance and disability
      measured at day 0 (before treatment), day 14 and day 42 after treatment. Endurance of DCF
      muscles was measured by CCF test using pressure biofeedback instrument, Pain intensity was
      measured using NPRS and Functional disability was assessed using NDI questionnaire.
