    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety, tolerability, maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/recommended phase 2
      dose (R2PD) of guadecitabine in combination with nivolumab in patients with refractory CpG
      island methylator phenotype (CIMP+) metastatic colorectal cancer. (Phase Ib Dose Escalation)
      II. To assess the overall response rate (ORR) in refractory CIMP+ metastatic colorectal
      cancer patients treated with guadecitabine and nivolumab. (Phase II Expansion)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the incidence of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) of
      guadecitabine combined with nivolumab. (Phase Ib Dose Escalation) II. To assess
      progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in refractory CIMP+ metastatic colorectal
      cancer patients treated with guadecitabine and nivolumab. (Phase II Dose Expansion)

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Characterize pre and post-treatment morphometric, proteomic and genomic profiles of
      circulating tumor cells using the high-definition single cell analysis (HD-SCA) platform.

      II. Determine associations between circulating cell-free tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA),
      messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression, inflammatory T-cell and DNA methylation
      signatures, with response rate (RR), PFS, OS.

      III. Determine associations between tumor PD1/PDL1 expression with RR, PFS, OS.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase Ib, dose-escalation study of guadecitabine followed by a phase II
      study.

      Participants receive guadecitabine subcutaneously (SC) on days 1-5 and nivolumab
      intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on days 8 and 22. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence
      of disease progression or unaccepted toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up at 30 days and then every 2
      months for 1 year.
