      operation, the contents of Following-up System of AVF include history, physical exam,
      ultrasonography detection. The assesment results will guide the methods of the AVF surgery
      operation. In the 2nd stage, before AVF puncture firstly and 3 months after AVF operation,
      the contents of Following-up System of AVF include physical exam and ultrasonography
      detection. The results will help the nurses and doctors make a decision of the method of AVF
      puncture. In the 3rd stage, during the following 2 years after AVF puncture successfully, the
      contents include physical exam and ultrasonography detection regularly. The adequacy of
      hemodialysis by using AVF will be assessed by urea clearance index (Kt/V).

      The data of patients in other hemodialysis centers will be recorded and compared to the
      patients in experiment group.
