      longterm safety and effectiveness of disease modifying therapies in inflammatory
      arthropathies. The Nor-Dmard study is a comparative, phase IV, longitudinal, observational
      study. All patients starting a DMARD regime are enrolled. Patients from two clinics
      (different parts of Norway) will be randomised to receive follow-up care from either a
      clinical nurse or a rheumatologist.

      The primary outcome measure is patient satisfaction measured by Leeds Satisfaction
      Questionnaire.

      The secondary outcome is effectiveness measured by Coping (CORS),Health related quality of
      life (SF-36) and Disease activity (MHAQ, DAS-28).
