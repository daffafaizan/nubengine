    
      This is an uncontrolled, non-randomized trial to evaluate safety, immunogenicity and
      feasibility of a new vaccine, consisting of semi-allogeneic fibroblasts transfected with
      autologous tumor-derived DNA. Briefly, the plan is to use a two-stage trial design and to
      initially enroll 15 patients with non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) over a period of 2
      years. The patients will undergo surgery and a portion of the primary tumor specimen not
      necessary for the pathologic diagnosis will be obtained to serve as a source of tumor DNA.
      Each DNA-based vaccine will contain 1 x 10e7 DNA-transfected human allogeneic fibroblasts.
      The vaccine will be lethally irradiated before it is used for immunization. It will be
      administered intradermally in the Outpatient Clinic. Patients delayed-type hypersensitivity
      (DTH) responses will be tested but will not be an eligibility criterion. Immunologic response
      to the vaccine will be evaluated. If there is no evidence of toxicity, and >3 of the 15
      initial patients show immunologic response, the second stage of the study will be opened for
      accrual of 22 patients. All patients will be monitored by IFN-g secretion in ELISPOT assays
      prior to and after vaccination for the frequency of T-cells responsive to autologous tumor
      (if available) and/or to the vaccine. The patients will also be evaluated before and after
      vaccination for the capability of their T cells to respond to activating signals delivered
      via the T cell receptor (TcR).
