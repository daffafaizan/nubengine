      will receive the same dose at each vaccination dependent upon group assignment. Groups will
      be divided according to the table below. An interval no less than 1 week will separate the
      third dose of a group from the first dose of the next group (receiving an increased
      InvaplexAR dose). Blood, stool, and saliva specimens will be collected at pre-specified
      intervals to examine systemic and mucosal vaccine antigen-specific immune responses. Ocular
      tear samples will be collected in groups C and D. Vaccine safety will be actively monitored
      during vaccination and for 28 days following the third vaccine dose. The decision to advance
      to the next dose level is based on the safety assessment (not immunogenicity). A dose level
      with no occurrence of stopping criteria in the 7 days following the last vaccine dose will
      prompt moving to the next higher level. All safety data will be summarized and reviewed with
      the research monitor prior to dose escalation. In addition, a report of all safety data will
      be provided to the sponsor's safety office for informational purposes.
