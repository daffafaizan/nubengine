      (UK) and regional pigeon fancier meetings.

      Consenting subjects will complete questionnaires, provide blood samples for genetic analysis
      and undertake lung function measurements.

      Subjects will be observed, and encouraged to report referral to specialist respiratory
      services, and following this information will be sought on diagnosis (including supporting
      evidence). Where interstitial lung disease is detected this will be linked to subsequent
      unbiased analysis to detect potential predisposing genetic associations.
