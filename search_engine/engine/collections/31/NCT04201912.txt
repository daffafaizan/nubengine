      Specific MAMP (microbe associated molecular pattern). Currently about 13TLRs have been
      identified. Among them, TLR2 and 4 recognize most organisms. Periodontal disease is mixed
      infection resulting due to dysbiosis. When aggravated by systemic disease the role of TLRs is
      detrimental for the overall state of periodontal apparatus. Type 2 diabetes is one of the
      systemic disease which is seen a risk factor if uncontrolled can exaggerate the titer of TLR2
      and TLR4 biomarkers. Various studies have been evaluated to determine the role of TLRs in
      autoimmune and periodontal conditions. The purpose of this study is to determine if both TLR2
      and TLR4 play equal roles in periodontal disease and in cases where periodontal disease is
      complicated by the presence of systemic disease. Individual role of TLR2 and TLR4 in active
      disease will help determine treatment strategies and will also be able to predict potential
      biomarker in disease.

      Periodontal diseases are classified according to the American academy of periodontology as
      stage 1, 2, 3&4 according to severity and extent of the disease progression.

      Stage 2 periodontitis was selected as it is considered as an intermediary, because
      CAL(clinical attachment loss was standardized at 3-4mm,this could reflect the progression of
      disease and its impact from a horizontal bone loss to a more oblique one, if in case the
      dysbiosis persists.
