      to treat participants who have advanced solid tumors or lymphomas. This study looked at mass
      balance, pharmacokinetics (PK), metabolism, elimination and safety of alisertib.

      The study enrolled 3 patients. The study consisted of 2 parts: Part A and Part B.
      Participants received:

        -  [^14C]-alisertib 35 mg in Part A

        -  alisertib 50 mg in Part B

      Participants were asked to take a single dose of [^14C]-alisertib oral solution containing
      80-100 Î¼Ci of total radioactivity (1.19-1.48 mCi/mmol) in Part A and alisertib 50 mg, orally,
      twice daily for 7 days in 21-day cycles until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity in
      Part B.

      This single center trial was conducted in United States. The overall time to participate in
      this study was up to 117 days. Participants remained confined to clinic in Part A and made
      multiple visits to the clinic in Part B. Participants were contacted 30 days after last dose
      of alisertib in Part A (if not continuing in Part B), or were contacted by telephone or a
      final visit 30 days after receiving their last dose of alisertib in Part B for a follow-up
      assessment.
