      technology of liposome formulation to be introduced in clinical practice. The low myocardium
      uptake of this formulation accounts for its reduced cardiac toxicity, confirmed both in
      preclinical models and in humans. Preclinical data have shown activity in NSCLC xenografts.
      This Phase II study is to explore the efficacy and toxicity of Pegylated liposomal
      doxorubicin and Carboplatin in patients with previously untreated non-small cell lung cancer
      (NSCLC) not amenable to radiotherapy or surgical treatment.
