      I. To estimate the frequency of bendamustine (bendamustine hydrochloride) combined with GCSF
      (filgrastim) and dexamethasone to successfully mobilize peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs)
      (as determined by collecting a minimum of 2 x 10^6 cluster of differentiation (CD)34+/kg).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the response rate to bendamustine by diagnosis using established
      disease-specific response criteria.

      II. To examine the number of apheresis cycles required to collect a minimum of 2 x 10^6 CD34+
      cells/kg and ideally >= 5 x 10^6 CD34+ cells/kg (when achievable).

      III. To assess the impact of bendamustine on B and T-lymphocyte populations in the peripheral
      blood (CD20+ cells, natural killer [NK] cells, CD4+25+ foxP3- regulatory cells, and CD8
      cells).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive bendamustine hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 30-60 minutes on days 1
      and 2, etoposide IV over 60-240 minutes on days 1-3, dexamethasone orally (PO) on days 1-4,
      and filgrastim subcutaneously (SC) beginning on day 5 and continuing until peripheral blood
      stem cell collection is complete. Patients undergo leukapheresis daily for a minimum of 3
      days or until > 5 x 10^6 CD34+/kg has been collected.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for up to 5 years.
