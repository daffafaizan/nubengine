      Complex (also known as AIDS dementia complex) that causes damage to the nervous system,
      particularly the brain and spinal cord. Evidence exists that nimodipine protects nerve cells
      in culture from injury by HIV. Although nimodipine has been used in patients with other
      neurological problems, its safety and effectiveness in halting the progression of
      HIV-Associated Motor / Cognitive Complex is not yet known.

      Forty patients currently taking zidovudine (AZT) or any other approved antiretroviral agent
      will be randomized to one of three treatment arms: high-dose nimodipine, low-dose nimodipine,
      or placebo. Additionally, six patients who are intolerant to standard antiretroviral therapy
      will be randomized to receive high- or low-dose nimodipine. Nimodipine is administered by
      mouth concurrently with patients' prestudy dose of antiretroviral agent. Treatment is given
      for 16 weeks, and patients are followed every 4 weeks. As an option, all patients may receive
      an additional 16 weeks of low-dose nimodipine.
