      awareness, sensitivity, and competence in people conducting human genetics research in
      developing countries, as well as to explore challenges and opportunities to improve cultural
      congruence. Human genetics research is becoming more common in developing countries, as
      researchers take advantage of differences in environment and population diversity. However,
      when research is conducted with individuals living in developing countries, there is a chance
      that culture will lead to misunderstandings between investigators and participants and
      consequently ineffective research. The proposed study uses a cross-sectional semi-structured
      qualitative interview design. Thirty to forty-five participants will be recruited.
      Participants will be researchers with experience in conducting genetics research in
      developing countries, who will have had direct contact with the participants in their
      research studies. These researchers will be recruited from professional organizations,
      through identification of lead authors in literature searches, and through snowball
      recruitment. Interviews will be conducted by telephone, recorded, transcribed, and analyzed
      for themes related to cultural congruence and specific challenges and opportunities with
      regard to cultural congruence.
