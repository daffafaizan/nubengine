      invited to participate in this study. Participating subjects will be randomized into either
      (i) vitamin D or (ii) placebo group in a 1:1 allocation ratio by computer-generated random
      numbers one month before IVF.

      Subjects allocated to the vitamin D group will take vitamin D 50,000IU per week from
      recruitment for 4 weeks, followed by 50,000IU once every 2 weeks throughout the IVF cycle
      until fetal viability is confirmed at 6 weeks (if pregnant), after which they will be
      switched to Materna. If not pregnant, they will continue Vitamin D 50,000IU once every 2
      weeks until 6 months from randomization, during which they can undergo frozen-thawed embryo
      transfer.

      Subjects allocated to the placebo group will take placebo tablets which will be identical to
      the active drug. If pregnant and fetal viability is confirmed at 6 weeks, they will be
      switched to Materna. If not pregnant, they will continue the placebo tablets until 6 months
      from randomization, during which they can undergo frozen-thawed embryo transfer.

      The clinician and patients will both be blinded to the randomization throughout the course of
      treatment. The live birth rate of the two groups will be compared.
