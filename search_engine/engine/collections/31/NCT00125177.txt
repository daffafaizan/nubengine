      incontinence (SUI), a model for predicting who will succeed in overcoming incontinence
      long-term (1-year) by simply using Knack therapy (thus avoiding invasive and costly surgery
      and time consuming Kegel's exercises). Specific Aims are to:

        -  develop a logistic regression model to predict success with the Knack;

        -  validate the model by determining the proportion of people who succeed according to who
           is predicted to succeed; and

        -  develop long-term effectiveness of the Knack (1-year).

      The project will be implemented in three phases: model development (n=160 women), model
      validation (n~160), and long-term follow-up of women who demonstrate response. This will be
      evaluated immediately and at 1 month and at 3-months and 1-year.
