      standard of care in the neoadjuvant setting. In HER2-positive disease trastuzumab is given
      simultaneously to chemotherapy. Recent data from the Neo-Altto and Neosphere trials suggest
      that a dual blockage of the HER2 receptor with e.g. trastuzumab and lapatinib reach
      significantly higher pCR rates than trastuzumab alone and should therefore represent the
      treatment back-bone of new neoadjuvant trials. A preplanned subgroup analysis of the
      GeparQuinto study demonstrated that in TNBC the addition of bevacizumab resulted in a
      significant increase of pCR rates (HR 1.4).

      Having a better cardiac tolerability profile compared to conventional anthracyclines, the
      non-pegylated liposomal encapsulated doxorubicin (NPLD) MyocetÂ® might provide the possibility
      to combine taxane, anthracycline, platinum salt as well with targeted agents as double HER2
      blockage or bevacizumab.
