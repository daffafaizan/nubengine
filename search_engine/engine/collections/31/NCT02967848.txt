      embolisation are often treated with stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy (SABR). SABR
      results in high local control rates but, similar to other treatment modalities, carries risk
      of damage to healthy surrounding liver. This study aims to use a novel nuclear medicine
      imaging tracer, 99mTcMebrofenin, to evaluate liver function before and after radiotherapy.

      Patients will have a 99mTcMebrofenin scan performed < 2 weeks before radiotherapy and 1 and 6
      months after radiotherapy. At the same time points, indocyanine green (ICG) and liver
      elasticity tests will be performed. These are global measures of liver function, whereas
      99mTcMebrofenin is both global and local. From the imaging data, the Investigators will be
      able to correlate change in local liver function in each sub volume of the liver with the
      radiotherapy dose it received. The Investigators will be able to thus measure the effect of
      radiotherapy on global and local liver function.
