    
      Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), also known as insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus or
      juvenile-onset diabetes, occurs primarily due to Î²-cell destruction, usually leading to
      absolute insulin deficiency. The condition is immune-mediated and is usually idiopathic.
      Tight glycemic control using intensive insulin therapy was shown in the Diabetes Control and
      Complications Trial (DCCT) to reduce rates of microvascular complications in T1DM; however,
      achieving and maintaining such control in T1DM using standard insulin therapy requires a high
      level of support and is associated with increased potential for hypoglycemia, increased
      weight gain and, in some patients, aggravation of cardiovascular risk factors including
      dyslipidemia.

      TAK-329 is being developed by Takeda Global Research & Development Center, Inc. (TGRD) as an
      adjunct treatment to improve glycemic control in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus who
      use insulin therapy.

      This study will take place at 1 site in the United States. A total of 36 male and female
      adult participants with T1DM will take part in the study.

      The study will last about 77 days, including a 28 days screening period, 4 cross-over
      treatment periods and a follow up period. Participants will be confined to the study clinic
      for 2 days in each period. Participants will also be contacted by phone 30 days following the
      last dose of study drug.
