      a priority in health and social policies due to the aging of the population and the
      progressive increase in dependent individuals. In our case, 88% of healthcare within
      dependency care is provided by the family and only 12% by health professionals. The family
      requires comprehensive and multidisciplinary ongoing care, in which the primary healthcare
      nurse plays a leading role. One of the areas involved is home-based nursing and counselling
      for family caregivers, in order to improve the quality of the care provided and to prevent
      issues arising that may adversely affect the caregiver's life.

      Method: This is a research-action study with a mixed analysis methodology. Quantitative
      analysis was used to evaluate the effectiveness of the Problem Solving Technique in reducing
      symptoms of anxiety and depression among family caregivers. The clinical trial involved a
      control and experimental group and pre-post intervention measurements, using the Goldberg
      scale of anxiety and depression. The sample consisted of 122 caregivers who presented one of
      these positive subscales. The technique's application process was evaluated for the
      qualitative analysis, with a content analysis of the records of 10 nurses performing the
      experimental intervention.
