      progesterone receptor(PR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) , and
      characterizes an aggressive behavior with higher risk of recurrence and death compared to
      other breast cancer subtypes. Little therapeutic progress has been made in adjuvant therapy
      in TNBC during the past decades and the standard of care is still missing.

      Pre-clinical and clinical data suggest that platinum-based regimens represent an emerging
      therapeutic option for selected patients with homologous recombination repair deficiency
      (HRD). The HR system is critical in regulating and maintaining genome stability, and is one
      of the most commonly altered systems in TNBCs, up to 15-20% TNBC patients carry germline
      BRCA1/2 mutations. Other HR genes included PALB2, RAD51 etc. Tumors that harbor HRD possess
      an increased burden of genomic aberrations and lesions, and have been shown to have increased
      sensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents such as platinum salts. Platinum-based regimens have
      been encouraging in TNBC patients with HRD, given increases in both pathologic complete
      response (pCR) rates in neoadjuvant trials and objective response rates(ORR) in metastatic
      diseases. Further information are needed on how platinum-containing therapies affect
      long-term outcomes in the adjuvant setting.

      In this trial, the investigators intend to compare the 3-year disease-free survival (DFS) of
      dose-dense epirubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by paclitaxel with paclitaxel plus
      carboplatin as adjuvant therapy in high-risk node-negative or node-positive TNBC patients
      with HRD. The other purpose of this trial is to observe the participants' tolerance.
