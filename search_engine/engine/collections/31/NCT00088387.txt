      in combination with divalproex on surrogate measures of neuroprotective activity in patients
      with Alzheimer's disease. It is hypothesized that at safe and tolerable doses these drugs
      will inhibit glycogen synthase kinase-3 activity and reduce the phosphorylated tau epitopes
      threonine-181 and threonine-231 implicated in the pathogenesis of this disorder. In this
      proof-of-principle study, efficacy on reducing tau phosphorylated epitopes will be assessed
      through cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) measurements. Safety will be monitored by means of frequent
      clinical evaluations and laboratory tests.
