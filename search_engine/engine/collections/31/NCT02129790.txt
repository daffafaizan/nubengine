      self-harm compared to healthy adolescents or adolescents with other psychiatric disorders.
      Adolescents vulnerable to emotion dysregulation and self-harm often have deficits in the
      ability to mentalize: to understand, acknowledge, and predict thoughts and feelings in
      oneself and others. Mentalization-based therapy for adolescents (MBT-A) has been shown to be
      more effective than 'usual care' in reducing self-harm for adolescents and adults with
      borderline personality disorder. MBT-A includes psychoeducational and coping strategies that
      may prove quite effective for bipolar adolescents who are at elevated risk for self-harm.

      Participation in this study will last 9 months. All participants will receive a thorough
      medical-psychiatric evaluation. All youth will be able to receive pharmacotherapy with a
      study psychiatrist in the CHAMP clinic. The MBT-A will consist of up to 21 weekly, biweekly
      and monthly individual sessions interspersed with 9 monthly family sessions (30 therapy hours
      total). Participants will also complete follow-up assessments every 3 months for 9 months.
      These assessments will include research interviews and questionnaires.
