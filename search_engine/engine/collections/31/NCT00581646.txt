      questions will ask about your feelings, sexual function, quality of life, and ideas about
      reproductive options. We will also ask some questions about you, your health, and your
      medical history. You can choose to answer these questions either at one of your doctor visits
      or over the telephone. You can decide the best way to complete this assessment.
