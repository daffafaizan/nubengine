        -  Determine the response rate of patients with progressive regional or metastatic
           transitional cell carcinoma of the urothelium with renal insufficiency when treated with
           paclitaxel and gemcitabine.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour followed immediately by gemcitabine IV
      over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment continues every 4 weeks for a minimum of 3
      courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10-27 patients will be accrued for this study within 10-27
      months.
