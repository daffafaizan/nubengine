      and be left with residual disability. Regaining independence in standing and walking is of
      utmost importance for patients recovering from stroke. Walking balance requires muscles in
      the legs and trunk to contract quickly if people lose their balance. Physical therapy plays a
      key role in the rehabilitation of walking balance in individuals after stroke. Given that
      maintaining one's balance requires fast muscle activity, rehabilitation post-stroke should
      focus on speed of movement. Thus we are proposing to compare a program that emphasizes speed
      of movement, Fast muscle Activation and Stepping Training versus an active control (usual
      care).
