      health and chronic medical conditions in acute and primary care medical settings. However,
      very few interventions exist for the acute injury population transitioning between settings.
      While peer interventionist programs have been instituted for care delivery in many
      conditions, they have not yet been comprehensively integrated into acute post-injury
      interventions. Literature reviews support the need for comparative effectiveness trials of
      health care system interventions targeting high need injured patients with multiple complex
      mental health and medical comorbidities who are at risk for fragmented post-injury health
      service utilization. This study evaluates two readily implementable approaches to the
      delivery of transitional care for injured patients treated emergently in US trauma care
      systems. The two approaches to be compared are a multidisciplinary team collaborative care
      intervention that integrates front-line trauma center staff with peer interventionists to
      trauma surgical team notification of patient emotional distress with recommended mental
      health consultation. The collaborative care intervention will be supported by a novel
      Emergency Department (ED) health information exchange technology platform.
