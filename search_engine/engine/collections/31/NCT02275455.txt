      modifications of ANS with external events which will all be recorded in a synchrony manner
      through a specific design (spy glasses with video/audio recording). Four phases will be
      carried out on autism participants and aged-marched controls: 1) 24-hour baseline
      pre-experiment (physical activity, sleep), 2) 2-hour in real life situation, 3) 30-minute in
      a quiet environment, interrupted by a few seconds stressful sound, 4) an interview to get
      comments and feelings about events that triggered anxiety. Autism and control participants
      will be together for phases 2 and 3, revealing different physiological responses to the same
      situations, and thus identifying potentially problematic events. We will apply the
      statistical analyses developed by our team on continuous ANS data. Detection of abrupt
      changes will allow segmenting the data in shorter time series of few minutes with a constant
      mean, and estimating their persistency or antipersistency through a piecewise constant
      fractal index. We will disentangle classes characterizing different behaviors such as
      anxiety, rest and physical activity.
