    
      This is a study of the fully integrated Uro-NIRS:UDS device (Laborie Triton or Laborie Dorado
      and Urodynamix's Non-Invasive Urodynamics device - Uro-NIRS), to confirm the results using
      the fully integrated Uro-NIRS:UDS device as compared to the stand-alone URO-NIRS device and
      UDS device. The study will evaluate male patients with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS)
      and female subjects with over-active bladder (OAB).

      The Uro-NIRS unit uses near infrared light at 3 different wavelengths to measure changes in
      haemoglobin and cytochrome from the detrusor muscle from the human bladder wall. This process
      is similar to what is used for cerebral and muscle oxygenation monitoring (e.g., pulse
      oximetry). Previous clinical feasibility studies have identified the correlation between the
      changes in haemoglobin and cytochrome and the pressure values obtained during urodynamics
      procedures and uroflow procedures.

      For this study the Uro-NIRS results specifically will not be used by the urologist/nurse to
      guide in patient management and treatment decisions, but rather will only be used to collect
      measurements from the patient. The Uro-NIRS sensor patch will be adhered to skin surface
      where their bladder is located.

      The study will be conducted by the two principal investigators at the two clinical study
      sites who will collectively enrol a minimum of 50 subjects, with a minimum of 35 male
      subjects and a maximum of 15 female subjects. The study enrolment objective is to equally
      enrol male subjects into three categories: unequivocal, obstructed and unobstructed. Female
      subjects shall all have OAB.
