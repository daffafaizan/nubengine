      with intubation was desaturation. Usual preoxygenation( bag-mask ventilation) have been show
      that marginally effective in critically ill patients. As a result, there is a need to
      optimize the technique of preoxygenation to prolong the safe duration of apnea during the
      intubation procedure in critically ill patients. Noninvasive ventilation provides continuous
      positive airway pressure is effective in increasing the efficiency of gas exchange and in
      reducing the decrease in oxyhemoglobin saturation during fiberoptic bronchoscopy in hypoxemic
      patients.

      Therefore, our aim was to study whether NIPPV is more effective at reducing desaturation than
      usual preoxygenation in hypoxemic, critically ill patients requiring intubation in ICU.
