      recruited and studied for this trial. After participants are deemed eligible, they will
      complete multiple questionnaires and then be randomly assigned (like a flip of a coin) to
      either guided imagery or deep breathing exercises delivered via a digital media player.
      Participants will be instructed to listen to the tracks at least 5 days per week for an 8
      week intervention period.

      At week 3 of the intervention period, the participant will complete another 2 week pain and
      stool diary.

      At week 7 of the intervention period, the participant will complete another 2 week pain and
      stool dairy. After this diary is completed, the participant will again complete multiple
      questionnaires for their final visit.
