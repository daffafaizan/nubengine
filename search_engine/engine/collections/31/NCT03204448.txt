      control diseases, will be used in the study. The specimen will be collected as the clinically
      leftover samples that have been used for routine clinical diagnosis purpose or research
      purpose, and with de-identification methods. Each set of samples will also be tested on a
      control serologic Anti-Ro60 detection kit, QUANTA Flash Ro60. Clinical sensitivity and
      clinical specificity will be analyzed for, also a method comparison conclusion will be drawn
