      residual instability as a result of vestibular system disorders or Parkinson's disease. It is
      also useful for treating lack of balance in the elderly (presbivertigo). However, there is no
      systematic, controlled and prospective analysis of whether vestibular rehabilitation is
      effective in reducing the number of falls in the elderly, or whether its effects in this age
      group are temporary or persist over time.

      This study compare vestibular rehabilitation with three different strategies (dynamic
      posturography exercises, optokinetic stimuli and exercises at home) and a control group, in
      people over 65 years. Balance tests are performed before vestibular rehabilitation and three
      weeks, six months and one year after it. Number of falls are quantified one year after
      vestibular rehabilitation.
