      I. To evaluate the safety of tagraxofusp-erzs (tagraxofusp) in patients with blastic
      plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN) after autologous (auto) or allogeneic (allo)
      hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with BPDCN receiving maintenance
      therapy with tagraxofusp after auto-HCT or allo-HCT.

      II. To estimate the overall survival (OS) in patients with BPDCN receiving maintenance
      therapy with tagraxofusp after auto-HCT or allo-HCT.

      OUTLINE:

      Within day 45 and 120 after stem cell transplant, patients receive tagraxofusp-erzs
      intravenously (IV) over 15 minutes on days 1-3 of cycles 1-4 and days 1-2 of subsequent
      cycles. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 24 cycles in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for up to 1 year.
