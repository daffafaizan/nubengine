      (ASD) patients aged between 2 years and 5 years old inclusive funded by the Health Resources
      and Services Administration (HRSA). It is a double-blind control trial of sertraline
      (Zoloft), an anti-depressant typically used in the treatment of depression,
      obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder, and other conditions. The researchers are
      investigating the use of this selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) in ASD because a
      retrospective study has shown significant improvements in language and social deficits. There
      is also emerging evidence regarding the stimulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor
      (BDNF) and the stimulation of neurogenesis when an SSRI is given early on in the development
      of animal models of Down syndrome. The researchers hope to see improvements in language
      stimulation, social gaze and social reciprocity, spatial attention, and a decrease in
      autistic behaviors.

      The aim of this study is to carry out a double-blind placebo controlled trial of sertraline
      in children with ASD who are between the ages of 2 years and 5 years old inclusive. At
      baseline, the researchers will assess behavioral and cognitive development. Each participant
      will be involved in this trial for a period of six months. This will include three visits to
      the UC Davis MIND Institute and eight phone calls. The researchers will also assess the side
      effects of the sertraline treatment throughout the study.
