      complex three dimensional vascular structure. This exam has several limitations already well
      documented, including shortening of the vessel, overlapping images, intra and inter-observer
      variability during the consideration of the severity of injuries. Besides, it offers great
      limitations in the diagnosis of the composition of atherosclerotic plaque. Furthermore,
      intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) provides a sensitive and reproducible measure of the
      dimensions of the vessel and allows direct visualization of the vessel wall, atherosclerotic
      plaque and arterial lumen. The utility of grayscale IVUS as prognostic tool and as a guide in
      percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) is well established. More recently, IVUS has also
      provided new insights for safety and efficacy of drug eluting stent (DES).

      Advances in technology now allow IVUS to characterize the morphology and composition of
      plaques. Specifically, the analysis of the IVUS wave frequency - beyond the interpretation of
      wave lengths used in grayscale IVUS- enables in vivo analysis of atherosclerotic plaque
      composition with high sensitivity and specificity. Although previous studies have reported
      data using IVUS radiofrequency analysis, the use of a new modality (iMapTM, Boston
      Scientific, Santa Clara, CA, USA) for characterization of atherosclerotic plaque is poorly
      known.
