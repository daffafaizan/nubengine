      pervasive cause of skin and soft tissue infections has increased the number of children
      requiring incision and drainage (I&D) procedures and heightened concerns about the optimal
      treatment strategy. Data on patients with methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA)
      abscesses, as well as emerging data on children with minor MRSA skin and soft tissue
      abscesses suggest that I&D alone is sufficient therapy. However, given concerns about the
      pathogenicity of MRSA infections, many patients who require hospital admission and I&D in the
      operating room receive postoperative antibiotics. The primary objective of this randomized
      controlled trial is to compare the effect of 5 days versus 1 day of postoperative antibiotics
      on the rate of treatment failure following I&D of abscesses in children in the era of
      pervasive MRSA infection. Secondary outcomes to be measured include incidence of additional
      skin and soft tissue infections in other body sites and incidence of these infections in
      family members and household contacts. Prospective data will be collected from wound
      cultures, as well as from nasal, rectal and skin cultures sent at the time of initial I&D to
      assess for MRSA carrier status. Finally, survey data will be used to assess epidemiologic
      risk factors.
