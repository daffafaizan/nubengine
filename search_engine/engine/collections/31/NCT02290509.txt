      intention of offering broader protection to include both lineages of influenza B strains, it
      is appropriate to transition Flublok from a trivalent to a quadrivalent formulation. The
      demonstration of non-inferior post-vaccination Hemagglutination Inhibition Assay (HAI)
      Geometric Mean Titers (GMTs) to antigens in the Flublok Quadrivalent formulation compared to
      those of the matching antigens in a US - approved IIV4 is intended to support licensure of
      Flublok Quadrivalent for the adult population for which Flublok trivalent is currently
      approved. The comparison of safety and reactogenicity of Flublok Quadrivalent to that of IIV4
      is expected to confirm a similar safety profile.
