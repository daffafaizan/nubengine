      challenging for clinicians to treat. This prospective, multi-center clinical study will
      examine outcomes following treatment of DFUs, with one of two FDA cleared tissue-engineered
      devices, MatriStemÂ® or cellular dermal replacement tissue, on DFUs that have demonstrated an
      inadequate response to initial standard of care therapy. The incidence of ulcer closure, rate
      of wound closure, and quality of life will be evaluated over a eight week period.
