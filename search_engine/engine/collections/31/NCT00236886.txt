      profile. In clinical trials, some patients have experienced substantial weight loss. This
      prospective single center, open, pilot study will investigate whether there is any metabolic
      predictor for the weight loss. The patients will receive daily oral dose of topiramate in
      addition to anti-epileptic medications already prescribed by their physicians. A battery of
      metabolic tests including Body Mass Index (BMI), lean body mass, blood lipids and fasting
      glucose in tandem with other examinations will be taken before dispensing of topiramate,
      after 3 months and at the final visit. The study hypothesis is metabolic test results will
      provide a predictor of weight loss with topiramate. Patients will receive between 25 to 400mg
      daily of topiramate by mouth in addition to current anti-epileptic medications for up to 1
      year. Dose will be adjusted (up to 1000 mg daily) by the investigators depending on the
      patients' clinical response.
