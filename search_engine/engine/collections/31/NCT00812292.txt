      medication), randomized (study medication will be assigned by chance) cross-over study in
      healthy adults to compare the rate and the extent of absorption of TMC278 when administered
      as a single 25 mg dose of the 3 concept pediatric formulations (solution [10 mg/mL],
      suspension [5 mg/mL], granules [2.5 mg/g]), under fed and fasted conditions, to that when
      administered as the 25 mg TMC278 Phase III tablet formulation, under fed conditions, in
      healthy adults and to assess the effect of food on the bioavailability of TMC278 after a
      single 25 mg dose of the concept pediatric TMC278 formulations in healthy adults. The
      palatability of the 3 concept formulations will be assessed in a fasted state by use of a
      questionnaire and a visual analog scale. The short-term safety and tolerability of TMC278
      following administration of 3 single oral doses of 25 mg, formulated as one of the concept
      pediatric formulations (under fed and fasted conditions) and as the Phase III tablet (under
      fed conditions), in healthy adults will be evaluated. TMC278 25 mg formulated as a solution,
      suspension, granules, or tablet will be administered orally (by mouth). Each volunteer will
      receive on the first day of one treatment session one TMC278 25 mg tablet. On the first day
      of the other sessions they receive a single dose of TMC278 25 mg formulated as a the
      solution, a suspension or granules.
