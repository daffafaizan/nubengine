      gynecologic-oncologic surgery department of European Hospital Georges-Pompidou, with patients
      undergoing partial or total mastectomies, lymph node biopsies or axillary lymph node removal
      and sampling of the adipocytic tumour microenvironment to measure POPs using gas
      chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry. The objective is to analyze the
      concentrations of 46 POPs including polychlorinated dibenzo(p)dioxins and furans (PCDD/Fs),
      polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybromodiphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and polybromobiphenyls
      (PBBs) in both adipose tissue (AT) and serum samples from breast tumor patients (benign,
      malignant with and without lymph node metastasis).
