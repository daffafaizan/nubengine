      factors will be randomized in a crossover fashion to follow a WFPB diet without animal
      products that is either high (4 tablespoons) or low (< ~1 teaspoon) in raw extra virgin olive
      oil. After confirming eligibility and patients provide consent, the research team will
      randomize the participant at the baseline visit. The baseline visit and run-in visit 1 will
      follow as described below. With the intent of recruiting cohorts of ten, a group of
      participants will subsequently begin the first Whole Food Plant Based culinary diet
      intervention for four weeks, followed by a one-week (+ 3 days) washout period before
      switching to the opposite oil diet for an additional four weeks. During each of the 4-week
      interventions, participants will attend weekly cooking sessions that align with the dietary
      intervention with a registered dietitian. Patients will be asked to maintain levels of
      physical activity through the duration of the study. Data will be collected at the patient's
      cardiology visits before and after each diet intervention for a total of four in-person
      visits excluding the screening visit.
