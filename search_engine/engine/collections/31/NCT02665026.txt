      physical and mental restriction, debilitating nuisance, among other problems. Skin
      irritation, prolapse, and retractionare quite common after ileostomy. A high incidence of
      parastomal hernia, ileus, and increased salt and fluid loss has been reported, which may also
      contribute to greater willingness of both the surgeon and patient to close the temporary
      stoma as soon as possible.

      Currently, it remains unclear whether stoma closure should be performed after the end of
      chemotherapy or during chemotherapy (12 weeks or 24 weeks after radical resection of rectal
      carcinoma).

      The aim of this study is to assess the possible impact of stoma closure timing on
      postoperative results and to evaluate that the early preventive ileostomy closure after total
      mesorectal excision of rectal cancer does not increase the risk of complications.
