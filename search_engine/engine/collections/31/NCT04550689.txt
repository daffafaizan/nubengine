    
      AIM To compare dimensional changes in extraction socket of single rooted teeth, 6 months post
      extraction, when grafted with xenograft versus allograft.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE

      Horizontal and vertical dimensional changes of extraction sockets as evaluated in a CBCT scan
      immediately post extraction and 6 months post extraction when grafted with xenograft versus
      allograft.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE

        1. Difference in horizontal dimensional changes in xenograft and allograft groups as
           measured intra-operatively after extraction and at re- entry 6 months post extraction.

        2. Difference in vertical dimensional changes in xenograft and allograft groups as measured
           intra-operatively after extraction and at re- entry 6 months post extraction.

        3. Difference in histologic analysis of bone biopsy cores taken in xenograft and allograft
           groups at 6 months re-entry from osteotomy site.

      Difference in newly regenerated supracrestal bone height and volume will be measured directly
      from the segmented images from MicroCT.

      NULL HYPOTHESIS

      There is no difference between the two groups for any of the parameters evaluated.
