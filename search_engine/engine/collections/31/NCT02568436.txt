      which make patients refuse to undergo treatment. It also has many disadvantages including
      higher caries rates, gingivitis, and root resorption. It also combined commonly with pain,
      which reducing patient acceptance and cooperation with treatment.

      Low level laser therapy in orthodontic has shown pain-reducing effects with an effect in
      biomodulation which lead to increased orthodontic tooth movement rate and reducing risk of
      root resorption.

      A recent systematic review states that low level laser therapy has shown efficiency in
      accelerating orthodontic tooth movement, but there is a need for more studies to determine
      the best protocols regarding energy and frequency. A review of the literature shows that
      there is no randomized controlled trails evaluating its efficiency in accelerating
      orthodontic tooth movement in regard of dental crowding cases, which is the main purpose of
      this study.
