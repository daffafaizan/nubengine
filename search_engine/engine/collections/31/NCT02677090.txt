      tolerability of the PROMITORÂ®given at the doses of 6, then 9 and finally 12 g (corresponding
      to 4, 6, and 8 g of fibers respectively) twice a day with the meals of the morning and of the
      evening versus control (maltodextrin, no fiber) over one week of intake in children from 3 to
      7 years old.

      As it is an exploratory study there is no categorization between primary and secondary
      objectives.
