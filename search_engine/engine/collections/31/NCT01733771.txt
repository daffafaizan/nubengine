      Patients interested in CAM treatments may receive various CAM treatments such as reflexology,
      acupuncture, guided imagery and hypnosis, according to patient preference and practitioner
      availability. Patients are requested to grade the severity of their symptoms on a visual
      analogue scale (0-100) before treatment and within 3 hours following treatments. Patients who
      are interested in standard care alone and not interested in CAM treatments grade their
      symptoms similarly, and serve as a control group. Primary outcomes are symptomatic relief and
      secondary outcomes are correlations between belief or disbelief in CAM with the primary
      outcomes.
