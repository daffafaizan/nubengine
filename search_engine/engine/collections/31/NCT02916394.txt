      Molecule as a novel PET/CT radiotracer to monitor IGF-1R expression status. The investigators
      want to evaluate the use of [68Ga]-labelling Anti-IGF-1R Affibody Molecule in IGF-1R
      expression cancer imaging in adult cancer patients （colon cancer 、NSCLC、gliomas cancer
      patients）with different IGF-1R expression status.
