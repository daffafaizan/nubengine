      objective is to study the involvement of epoxy-eicosatrienoic acids (EETs) in the reactivity
      of cutaneous microcirculation during post-occlusive hyperemia and thermal hyperemia, by
      studying the response to microdialysis of fluconazole (an inhibitor of EETs) versus control,
      on the forearm.

      Response is measured by the amplitude of the post-occlusive hyperemia and thermal hyperemia
      peaks (maximum amplitude as a percentage of maximal vasodilation and areas under the curve:
      AUC) during the injection of fluconazole compared to an intradermal injection of solvent
      (NaCl 9 â€°).

      The subjects are healthy volunteers of both sexes, aged between 18 and 35, non-smokers and in
      good health. Over two years, 30 subjects will be included in the study for 6 to 13 weeks.
