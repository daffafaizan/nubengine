      the MILD&CA in 2015 to reinforce the links between local caregivers and the
      addictoviligance's inquieries. In particular, the CEIP-A has been alerted about a drug called
      " chimique " in Mayotte, leading to many hospitalizations. Most of the patients are less than
      18 year old or are young adulthoods. For all patients who have agreed to participate in this
      study, the remainder of the blood sample will be reused for a drop of blood on blotting
      paper; the remainder of the remainder will be stored in the heparinized tube. Medical data
      collected in the emergency department will also be collected. All the data will be analyzed
      by the pharmacology and toxicology laboratory of the Bordeaux University Hospital
