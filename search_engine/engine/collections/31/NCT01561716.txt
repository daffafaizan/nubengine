      obesity are among the highest public health priorities in the U.S. because physical
      inactivity negatively affects a wide variety of medical conditions (e.g., metabolic
      syndromes, cardiovascular disease). Research has shown that a major contributor to physical
      inactivity is the sedentary behavior induced by increased use of computer and video games.
      However, some of the newer generations of game consoles such as the Nintendo Wii market their
      product for its physical activity promoting features. Nintendo's recent release of Wii Fit /
      Wii Fit Plus uses a balance board and is the first game in which whole-body movements closely
      mirror that of the actual activity. As the use of these gaming systems may be more enjoyable
      modes of promoting physical activity than the traditional treadmill exercise, respondents may
      in turn exercise more regularly and for longer periods of time. To the best of the
      investigators' knowledge, no studies exist that demonstrate the energy expenditure of the Wii
      Fit / Wii Fit Plus among adults, or the Wii Fit / Wii Fit Plus compared to other forms of
      aerobic exercise such as walking and running. This study will provide preliminary data for
      future external grant applications comparing the energy expenditure of different physical
      activity conditions employing cutting-edge interactive physical activity promoting technology
      among adults. The potential contributions of the Wii Fit / Wii Fit Plus to promote healthy
      behaviors by being an alternative form of physical activity may be particularly informative
      for people who are unable to meet the national public health recommendations due to personal,
      health, safety or environmental concerns.
