      healthy aging men and women. The combined changes have substantial clinical implications to
      aging-related physical frailty, diminished aerobic capacity, sarcopenia, osteopenia, visceral
      adiposity, glucose intolerance, and reduced psychosocial wellbeing. Whereas androgen is
      considered the main trophic (anabolic) sex steroid, recent data demonstrate that certain
      tissues respond principally to GH and testosterone-derived estradiol, Estrogen (E2) (e.g.
      bone, brain, liver and pituitary). In principle, frailty may thus be associated with dual GH
      and sex-steroid deficiencies. Additionally, young, but not older healthy women secrete
      significant amounts of progesterone for approximately 14 days during the luteal phase of
      every menstrual cycle. When GH levels rise nearly two fold, the investigators hypothesize
      that progesterone potentiates the GH response to E2. This hypothesis arises from scattered
      indirect studies often using synthetic progestins with partial androgen agonism, instead of
      progesterone per se.

      Because there is no basis for estimating statistical power for this novel paradigm, 40 women,
      10 each in 4 groups, will be studied. The pilot data will be used to calculate statistical
      power for a definitive R01-based investigation of gender-specific distinctions in
      estrogen-regulated pituitary-hormone secretion.
