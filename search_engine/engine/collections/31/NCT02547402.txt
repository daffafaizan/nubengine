    
      This is an exploratory study in a small, well controlled group of healthy subjects to explore
      the effect of CXA-10 on pravastatin and VytorinÂ® (combination of simvastatin and ezetimibe).

      The overall design of the trial is to administer drugs that are metabolized through these
      transporters to quantify the impact CXA-10 may have on the exposure of these drugs.

      The study will also examine the 24-h urine total creatinine excretion prior to and following
      administration of CXA-10 to examine the effects of CXA-10, if any, either directly on
      creatinine transporters or through enhanced creatinine production.

      To reduce the potential variability in drug exposure levels, the study population will only
      include male subjects between 19 to 25 years of age.
