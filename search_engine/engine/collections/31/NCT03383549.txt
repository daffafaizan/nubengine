      by randomization. Randomization will be applied with a ratio of 1:1.

      The Telerehabilitation program is conceived as a combined protocol to train both cognitive
      and physical domains. Participants will be requested to perform the cognitive training three
      times weekly and physical training two times weekly, on alternate days. The subject will
      access the Telerehabilitation contents by using a web application configured on a touchscreen
      notebook, that will be provided to each participant by the research institute.

      Physical exercises are going to be chosen according to adaptive physical activity model, and
      each session will be made up of eleven exercises, divided in three categories: warm-up,
      strengthening and stretching/relaxation. The participants will perform the exercises
      according to instructions received in a sequence of videos. Every session will last 30
      minutes.

      Cognitive training will be based on BrainHQ exercises (BrainHQ, Posit Science,USA) which are
      characterized by adaptive control of the difficulty levels. The chosen exercises aim to train
      different cognitive domains including: attention, executive function, memory, processing
      speed, reasoning, and visuospatial memory. Each session will last 20 minutes, and will
      include four different types of exercise.

      While enrolled in the 8 weeks program, participants will also be requested to wear an
      actigraph. The actigraph will be placed on the non-dominant arm and will be used to monitor
      daily activity and sleep quality.

      At the end of the tele-rehabilitation program, participants will undergo a final assessment.
