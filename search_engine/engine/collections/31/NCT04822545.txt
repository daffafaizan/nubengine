           18 years of age) hospitalized patients who have obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m 2 or BMI ≥ 27
           kg/m 2 if Asian/South Asian), and after stabilization of their acute medical conditions.
           Prior to hospital discharge, patients will receive a referral for an outpatient
           comprehensive weight management clinic, with a message that will be sent to the CWM
           clinic scheduler. Then the investigators will follow the patients forward for 6 months
           from hospital discharge to assess primary and secondary outcomes. Also, the
           investigators will look at a historical control group of hospitalized patients with
           obesity (age, comorbidity matched) from 2014-2019 (chosen instead of 2020, to avoid any
           impact of 2020 COVID 19 pandemic) and compare the primary and secondary outcomes. At six
           months after discharge, patients will receive a phone call from the investigators to
           ascertain whether they were able to go to the comprehensive weight management clinic and
           about their experience.

        -  Hospitalized patients who have decision-making capacity and whose acute medical
           condition has been stabilized who meet study criteria will be identified by study
           physician(s) who will look at his/her personal patient list on a regular basis to
           identify patients who meet enrollment criteria and will refer the patients to the
           co-investigator who is not directly involved in the patient's care who will then discuss
           enrollment with patients.
