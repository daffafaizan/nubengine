    
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety
      and effectiveness of an investigational drug, or in the case of this study, combination of
      drugs, to learn whether the combination of drugs works in treating a specific disease.
      "Investigational" means that the combination of drugs is being studied.

      The primary purpose of this research study is to test the safety and effectiveness of
      eribulin and pembrolizumab in combination for controlling this cancer

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has approved eribulin for the treatment of
      liposarcoma, based on a phase III study that compared eribulin and dacarbazine in the
      treatment of liposarcoma and leiomyosarcoma. The FDA has not approved pembrolizumab for this
      specific disease but it has been approved for other uses. A phase II study showed rare
      responses of liposarcoma and undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma to treatment with
      pembrolizumab. While eribulin in combination with pembrolizumab has not previously been
      tested in the treatment of liposarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, or undifferentiated pleomorphic
      sarcoma, other research studies and laboratory experiments and information from those studies
      suggest that the combination of these drugs may help to stop cancer cells from growing.
      Chemotherapy treatment with eribulin may increase the response to immunotherapy with
      pembrolizumab
