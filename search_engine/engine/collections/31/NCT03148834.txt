      aerobic metabolism of lipids and the production of energy in the form of phosphates will
      depend, in this situation, on the anaerobic metabolism of glucose. As a result they are
      consumed muscle glycogen stores that produce little ATP, and also generating acidosis. The
      cell membrane loses its ability to maintain the fluid's electrolyte balance. Cellular edema
      is generated by the entry of sodium and water, leading to cell rupture. During ischemia and
      reperfusion free radicals are produced that stimulate inflammation and consequently release
      prothrombotic and cytotoxic substances that also produce cellular damage. Due to its osmotic,
      antithrombotic, anti-inflammatory and rheological effects, dextran could be useful in this
      scenario.

      The administration of a solution in the distal bed, for the protection of the myocardium,
      before opening the epicardial artery is called by us "controlled reperfusion". The
      researchers think, using a solution with venous blood, containing less O2 but retaining
      buffer properties; enriched with Dextran, which has onctic power, anti-inflammatory and
      anticoagulant properties, and molecules similar to glucose; results in a potentially useful
      solution for myocardial protection in this scenario.

      The group of investigators expect that controlled reperfusion treatment will reduce the
      incidence of ST correction and infarct size by 20-30%, improving the prognosis in terms of
      mortality and heart failure.
