      alcohol use disorder. Our investigations with glutamate modulators in drug and alcohol
      dependent individuals suggest that they may exert unique therapeutic effects on
      dependence-related vulnerabilities and may also address problem drinking in alcohol dependent
      individuals. The proposed project will expand on our prior research by testing the efficacy
      of glutamate modulators in a larger population of non-depressed individuals with alcohol use
      disorder (AUD); it also aims to investigate, using a 2 by 2 factorial (2x2) design, the
      hypothesis that the effects of the glutamate modulator are enhanced when combined with
      behavioral treatment. It, therefore, has the potential to deepen our understanding of the
      therapeutic role of glutamate modulators in AUD treatment, as well as to provide further
      evidence for the efficacy of this novel pharmacotherapy strategy in addressing problem use
