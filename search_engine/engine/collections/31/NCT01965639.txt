      physician, nurse practitioner, dietician, pharmacist, licensed clinical social worker (LCSW),
      case manager, health educator and a community health worker. Care will be delivered in
      community settings including home visits and community based clinics. With the exception of
      specific surveys (listed in the Study Intervention section) all data are being collected for
      the purpose of delivery of standard preventive care and clinical care. The population group
      will include patients diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in four Southern United States
      counties, meeting certain inclusion criteria, and deemed "high risk" as determined by a set
      of standard criteria or a risk algorithm run on secondary data.

      The investigators plan to characterize patients diagnosed or at risk for diabetes mellitus,
      and allow more detailed knowledge of their health than is provided by standard public health
      data. The investigators will use descriptive, parametric and non-parametric statistics to
      describe baseline characteristics (demographics and clinical measures of disease severity) of
      the sample and will compare responders and dropouts on independent and dependent variables,
      report any significant differences, and include this in the interpretation of results.
