      renal carcinoma in patients with renal masses. Studies of imaging characteristics of 124I by
      a variety of PET cameras, quantification of tumor uptake of 124I-labeled antibody and
      correlation with biopsy measurement of tumor and normal tissue have met with encouraging
      results. As clear cell renal cancers are associated with an aggressive phenotype their a
      priori determination may help guide appropriate surgical/therapeutic management.
