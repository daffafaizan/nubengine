      and use of special education services in brain tumor and CNS tumor patients treated with
      proton radiation at MGH. Furthermore, we seek to correlate neurobehavioral data with
      pertinent clinical information. We anticipate better neurobehavioral functioning to be
      associated with use of protons (vs. photons, as reported in the literature). We also
      anticipate the need and utilization of special education services to be lower in brain and
      CNS tumor patients treated with protons (vs. photons, as reported in the literature). Lastly,
      we anticipate greater neurobehavioral deficits in patients whose proton radiation treatment
      involved the craniospinal axis compared to those who received proton radiation to the
      involved field.
