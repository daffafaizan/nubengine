      uptake in insulin target tissues (muscle and adipose tissue) is common in end-stage renal
      disease (ESRD), but is also present at earlier stages of renal disease with mild-moderate
      renal function impairment as well as in microalbuminuria and nephrotic syndrome.

      Population-based cross-sectional studies have shown that low levels of vitamin D (25(OH)
      vitamin D) is associated with impaired glucose tolerance in subjects with normal renal
      function and that reduced renal function and 25(OH) vitamin D deficiency are independently
      associated with insulin resistance.

      Vitamin D has well-known effects on calcium metabolism and skeletal mineralisation but recent
      experimental studies suggest that vitamin D in addition reduces several inflammatory
      mediators that are of importance in the development and progression of renal disease which
      also associated with insulin resistance such as TNF-Î± and IL-6.

      This is a prospective, single-blind, explorative, randomized, placebo-controlled,
      single-centre, two-way cross-over study with two treatment periods of 10 weeks separated by a
      washout period of 6 weeks. Non-diabetic patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 3
      and 4 (GFR 15-60 ml/min/1.73m2) who have low serum 25-OH-vitamin D levels (< 30 ng/mL) and
      elevated fasting serum insulin levels (>10 IU/L) will be randomized to receive either vitamin
      D3 (cholecalciferol) 3200U orally (tablets) daily or placebo.

      Approximately 24 patients are going to complete the study. A pre-entry wash-out period of 6
      weeks is needed for patents already on vitamin D treatment. An in vivo assessment of insulin
      secretion and insulin sensitivity will be made by insulin-glucose clamp at the end of each
      treatment period.
