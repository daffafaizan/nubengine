      metabolism and pharmacokinetics of individual enantiomers of PQ in healthy human volunteers.

      The overall approach is as follows: in 36 healthy volunteers with documented normal G6PD
      activity, we will administer a single oral dose of RPQ, SPQ, or RSPQ. At various times after
      dosing, we will draw blood samples, in which we will record the plasma levels of the parent
      drugs, along with plasma and urinary metabolites. The comparative pharmacokinetics,
      tolerability and hematological effects of these two enantiomers and the racemate will be
      assessed.
