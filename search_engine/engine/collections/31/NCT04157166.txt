      referred for bone scans as part of a search for primary or metastatic neoplastic bone lesions
      (known neoplastic history) will be offered to participate in the study by the doctors of the
      nuclear medicine department of the CHRU from Nancy.

      The capture of tracers used for bone scintigraphy (technetium-99m-labeled bisphosphonates) is
      highly dependent on bone remodeling, osteoblast activity and tissue perfusion . This is why
      bone scintigraphy is a sensitive examination, capable of detecting anomalies before their
      radiological translation . 3-dimensional (3D) recordings called SPECT detect bone metastases
      with a sensitivity equivalent to that of MRI .

      These SPECT are most often produced by hybrid systems, in combination with X-ray scanner (CT)
      recordings, which makes it possible to correct certain imperfections in the quantification of
      the measured activities (attenuation, diffusion, partial volume) and also, to complete the
      characterization of lesions.

      Bone diseases, which are often diffuse, frequently require two-dimensional (2D) whole body
      recordings, but these are unfortunately less informative and less sensitive than 3D
      recordings. This is why complementary focused SPECT / CT images are recommended for areas
      that are difficult to explore, especially the pelvis and spine, and when neoplastic lesions
      are suspected. This registration procedure is long (about 40 minutes), difficult for some
      patients to support, and does not offer an optimal 3D analysis of the entire skeleton.
