      University of Ghana who meet initial the inclusion criteria. Screening will involve pregnancy
      testing, assessment of hemoglobin, and ferritin and also administration of a health history
      questionnaire.

      Thereafter, 120 eligible subjects will enrolled and randomized to recieve the treatment. All
      subjects will complete 3-day dietary record (including 2 weekdays and 1 weekend) at baseline
      and at endline (i.e. one week prior to treatment completion). The dietary data will be
      analyzed using nationally-generated food composition tables together with the ESHA food
      processor software. In addition, body weight and height will be measured using standard
      methods at baseline and end of the study. Weekly monitoring of side effects will be recorded.
      Fasting blood samples will be collected at baseline and endline to enable determination of
      anemia status and other indicators including serum ferritin, transferrin receptor and full
      blood count, together with C-reactive protein.
