    
      This study protocol is an elaboration of the original study protocol titled "A Randomized,
      Multi-center, Open label trial to establish the therapeutic equivalence between Biogeneric
      Epoetin and Eprex and to determine the long term safety profile of Biogeneric Epoetin in
      patients on Hemodialysis".

      In the first stage, a biogeneric Epoetin shall be evaluated by a randomized trial designed to
      demonstrate therapeutic equivalence (TE) versus an innovator product (Eprex), the efficacy
      clinical end-point being Hb at 6 to 12 weeks on treatment.

      When preliminary evidence of efficacy is established from above stage 1 TE trial, the product
      may proceed to be evaluated in a stage 2 single group cohort study designed to establish the
      long term safety, with particular emphasis on surveillance for occurrence of Pure Red Cell
      Aplasia (PRCA) and other immunogenicity related adverse event. To establish the long term
      efficacy, its emphasis on the potential impact of batch to batch variation in product content
      and potency (bioactivity) on Hb response.

      This practical trial also designed to investigate the cost-effectiveness by estimating the
      optimal dosage for combination of Epoetin and Iron sucrose to achieve Hb target under
      unconstrained prescriptionas, and hence the budgetary requirement can be estimated to meet
      therapeutic target in this dialysis population under various pricing scenario in the presence
      of generic competition.
