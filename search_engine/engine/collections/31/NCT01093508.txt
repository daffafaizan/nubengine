    
      This is a Phase 1, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-dose escalation study
      of up to 9 dose cohorts (1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 30, 45, 70 and 90 mg) each comprising 8 subjects (2
      to receive placebo, 6 to receive APD916). Each cohort will be assigned to receive a single
      dose of APD916. After dosing within the first cohort has been completed and safety data
      review identifies no tolerability issues, and the principal investigator (PI) and Sponsor
      have agreed that it is safe to proceed, then subjects in the next cohort may be dosed.
