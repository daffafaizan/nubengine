    
      Objective: The objective of this protocol is to collect and assess adaptive optics (AO)
      retinal images of normal and diseased eyes.

      Study Population: Three hundred and fifty (350) participants with eye diseases and

      250 normal volunteers will be enrolled.

      Design: This is an observational protocol which will enroll 350 participants with various eye
      diseases and 250 age-matched healthy volunteers over five years. In general, participants
      will undergo a complete ophthalmic examination including assessments of visual acuity,
      intraocular pressure, and a dilated ocular examination. Imaging will be performed using
      adaptive optics instruments provided by Canon, Inc and the Medical College of Wisconsin.

      Outcome Measures: The primary outcome for this protocol is qualitative and quantitative
      assessment of the AO images with comparisons of normal and diseased states.
