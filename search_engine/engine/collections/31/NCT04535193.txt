    
      This is a Phase 1/2 study evaluating the positron-emitting radiopharmaceutical 18F-mFBG as an
      imaging agent for quantification of myocardial sympathetic innervation. The first part of the
      study will examine control subjects, patients with very low likelihood of coronary heart
      disease. This initial part will determine optimal imaging procedures for studying uptake and
      clearance of 18F-mFBG in myocardial sympathetic neurons and provide preliminary data for
      estimating radiation dosimetry in adults and developing reference files for quantification of
      normal and abnormal levels of the radiopharmaceutical. The second part will examine a group
      of stable patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class 2 heart failure (HF) and
      reduced left ventricular (LV) systolic function (LV ejection fraction (EF) â‰¤35%). The primary
      objectives of the second part will be to:

        -  document the degree to which 18F-mFBG uptake in the heart is reduced and

        -  characterize the distribution of regional abnormalities in relation to findings on other
           cardiac imaging studies such as myocardial perfusion (MP) and magnetic resonance (MR)
           imaging.

      Effectiveness of 18F-mFBG will be judged in relation to historical experience with other
      nuclear imaging agents for cardiac sympathetic innervation imaging such as a
      123I-meta-iodobenzylguanidine (mIBG) and 11C-hydroxyephedrine (HED).
