      the first time was that elderly individuals present greater foot abduction (toe-out) during
      running than young adults. This alteration has been observed in elderly individuals in
      general during walking, and identified as a protective mechanism to not overload the medial
      compartment of the knee joint. It is also known that elderly individuals present a different
      joint torque distribution in the lower limbs during walking in comparison with young adults.
      However, it's not known the relation between the movement patterns, particularly the foot
      abduction pattern, and the mechanical load on the knee joint during running by elderly
      individuals and neither the longitudinal effect of running practice on this relation and on
      the mechanical joint load distribution. Another unknown aspect is the actual effect of the
      running practice on the posture control of elderly individuals.

      With this project, the investigators want to understand why elderly individuals change their
      movement pattern during running, to determine for the same subjects if this altered pattern
      is also present during walking and standing, and to determine the effect of running practice
      on the elderly posture control. Our hypotheses are that the strategy of greater foot
      abduction is present in all movement tasks and that the use of this strategy is related to
      the integrity of the knee joint, even considering the highly active elderly individuals and
      that the practice of running contributes for a better postural control in this population.

      These findings will contribute for a greater understanding of the benefits of the practice of
      running and the adaptations developed by the elderly runners and in this way to contribute
      for the prescription of this activity to the elderly population.
