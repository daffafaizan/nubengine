      condition affecting millions of aging Americans, up to 35% of those 65 or older. Currently
      used treatment methods include voice therapy, injections of inert fillers, and laryngeal
      framework surgery. These modalities are imperfect with voice therapy requiring considerable
      time commitment, filler injections generally temporary in benefit, and surgery with increased
      risks. The investigators intend to conduct a single-arm study to assess the safety and
      efficacy of autologous platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injection for vocal fold atrophy, sulcus
      vocalis and scar. PRP is a substance purified from the patient's own blood that consists of
      platelets, growth factors, and other regenerative molecules that have been shown to promote
      rejuvenation in a variety of tissue types. Patients with vocal fold atrophy, sulcus vocalis,
      and scar identified in the USC Voice Center will be offered participation in a study to
      receive serial PRP injections in one vocal fold. Outcome measures evaluated pre- and
      post-injection and over follow-up visits will include various patient reported quality of
      life indices, objective clinical assessments of voice, and laryngeal videostroboscopy
      examinations. The investigators hypothesize that serial PRP injections will significantly
      improve vocal fold mucosal volume, morphology, and dysphonia in these patients with no
      adverse side effects.
