      remote monitoring technology in patients being discharged following cardiac surgery at Mayo
      Clinic in Rochester, MN. The investigators also aim to determine whether machine learning
      algorithms can predict readmission following cardiac surgery in these patients, which the
      investigators believe will benefit patients in future studies.
