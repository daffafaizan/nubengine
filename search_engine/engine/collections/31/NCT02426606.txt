      blood sample will be taken by fingerprick, and approximately 500ÂµL of blood will be dripped
      into a collection tube. The participant will then consume a meal of either: white bread,
      white rice (or white potato), or white rice with lentils (or white potato with lentils).
      White bread will be consumed on the first study visit and the rest of the meals will take
      place in random order in the visits following. Each meal will provide a total of 50g
      available carbohydrate. Six more blood samples will be taken by fingerprick at 15, 30, 45,
      60, 90 and 120 minutes after the beginning of the meal.
