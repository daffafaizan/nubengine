      non-weight bearing restrictions for periods of up to 6 weeks. This is necessary to allow for
      soft tissue healing particularly following repair of rotator cuff tears and shoulder
      replacement surgeries, two common procedures performed in the elderly population. Previous
      studies have shown that natural arm swing plays an essential role in maintaining balance and
      normal gait patterns. Decreased functional mobility and gait impairment has been shown to
      increase the risk of falls, mortality, and morbidity in an elderly population. However,
      following upper extremity surgery requiring the use of a sling, targeted therapy for gait and
      balance training is rarely prescribed. Consequently, the investigators wish to assess whether
      or not sling use impacts functional mobility test scores in an elderly population. The aim of
      this project is to maximize perioperative functionality in these patients in efforts to
      prevent any unanticipated secondary injury.
