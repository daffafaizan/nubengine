      surgery, is blocked by anticholinergics and enhanced by opioids and dexmedetomidine. Two
      recent studies suggest that deeper inhalational anesthesia monitored by bispectral index
      (BIS) protects against OCR; the investigators wondered if our data correlated similarly.

      Methods: In an ongoing, prospective study of OCR elicited by 10-second, 200 gram square-wave
      traction on extraocular muscles (EOM) from 2009 to 2013, anesthetic depth was estimated in
      cohorts using either BIS or Narcotrend monitors. The depth of anesthesia was deliberately
      varied between first and second EOM tested.
