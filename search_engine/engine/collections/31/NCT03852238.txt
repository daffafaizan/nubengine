      with hepatitis B or C viruses, alcohol, obesity, exposure to aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) or
      hemochromatosis. Nevertheless, 10 to 40% of HCCs can develop on non-cirrhotic terrain and
      about 5% on nonfibrotic liver (NfHCC). In 20 to 40% of these NfHCCs, no classical HCC risk
      factor is identified. Some cases could be the result of a transformation of an adenoma.
      Others may be associated with yet non-formally identified toxins and / or a specific genetic
      predisposition. While there is a lot of data on alterations of signaling pathways (ß-catenin,
      AKT / mTOR, Ras / pERK, etc.) in "classical" HCCs, altered pathways remain unknown in most
      NfHCCs, even in some cases, activation of β-catenin, inactivating mutations of HNF1 or
      activators of gp130 have been shown. A specific study of NfHCCs, rather rare cancers,
      represents an opportunity to look for directly carcinogenic factors in the absence of
      cirrhosis, and to dissect the involved carcinogenesis pathways.
