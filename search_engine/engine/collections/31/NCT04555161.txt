    
      This clinical investigation is a prospective, non-randomized, single- arm, multi-center early
      feasibility study of the Aria CV Pulmonary Hypertension (PH) System implanted in patients
      with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). The purpose of this study is to validate that the
      clinical use of the Aria CV PH System is safe for the patient, and to evaluate its
      performance in treating patients with PAH.

      The study will be conducted in a maximum of 10 centers in the United States with a planned
      maximum enrollment of 45 patients to ensure up to 15 "Device Deployed" subjects. Patients
      will be evaluated at each of the following time intervals: preoperative, implant, 7-day (or
      discharge if earlier) and 1-, 3-, 6-, 12- and 24-month post index procedure. The Aria CV PH
      System will be assessed at each follow-up visit, as well as at 2- and 9- month and quarterly
      between 12 and 24 months. The duration of the study is anticipated to be 2.5 years.
