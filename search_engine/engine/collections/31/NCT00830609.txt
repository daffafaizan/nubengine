        1. Efficacy 1.1) Rate of RNA-HCV negative at week 4 and 24 in each arm. 1.2) Rate of SVR in
           each arm.

        2. Safety 2.1) Rate of adverse effects in each arm.

      Design: Randomized controlled trial.

      Patients will be randomly allocated into three arms:

      Arm A : Peginterferon α-2a (180 μg/week)SC. plus Ribavirin (800 mg/day) p.o. over 24 weeks.

      Arm B: Peginterferon α-2a (180 μg/week) plus Ribavirin (1600 mg/day) with support of Epoetin
      β (450 IU/kg/week) SC over 4 weeks:

      B1.- If RNA-HCV undetectable at week 4, standard of care will be continued (Peginterferon
      α-2a, 180 μg/wee plus Ribavirin (800 mg/day) over 20 additional weeks).

      B2.- If RNA-HCV were detectable at week 4, treatment will be continued with peginterferon
      α-2a (180 μg/week) plus RBV(1,600 mg/day) plus Epoetin β (450 UI/kg/week) over 20 additional
      weeks.

      Sample size: 111 patients. To increase the SVR from 50% to 75%. Beta: 0.1; alfa: 0.05; Loss:
      15%.

      Randomization will be 1:2, 37 patients in Group A and 74 patients in group B.
