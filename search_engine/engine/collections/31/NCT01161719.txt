      All subjects were screened and assessed for psychiatric and learning disorders using
      structured interviews (DICA, parent and child version, Reich et al, 2000) based on DSM IV
      criteria and parent and teacher rating scales. Mothers took the Beck Depression Inventory
      (BDI) to assess for depression.

      Parents or primary caregivers were randomized to two treatment arms (videoconference or face
      to face). Ten sessions of weekly parent training through either videoconference or
      face-to-face delivery was conducted using Dr. Russell A. Barkley's manual. A non-mandatory
      skill training and play group was offered to the children of both groups while parents
      attended the parent training group in order to provide child care for the parents during the
      training sessions.

      Following outcomes will be measured to assess the effectiveness of the intervention:

      Primary outcome Acceptance of the parent and children on the mode the communication as well
      as parent training.

      Secondary outcomes:

        1. Parent-child relations measured by the Parent Child Relationship Questionnaire (PCQ)

        2. The Vanderbilt Assessment Scale (parent & teacher versions), Children Global Assessment
           Scale (CGAS), Clinical Global Impression- Severity score (CGI-S), and Clinical Global
           Impression-Improvement Scores (CGI-I) assessed the severity of core symptoms of ADHD and
           oppositional/aggressive symptoms.

        3. The parent and teacher-rated versions of the Social Skills Rating System (SSRS) assessed
           social skills.
