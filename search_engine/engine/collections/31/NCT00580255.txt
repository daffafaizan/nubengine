        1. To assess the correlation between elevated brain natriuretic peptide levels and elevated
           thoracic impedance/body fluid index as measured by selective biventricular
           resynchronization devices and an external impedance cardiography device.

        2. Correlate impedance measurements and brain natriuretic levels with occurrence of atrial
           and ventricular arrhythmias as assessed by interrogation of biventricular devices.
