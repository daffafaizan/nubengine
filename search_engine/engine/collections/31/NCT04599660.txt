      really peculiar neoplasm for its biological and clinical properties. Surgery (if feasible) is
      the main therapeutic approach for all the patients with localized disease, while a
      pharmacological adjuvant treatment is reserved to those with a relevant risk of
      recurrence/progression.

      After tumor removal, clinical and radiological follow-up is of central importance to early
      intercept recurrence and to evaluate the most correct subsequent therapeutic approach. In
      particular, for the group of patients with GIST at very-low and low risk of
      recurrence/progression, the evidences to support a specific follow-up program and its
      features are poor.

      On the basis of the aforementioned considerations, we propose a multi-institutional
      retrospective study in order to identify the most relevant and advisable features of
      follow-up, and to explore its impact on principal clinical outcomes. Moreover, a dedicated
      effort will be pursued to identify the peculiar characteristics (if any) of patients that
      experienced recurrence of the disease.

      The study will collect data about patients affected by primary GIST at very-low and low risk
      of recurrence/progression, referred to participating Institutions between January 2000 and
      February 2020
