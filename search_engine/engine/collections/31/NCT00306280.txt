      worldwide. Treatment by multiple antibiotics and proton pump inhibitors is effective but are
      compromised today by significant non compliance due to side effects and duration of required
      treatment. Also, the increase in antibiotic resistance coupled with the decreased
      availability of new antibiotics project a significant population of patients who will not be
      treatable with antibiotics.

      A special, visible-light based phototherapy system has been demonstrated to significantly
      decrease the viability of H pylori in vitro and in a brief clinical experiment.

      This study will evaluate the safety and short term efficacy in up to 60 patients of the
      phototherapy system to treat H pylori.
