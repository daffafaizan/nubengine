      fatigue, pain, neuropathy and diminished functional performance that can affect the
      survivor's quality of life (QOL). And as survival for multiple myeloma continues to improve,
      physical activity may be a supportive therapy that can help to address the multitude of QOL
      concerns. Physical activity is a modifiable behavior, and has been proposed as an important
      non-pharmacologic intervention to improve health-related outcomes among cancer survivors. The
      American College of Sports Medicine examined evidence of the impact of physical activity in
      cancer survivors, and concluded that physical activity is safe for cancer patients, both
      during and after cancer treatment, and may lead to improved physical functioning, decreased
      physical fatigue, and improved QOL in a number of cancer survivor groups, including
      hematopoietic malignancies. While a small number of studies have suggested that exercise may
      reap benefits in QOL and fatigue in multiple myeloma survivors, none were conducted in the
      local context.Given the limited evidence, the primary objectives of this preliminary study is
      to estimate the prevalence of physical activity among a local sample of multiple myeloma
      survivors, and to investigate its associations with reported fatigue and quality of life.
