    
      The primary objective is to determine the pathological complete response (pCR) of combining
      preoperative tegafur-uracil, folinate, radiation and celecoxib for locally advanced rectal
      cancer.

      The secondary objectives of this study are to determine:

        1. Toxicity profile of combining celecoxib, tegafur-uracil, folinate and preoperative
           radiation for locally advanced rectal cancer.

        2. Negative resection margins (circumferential resection margin) rate.

        3. Downstaging rate.

        4. Sphincter preservation rate

        5. Locoregional and distant failure rate.

        6. Overall survival
