      detection program employing state-of-the-art science and technology in collaboration with
      other nationally recognized clinicians and scientists.

      This proposed research study will foster collaboration between clinicians and scientists that
      will facilitate the rapid identification of a set of molecular, biochemical, functional, and
      genetic markers which can be employed to effectively detect and manage ovarian cancer and
      other gynecological malignancies.
