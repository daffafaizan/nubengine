    
      There is two sequences, one before and one after the physical activity program. Each sequence
      contains one "rest" session and one "exercise" session.

      Each session contains : blood sample at regular interval (Leptin, Ghr√©lin, CCK, PYY, GLP-1),
      a sleeping assessment (Pittsburg scale), an assessment of hunger sensations at regular
      interval, an assessment of food intake in a "ad libitum" lunch and in the diner indirectly by
      the SU.VI.MAX. tool.

      During the " rest " session :

      Blood samples, assessment of hunger sensation, assessment of food intake are realized during
      the morning. Physical condition (VO2 max, DEXA, and muscular test), insulin-sensibility,
      lipid profile, are also assessed.

      During the "exercise" session: it is identical to the first session but an intense exercise
      of 40 minutes is realized at 70% of the patient's VO2 max. The peripherical blood output is
      measured by a non-invasive method: the Near-Infra-Red-Spectroscopy, during the exercise.

      The 3-months-physical activity program : there is 4 sessions of 30 minutes and 2 sessions of
      1 hour per week. Most of exercises sessions are realized at home but one 1-hour session per
      week is controled with a sports educator.
