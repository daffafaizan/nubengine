      Group) to scheduled implant removal (Removal Group) in 100 skeletally mature patients with
      Lisfranc injuries previously treated with screw and/or plate fixation. The primary outcome
      measure is the validated, patient-reported Foot and Ankle Ability Measure (FAAM) at 1-year
      post initial Lisfranc injury. Secondary outcome measures include: 1. American Orthopedics
      Foot and Ankle Midfoot Score (AOFAS), 2. patient-reported Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for
      Foot and Ankle, 3. range of motion, 4. radiographic assessment of Lisfranc reduction, 5.
      comparative cost analysis between treatment groups. This study will follow patients for
      1-year post-injury.

      Patients, surgeons, employers, and administrators will benefit from an evidence-based
      approach to implant removal following operatively treated Lisfranc injuries. This study will
      allow orthopaedic surgeons to counsel patients regarding the advantages and disadvantages of
      implant retention compared with removal. This study will provide robust data to inform
      clinical decision making for surgeons and provide patients with information regarding
      expected functional outcomes following Lisfranc injuries.
