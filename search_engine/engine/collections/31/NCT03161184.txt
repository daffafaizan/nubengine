      women's access to maternal health services through prenatal counseling and referral. However,
      CHW performance can often be enhanced with sufficient training, incentives, supportive
      supervision and job aids. Smartphone-based applications designed to assist CHWs with
      referrals, health education and client counseling may improve the quality of care delivered
      during household visits. There is a need for rigorous scientific studies on the impact of
      such interventions.

      This study investigates whether CHWs' use of a smartphone-based application increases women's
      use of maternal health services in Singida region, Tanzania. It is hypothesized that
      smartphone-assisted counselling by CHWs can increase use of health facility-based delivery
      services compared to a control group of CHWs using standard paper-based protocols. This study
      is conducted within the context of larger project - SUSTAIN-MNCH Project (Supporting Systems
      to Improve Nutrition, Maternal, Newborn and Child Health), implemented by World Vision
      through multiple partners.
