      corticospinal excitability and central sensitization of pain pathways for their influence on
      quadriceps voluntary activation. A secondary objective is to establish the feasibility of an
      intervention study to determine if changes in the excitability of these supraspinal motor and
      sensory processes can be modified by physical therapy interventions targeting pain and muscle
      strengthening. We hypothesize that patients with knee osteoarthritis will show measurable
      deficits in quadriceps voluntary activation that can be explained by lower levels of
      corticospinal excitability and increased pain sensitization. A 1 week physical therapy
      intervention will improve voluntary activation and reduce pain with concurrent changes in
      underlying motor and sensory processes. We further hypothesize that part of this improvement
      will be attributed to positive treatment expectation.
