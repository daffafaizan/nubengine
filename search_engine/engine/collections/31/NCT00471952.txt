      hours in the vast majority of patients, especially when undertaken as an early intervention
      strategy. Caffeine has been demonstrated to have analgesic effects in patients treating
      tension type headache and is found as part of a combination including aspirin and
      acetaminophen as a treatment for acute migraine headache.

      The mechanism by which Maxalt relieves migraine headache is believed to be through action on
      5HT1B/1D receptors both on blood vessels as well as centrally. Caffeine may have effects on
      relief of migraine through modifying norepinephrine related mechanisms which have been
      suggested through clinical research. Patients commonly report that they may obtain partial or
      complete relief of their migraines by consuming the modest amounts of caffeine found in a cup
      of coffee. this is estimated to be approximately 100mg per cup. The analgesic effects of
      caffeine appear to be most significant in the first 3 hours after ingestion. Recent work
      suggests that intervention in migraine when the pain is still mild and has not persisted for
      a prolonged duration may increase the likelihood of complete migraine response. Therefore,
      the combination of the two agents with activity in migraine that work early in the migraine
      process, have good tolerability at the proposed doses and working via different mechanism may
      increase the likelihood of patients achieving better response with their migraine treatment
      than that which is currently available.
