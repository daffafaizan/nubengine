      some medications can help it from getting worse. The research study will help to answer the
      question if participation in an exercise program helps memory loss from getting worse, and if
      it improves daily functioning and attitudes of those with probable Alzheimer's disease. It
      will involve participation of both the person with memory loss and someone who knows their
      daily activities.

      The research study is a randomized-control trial: some participants will be picked to
      participate in the exercise program, while others will not. Their memory, thinking abilities,
      activities, and attitudes will be measured at baseline and follow-up assessment 5-6 months
      later. Participants are in good health, and are treated with a cholinesterase inhibitor for
      memory loss (standard treatment).
