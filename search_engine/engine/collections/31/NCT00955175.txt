    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To evaluate the acute and long-term radio-induced toxicity (any organ) of
           hypofractionated 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed
           stage I-III non-small cell lung cancer.

      Secondary

        -  To assess the radiological tumor response rate at 3 months after completion of
           radiotherapy.

        -  To assess the actuarial freedom from thoracic progression rate.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to combined lung volume at 25 Gy (â‰¤ 30% vs > 30%).
      Patients are assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups.

        -  Group 1: Patients undergo hypofractionated 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy 5 days a
           week for 24 fractions (total of 72 Gy).

        -  Group 2: Patients undergo hypofractionated 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy 5 days a
           week for 22 fractions (total of 66 Gy).

        -  Group 3: Patients undergo hypofractionated 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy 5 days a
           week for 20 fractions (total of 60 Gy).

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months thereafter.
