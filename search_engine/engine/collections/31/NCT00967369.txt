      I. To determine the objective response rate (ORR), partial remissions (PR), and complete
      remissions (CR) after 3 cycles of bortezomib plus ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide
      (ICE) (BICE) versus ICE in patients with relapsed/refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma
      (cHL).

      II. To evaluate 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) in patients treated with 3 cycles of
      BICE versus ICE.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare positron emission tomography (PET) scan response after 3 cycles of BICE versus
      ICE chemotherapy.

      II. To compare serum levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) proteins (a proliferation-inducing
      ligand [APRIL], B lymphocyte stimulator [BLyS], soluble [s]CD30, and CD40L) and CC thymus and
      activation-related cytokine (TARC) at baseline and after 3 cycles of BICE versus ICE
      chemotherapy.

      III. To correlate baseline cytokine/chemokine levels with response to therapy.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM A: Patients receive bortezomib intravenously (IV) over 5 seconds on days 1 and 4,
      ifosfamide IV continuously over 24 hours on day 1, carboplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1, and
      etoposide IV over 2 hours on days 1-3. Treatment repeats every 14 days for up to 6 courses in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM B: Patients receive ifosfamide, carboplatin and etoposide as in Arm A. Treatment repeats
      every 14 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 4 months for 2 years.
