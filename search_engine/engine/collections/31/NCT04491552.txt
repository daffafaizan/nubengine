      subclinical acute rejection. These studies generally evaluated the diagnostic value of
      TruGraf® at single timepoints. Thus the value of serial monitoring and changes over time has
      not been previously investigated. In addition, no study has assessed TruGraf® and TRAC™in a
      serial and longitudinal fashion.

      Therefore the aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of serial monitoring renal
      transplant patients with both TruGraf® and TRAC™ on long term outcomes.
