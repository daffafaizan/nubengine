      visualization of the LV EBD during pharmacologic stress echocardiography examinations and for
      detection or exclusion of the coronary artery disease (CAD). The study population consisted
      of adult subjects referred for pharmacological stress echocardiography and with suboptimal
      image quality during unenhanced ultrasound imaging at rest who had known or suspected CAD.
      Subjects enrolled in the study represented subjects who could benefit most from
      contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) stress echocardiography.
