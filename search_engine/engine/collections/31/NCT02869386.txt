    
      This is a pragmatic, prospective, multi-center trial with blinded outcome assessment of
      treatment candidates three months after stroke. Treatment candidates will be defined as
      patients with final discharge diagnosis of cerebral ischemia, and onset-to-alarm time â‰¤4
      hours, symptoms not resolved at time of ambulance arrival, and able to walk without
      assistance prior to emergency. These patients will be included if their emergency call from a
      predefined catchment area in Berlin, Germany, caused a stroke alarm at the dispatch center
      during STEMO hours (7am-11pm, Monday-Sunday). About 45% of STEMO dispatches will be handled
      by regular ambulances since STEMO will be already in operation creating the quasi-randomized
      control group.

      B_PROUD uses data from the B-SPATIAL registry. The B-SPATIAL registry has started recruitment
      in January 2016. However, B_PROUD recruits patients with symptom onset October 1st, 2016 or
      later (because data access at the dispatch center had to be established first).
