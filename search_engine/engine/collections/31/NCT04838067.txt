      usually treated with hypnotics or cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, the need for
      novel nonpharmacological treatment for insomnia is increasing emphasized due to reports of
      side effects and detrimental consequences of hypnotics. Trigeminal nerve electrical
      neuromodulation has been suggested as a potential treatment modality through its modulation
      of noradrenergic activity that results in promoting relaxation and reducing hyperarousal.
      Insomnia patients enrolled in the study will go through a 20-minute daily session of the
      Cefaly device(originally FDA-approved device for migraine, which electrically modulates
      trigeminal nerve) for 4 weeks. The objective of this study is to test whether trigeminal
      nerve electrical neuromodulation has a therapeutic effect, validation measures involving
      subjective measures(Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Insomnia Severity Index, Epworth
      Sleepiness Scale), objective measures(Polysomnography measures) and neuroimaging(changes in
      resting state networks, cortical thickness, fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity).
