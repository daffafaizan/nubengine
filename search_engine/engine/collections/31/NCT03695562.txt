      for success There are many researches focused on the outcome of delayed dental implant Since
      the first report of highly success rate after placement of a dental implant there has been
      increasing interest in this technique for implant treatment The goal of modern dentistry is
      to restore the patient's dentition to normal contour function comfort esthetics speech and
      health regardless of the atrophy disease or injury of the stomatognathic system As a result
      of disease related tooth loss and the value placed upon teeth there has been a continual
      search for methods by which missing teeth could be replaced Early artificial replacements
      were made from natural teeth and a variety of substitute materials All transplantation of a
      tooth from one person to another was an early method by which lost teeth were replaced
      Archeological discoveries indicate that many ancient civilizations practiced allogenic tooth
      transplantation. In 1561 Ambrose Pare reported that decayed teeth could be replaced by using
      extracted teeth from another individual and is credited with being the first to mention
      transplantation The core objective of dental implant therapy is to improve functional
      dentition throughout life Nevertheless there are many factors that may effect on implant
      stability A significant part of implant failure may be related to systemic condition that my
      retard dental implants osteointegration one of this factors is vitamin D deficiency recently
      many paper focused on vitamin D deficiency and its impact effect on bone turn over around
      dental implant There are many different techniques for implant placement even sequential
      drilling or single drilling technique knowing that single drilling technique has a
      compression effect which may enhance implant stability however sequential drilling don't have
      compression effect on bone some paper supported that sequential is much better than single
      drilling technique however some paper showed there is no clinical significance between two
      techniques the main idea here that we need to find an ideal technique for implant placement
      in patients with vitamin D deficiency knowing that vitamin D play an important role for bone
      turnover around dental implant to attain the required dental implant stability also play a
      role for osteoblast osteoclast activity Also vitamin D play a role for regulation of
      parathyroid hormone which play a role for homeostasis of calcium level from bone in blood .
