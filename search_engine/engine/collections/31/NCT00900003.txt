        -  To determine whether the cellular localization of BRCA1 can predict how patients with
           pancreatic cancer will respond to cytotoxic agents (e.g., fluorouracil or gemcitabine
           hydrochloride) or radiotherapy.

        -  To identify pre-treatment markers that can be used to correlate with clinical outcomes
           of survival and recurrence.

        -  To determine if a method of extracting and identifying secreted cytokines and growth
           factors from biopsy tissue can now be applied to the pancreatic cancer population.

      OUTLINE: Tissue samples from biopsies performed during pancreatectomy are collected from the
      Vanderbilt Ingram Cancer Center Human Tissue Acquisition Core for laboratory biomarker
      studies. Proteins secreted by cancer cells and/or cancer-associated cells are studied by
      extracting and identifying secreted cytokines and growth factors from biopsy tissue. The
      integrity of the DNA repair pathway in pancreatic cancer is analyzed by Rad51 and
      phosphorylated DNA-PK foci formation. Markers are correlated with clinical outcome.

      Patients are followed for recurrence, relapse, and death from disease.
