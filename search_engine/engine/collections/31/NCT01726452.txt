    
      Indication:

      Patients with cT2-3 N0-1 M0 adenocarcinoma of the oesophagus or junction, based on clinical,
      CT-PET, and EUS staging, will be randomised to the modified MAGIC (ECF/ECX or EOF/EOX) or
      FLOT regimen and chemotherapy regimen versus the CROSS neoadjuvant chemo radiation protocol
      prior to surgery. Patients will be randomised to either Arm A (modified MAGIC or FLOT
      chemotherapy only and surgery) or Arm B (CROSS protocol: chemotherapy with radiation therapy
      and surgery as per multimodal protocol).

      Eligible patients will be randomised in a 1:1 fashion between the modified MAGIC or FLOT
      regimen or the CROSS protocol.

      Exploratory Study- Translational Research :

      The collection of blood and tissue samples for storage in the bio bank for future research.

      Patients enrolled in this trial at the St James's' Hospital site, will be invited to consent
      to having some of their tissue and blood taken for use in future research studies. Following
      consent from the patient, tissue biopsy of tumour and/or normal oesophageal tissue will be
      obtained for research at the same time as that biopsied for histological diagnosis. In
      addition, tumour and/or normal tissue will also be obtained following surgical resection.
      Patient blood samples will also be obtained, both before and during treatment. The
      identification of both tumour and circulating biomarkers will increase knowledge of the
      molecular mechanism(s) underlying treatment response in oesophageal cancer and may facilitate
      the identification of biomarkers predicting patient response to treatment.
