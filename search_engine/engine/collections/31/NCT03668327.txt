      death among children under five years of age. Preterm childrens are more susceptible to
      adverse health problems including brain injury and neurodevelopment delay, and are at risk of
      chronic diseases which could impair the health status and life quality later in life.
      However, the causes of preterm birth is still not clear, and there are no effective
      prediction and preventive strategies. The Preterm Birth Cohort Study in Guangzhou (PBCSG)
      will collect the epidemiological,clinical information and biological specimens including
      maternal blood,cord blood, placenta, children's blood and stool samples of preterm childrens
      and their mothers. More importantly, childrens' health status, physical and neurodevelopment
      will be followed up to late childhood and adolescence. The preterm birth cohort would help to
      explore the mechanism of preterm birth and to examine the short- and long-term influence of
      preterm birth on physical health and neurodevelopment of childrens.
