      component of optimal medical care for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and chronic
      thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH), which improves exercise performance, quality
      of life, and may even modify disease progression.

      To date, no studies have utilized mobile health (mHealth) technology to provide exercise
      program interventions in the pulmonary hypertension population. Leveraging mobile technology,
      such as smartphones or tablets, to administer a home-based exercise rehabilitation program
      could improve patient access, satisfaction, and participation, while providing sustained
      physiologic benefits and incurring major cost savings compared to inpatient or
      outpatient-based supervised programs.

      This study hypothesis is that a home-based exercise program delivered by a mobile app will be
      feasible and safe for PAH/CTEPH patients. The secondary outcomes assessed will explore
      whether there are changes in exercise capacity, health-related quality of life, and right
      ventricular function, compared to standard care.
