      closed-loop anesthesia system can be built using BIS as the control variable, two
      proportional-integral-differential control algorithms, a propofol and a remifentanil
      target-controlled infusion systems as the control actuators. Preliminary results show that
      this system can be used during surgery. We propose a prospective randomized study to evaluate
      the effectiveness of such a closed-loop anesthesia system during the postoperative period.
      Two groups of patients are compared: one in which propofol and remifentanil are administered
      by the anesthesiologist using target-controlled infusion systems, and one in which propofol
      and remifentanil are administered automatically by the combined closed-loop anesthesia
      system. In both groups, the goal is to maintain BIS between 40 and 60, the recommended range
      during anesthesia by the manufacturer. We expect the combined closed-loop system group to do
      similar or better.
