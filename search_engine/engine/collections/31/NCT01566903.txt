      of neurovascular diseases, at the cervical and cerebral levels.

      Secondary objectives are:

        -  to compare the NCE MRA sequences with the CE MRA sequences used in the clinical routine.

        -  to evaluate the anatomic and hemodynamic changes observable with sequences in the
           follow-up of patients, particularly those treated with partial embolization or
           radiosurgery.

      By circumventing the limitation to short bolus duration synchronization, the new dynamic
      sequences have the potential to achieve higher temporal resolution without compromising
      spatial resolution. Arteries and arteriovenous shunts may be more precisely identified and,
      due to a better visibility of small vessels allow a more accurate dynamic analysis.

      Finally, the sequence being derived from arterial spin labeling, and differing from time of
      flight or phase contrast sequences, should allow for an exploration less dependent on the
      vascular geometry with better anatomical analysis. For example, the tendency to overestimate
      arterial stenoses could be reduced.

      The robustness of sequences allow the non-invasive monitoring of patients including it
      possible to monitor the hemodynamic changes after radiosurgery or embolization.
