    
      First, we will detect PD-L1 expression on PBMC of septic patients and healthy controls.

      Second, blockade of PD-1/PD-L1 pathway in vitro and stimulate with some biomolecules and then
      analyze the PBMC function and apoptosis by flow cytometry.

      Then, compare with healthy controls and find the differences.
