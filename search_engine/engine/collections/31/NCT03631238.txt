      Some studies suggested that high TC level in old peoples is associated with a decreased risk
      of dementia.

      Other studies have indicated that hypercholesterolemia may be a risk factor for cognitive
      decline and Alzheimer's disease (AD).

      But a recent study published in 2014 by Cheng and colleagues, showed that, an inverse
      U-shaped relationship between total cholesterol level and cognitive score was found only in
      participants with normal homocysteine levels. Indicating that both low and high total serum
      cholesterol were associated with lower cognitive scores, ended to the relationship between
      cholesterol levels and cognitive function depends upon homocysteine levels, suggesting an
      interactive role between cholesterol and homocysteine on cognitive function in the elderly
      peoples.

      The effect of high serum homocysteine (HHcy) levels on cognition was overwhelming regardless
      of the serum cholesterol levels but in peoples with normal homocysteine levels, both low and
      high cholesterol levels may be detrimental to cognitive health.
