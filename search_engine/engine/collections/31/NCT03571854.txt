    
      1. Total 34 patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I-III who
           underwent lumbar spine surgery in prone position were enrolled.

        2. All patients fasted for 8 hours before the surgery and were premedicated with
           intramuscular glycopyrrolate 0.2 mg. Anesthesia was induced with remifentanil (0.1-0.2
           ug/kg/min), propofol (1.5-2 mg/kg) and rocuronium (0.6 mg.kg) and maintained with
           sevoflurane (2.0-2.5 vol%) in inspired oxygen fraction with 0.5, remifentanil (0.05-0.3
           ug/kg/min) and vecuronium (0.03-0.05 mg/kg/hr).

        3. A 20 G catheter was inserted into the radial artery to monitor continuous arterial
           pressure and hemodynamic variables (cardiac output, cardiac index, stroke volume, stroke
           volume index, and stroke volume variation) monitoring.

        4. All patients were ventilated with a Datex-Ohmeda Ventilator (S/5 AVANCE). Patients were
           randomized to receive either PCV-VG (n=17) or VCV (n=17) mode. The tidal volume in both
           group were set to deliver 8 mL/kg of ideal body weight. The respiratory rate (RR) was
           adjust to maintain end tidal CO2 (ETCO2) 33-38 mmHg.

        5. Hemodynamic variables (mean blood pressure, heart rate, cardiac output, cardiac index,
           stroke volume, stroke volume index, and stroke volume variation) , respiratory variables
           (saturation, RR, ETCO2, peak airway pressure, mean airway pressure and lung dynamic
           compliance) and arterial gas analyses were recorded at 4 stages: (1) 15 minutes after
           induction in supine position, (2) 30 minutes after turning the patient to the prone
           position, (3) 60 minutes after turning the patient to the prone position, (4) 15 minutes
           after turning the patient to supine position at the end of surgery.
