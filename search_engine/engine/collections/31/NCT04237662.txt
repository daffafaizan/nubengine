      periodontal root instrumentation will be performed. In the test group, an additional flapless
      application of enamel matrix derivatives will be granted for sites with pockets deeper than 5
      mm.

      Metabolic glucose control as measured through blood testing and local parameters of
      periodontal health will be measured at baseline and three months after treatment completion.
