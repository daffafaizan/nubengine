      inducing early satiety. Additionally, insertion of an intragastric balloon causes delayed
      gastric emptying; longer gastric emptying times after balloon insertion are correlated with
      more weight loss. The exact mechanism of function, however, is not clear and likely
      multifactorial. The investigators hypothesize that the intragastric balloon causes weight
      loss by affecting gastric and autonomic function, including pace-making and accommodation,
      and that the difference in responsiveness among patients may be mediated by differences in
      gastric function.
