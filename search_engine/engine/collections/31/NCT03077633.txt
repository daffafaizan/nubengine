    
      A prospective Randomized Trial that will test whether treatment with cervical cerclage plus
      vaginal progesterone improves pregnancy outcomes among women with twin pregnancy at 16 0/7 to
      25 6/7 weeks of gestation who have a cervical length (CL) of 0.1 to 15.0 mm on transvaginal
      ultrasound exam, the rate of preterm birth at less than 32 weeks of gestation (PTB<32 wks.)
      and the rate of adverse perinatal outcome will be lower in those treated with cervical
      cerclage plus vaginal progesterone than in those treated with vaginal progesterone alone.
