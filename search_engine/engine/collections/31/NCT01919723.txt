      percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) will be randomized to ticagrelor loading dose and
      eptifibatide bolus-only versus ticagrelor loading dose and eptifibatide bolus plus 2 hour
      infusion administrated after cardiac catheterization, but before PCI. Platelet function
      testing will be performed at baseline and follow-up.
