    
      This was a single-center, open-label evaluation of a single injection of Tc 99m EC20
      containing 0.1 mg EC20 labeled with 15 - 20 mCi of technetium-99m in normal volunteers and
      patients with known or suspected ovarian cancer. Two normal volunteers and two patients also
      were to receive an injection of 0.25 - 2.0 mg folic acid 1 to 2 minutes prior to the
      injection of Tc 99m EC20. Serial blood samples and urine were collected during the 24-hour
      period following each injection for pharmacokinetic evaluation. Serial whole body images were
      acquired during the 24-hour postdose period for dosimetry evaluations. Safety was monitored
      through predose and postdose physical examinations, electrocardiograms (ECGs), vital signs
      and clinical laboratory evaluations. Adverse events were monitored from the time of signing
      of Informed Consent to 24 hours postdose.
