      patients are unsuitable for tumor resection because of factors such as poor hepatic
      reserve(cirrhosis) which directly lead a poor liver function. Direct ablative treatments
      include radiofrequency ablation, microwave (MW) ablation and cryotherapy and irreversible
      electroporation had been used successful as a therapeutic choice for unresectable patients.
      At the same time，Irreversible electroporation(IRE)，which was applied with a novel ablation
      technology, can induce tissue necross by utilizing short pulses of high-voltage electrical
      energy. The technique also had many advantages, including Short ablation time, preservation
      of vital structures within IRE-ablated zone, avoidance of heat/cold-sink effect, complete
      ablation with well-demarcated margin and real-time monitoring of IRE ablation.
