      As a secondary objective, data will be analyzed to determine the effects of medical and
      musculoskeletal comorbidities on the rating of upper extremity function by the patient.

      Potential Contribution: The data that we intend to gather could further our understanding of
      the overall health impact of thumb osteoarthritis and allow surgeons to more accurately
      interpret patient-rated measures of upper extremity function in the presence of
      comorbidities.

      Osteoarthritis of the thumb carpometacarpal joint is one of the most common sites of
      arthritic degeneration in the hand. To date, no study has examined this conditions impact on
      overall health using a validated health measure (e.g. SF-36). Additionally, no study has
      examined the impact of medical and musculoskeletal comorbidities on patient-rated measures of
      upper extremity function in these patients.
