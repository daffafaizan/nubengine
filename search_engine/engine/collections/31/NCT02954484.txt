      Whether pregabalin given preoperatively and for one week postoperatively in addition to
      patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) morphine is effective in reducing morphine requirements,
      improving pain scores and reducing chronic neuropathic pain when compared with placebo for
      primary total knee arthroplasty.

      Methodology:

      A single-centre double-blind randomized controlled trial in patients undergoing primary total
      knee arthroplasty. All subjects receive PCA morphine, paracetamol 1g every six hours,
      etoricoxib 120mg once daily postoperatively. Subjects receive either pregabalin 75mg po
      preoperatively followed by 75mg OM and 25mg ON for two days postoperatively or matching
      placebo. The primary outcome is cumulative morphine consumption at 72 hr following surgery.
      Secondary outcome measures included pain scores, knee range of motion and patient
      satisfaction.
