      Thrombectomy Device with the legally marketed MERCI Retrieval System. The study will evaluate
      safety and efficacy of the ReStore™ Thrombectomy Device in subjects diagnosed with acute
      ischemic stroke who require mechanical thrombectomy. All eligible patients will be enrolled
      and randomized to treatment with either the investigational therapy or the control therapy.
