      I. To assess the response rates in patients with recurrent or persistent epithelial ovarian,
      fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer who are treated with oral cyclophosphamide alone
      or oral cyclophosphamide with celecoxib.

      II. To assess the time to disease progression in this group of patients. III. To further
      describe the toxicities of oral cyclophosphamide with or without celecoxib in the above
      patient population.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive oral cyclophosphamide once daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 4
      weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive oral cyclophosphamide once daily and oral celecoxib twice daily on
      days 1-28. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.
