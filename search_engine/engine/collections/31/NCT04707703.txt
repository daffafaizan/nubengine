    
      Adult patients with polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infection
      without a diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis who are hospitalized in the ICU are eligible
      for inclusion in this study and will be randomized to the isavuconazole plus standard of care
      (SOC) group or placebo plus SOC group.

      If randomized to the isavuconazole group, participants will receive intravenous
      isavuconazonium sulfate 372 mg every 8 hours for 6 doses followed by intravenous
      isavuconazonium sulfate 372 mg once daily for up to 28 days. If randomized to the placebo
      group, participants will receive intravenous placebo every 8 hours for 6 doses followed by
      once daily for up to 28 days. Both groups will receive the usual SOC.

      Following randomized to the two treatment arms, participants will be screened for invasive
      aspergillosis with thrice weekly fungal cultures from tracheal aspirate (TA) secretions or
      thrice weekly serum galactomannan (GM) testing (if TA unable to be performed,
      contraindicated, or participant is not intubated). If invasive aspergillosis or other
      invasive fungal infection is detected, antifungal therapy will be initiated (if the
      participant is in the placebo arm) or modified if needed (if the participant is in the
      isavuconazole arm).
