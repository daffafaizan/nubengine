      temperature = 33 degrees Celsius or 91.4 degrees Fahrenheit) during open neurosurgical
      craniotomies for aneurysm clipping improves neurological outcome (measured as 3 months after
      surgery) in patients who have suffered an aneurismal SAH. This may be the only NIH-funded
      trial to examine the impact of an intraoperative intervention on neurological outcome
      following any neurosurgical procedure, and is certainly the largest trial of its kind yet
      undertaken.

      Many methods have been proposed to "protect" neurosurgical patients from neurological
      complications that can occur during and after intracranial vascular procedures. However, no
      treatment targeted at the intraoperative period has ever been systematically tested. Mild
      hypothermia was chosen as the treatment to be tested after an extensive review of medical
      literature and discussions with many anesthesiologists and neurosurgeons expert in the field
      suggested it was the intervention most likely to be beneficial. Hypothermia is also easily
      produced in the operating room and most anesthesiologists are familiar with managing mild
      hypothermia. As a result, the investigators felt that a trial of hypothermia was practical
      and reasonably safe.
