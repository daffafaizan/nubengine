      injection (ICSI) were included in the study. The patients were randomly allocated into two
      groups. The intervention group consisted of 50 patients who received intrauterine injected
      with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). The other group (the control group)
      consisted of 50 patients and injected with intrauterine Human Chorionic Gonadotropins (HCG).
      Both groups received the interventions at ovum pick-up day. The main outcome was the clinical
      pregnancy rate which has been evaluated after 2 weeks of the positive pregnancy test. The
      secondary outcome was an ultrasound image of the gestational sac after 6 weeks of pregnancy.
