      available and known to exhibit anti-inflammatory activities. This is a Phase IIa bicentric
      baseline-to-treatment study with the standardized frankincense extract Boswelan to test the
      safety, tolerability and efficacy of BAs in RR-MS patients. Following a 3-month screening
      phase, patients received an individualized dose finding identifying the highest well
      tolerated BOSWELAN dose for each patient. The primary outcome in the treatment phase (Stage
      3) will first compare mean Gd-enhancing lesion number occurring during the 4 month baseline
      to mean Gd-enhancing lesion number occurring months 5, 6, 7, 8 on treatment in patients
      treated with a dose of at least 800 mg t.i.d.
