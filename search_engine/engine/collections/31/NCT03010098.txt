      into two groups:closed-loop (group A,n=100) and open-loop group(group B,n=100).The procedure
      during induction of anesthesia was same in two groups.In group A,if Narcotrend index(NI) fall
      down to 46 and keep more than 30 seconds,propofol and remifentanil were intravenously infused
      as feedback automatically to achieve the target NI of 26-46.However,the NI in group B was
      controlled manually.Taking an exam of MMSE before and after the surgery which measures if the
      older's cognition changed. Furthermore.we will measure the levels of protein S100beta and
      NSE.
