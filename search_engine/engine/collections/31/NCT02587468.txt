    
      Phytonutrients are regarded to play an important role in many health-related issues like:

        -  Improvement of redox balance

        -  Anti-inflammatory effects

        -  Prevention of chronic diseases like CVD, stroke, diabetes II, Alzheimer´s, AMD, and
           certain forms of cancer

        -  Beneficial effects on human´s microbiome Therefore it is of scientific interest whether
           this product provides absorbable phytonutrients/phenolics and vitamins to support
           mechanistic explanations for the beneficial outcomes observed in the past after intake
           of Juice Plus+®.

      GOAL To identify absorption kinetics and bioavailability of phenolic compounds and specific
      vitamins from encapsulated Juice Plus+® powder

      MERITS

        -  This study would reveal knowledge whether and to which extent specific vitamins and
           phenolic compounds are absorbed, including absorption kinetics/metabolism.

        -  Data of this study may provide support for mechanistic arguments on the beneficial
           clinical outcomes observed and published in the past.

      ENDPOINTS

        -  Absorption kinetics of phenolic compounds in plasma

        -  Bioavailability of vitamins C, E, and carotenoids into plasma

      Absorption kinetics of phytonutrients:

        -  Open-, one-arm study, absorption kinetics over 10 hours

        -  5 blood sample collections: baseline (= 0); 1hr, 2hrs, 5hrs and 10 hours after intake of
           3 capsules

        -  Wash-out of all food supplements and dietetic foodstuff: 2 weeks

        -  Wash-out of phytonutrients: 48 hours before baseline sampling, accomplished via a
           phytonutrient-poor diet.

      Bioavailability of vitamins C, E, A and carotenoids:

        -  Open-, one-arm study over 8 weeks

        -  2 blood sample collections: at baseline (2 weeks after the phenolics experiment) and
           after 8-weeks

        -  Wash-out of all food supplements and dietetic foodstuff: 4 weeks, 2 weeks before the
           phenolics experiment + another 2 weeks Subjects: 20 healthy subjects from Graz region,
           meeting all inclusion criterions (see underneath).
