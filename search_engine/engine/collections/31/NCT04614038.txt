      makes them non-healing over time. The inability to identify a slowly healing or non-healing
      wound early on can be detrimental to the patient's well-being. Currently, determination of
      non-healing wounds is based on the clinician's visual observation of wound size changes for 4
      weeks. It is also well established that chronic, non-healing, or infected wounds often reside
      in an alkaline state while healing wounds are habitually associated with a non-alkaline and
      even acidic environment.

      To reliably and continuously monitor wound alkalinity objectively, a portable, disposable,
      non-invasive, and non-contact device - DETECÂ® pH - was developed to indirectly assess the
      alkalinity of wounds by analyzing the wound exudate adsorbed on to freshly discarded wound
      dressings during the participants' follow-up visit. Subjects with chronic wounds will be
      screened and enrolled in this investigation based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria.
      The study will include enrollment and initial assessment visit, subsequent visits when the
      device will be tested, and end of study wound healing status assessment at 12 weeks. The
      subjects' wounds will be managed using standard care by the provider at each visit. The
      device outputs and wound conditions will be recorded. The clinicians will be blinded to the
      device outputs that will be compared to the clinical non-healing status of the wounds
      assessed for up to 12 weeks after the subjects' enrollment. For the study, a non-healed wound
      is defined as one that has failed to achieve complete wound closure that is defined as skin
      re-epithelialization without drainage or dressing requirements (100% of the wound is covered
      and the surface is intact), as assessed by the treating clinician.
