      recognize tumor associated antigen and kill tumor cells specifically. CAR-T therapy showed
      great effect on patients with relapsed or refractory B cell malignancies. To improve the
      efficacy and safety, the researchers designed a second-generation humanized CAR, consisting
      of humanized CD19 single chain variable fragment (scFv) and CD137 costimulatory domain. This
      study aims to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of humanized anti-CD19 CAR-T cells in
      patients with relapsed or refractory B cell Malignancies.
