      number of proposed mechanisms. The purpose in this study is to identify biomarkers in
      pulmonary hypertension to further understand the pathophysiology of this disease in patients
      with heart disease.Patients are recruited in the cardiac catheterization lab, which are
      undergoing right heart catheterization as per their plan of care established by their primary
      cardiologist. During the procedure, we will ask the performing cardiologist to obtain a blood
      sample of 40-50 milliliters from the catheter that they are using during the procedure. These
      blood samples will be sent for analysis of biomarkers. The patient will then have an
      echocardiogram done 1 year from their heart catheterization.
