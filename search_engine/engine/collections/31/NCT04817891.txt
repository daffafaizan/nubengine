      neural network regions underlie cognitive fluctuations in patients with LBD. The
      cingulo-opercular task control (COTC) neural network is believed to play a role in
      maintenance of alertness but this remains uncertain in LDB. This critical knowledge gap forms
      the basis of our first aim. The study proposes to use transcranial direct current stimulation
      (tDCS) to "excite" critical cholinergic denervation components of the COTC as an adjunct to
      cholinergic pharmacotherapy in a target engagement study. tDCS is an emerging non-invasive
      neurostimulation technology that may improve a range of neurological symptoms, including
      cognition. The study will evaluate whether target engagement by tDCS excitation of
      cholinergic denervated COTC hubs may affect cognitive fluctuations in LBD subjects.
