      TBS--with the goal of decreasing or increasing dmPFC responding, respectively--and one of
      sham TBS. Session order will be counterbalanced, with a double-blind approach to condition.
      Brain function, behavior, and mood will be assessed before and after each TBS session.
      Broadly, the investigators predict that inhibitory TBS to the dmPFC will enhance neural,
      behavioral, and subjective aspects of reward function by reducing dmPFC function and dmPFC
      connectivity with the ventral striatum (VS).
