      checkpoint inhibitor and local ablation via RFA / MWA / brachytherapy or combination of TACE
      with RFA, MWA or brachytherapy harbors the potential to satisfy the unmet need for an
      improvement in the outcomes of HCC patients treated with RFA / MWA/ brachytherapy or
      combination of TACE with RFA, MWA or brachytherapy. Furthermore, early clinical data
      indicates that the combination of immune checkpoint inhibition with RFA, MWA or brachytherapy
      displays an acceptable safety profile, resulting in a positive benefit-risk ratio of this
      trial.
