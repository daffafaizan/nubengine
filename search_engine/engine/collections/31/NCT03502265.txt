      before, during, and after Otteroo experience. Study population or sample characteristics.
      Participants will be 4 pre-locomotor infants or young children for whom a healthcare provider
      or caregiver has identified concerns about potential developmental delay. Study methodology.
      A single-subject research design will be used: measures of infant development will be
      collected across a 4-week baseline period (standard care), 4 weeks of intervention (standard
      care and Otteroo use), and a 4 weeks of reversal/retention period (standard care). Study
      endpoints or outcomes. The end of the study is the final assessment at 12 weeks. Follow-up.
      None. Statistics and plans for analysis. Researchers will calculate descriptive statistics
      (mean, range, coefficient of variation) for all measures and describe changes over time,
      relating the participant's performance at each time point to norm-referenced results for
      their age.
