      progesterone metabolites, 4 cortisol metabolites, free cortisol, six organic acids,
      8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), and melatonin that are measured on patient urine
      samples and cortisol and cortisone on patient saliva samples. The investigators would like to
      both reinforce the validation of the accuracy of these urinary markers and examine how these
      markers associate with patient demographics, symptoms, hormone therapy doses and routes of
      administration.

      This study will involve analysis of existing data from routine clinical care. All data will
      be deidentified and each set of results will be given a study ID number. The key will be held
      by Danielle Martinot and will contain only the original Precision Analytical sample accession
      number and the new study ID (identification). No identifying PHI (Protected Health
      Information) will be accessible to the PI.

      These data will be used to evaluate the following hypotheses: 1) Urinary hormone measures
      accurately reflect expected changes in hormones with regard to circadian rhythm, menstrual
      status, and use of hormonal medications; 2) Urinary metabolites of cortisol will show a
      stronger association with body mass index and symptoms related to cortisol production as
      compared to salivary measures; 3) Urine values of reproductive hormones and organic acids
      will correlate to the dosing of estrogen and androgens more strongly than to progesterone
      creams; 4) 8-OHdG, a measure of oxidative stress, and melatonin will be correlated with age
      and BMI; and 5) Urinary hormone measures will capture age-related changes in hormone
      regulation.
