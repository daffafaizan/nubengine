      thermal pain stimuli will be used to elicit activation of the pain neuro-matrix. All
      participants will undergo thermal pain threshold testing before and after fMRI scan.
      Participants will also rate the painfulness and unpleasantness of the thermal stimuli applied
      before fMRI and after fMRI. All participants will be given prompts to apply a set of
      cognitive pain-control strategies. Half of the participants will receive real-time fMRI
      feedback of activity in the Right Anterior Cingulate Cortex (rACC) and the other half will
      receive real-time fMRI feedback of activity in the Prefrontal Cortex (PFC). It is
      hypothesized that those receiving real-time feedback of brain activity thought to be involved
      with analgesic effects will demonstrate greater analgesia associated with the application of
      the cognitive control techniques after fMRI paradigm (decreased pain intensity and
      unpleasantness ratings and increased thermal pain thresholds) than those who are not given
      feedback before fMRI paradigm.
