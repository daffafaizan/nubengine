      participating center. Subjects will be allocated randomly in each of the two interventional
      arms independently by stratification in each participating center. The population for
      intervention will be medical staff from three different national hospitals in the frontline
      during the pandemic. After valid informed consent, a screening process will take place to
      identify symptoms as baseline evaluation using validated self-assessment tools delivered
      through electronic invitation. Post-intervention measurements will take place at 3 and 6
      months from baseline. Intention to treat analysis and per-protocol analysis will take place.
      CONSORT guidelines were followed.
