      arterial pressure and on the autonomic cardiac modulation of hypertensive individuals treated
      in the Unified Health System (UHS). Two prospective, randomized, controlled trials will be
      conducted with hypertensive patients in the public health network of Petrolina (PE) and SÃ£o
      Paulo (SP). Included in the study will be individuals with an age group over 18 years of both
      genders, with systemic arterial hypertension (SAH) controlled with the use of
      antihypertensive medication, non-smokers and without the presence of diabetes or other
      cardiovascular diseases that will be allocated randomly in two groups: supervised group (SG)
      and control group (CG). SG will be instructed to perform supervised isometric handgrip
      exercise for three weekly sessions in four sets with two minutes of isometric contraction
      with 30% of maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) of the subjects and interval between
      two-minute series. In CG, individuals will be encouraged to increase their level of physical
      activity. Prior to initiation and after 12 weeks of intervention, blood pressure, autonomic
      cardiac modulation and level of physical activity will be obtained.
