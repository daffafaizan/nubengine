      secondly, lymphoproliferative disorders, will be enrolled into the study, and will be
      referred to as the index case. The analysis will be performed both retrospectively and
      prospectively. A gene panel deep sequencing (GPDS) of the tumor DNA from peripheral blood of
      the index case at diagnosis will be performed in order to identify mutations in a number of
      genes known to be associated to myeloid malignancies, mainly: ASXL1, BCOR, NRAS, TP53, RUNX1,
      CEBPA, FLT3, EZH2, IDH1, IDH2, NPM1, DNMT3A, TET2, CBL, KRAS, ETV6, SF3B1, SRSF2, U2AF1,
      ZRSR2, GATA2, TERT, TERC, SRP72, and ANKRD26.

      In case none of the known mutations is found by the GPDS, whole exome sequencing (WES) will
      be performed as second step on the tumor cells of the index case.

      When one or multiple somatic mutations are found, a Sanger Sequencing (SS) on germline DNA
      from epithelial buccal cells of the index cases and affected relatives will be performed for
      the screening of the same somatic leukemic mutations on germline DNA. If the index case and
      affected relatives share the same mutations on the germline, the same germline mutations will
      be checked by SS in the unaffected family members.
