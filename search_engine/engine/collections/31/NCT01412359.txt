      fat emulsions composed of soybean oils. Lipids are necessary in PN dependent patients due to
      their high caloric value and essential fatty acid content. Phytosterols such as those
      contained in soybean oil based fat emulsions are thought to have a deleterious effect on
      biliary secretion and they have been implicated in predisposing patients to PN associated
      liver disease. Children requiring prolonged courses of PN are at risk for developing PN
      associated liver disease. The investigators hypothesize that although soybean oil based fat
      emulsions prevent fatty acid deficiency, they are not cleared in a manner similar to enteral
      chylomicrons and therefore accumulate in the liver resulting in steatotic liver injury.

      Animal studies have shown that fish oil based IV fat emulsions(IFE)which are high in
      eicosapentaenic and docosahexaenoic acid, reduce impairment of bile flow seen in cholestasis
      caused by conventional fat emulsions. Omegaven速 is a fish oil based IV fat emulsion. The
      investigators hypothesize that administering Omegaven速 in place of conventional soybean fat
      emulsions may reverse or prevent the progression of PN associated cholestasis and thus allow
      the patient to be maintained on adequate PN until he/she is able to ingest adequate nutrition
      enterally.

      Primary outcome measures to be addressed include the normalization of liver enzymes including
      bilirubin upon the start of Omegaven速 and continued growth on Omegaven速. Safety measures will
      include the prevalence of essential fatty acid deficiency, hypertriglyceridemia, and bleeding
      disorders.
