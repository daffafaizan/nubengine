      produce a good number of oocytes at retrieval. However, in addition to quantity, oocyte
      maturity is an important variable for the success of reproductive technologies. In general,
      nearly 85% of retrieved oocytes are mature and reproductively useful, whereas the remaining
      percentage are still at metaphase I or germinal vesicle stage (MI: 4% and GV: 11 %,
      respectively). Due to the limited expectations held for in vitro maturation in said
      stimulated cycles, the rescue of immature oocytes is not widely used in current clinical
      practice and these oocytes are usually discarded due to the possibility of abnormal embryonic
      development or an increased rate of abortion.

      The objective of our study is to assess if immature oocytes co-cultured with autologous
      cumulus cells is a safer strategy than just leaving the oocytes in standard culture.
