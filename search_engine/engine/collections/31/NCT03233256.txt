      complexity of sample collection and preparation, and the level of technical skills required
      for Isotope-ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) analysis have limited the adoption of the doubly
      labeled water (DLW) method; and 2) the investigators preliminary data demonstrates that
      Off-Axis Integrated Cavity Output Spectroscopy (OA-ICOS) provides a valid, more rapid, and
      less technically challenging approach to isotopic analysis of human samples.
