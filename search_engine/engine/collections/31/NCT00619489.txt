      (IV) every 8 weeks. The study population included treatment-naïve ulcerative colitis (UC) or
      Crohn's Disease (CD) participants, as well as 38 UC participants who had tolerated
      vedolizumab well during Study C13002 (NCT01177228).

      In the original study protocol, all participants were randomized to receive vedolizumab at
      doses of either 6 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg. With the implementation of Amendment 1, the assigned
      doses of vedolizumab were decreased to 2.0 mg/kg and 6.0 mg/kg. To implement the dose
      changes, instead of randomizing all participants across both doses, those who rolled over
      from Study C13002 were reassigned to receive the 2.0 mg/kg dose and all participants who
      entered C13004 naïve to treatment were to receive the 6.0 mg/kg dose, starting on the next
      scheduled dosing day. Also, if participants assigned to the 2 mg/kg dose experienced flare,
      they were to receive the higher 6 mg/kg dose.

      In the results analyses for this study, participants are grouped according to the lowest dose
      received, i.e., 2.0 mg/kg or 6.0 mg/kg vedolizumab.
