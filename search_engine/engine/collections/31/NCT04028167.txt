      gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma are suboptimal, with low rates of pathologic
      complete response (pCR) to current neoadjuvant treatment strategies. Although significant
      progress has been made by incorporation of neoadjuvant chemoradiation or perioperative
      chemotherapy, most patients will ultimately develop disease recurrence, with both
      locoregional and distant recurrence representing a significant component of failure. For
      patients receiving preoperative chemoradiation, a regimen consisting of concurrent
      carboplatin and paclitaxel with radiotherapy has been established as a standard of care based
      on the Chemoradiotherapy for Esophageal Cancer Followed by Surgery Study (CROSS). In the long
      term results of CROSS, locoregional progression was noted in 22% of patients receiving
      neoadjuvant therapy, with distant progression in 39%.

      Recent studies have also suggested perioperative chemotherapy as a potential alternative
      strategy for selected patients, based on results of the MAGIC trial, which included a subset
      patients with esophageal/GE junction tumor location, and demonstrated improved survival for
      patients receiving perioperative epirubicin, cisplatin, and infusional 5-fluorouracil (ECF)
      compared to surgery alone. The FLOT4-AIO trial has subsequently demonstrated a further
      overall survival benefit to a perioperative regimen of docetaxel, oxaliplatin, and
      leucovorin, with short term infusional 5-FU (FLOT) compared to ECF. A regimen of
      perioperative FLOT is currently being compared to preoperative chemoradiotherapy using the
      CROSS regimen in the ongoing ESOPEC trial (NCT02509286).

      Given the significant risk of recurrence either with the CROSS preoperative chemoradiation
      regimen, or the perioperative FLOT regimen, it is plausible that selected patients may
      benefit from a combination of intensified systemic therapy using the FLOT backbone, in
      combination with sequential preoperative chemoradiation due to the known risk of locoregional
      recurrence in this population. This study evaluates the proposed neoadjuvant regimen of
      induction FLOT followed by neoadjuvant chemoradiation in patients with resectable cT3/T4 or
      node positive adenocarcinoma of the esophagus or gastroesophageal junction.
