      patients with burns at the Burn Center at University Medical Center. A total of 12 adults
      aged 18 to 80 years with >/= 20% percent total body surface area burned will be required to
      complete the study. A single intravenous dose of ceftolozane and tazobactam of 2 grams/1 gram
      will be administered over 60 minutes and whole blood will be obtained predose and at 0.5, 1,
      1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, and 24 hours following the start of infusion. Urine samples
      (5 ml) will be collected from a urine collection bag (if the patient has urinated) at the
      following timepoints: 0-0.5, 0.5-1, 1-2, 2-4, 4-8, 8-12, and 12-24 hours for analysis of
      ceftolozane and tazobactam content. Urine for collected during each time period will be
      measured to determine urine volume for urine clearance calculations. The volume of urine in
      the urine over the entire 24 hour period and an aliquot sent for analysis of urine creatinine
      content to determine the patient's 24 hour creatinine clearance.
