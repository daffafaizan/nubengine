      certified for intraoperative use in humans (CE No 0653), is topically applied to the bleeding
      site. The delivery device consisted of a 5ml syringe containing Seraseal plugged to standard
      delivery catheters, either ERCP catheters or dye spraying catheters (Boston Scientific, USA)
      that are inserted via the working channel of the endoscope. Once the bleeding is identified
      at endoscopy, the delivery catheter is inserted through the endoscope and positioned toward
      the lesion, leaving 1-2 cm between the bleeding site and the catheter tip. Seraseal is then
      delivered in short spray bursts or direct shots (for 1-2 seconds) until hemostasis is
      confirmed. A maximum of 5ml of Seraseal is administered in each patient. Homeostatic success
      is determined by 5 min without bleeding at gastrointestinal site. after application of
      Seraseal.

      Two groups are formed for analysis of this proof of concept study:

      In group A, Seraseal is applied as initial method for hemostasis. If successful, the bleeding
      site is then observed for 5 minutes. If bleeding remains active or recurs, the institutional
      standard of care for hemostasis is applied.

      In group B, Seraseal is applied as rescue therapy after an initial failure of the
      institutional standard method. If Seraseal is successful, the bleeding site is then observed
      for 5 minutes. If the bleeding remains active or recurs after Seraseal, alternative methods
      of hemostasis will be applied.
