      controlled trial will either be exposed to ten vape education messages or to ten messages on
      sun safety, with all messages formatted for social media.

      This study will take place over a 1-month period. Individuals who complete the screening
      survey and are eligible to participate will be invited to complete a 10-15 minute baseline
      survey at the start of the study. This survey will ask questions about tobacco and electronic
      vapor product use, and beliefs about and perceptions of vape products. This survey will also
      ask about exposure to tobacco and e-cigarette marketing, exposure to prevention messaging on
      vaping and tobacco use, and peer and family influences on tobacco use. During the survey,
      participants will be presented with and be asked to provide feedback for short health-related
      messages.

      One month after completing this survey, participants will be sent an invitation to the
      follow-up survey. This survey will again ask about tobacco and electronic vapor product use,
      and beliefs about and perceptions of vape products.

      All study procedures will take place remotely, with surveys conducted online. At the end of
      the first survey, participants will be eligible to receive a $10 online gift card. Upon
      completion of the follow-up survey, participants will be eligible to receive a $15 online
      gift card. In total, participants will be eligible to receive up to $25 for completing both
      surveys. Those who are ineligible will not be asked to complete the baseline survey and will
      not be compensated.
