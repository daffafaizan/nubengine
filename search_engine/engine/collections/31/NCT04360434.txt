    
      This phase 1, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial in subjects with Amyloid
      Transthyretin Cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM) consists of single-ascending dose (SAD) and
      multiple-ascending dose (MAD) phases, followed by an open-label extension (OLE) phase.

      In the SAD phase subjects are randomized in a 4:2 ratio to receive a single infusion of NI006
      or placebo.

      Subjects completing the SAD phase will be enrolled in the MAD phase upon evaluation of all
      available safety data and receive a maximum of 3 additional infusions of NI006 or placebo
      every 28 days.

      Subjects completing the MAD phase will have the possibility to continue in an OLE phase with
      treatment up-titrations and switch from placebo to NI006 and receive up to 8 infusions of
      NI006 every 28 days.

      In the dose escalation about 30 to 36 subjects are planned to be enrolled in 5 to 6 ascending
      dose cohorts of 6 subjects each.
