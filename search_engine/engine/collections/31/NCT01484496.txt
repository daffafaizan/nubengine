    
      This is a Phase 3, multi-center, international, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      52-week study to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of belimumab administered
      subcutaneously (SC) (200 mg weekly) in adult subjects with active Systemic Lupus
      Erythematosus (SLE). Approximately 816 SLE subjects will be randomized, with a target of
      about 544 subjects receiving belimumab and 272 subjects receiving placebo. Subjects
      completing the 52-week double-blind period can enter a 6-month open-label extension in which
      all subjects receive belimumab 200 mg SC weekly.
