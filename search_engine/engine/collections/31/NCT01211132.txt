      colonoscopy compared to standard colonoscopy. Also, cap assisted colonoscopy will be safe and
      cecal intubation rate will be similar compared to standard colonoscopy.

      Specific Aim 1 - To compare the prevalence of adenomas detected by standard colonoscopy and
      cap assisted colonoscopy.

      Specific Aim 2 - To compare the number of adenomas detected per subject by standard
      colonoscopy and cap assisted colonoscopy.

      Specific aim 3 - To compare the cecal intubation rate, insertion time, withdrawal time and
      complications of standard colonoscopy and cap assisted colonoscopy.
