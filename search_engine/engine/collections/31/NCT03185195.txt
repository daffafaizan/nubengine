    
      This is a single-centre, open-label, non-randomised, 2-part, sequential dose study in healthy
      male and female subjects. It is planned to enrol a single cohort of 8 healthy subjects (4
      male and 4 female) who will participate in Part 1 and Part 2 of the study.

      In Part 1, each subject will receive a single oral dose of AQX-1125 followed by an IV
      microtracer dose of carbon-14-AQX-1125 ([14C]-AQX-1125). In Part 2, each subject will receive
      a single oral dose of [14C]-AQX-1125.
