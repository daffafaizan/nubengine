      survival of stage III or IV melanoma patients, divided in 3 sub-cohorts:

        -  Patients treated in the adjuvant setting (cohort A): new user of immune checkpoint
           blockers.

        -  Patients treated in the metastatic setting (cohort B): - B1: new users of immune
           checkpoint blockers; - B2: prevalent users of immune checkpoint blockers treated with
           complementary radiotherapy.

      For patients of cohort A and B1, immune profiles characteristics will be evaluated before
      initiation of treatment (=baseline), and at each radiological evaluation of the tumour
      response, up to maximum 12 months as duration.

      The maximal duration of treatment will be 12 months for patients treated in the adjuvant
      setting. For metastatic patients, the duration of treatment will be decided by physician
      according to different factors (responses, progression, toxicities, ...).

      For patients in cohort B2, the characteristics of the immune profiles will be evaluated
      before radiotherapy initiation,, within 6 weeks after the end of radiotherapy, then at the 2
      following radiological evaluations of the tumour response
