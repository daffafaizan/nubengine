      Seizure Therapy (MST) and Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT) in patients currently experiencing
      a major depressive episode in the context of either unipolar or bipolar depression. ECT is
      known to be highly effective in treating depression, but it can have some adverse cognitive
      side effects. MST is a new form of convulsive therapy that is being developed as a means of
      improving the side effect profile of ECT so that more patients may benefit without suffering
      significant detrimental effects on cognition.

      Both ECT and MST cause a seizure, but they do so in different ways. In ECT, an electrical
      stimulator is used to pass an electrical current between two electrodes placed on the
      person's head, which causes some electricity to go through the brain and cause a seizure. In
      MST, a magnetic stimulator is used to pass a magnetic field to the brain, which then creates
      a small electrical field in the brain that causes a seizure.

      In addition to the treatment sessions, this study will involve a number of assessments at
      different timepoints that are used to evaluate the person's antidepressant response and the
      physical and cognitive side effects of treatment.
