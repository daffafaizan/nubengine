      sham-controlled investigation of Trigeminal Nerve Stimulation as a treatment for ADHD, and
      who were randomized to the sham condition.

      In the double-blind trial (NCT02155608), children ages 8-12 years undergo study screening and
      if eligible begin 4 weeks nightly treatment with active or sham TNS administered nightly
      during sleep. At the conclusion of the 4-week trial, all interventions (both active and sham
      TNS) are discontinued with blinding remaining in place for an additional week to assess
      possible residual treatment effects. Participants' randomized condition is unblinded at Week
      5.

      All participants randomized to sham in the double-blind trial are invited to participate in a
      4-week open-trial of TNS to allow all participants the opportunity to benefit from the active
      intervention.

      During this 4-week open-extension trial, interested participants will receive nightly active
      TNS during sleep. The final study visit (Visit 5) of the double-blind study will serve as
      baseline for this open-extension. Participants will return for clinic assessments at Weeks 2
      and 4. Participants who achieve clinically significant improvement from active TNS over the
      4-week open trial will be invited to receive a year of nightly active-TNS therapy as part of
      a 12-month extension study.
