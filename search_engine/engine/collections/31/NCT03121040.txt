      VAAMÂ® (two cans every day) for 10 weeks. In detail, on the 6 days/week of supervised running
      tests, participants were instructed to consume one drink before their warm-up exercise and
      the other drink while running. During their sessions and without supervision (1 day/week),
      participants were also instructed to consume one drink in the morning after breakfast and the
      other drink in the evening after dinner.

      The subjects were divided into three groups for the running tests: 3 males were assigned to
      group 1, which involved training for the 1500-meter race; 2 males were assigned to group 2,
      which involved training for the 800-meter race; and 1 male and 3 females were assigned to
      group 3, which involved training for the 400-meter race. The running exercises began with a
      45 min warm-up (including jogging, leg stretching, etc.) followed by running their specific
      races. The experimental procedure was conducted 6 days/week for 10 weeks.
