      through day of life 21, if the infant is already having labs drawn that day. The primary
      outcomes will be intestinal perforation and/or death on or before day of life 21. Each
      patient will be followed until death or discharge. Discharge will be defined as the release
      of the infant to home. Infants who are transferred to another NICU may be followed if the
      receiving NICU is one of the investigational sites. Transfer includes the release of the
      infant to outside units or other units within the same hospital. The purpose of this follow
      up is to obtain serial IRT values through day of life 21.
