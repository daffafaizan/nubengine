      media before stenting. In the GOO tailored group (33 cases), the distal stents were
      semi-spherical with a length of 20 mm and a diameter of 28 mm. The middle stent segments had
      diameters of 20 mm. The proximal ends of large cup-shaped stents had 53.3 ± 5.5 mm diameters
      and were 15 or 20 mm long, whereas the large funnel-shaped stents had 33.6 ± 3.6 mm diameters
      and were 25 or 30 mm long. The control group (32 cases) received standard uncovered stents
      (semi-spherical, with diameters of 28 mm and 20 mm long).Our hypothesis was that unresectable
      GOO tailored covered stents are superior to the standard uncovered ones in terms of stent
      re-obstruction and stent migration. In the current study the efficacy and safety of GOO
      tailored covered stents for the treatment of non-resectable GOOs caused by distal gastric
      cancer was compared with standard uncovered stents.
