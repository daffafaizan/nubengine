    
      Study ADCT-402-101 is the first clinical study with ADCT-402 in participants with B-cell Non
      Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL).

      ADCT-402 is an antibody drug conjugate (ADC) composed of a humanized antibody directed
      against human cluster of differentiation 19 (CD19), stochastically conjugated via a
      valine-alanine cleavable, maleimide linker to a pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) dimer cytotoxin.

      The study will be conducted in 2 parts. In Part 1 (dose escalation) participants will receive
      infusions of ADCT-402, at escalating doses. Part 1 will continue until the maximum tolerated
      dose is determined. In Part 2 (expansion), participants will be assigned to the recommended
      dose level(s) and schedule(s) of ADCT-402 identified in Part 1 by the Dose Escalation
      Steering Committee.

      For each participant, the study will include a screening period (up to 28 days), a treatment
      period (until withdrawal), and a follow-up period to assess disease progression and survival
      for up to 12 months after the last dose of study drug. The total study duration will be
      dependent on overall participant tolerability to the study drug and response to treatment. It
      is anticipated that the duration of the entire study (Parts 1 and 2) could be approximately 3
      years from first participant treated to last participant completed.
