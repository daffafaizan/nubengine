      FiO2 mask, driven by 10-15L/min oxygen and are randomly assigned to control or NIV group.
      Preoxygenation is then performed for a 3 minute period prior to a standardized rapid sequence
      intubation. For the control group, preoxygenation use a non-re-breather bag-valve mask driven
      by 15L/min oxygen. Patients allow to breath spontaneously with occasional assists (usual
      preoxygenation method). For the NIV group, pressure support mode is delivered by an ICU
      ventilator through a face mask adjusted to obtain an expired tidal volume of 7 to 10 mL/kg.
      The fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) was 100% and we used a PEEP level of 5 cmH2O.
