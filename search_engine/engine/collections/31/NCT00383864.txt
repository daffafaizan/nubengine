      liver transplantation. Several strategies can be used to prevent or treat hepatitis C in the
      setting of liver transplantation. There are no controlled studies evaluating the efficacy and
      safety of antiviral treatment (using pegylated interferon and ribavirin) in liver transplant
      recipients. The main endpoint of this study was: 1) histological outcomes (effect of
      antiviral treatment on disease progression, i.e. liver fibrosis). The secondary endpoint were
      1) Sustained virological response (persistent HCV-RNA clearance) and 2) Safety of pegylated
      interferon and ribavirin
