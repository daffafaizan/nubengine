    
      This is a randomized, double blinded, placebo-controlled, monocentric, cross-over study with
      two 6-week periods of placebo or rosuvastatin. Subjects will enter a one month placebo
      lead-in period after which they will be eligible for rosuvastatin 20 mg or placebo for two
      6-week periods.

      An in vivo kinetic study will be performed with stable isotopes (13C leucine) in type 2
      diabetic patients (n=8) before and after a 6-week period of rosuvastatin (20mg) therapy. The
      study is design with a one-month steady state period with placebo then on a cross-over design
      with two 6-week periods of placebo or rosuvastatin (20 mg. An in vivo kinetic study will be
      performed at the end of each 6-week period.

      The kinetic studies performed, in each patient, will assess the production rates and
      fractional rates of VLDL1-apoB, VLDL2-apoB, IDL-apoB, LDL-apoB and HDL-apoA-I.
