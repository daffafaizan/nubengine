      limb salvage procedure. This prospective randomized study reported early results of 30
      unreconstructible patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI) treated during 2009 year at
      Clinic for vascular surgery, Clinical Center of Serbia in Belgrade. Patients were divided in
      two groups, 10 treated with DVA and 20 conservatively (CT) using antiplatelet drugs.
