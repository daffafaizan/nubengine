    
      This study was terminated on March 8, 2010 due to an analysis by an independent Data Safety
      Monitoring Committee (DSMC) indicating that the addition of CP-751,871 [figitumumab] to
      erlotinib [Tarceva] would be unlikely to meet the primary endpoint of improving overall
      survival when compared to erlotinib alone.

      This Oncology study continues as terminated, however for ethical reasons some patients, noted
      with resultant benefit, continue receiving treatment.
