      Efficacy objectives:

      The primary objective is to assess the effect of denosumab on the reduction of radiographic
      erosive progression using GUSS (Ghent University Score System).

      The secondary objective is to assess the effect of denosumab on the reduction of radiographic
      erosive progression as defined by diminishing the appearance of new erosive IP finger joints.

      The exploratory objective is mainly to assess the effect of denosumab on clinical variables,
      as well as ultrasonography and DEXA (dual energy x-ray absorptiometry) parameters.
