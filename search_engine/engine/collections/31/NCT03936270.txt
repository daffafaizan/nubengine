      for the treatment of postmenopausal women with breast cancer. It is administered orally on a
      continuous 2.5 mg daily dosing regimen and has a good toxicity profile. Palbociclib
      (Ibrance®) is an active potent and highly selective reversible inhibitor of cyclin- dependent
      kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6). Palbociclib was approved by the United States Food and Drug
      Administration (U.S. FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the treatment of
      postmenopausal women with hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor
      receptor 2 (HER2)-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer in combination with an
      aromatase inhibitor based on a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, international
      clinical trial PALOMA-2. It is administered orally on a dose of 125 mg per day in 4-week
      cycles (3 weeks of treatment followed by 1 week off). This trial was based on preclinical
      studies that showed a synergistic effect between targeting the ER and cyclin-D-CDK4/6-Rb
      pathway. The principal toxicity was myelotoxicity but it was managed with appropriate
      supportive care and dose reductions13.

      Based on the results of phase 1 and 2 clinical trials of CDK4/6 inhibitors used as
      monotherapy to treat patients with recurrent ovarian cancer, we hypothesized that, as
      Palbociclibe is active in this population and many ovarian cancer show ER/PR expression, its
      combination with Letrozole can improve outcomes in ER/PR positive endometrioid or high-grade
      serous Ovarian Cancer who have disease progression on second-line chemotherapy, similar to
      what is seen in breast cancer studies.
