      unrelieved symptoms and side effects of often-aggressive treatments can lead to poor
      psychosocial functioning and decreased health-related quality of life (HRQOL) for patients
      and their families. Barriers at the patient, healthcare provider and system levels can
      contribute to poor symptom management. A technology-based program can minimize these barriers
      by routinely collecting and interpreting patient-reported outcomes (PROs) and patient/parent
      contextual data in pediatric oncology ambulatory settings in a manner that is efficient,
      actionable by physicians, supports engagement of patients and families with their health and
      care, and improves clinical processes and outcomes. This proposed project will develop and
      evaluate the effectiveness of such a program: Symptom Monitoring & Systematic Assessment and
      Reporting System in Young Survivors (SyMon-SAYS). We hypothesize that the SyMon-SAYS
      intervention will decrease parent-perceived barriers to managing their child's symptoms,
      decrease patient symptom burden, increase patients' and parents' self-efficacy, and
      ultimately increase patient HRQOL.
