      rubric of lymphoma exist some of the fastest growing cancers known to science, (Burkett's
      lymphoma, lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia), as well as some of the most indolent (small
      lymphocytic lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, and marginal zone lymphoma). This remarkable
      diversity of biology imposes significant challenges. Researchers are seeking to understand
      the cell of origin and differentiate what are sometimes subtle differences between the
      related sub-types of disease; and to identify the best treatments for these subtypes, with
      the ever-increasing likelihood that new understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of these
      diseases will result in an increase in new drugs for specific target populations.
