      can cross the blood brain barrier .There it can deposit in areas of the brain, with a
      predilection for deposition in the basal ganglia, auditory pathways, and oculomotor nucleus.
      This deposition and accompanying damage result in the classical symptoms associated with
      kernicterus. Hypoxia, acidosis, prematurity, and genetic predispositions all increase the
      risk for kernicterus.In well term babies risk for kernicterus increases after bilirubin
      levels cross (20 mg/dL) and it is very high above (30 mg/dL). In preterm babies the threshold
      for damage from bilirubin could be as low as(20mg/dl). The risk increases with increasing
      serum levels of unconjugated bilirubin.

      Acute bilirubin encephalopathy presents as lethargy, high pitched cry, poor feeding, abnormal
      tone, opisthotonus, upgaze palsy and seizures. Aggressive treatment at this stage can reduce
      the damage caused. Chronic bilirubin encephalopathy leads to conditions like choreoathetoid
      cerebral palsy, high frequency hearing loss, dental dysplasias and oculomotor palsies.
