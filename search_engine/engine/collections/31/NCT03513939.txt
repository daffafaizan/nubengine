      Pouch™ implantation, immunosuppression will be initiated and optimized for another 3 weeks.
      This will allow for proper vascularization of the Cell Pouch™ chambers and the patient to be
      stabilized on immunosuppression prior to transplantation. A mass, >3,000 islet equivalent
      (IEQ) numbers per kg of patient body weight (IEQ/kg), of highly purified islets will be
      transplanted in the Cell Pouch™. The Cell Pouch™ will be assessed for safety and tolerability
      for up to one year following transplant. Data for the primary and secondary endpoints will be
      summarized using descriptive statistics (such as counts and percentages).
