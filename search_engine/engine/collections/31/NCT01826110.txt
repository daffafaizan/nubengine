        1. To perform PET scans with [11C]PIB to use for direct (i.e., same-subjects) comparison of
           [11C]PIB and [18F]AV-45

        2. To establish the most effective and reliable PET imaging method to detect amyloid
           deposition in AD, in order to understand disease progression and subsequently evaluate
           treatment effects.

        3. To ascertain a PET imaging method that will minimize discomfort for subjects, thus
           increasing the potential for clinical follow-up scans, by reducing the patient burden
           and potential cost of future PET examinations.

      A separate protocol/study will be conducted using [18F] AV-45. Participants who enroll in
      this protocol using [11C] PIB will be consented to participate in the [18F] AV-45 (IRB #
      NA_00033155) protocol/study as it is a mandatory requirement that participants participate in
      both protocols.Up to 20 participants with mild to moderate Alzheimer's Disease and 10 healthy
      volunteers will participate in this study.
