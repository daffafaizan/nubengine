    
      Multicenter, randomized, controlled clinical trial conducted from August 28, 2001 to April
      23, 2004, of 102 pediatric patients from 7 US pediatric intensive care units aged 2 weeks to
      18 years who were treated with supine vs. prone positioning. Randomization was concealed and
      group assignment was not blinded.

      Patients were randomized to either supine or prone positioning within 48 hours of meeting
      acute lung injury criteria, with those patients in the prone group being positioned within 4
      hours of randomization and remaining prone for 20 hours each day during the acute phase of
      their illness for a maximum of 7 days, after which they were positioned supine. Both groups
      were treated using lung protective ventilator and sedation protocols, extubation readiness
      testing, and hemodynamic, nutrition, and skin care guidelines.
