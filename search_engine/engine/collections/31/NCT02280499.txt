      Radiological and clinical loosening rates of the glenoid and humeral components must be
      comparable or below the rates of other well documented state-of-the-art shoulder systems with
      cemented glenoid components. Complications occurring intra- or postoperatively will be
      assessed and sub-classified in their relation to the implant.

      At the end of the observation, a long-term survival rate will be calculated according to
      Kaplan-Meier with revision due to aseptic loosening as the end-point.

      Secondary objectives:

      The Constant Murley score and the ASES clinical evaluation are used for documenting the
      improvement in pain, function and range of motion. For the patient's subjective view of
      improvement in function a patient self-assessment form is used.
