      clinical and experimental data indicate that statins regulate yet other processes, many of
      which play a major role in sickle cell disease (SCD). Independent of their
      cholesterol-lowering effects, statins have been shown to prevent damage to blood vessels in
      several ways, through upregulation of endothelial nitric oxide (NO)and decreased
      inflammation. Numerous studies documenting the protective effects of statins, together with
      data showing the therapeutic role of NO in SCD, provide the basis for investigating the
      potential clinical benefit of simvastatin in SCD.

      Data supporting the safety and tolerability of simvastatin in patients with SCD are now
      needed. For this phase I/II dose-escalation study of oral simvastatin in SCD, we propose the
      following specific aims:

        1. To obtain preliminary efficacy data on the effects of oral simvastatin on plasma
           biomarkers of endothelial injury in patients with SCD, and

        2. To assess the safety and tolerability of oral simvastatin in patients with SCD.
