      the vertebrae, are performed at a rate of nearly 13 million per year in the US, across a
      myriad of diagnostic and therapeutic clinical scenarios.

      The standard of care involves manual palpation of the patient's back to detect the spinous
      processes (SPs) and estimate the location of the interspinous needle insertion site. While
      providers are trained to perform these procedures with meticulous precision and attention to
      detail, this technique remains highly inaccurate, often requiring multiple insertion attempts
      to properly place the needle. These attempts lead to patient pain and complications, such as
      traumatic taps and PDPHs; unpredictable procedure times; and poor facility throughput.

      The VerTouch device uses tactile imaging to offer a non-invasive, untethered, non
      radiation-producing solution for visualizing spinal anatomy in order to identify an ideal
      location for needle placement in a neuraxial procedure. The device can be used to mark the
      identified site with a surgical marker, or to begin placement of a needle or introducer at
      that site.

      Study participants will be recruited in two parallel cohorts: the control (palpation) group
      or the tactile imaging (VerTouch) group, further stratified by procedure setting, including
      emergency medicine, neurology, and anesthesiology. Once an insertion site is marked with a
      marker or shallow placement of a needle or introducer, the procedure will continue in the
      usual manner for subjects in both groups.
