    
      Our primary objective for the study is to clinically and metabolically phenotype parents and
      their offspring to identify risk factors for obesity, T2D, and cardiometabolic risk in
      childhood and adolescence in a prospective birth cohort by reporting:

        1. Maternal and/or paternal factors including anthropometrics, metabolic parameters, HNF1a
           genotype, lifestyle (diet and physical activity), and socioeconomic environment.

        2. Infant factors including anthropometrics, early infant nutrition, and metabolism.

      Secondary Objectives:

        1. To evaluate if children born to mothers with T2D prior o pregnancy are at increased risk
           of obesity and T2D.

        2. To determine the modifiable risk factors which contribute to the increased risk of
           obesity and T2D.

        3. To evaluate the differential risk between mothers and fathers with T2D in terms of
           somatic and genetic contributions to risk compared to intrauterine environmental
           contributions to risk.

        4. To plan a large-scale, randomized, controlled community-based breastfeeding intervention
           with intensive breastfeeding counseling and support for the prevention of T2D
           development in offspring of mothers or fathers with youth onset T2D.

        5. To explore potential new research questions and feasibility studies for epigenetic
           studies using cord blood under the umbrella of the new research theme on T2D at the
           Children's Hospital Research Institute of Manitoba.
