      providing evidence-based services to intervention families in a seamless package. Low-income
      parents who gave birth to their first child when they were under 21 and who were not involved
      in the child welfare system were targeted as an at-risk group for whom home visitation
      services would offer optimal preventive and cost-efficiency outcomes. Services include
      Interpersonal Psychotherapy [IPT] for maternal depression and Child Parent Psychotherapy
      [CPP] for maternal-child relationship development and trauma treatment, and Parents As
      Teachers [PAT]. Families are provided a tiered complement of BHC services based upon risk and
      current need.

      Case management and outreach services are key to assure family engagement and full program
      participation. An assigned community outreach worker provides a consistent, nurturing
      relationship that helps retain families in the program and readies parents for the
      evidence-based treatments, movement towards goals, and behavior change. Outreach workers help
      to stabilize families and ensure compliance with medical appointments and recommended care.

      Most importantly, BHC home-based services are integrated with primary care practices:
      pediatric, family medicine, and federally qualified neighborhood health center. These
      comprehensive services are compared with a screening and referral only group in a randomized
      design. Integration with the child's medical home is an all-inclusive approach to improve
      child health and well-being and to achieve desired program outcomes.
