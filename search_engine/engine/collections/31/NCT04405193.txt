      pleasurable rush caused by release of dopamine, nor-ephinephrine and serotonin. It produces
      euphoria, a heightened level of alertness and increased level of alertness and increased
      energy. Long-term regular meth use can lead to severe tooth decay, infection, weight loss,
      malnutrition, kidney damage, liver damage, respiratory issues, paranoia, violent behaviour,
      psychosis, severe anxiety and depression.

      Studies suggested that withdrawal symptoms in methamphetamine dependent patients were due to
      the state of hypodopaminergic activities.

      Up to date, no approved medications are available for the treatment of methamphetamine
      addiction. Recently, N-acetylcysteine is recently being studied for methamphetamine
      withdrawal.

      N-acetylcysteine, is a drug that has been long used as a mucolytic. Up to date, there has
      been 2 pilot study investigating the efficacy of N-acetylcysteine for methamphetamine
      dependence. The present study is aimed to confirm the efficacy and safety of N-acetylcysteine
      in the treatment of methamphetamine withdrawal symptoms.
