      parallel study in healthy subjects to evaluate central (CSF) and peripheral (plasma)
      pharmacodynamics effects (Abeta) over 36 hours post single doses of PF-06648671. Two cohorts
      will be run in sequential. the first cohort is to evaluate the Abeta effect at top dose of
      300 mg PF-06648671 and second cohort is to evaluate the Abeta effect at top dose (if more
      subjects are required) and/or 1-2 lower doses
