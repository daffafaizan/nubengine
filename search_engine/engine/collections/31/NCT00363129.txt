    
      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Patients
      are stratified according to type of chemotherapy (taxane vs cisplatin vs carboplatin vs
      oxaliplatin vs combination), age (≤ 50 years vs > 50 years), and gender. Patients are
      randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Compare the incidence of chemotherapy-induced sensory peripheral neuropathy ≥ grade 2 in
           patients undergoing curative neurotoxic chemotherapy for cancer treated with vitamin E
           vs placebo.

      Secondary

        -  Compare the proportion of patients requiring dose reductions of chemotherapy secondary
           to sensory peripheral neuropathy.

        -  Compare the proportion of patients stopping chemotherapy before treatment is complete
           secondary to sensory peripheral neuropathy.

        -  Assess the toxicity of vitamin E in these patients.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 6 months.
