      diseases that are detected initially through an eye examination. For many years, clinical
      decision-making regarding which patient with uveal melanoma required treatment has been based
      solely on clinical features observed at the time of diagnosis. These features include: tumor
      size as measured by ultrasound, associated subretinal fluid, presence of orange lipofuscin
      pigment, lack of drusen, posterior location, and ciliary body involvement. All of these
      clinical features have been demonstrated to be associated with tumor growth which is
      associated with the eventual development of metastases. However, these clinical features are
      not adequately sensitive or specific enough to predict which patients will develop
      metastases.

      More recently, researchers studying the genomics of uveal melanoma have focused on
      identifying genetic abnormalities present in tumor tissue in order to characterize these
      lesions more fully. Several landmark papers over the past 15 years have reported cytogenic
      and genomic abnormalities in uveal melanoma tumor tissue that are associated with a poorer
      prognosis. Although rare, there have been at least five cases in which patients undergoing
      biopsy of these lesions have developed extraocular spread of melanoma from the biopsy sites.
      With this new technique, the possible rate of extraocular spread should be lower, making the
      biopsy a safer technique than what is currently in practice.
