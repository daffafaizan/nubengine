    
      This is an open-label, non-randomized study which will assess the pharmacokinetics and safety
      following 7 days once daily dose of inhaled FF/ GW642444M (200/25mcg) in subjects with renal
      impairment. Nine subjects with severe renal impairment (as defined by a Clcr<30mL/min) will
      be recruited along with healthy control subjects (as defined by a Clcr>80mL/min matched to
      the severe subjects based on gender, ethnicity, body mass index (±15%) and age (±5 years)).
      All subjects will receive fluticasone furoate 200mcg/GW642444M 25mcg once daily for 7 days.
      The results of this study will aid in deciding whether a FF/GW642444M dose adjustment is
      justified in subjects with severe renal impairment and in estimating any such adjustments.
