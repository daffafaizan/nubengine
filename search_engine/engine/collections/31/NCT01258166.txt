      translates medially along the inclined plane of the distal radius. This pattern of
      instability has been well recognized in patients with rheumatoid arthritis as a result of
      articular erosions and attenuation of wrist ligaments. In contrast, ulnar translocation of
      the carpus following trauma is seemingly rare, with published accounts limited to case
      reports and small case series.

      The radiographic features of traumatic ulnocarpal translocation have been described and the
      instability pattern has been reproduced in cadaveric models. However, the recognition of
      radiocarpal malalignment may be unintentionally missed or delayed owing due to the uncommon
      nature of the this injury. The investigators present 11 cases of posttraumatic ulnar
      translocation of the carpus and review criteria for early recognition of the injury and the
      results following varying treatment methods.
