      Obesity is rapidly increasing with an estimated prevalence of 66% in the adult population in
      the United States. GERD symptoms are common in the obese population with data showing weekly
      GERD symptoms in 34.6% and erosive esophagitis 26.9% in people with BMI > 30 Kg/m2.

      Presently, bariatric procedures are the only sustainable method to address morbid obesity and
      its resulting comorbidities. There are endoscopic and surgical bariatric procedures. The
      natural history of GERD symptoms in this population after undergoing a bariatric treatment is
      scarce or conflicting. Moreover, silent or asymptomatic GERD prevalence has not been well
      established preoperatively. Evaluation and documentation of GERD may potentially change the
      planned bariatric procedure and avoid unnecessary additional surgeries or procedures to
      address symptomatic post-operative GERD.

      The investigators hypothesized that GERD is more prevalent in patients undergoing surgical
      bariatric procedures, specifically laparoscopic vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG). This
      multi-center, prospective, cohort study can potentially clarify current debatable data, based
      mostly on retrospective studies, and can help clinicians to select the most appropriate
      bariatric treatment for the patients. Most importantly, by selecting the best approach based
      on preoperative GERD studies it could prevent long term complications of GERD and further
      unnecessary procedures for the bariatric patient.
