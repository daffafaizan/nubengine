      largely justified in the current climate of uncertainty. However, dysfunctional worry, that
      is, pervasive worry that is disproportionate in its intensity or duration, and that
      significantly interferes with every-day problem-solving or goal-driven behavior, is clearly
      counterproductive. Research has also indicated that repeated media exposure to a community
      crisis can lead to increased anxiety and heightened stress responses, that can give a
      downstream effect on health, and misplaced health-protective and help-seeking behaviors
      which, in turn, may overburden health care facilities. There is an urgent need to develop a
      brief, scalable intervention to target such dysfunctional worry in the general population.

      The current randomized controlled trial will evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of a brief
      online-delivered cognitive behavioral intervention designed to target dysfunctional worry
      related to the Covid-19 pandemic. 670 individuals are randomized to intervention or to
      waiting-list. The hypothesis is that the brief self-guided intervention will show significant
      within-group reductions in self-rated worry from baseline (week 0) to post-treatment (week
      3), and that these improvements will be larger than those seen in the wait-list control
      group. The wait-list group will be crossed over to receive the intervention after three weeks
      (post-treatment). All participants will be followed-up one month and one year after the end
      of the intervention.
