    
      Data obtained from patients via the questionnaires will be copied into a computer database
      and as follows :

        -  The date of birth (day, month and year),

        -  Sex,

        -  The patient's opinion and attitude towards the current treatment: compliance, adverse
           effects, lifestyle restrictions, changes in professional activity, family activities,
           relationships, physical fitness, moral, concomitant treatments, expenses not refunded
           parallels related to the management of adverse effects,

        -  The family situation, the number of children,

        -  Degrees obtained and employment,

        -  Net monthly income.

      In parallel with the questionnaires, the Clinical Research Associate (CRAs) of the
      Observatory will collect data from the medical file on site. The data collected on an
      electronic Case Report Form (e-CRF) are as follows:

        -  Type of cancer, date of diagnosis and metastatic disease, possible surgery and
           radiotherapy,

        -  Description of the different treatment lines: number of cures, start and end date,
           response, toxicities,

        -  Status of the patient at the end of the study.

      The number of subjects needed is calculated from observant patients. Based on the existing
      literature on adherence to chemotherapy or targeted oral therapy, the observed compliance
      rate is approximately 80%. However, since this characteristic is the object of this study and
      therefore not known ex ante, in the calculations of the sample size, the value allowing to
      obtain the lowest margin of error on the rate of compliance, an estimated prevalence of 50%
      compliance is used. By setting the risk of the first species at 5%, a confidence level of
      95%, it is then necessary to include 132 patients.

      In addition, given the difficulty inherent in the questionnaires in collecting all the
      information, 20% of the data was estimated not to be evaluable. It will therefore be
      necessary to include 158 patients in the study to reach our goal.
