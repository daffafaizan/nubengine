      The investigators want to improved the current method for bacterial culture test in patients
      with possible sinusitis by reducing the risk of contamination from the nasal vestibule. The
      investigators will examine whether significantly fewer Staphylococcus Aureus are detected in
      the middle meatus when applying a new device for bacterial swab introduction. This device is
      designed to prevent bacterial pollution from the nasal vestibule.

      More precisely, the investigators hope to reduce the frequency of Staphylococcus aureus in
      nasal swabs from 10-15 % to 0-5 %.

      The overall objective is to avoid over-treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics in patients
      with sino-nasal disease.

      Design:

      A comparative study in which patients serve as their own control. A bacterial swab will be
      introduced to both sides of the nose; on the right side using the new device, on the left
      side using the present day technique (visual guidance). 70 participants will be included.

      Statistics:

      A chi-square test will be used for comparison of frequencies.
