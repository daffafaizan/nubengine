    
      Subjects who consented to be part of the trial will be randomized at the time of skin closure
      of their cesarean section to either the standard group or the study group. The standard group
      will receive the standard treatment of 2 doses of 30mg IV Ketorolac on an as needed basis.
      The study group will receive 6 doses of 30mg IV Ketorolac scheduled every 6 hours. The
      subject will receive her first dose in the operating room. The ob/gyn residents will be
      responsible for placing the orders in Sorian for either "Standard Post-Operative Pain
      Control" order set or the "Ketorolac Study Post Cesarean Section Pain Control" order set.
      Please see below for sample order sets. Pain scores will be evaluated using a visual analog
      pain scale every 6 hours throughout hospitalization and recorded in the electronic medical
      record. The amount of oral opiate medications administered for subjects in each group will be
      recorded in the electronic medical record as well.
