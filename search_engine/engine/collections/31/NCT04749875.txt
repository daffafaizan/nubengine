      specificities of the different leukocyte sub-populations in patients with chronic
      inflammatory rheumatism and rare systemic autoimmune diseases. We will perform an exploratory
      descriptive study whom primary endpoint will be to assess by FACS the phenotype of the
      specific leukocyte subsets. In addition, we will characterize the protein and transcriptomic
      signature associated with the conditions for which we have obtained preliminary data showing
      their potential involvement in autoimmunity (i.e: IL7 pathway, IFN signature).
