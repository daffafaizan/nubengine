      tailored Web-based SBIRT (Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment)
      intervention combined with subsequent Web- or Peer-based boosters, compared to enhanced usual
      care (EUC). All participants will also receive a booklet with prevention information that
      includes general alcohol, opioid, and sedative use information as well as other health
      behaviors. The proposed study will screen ~ 4,300 unique Service Members as part of Soldier
      Readiness Processing in the Michigan National Guard (NG) to enroll 750 participants within 35
      armories with alcohol and/or prescribed opioid or sedative misuse (AOS misuse). We will
      identify AOS misuse with a combination of the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification
      Test-Consumption (AUDIT-C) and an adapted version of the Pain Medication Questionnaire (PMQ).
      Computerized screening with touch-screen computer tablets will be used to recruit NG Service
      Members with AOS misuse in the prior 4 months. Participants will be randomized to one of
      three conditions:1) Web-delivered alcohol/prescribed drug misuse brief intervention with Web
      booster sessions (1/month for 3 months; W+W; n=250); 2) Web-delivered brief intervention with
      Peer-delivered booster sessions (at least 1/month for 3 months; W+P; n=250); or 3) Enhanced
      Usual Care (EUC; n=250). Random assignment will be stratified by gender and alcohol vs.
      prescription opioid/sedative misuse.
