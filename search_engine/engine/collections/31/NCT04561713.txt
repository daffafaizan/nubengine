    
      Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is the most common neurodevelopmental
      disorder in school-aged children. This disorder is characterized by a symptomatic triad
      associating, inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity. Cognitive, emotional and behavioral
      dysfunctions have a strong impact on the school, family and social domains of the child. The
      clinical diagnosis of ADHD is all the more difficult because there are currently no
      biological, clinical or psychological markers that accurately measure the symptoms of ADHD.
      The diagnosis is made during interviews with specialist doctors allowing the collection of
      information from parents and the child. Virtual reality technology is most recognized as a
      tool for assessment, rehabilitation of cognitive processes and functional skills. In addition
      to traditional diagnostic assessment methods, a virtual reality application in an immersive
      room (CAVE) in three dimensions could objectively assess the child in a dynamic environment
      that is as close as possible to everyday situations
