      laboratory setting in older overweight adults with type 2 diabetes. Participants will receive
      both of the acute testing conditions in a randomised manner.

      Study design: Randomised cross-over pilot trial of 20 overweight/obese older adults with
      diet-controlled type 2 diabetes involving 2 acute treatment conditions, with a one-week
      wash-out period between testing conditions (Figure 1 a).

      Setting: Acute, supervised laboratory setting within the Alfred and Baker Heart Institute
      Medical Unit.

      Outcomes: We will measure acute responses in laboratory-measured plasma glucose &
      triglyceride levels (every 60 mins) and glucose concentrations determined from continuous
      glucose monitoring (CGMS).
