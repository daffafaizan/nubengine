    
      This study will have three parts.

      Part A of the study is designed to evaluate the incidence of febrile neutropenia, efficacy,
      and dose intensity in participants with advanced stage classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL)
      receiving granulocyte colony stimulating factor primary prophylaxis (G-PP) administration
      during treatment with frontline A+AVD. In Part A, participants will be treated with
      granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) following every dose of A+AVD for 6 cycles of
      treatment. Participants will be treated using institutional standard of care practices for
      the majority of treatment decisions.

      Part B is designed to evaluate the combination of brentuximab vedotin, nivolumab,
      doxorubicin, and dacarbazine (AN+AD) as frontline treatment in participants with advanced
      cHL. In Part B, participants will be given AN+AD combination for 6 cycles of treatment. This
      part of the trial will look at whether this combination of drugs is effective and tolerable
      in participants with Stage II with bulky mediastinal disease and Stage III or IV cHL.

      Part C is designed to evaluate AN+AD as frontline treatment in participants with early stage
      cHL. In Part C, participants will be given AN+AD combination for 4 cycles of treatment. This
      part of the trial will look at whether this combination of drugs is effective and tolerable
      in participants with Stage I or II cHL with non-bulky mediastinal disease.
