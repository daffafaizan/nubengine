      transmission that would also be applicable and affordable in developing-country settings. The
      frequency of vertical HIV-1 transmission is estimated to be 25 percent. The proposed trial
      specifically will test the hypothesis that chemoprophylaxis of the fetus/neonate during labor
      and delivery and the first week of life may significantly reduce the risk of perinatal HIV-1
      transmission.

      Pregnant women infected with HIV-1 are randomized to 1 of 4 study arms and receive either NVP
      or its placebo, or AZT or its placebo. Mothers in the NVP group receive a single dose of NVP
      or placebo at the onset of labor and are followed to 6 to 8 weeks after delivery. Infants
      born to these mothers receive at 48 to 72 hours post-delivery or discharge, whichever comes
      first, a regimen of the same treatment (NVP or placebo) given to the mother. Infants are
      followed for 18 months post-delivery by clinical and laboratory evaluation to determine
      toxicity, evidence of HIV-1 infection, and clinical disease progression.

      Mothers in the AZT group receive either a bolus of AZT or its placebo at onset of labor, then
      doses every 3 hours until delivery, with follow-up to 6 to 8 weeks. Infants begin receiving
      either a lower dose of AZT or placebo as soon as they can tolerate liquids by mouth, twice
      daily for 7 days, and are followed for 18 months as in the NVP group.
