      complete a comprehensive assessment of neurological and behavioral function before and after
      a season of participation. Additionally, those who sustain a concussion will undergo a
      post-injury testing timeline where they are assessed within 5 days of injury and again at the
      following time points: 3-4 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year post-injury. Each individual
      who completes testing as a concussion subject will be matched with a healthy control subject
      by height, weight, age, sport, and position, and each control subject will complete the same
      protocol in similar time increments as subjects with concussion.

      Through this study design, we hypothesize that we will be able to detect objective deficits
      resulting from concussion within one week of injury and determine the feasibility and added
      value of a comprehensive neurological and behavioral testing battery through a comparison of
      metrics between injured and healthy collegiate student athletes. Additionally, we hypothesize
      that for athletes who do not sustain a concussion, decrements between the pre-season and
      post-season time points will be greater in those who participate in collision/contact sports
      in comparison to those who participate in non-contact sports. Thus, outcomes from this study
      will enhance the understanding of the pathophysiology of concussion through a rigorous
      laboratory testing component, but with simultaneous direct translation to clinical
      implementation through the use of a highly-feasible clinical testing paradigm that possesses
      potential for ubiquitous and widespread use throughout sports medicine practices.
