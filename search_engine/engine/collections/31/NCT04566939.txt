      motion(ROM), and the clicking sound of the shoulder.

      On recent research by Health Insurance Review & Assessment Service, the number of rotator
      cuff tear patients has increased from 508155 to 704838 during 2013-2017. And also the
      research reported that the difference of effect between surgical treatments and non-surgical
      treatments was unremarkable. So in most cases, non-surgical treatments are applied primarily
      on rotator cuff tear except for some serious cases.

      Physical therapy and medication are well known for the currently known non-surgical and
      conservative treatments, but research reported on the treatment of rotator cuff tear by using
      Korean medicine treatment so far has its weak level. Therefore, it is expected that this
      study will demonstrate the efficacy of the treatment of rotator cuff tear in Korean medicine
      treatment and will further pave the way for non-surgical treatment of rotator cuff tear.

      Therefore, The investigators conducted an observational trial to analyze the effectiveness of
      Korean medicine treatment in rotator cuff tear. Retrospective data will be extracted using
      electronic medical records and computerized data of hospitalized patients. Based on this,
      investigators will conduct research in the form of a prospective survey and analyze the
      causal relationship and factors using the two data.

      The hospital's medical records will be used to analyze the patient's condition during the
      hospitalization period and to determine the situation after the end of treatment through a
      questionnaire. The questionnaire will be developed after consultation with experts from the
      musculoskeletal system and related societies, and will be used for the questionnaire."
