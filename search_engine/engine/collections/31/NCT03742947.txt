      Haemostasis and fibrinolysis are activated in peripartum. Fibrinolysis is decreased during
      pregnancy, is quickly activated after childbirth and can be overactivated in case of PPH.
      Tranexamic acid (TXA), an antifibrinolytic drug, has been proven to efficiently decrease
      bleeding and death in PPH. Its place in prevention of PPH after caesarean section remains to
      be established. The aim of the study protocol TRAAP2 is to conduct a large multicentre
      randomized, double blind placebo-controlled trial to adequately assess the impact of TXA for
      preventing PPH following a caesarean section. Peripartum is also a period of increased
      thrombo-embolic risk. TXA has never been proven to increase thromboembolic events.
      Nevertheless, it seems important to reserve TXA for women with activated fibrinolysis.

      The aim of the ancillary biologic study BIO-TRAAP is thus to explore haemostasis and
      fibrinolysis in peripartum, to determine which women will in the future benefit from TXA.
      Fibrinolysis will be studied by clot lysis time by Global Fibrinolytic Capacity test on the
      Lysis Timer (GFC/LT), t-PA, PAI-1, PAI-2, euglobulin clot lysis time, plasminogen,
      plasmin-anti-plasmin complex, thrombin-anti-thrombin complex, fibrin degradation products
      (FDP).
