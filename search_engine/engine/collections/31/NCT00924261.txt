           fast walking speeds are reduced in the elderly groups compared to passive and dynamic
           peak hip extension in healthy young adults.

        2. Test the hypothesis, separately for each elderly group, controlling for co-factors, that
           there is greater change in step length in the treatment group compared to the control
           group, after controlling for co-variates. We also expect greater changes in dynamic hip
           peak extension, a reduction in anterior pelvic tilt, improvement in age-related
           reductions in peak ankle plantar flexion and ankle power generation, and in dynamic
           CoM-CoP moment arm during both comfortable and fast walking, and an increase in
           comfortable walking speed.

        3. Test the hypothesis separately for the frail elderly group who cannot independently
           perform IADL only, controlling for co-factors, that there is a greater change in
           secondary, non quantitative gait-parameters of the Timed Get Up and Go Test, Activities
           of Daily Living, Instrumental ADL function, fear of falling and number of falls during 6
           months following intervention.

        4. Test the hypothesis that the created forward dynamic model can accurately predict in
           individual subjects, the actual effect of an increase in passive peak hip extension on
           dynamic peak hip extension, anterior pelvic tilt, peak ankle plantar flexion and step
           length.
