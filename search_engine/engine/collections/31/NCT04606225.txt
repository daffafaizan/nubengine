      in cognitive and emotional processes. Accumulating evidence demonstrates modulatory effects
      of the angiotensin antagonist losartan in the domains of memory and emotional processing.
      Against this background the present study aims to investigate the behavioral and neural
      effects of a single dose of losartan on emotional processing and emotion-memory integration
      in healthy subjects. In a double-blind, between-subject, placebo-controlled pharmaco-fMRI
      experiment, 60 male participants will be randomized to a single dose of losartan (50 mg) or
      placebo, and encode emotional pictures during fMRI (scheduled 90 minutes after drug
      administration). Then 24 hours post fMRI participants will finish a surprise recognition
      memory test to estimate the emotion effects on subsequent memory.
