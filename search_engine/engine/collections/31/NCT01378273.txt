    
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, study of Epo treatment of preterm infants 24-0/7 to
      27-6/7 weeks of gestation, beginning in the first 24 hours after birth. Randomization will be
      stratified by site and gestational age at birth (<26 week or 26-27-6/7). Study size sample is
      940 patients. We expect to evaluate 752 subjects at 24-26 months corrected age, our primary
      endpoint. There is no enrollment restriction based on gender, ethnicity or race. Enrollment
      is expected to take 24-26 months, with each subject participating through 24-26 months
      corrected age when neurodevelopmental outcomes are assessed. The combined outcome of death or
      severe NDI will be compared between Epo-treated and control subjects. All outcomes will be
      collected in a blinded manner. Subjects will be randomized by the data-coordinating center
      (DCC) to Epo treatment or placebo, and Epo treatment will continue until 32-6/7 weeks post
      menstrual age. Serial measurements of circulating inflammatory mediators and biomarkers of
      brain injury will be made. A brain MRI will be done at 36 weeks post menstrual age in the
      same subset of infants. Phone contact will occur at 4, 8, 12, and 18 months. Face to face
      follow up will occur at 24-26 months corrected age. The primary outcome is death or severe
      NDI at 24-26 months corrected age, with a secondary outcome of death or moderate NDI. Our
      primary sample size calculation is based on the conservative assumptions that Epo treatment
      will result in a 40% reduction in the severe NDI rate (the range in animal studies is 49-70%)
      and minimal impact on death. This would yield a control group rate for the primary outcome of
      40.4% and an expected treated rate of 31.5% thus yielding an 8.9% lower rate of Death + NDI.

      Clinical information including co-morbidities of extreme prematurity, information about
      transfusions, and specific laboratory values were collected in the PENUT database.
