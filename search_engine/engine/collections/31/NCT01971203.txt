      cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) compared to CBT plus placebo in the treatment of patients
      with comorbid major depression and generalized anxiety disorder. We will also evaluate the
      quality of life in patients with comorbid MDD/GAD, the response and remission rates by
      treatment group, changes in sleep quality, and tolerability of adjunctive quetiapine to CBT.
