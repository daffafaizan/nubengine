      Human Connectome Project (HCP), to psychiatrically ill populations. The HCP consortium has
      made significant improvements in MRI instrumentation, data acquisition, preprocessing, and
      analysis. These improvements are currently providing publicly available data on the
      structure, function, and connectivity of young adult human (age 22-35) brains at
      unprecedented spatial resolution, temporal resolution, and accuracy. This study will focus on
      individuals aged 45-85 years who have a diagnosis of dementia, or are healthy controls.
      Additionally, similar to the HCP, the investigator will study the effect of genetics on the
      patterns of brain connectivity in various psychiatric populations. DNA will be collected
      non-invasively from saliva. Furthermore, this investigator will study cortisol levels in hair
      samples as an additional assessment to help characterize brain imagining findings.
