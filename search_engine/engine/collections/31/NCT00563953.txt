    
      This is a phase II, uncontrolled, open label, multicenter study of a primary chemotherapy
      regimen consisting of four cycles of liposomal pegylated doxorubicine 35 mg/m² IV plus
      cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m² on Day 1 every 4 weeks followed by paclitaxel 80 mg/m²/week for 12
      weeks before surgery in breast cancer patients at risk of developing anthracycline-induced
      cardiotoxicity.

      Surgery (tumorectomy, quadrantectomy, or mastectomy plus lymphadenectomy) will be performed 2
      to 5 weeks after the last primary chemotherapy infusion.

      Patients with > 10% of hormone receptor-positive cells will receive appropriate hormone
      therapy according to menopausal status.

      Patients treated with breast-conserving surgery will receive radiation therapy to the mammary
      gland.

      Patients with T4 tumors or significant axillary involvement (≥ ypN2) will receive radiation
      therapy to the breast or chest wall and to the lymph node chains.
