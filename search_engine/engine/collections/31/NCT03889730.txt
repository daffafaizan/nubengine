      surgery-associated acute kidney injury (CSA-AKI) is associated with increased in-hospital
      mortality, prolonged length of stay in the Intensive Care Unit and hospital, and higher costs
      of care. Intraoperative hypotension is an important risk factor for the development of AKI
      after noncardiac surgery. In a retrospective analysis, a mean arterial pressure of less than
      55 mmHg predicted the occurrence of adverse cardiac- and renal-related outcomes after
      noncardiac surgery. Other studies also revealed that intraoperative hypotension is associated
      with increased incidence of AKI and 1-year mortality after noncardiac surgery. In patients
      undergoing cardiac surgery, 30-day mortality is proportionate to the extent of systolic blood
      pressure excursions outside the range of 75 to 135 mm Hg intraoperatively. However, the
      correlation between intraoperative hypotension and the development of AKI after cardiac
      surgery has not been fully investigated. The purpose of this study is to analyze the
      association between intraoperative hypotension and the risk of acute kidney injury after
      off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery.
