      world. Its accidental or deliberate ingestion is associated with a high mortality rate
      ranging from 40% to 70%. Paraquat usually cause multiple organ dysfunction syndrome,
      including liver, kidney, lung and heart dysfunction. Besides, pituitary insufficiency also
      occurs on those patients with paraquat poisoning, which leads to multiple endocrine gland
      dysfunction, involving adrenal gland, thyroid and sex gland. Nowadays, steroids, as a hormone
      replacement therapy, is one of most important drugs for paraquat poisoning, and it has
      decreased patients' mortality greatly since using it. However, the clinicians have not paid
      enough attention to thyroid replacement therapy, as thyroid dysfunction is also the key
      pathophysiological course when paraquat poisoning occurs.

      As a result, the investigators decide to initiate the clinical trial to find whether thyroid
      replacement therapy can furtherly reduce the mortality, and improve patients long-term
      prognosis.
