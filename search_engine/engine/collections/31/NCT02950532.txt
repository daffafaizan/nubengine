      strategies for thoracolumbar (TL) fractures. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is the gold
      standard to confirm PLC injury. The routine use of MRI has its limitations especially since
      in most trauma centers MRI is not the primary assessment for TL fractures due to reduced
      availability, increased cost and its adverse applicability in trauma setting and in case of a
      polytrauma. In contrast computed tomography (CT) scans are an integral part of trauma
      evaluation protocols, are accurate in spine fracture diagnosis and are performed in less
      time, making them suitable to assess polytrauma scenarios. In a recent pilot study, a number
      of radiological parameters based on CT scans have shown to reliably detect PLC injury when
      compared to MRI. The aim of the study is to reconfirm and validate these CT based parameters
      to assess PLC injury compared to MRI.
