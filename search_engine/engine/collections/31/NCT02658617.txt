      important in many early theories of emotion. William James was one of the first to present a
      psychological theory linking viscero-afferent feedback to emotional experience. The
      processing of bodily and thus interoceptive stimuli may be a crucial component in yielding
      empathy, since affective states are often assumed to involve awareness of oneÂ´s own bodily
      state. The assumption of a close relationship between interceptive awareness and empathy is
      further supported when considering the regions recruited during both processes, like the
      insula and the anterior cingulate cortex. Although especially the affective component may
      implicate interoception and interoceptive awareness, the impact of interoception on empathy
      has never been evaluated behaviorally or neurophysiologically.

      Also associated with altered insula and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) function is
      Alexithymia. Alexithymia, a personality trait, is marked by cognitive and affective features
      including difficulties in identifying and describing feelings as well as in distinguishing
      feelings from bodily sensations of emotional arousal. Recent studies found a negative
      correlation between prefrontal glutamate (Glu) and mental perspective taking as well as
      extraversion. Even though several functional imaging studies investigated the neuronal
      signatures of interoceptive awareness and the personality trait alexithymia, little is known
      about the functional relevance of neurotransmitter concentrations
