      each of the three therapies for 16 weeks by means of a cross-over study design. INFANT aims
      to determine whether individual children respond better to one treatment than another and, if
      so, whether those children can be identified by phenotypic characteristics or selected
      biomarkers. In this regard the INFANT study is expected to address critical gaps in current
      asthma management guidelines. Ultimately, the findings from this study are expected to help
      clarify treatment modalities for this population of young preschool children who are
      extremely difficult to treat.
