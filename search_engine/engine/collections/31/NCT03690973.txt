      which can be partially lost after tooth removal. These procedures allow for wider and longer
      implant placement compared with non-augmented sockets and reduce the need for simultaneous
      augmentation procedures at the time of implant placement.It is expected that immediate
      implant avoid crestal resorption in the fresh extraction socket in humans also immediate
      installation at the time of extraction offers potential advantages for both practitioners and
      patients. It allows a decrease in treatment time and may result in an increase in patient
      satisfaction.Also it is expected that flapless procedure include maintenance of the buccal
      keratinized gingival , and prevention of alterations to the gingival contours and migration
      of the mucogingival junction that are often experienced after raising a flap
