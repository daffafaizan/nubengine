      CTG), patients will receive the traditional Chinese Tuina therapy (including rolling,
      grasping, scratching, pressing, acupressure or pushing) on the basis of KOA health education
      and home-exercise. Patients in the Physical Manual group (group PMG) will receive the modern
      physical manual therapy (including joint mobilization/manipulation, manual traction, soft
      tissue manipulations, passive stretching, range of motion and strength training) on the basis
      of KOA health education and home-exercise. Assessments will be conducted at baseline and 4
      and 16 weeks after randomization.

      It is expected that the interventions will alleviate the sufferings of the patient. The risks
      of participation are minimal. Occasionally, tuina can make people feel nauseous or experience
      a temporary increase in pain either during or after treatment. Rare side effects happen
      during and after Tuina or manual treatment.
