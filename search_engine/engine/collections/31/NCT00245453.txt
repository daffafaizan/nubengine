    
      To Evaluate the relationship between rate of S. pneumoniae killing in sputum, PK/PD, and
      clinical response of oral telithromycin and azithromycin in patients with AECB or CAP and to
      determine if there is a difference in the rates of infection site bacterial killing (as
      described above) between these 3 antibiotics against penicillin- and erythromycin-resistant
      S.pneumoniae
