    
      This is an open label, randomised, stratified, 2-Arm, multi-centre, phase 2 clinical trial
      recruiting 140 newly-diagnosed high-volume mHNPC patients at 11 Australian centres over a
      period of 18 months. Patients will be randomised to the experimental Arm (177Lu-PSMA followed
      by docetaxel) or standard-of-care Arm (docetaxel) in a 1:1 ratio. All patients will receive
      ADT continuously throughout the trial. Patients will be stratified according to disease
      volume by conventional imaging (low-volume vs. high-volume) and duration of ADT at time of
      registration (â‰¤ 28 days vs. > 28 days).
