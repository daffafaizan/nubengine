    
      Perinatal Services BC maintains a current database on live births, antepartum, intrapartum
      and postpartum outcomes; including details of ART if used to conceive. Live birth rate, for
      the purposes of this study, will be defined as the birth of at least one live born baby, with
      the birth of twins or higher order multiples considered as one live birth. The birth rate for
      ART will be taken as a proportion for birth rate from ART over total birth rate for given
      calendar year and the overall period of analysis. Data from April 1 2008 to Marcch 31 2018 on
      autologous ART treatment cycles and outcomes will be extracted from this database, with
      approval. Overall proportion of ART contributing to live birth rate will be analyzed as well
      as sub categorical analysis based on age (younger than 30, 30-34 years, 35-39 years, 40-44
      years, and 45 years and older). Only nulliparous women will be included in this study. All
      Moreover, data will be analyzed by calendar year in which baby from ART delivered to evaluate
      overall trends in ART outcomes. The total live birth rate for all of BC will serve as the
      denominator.

      Although the data will be reviewed and rules interpreted by the principal investigator of
      this study, a biostatistician will be hired to carry out the necessary statistical analysis.
