      oil (containing EPA 1440mg, DHA 960mg). The experimental groups will be compared to placebo
      to evaluate if it may benefit clinical symptoms, cognitive symptoms and metabolic markers in
      MDD patients. We also plan to investigate the changes in markers of inflammation at the same
      time.
