    
      Patients with spondyloarthropaty, who initiate or switch biologics in routine care due to an
      active disease state, will be enrolled in this observational study.

      The overall aim is to investigate extra-articular manifestations, pain mechanisms and
      patient-reported outcomes and elucidate if these factors - independently or by interaction -
      influence treatment response after ≥ 3 months. Patients will have a baseline visit, an eye
      examination and a follow up visit after ≥ 3 months. Clinical examinations will be performed
      at both time points and include:

        1. Clinical examination (the spinal movement)

        2. Assessment of pain mechanisms by clinical evaluation (BASDAI, tender points,) and pain
           questionnaires (PainDETECT).

        3. The SPARCC Enthesitis Index will be used to enthesitis count.

        4. Interview and questionnaires regarding lifestyle, comorbidity, function and quality of
           life

        5. Blood samples

        6. Urine samples

        7. Stool samples

      Clinical as well as patient-reported and observer-based outcomes will be described for the
      overall study population and the prognostic influence of extra-articular manifestations,
      comorbidity and pain mechanisms will be analysed.
