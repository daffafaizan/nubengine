      often cause two main undesirable consequences: symptomatic portal hypertension (such as
      variceal bleeding or ascites) and cavernous transformation of portal vein (CPTV). The former
      could lead to death and the latter increases the difficulty of the transjugular intrahepatic
      portosystemic shunt (TIPS) treatment, which is considered as a main effective treatment for
      symptomatic portal hypertension. Some patients with CPTV and variceal bleeding only have to
      receive conservative treatment (non-selective beta blockers, endoscopic therapy and/or
      anticoagulation). With advances in technology, modified TIPS procedure could significantly
      improve the operation success rate of patients with CPTV. To date, the difference in safety
      and efficacy between TIPS and conservative treatment (non-selective beta blockers, endoscopic
      therapy and/or anticoagulation) in patients with PVT and CPTV is still unclear.
