      that there is a nonzero correlation for each subject will be calculated. The minimum average
      power correlation, alpha = 0.05, will be used. Correlation will be made (CRI trend during
      550ml blood volume removal) using pre and post blood draw data.

      Specific Aims: These data will be submitted to the FDA with the following claims: The CRI

           display the trend of intravascular volume changes (hemorrhage)

        2. Is intended for use by clinicians and medically qualified personnel to noninvasively
           display the trend of stroke volume changes and

        3. The CRI trend value is not relative to an initial CRI reading, instead it is an actual
           CRI trend value that does
