      During the first 24 weeks (Phase A) they did not receive any other blinded study medication.
      In Phase B (subsequent 80 weeks), participants who did not initiate glycemic rescue in Phase
      A received additional blinded study medication: participants in the omarigliptin group
      received placebo to glimepiride and participants in the placebo group received glimepiride.
