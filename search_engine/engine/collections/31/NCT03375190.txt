      volunteers utilizing 6 different securement techniques. The primary outcome is the force
      required to dislodge the peripheral nerve catheter by 1 centimeter as measured by a
      dynamometer in Newtons. The secondary endpoint will be the force required to disrupt the
      catheter dressing.
