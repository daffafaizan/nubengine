    
      Double blinded randomized clinical trial. Fifty patients will be selected for each group.
      Group A will receive 10mg olanzapine in the preoperative and group B will receive placebo in
      the preoperative period. Both groups will receive intravenous general anesthesia combined
      with epidural. All patients will receive epidural PCA.

      The primary outcome of this study is the incidence of post-operative nausea and vomiting. The
      power of analysis was based on the following parameters: type error I (α = 0.05), error II (β
      = 0.8), 95% confidence interval and hypothesis test two-tailed. Thus, 42 patients are
      indicated per group to obtain reduction of the incidence of nausea and / or vomiting of the
      population risk from 60% to 30%. The population will be composed of 100 patients because it
      is assumed that percentage of loss of 10% per group.

      The statistical analysis will be performed in program R version 3.5.1. The results obtained
      will be presented as mean + standard deviation for continuous data or absolute frequency for
      described data.

      For quantitative variables, the Student's t-test will be used for with normal distribution or
      Mann-Whitney for non-distributed data normal.

      For qualitative variables, the chi-square test will be used or Fisher's exact test.
      Significant difference is defined as p, 0.05.

      Data will be collected and managed using REDCap data capture tools
