      patients have one or more readmissions within one year. While glycemic control is rarely the
      primary reason for admission, poor glycemic control has been associated with increased rates
      of hospitalization and worse clinical outcomes, including infections, poor wound healing, and
      death. Hospitalization has been proposed as a "teachable moment" for patients with diabetes,
      as they have intensive contact with a full range of expert clinicians, but the effects of
      changes implemented during hospitalization after discharge are poorly studied.

      The objective of this study is to conduct a randomized controlled trial to test a novel
      approach to diabetes management in the transition from inpatient to outpatient care. We will
      assign 40 hospitalized adult patients with type 2 diabetes to usual care or access to a
      web-based patient-provider communication and remote glucose monitoring tool ("Diabetes
      Transitions Tool Kit"). Our aims are to evaluate feasibility of implementation of the tool as
      well as impact on post-discharge glycemic control, diabetes-related self-care and distress.
      We hypothesize that providing patients this web-based tool over a 4-week period after
      discharge to home will result in more effective glycemic control compared to usual care, and
      that patients with access to the "tool kit" will have a trend towards improved diabetes
      self-management and less diabetes-related distress. Feasibility and preliminary data from
      this pilot study will be the foundation for larger-scale interventions that may ultimately
      improve the delivery of diabetes care in the transition from hospital to home.
