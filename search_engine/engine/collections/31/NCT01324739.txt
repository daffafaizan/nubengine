      secretion (beta cell function with the insulinogenic index, IGI) in patients with heart
      insufficiency by frequently sampled oral glucose tolerance test (21). Insulin sensitivity was
      impaired in CHF compared to control (OGIS: 354±14 ml/min/m2 vs. 450±20; p<0.003). Also beta
      cell function was reduced (IGI: 100±14 vs. 150±45 pmolINS/pmolGLUC). Interestingly a
      significant inverse correlation exists between BNP and IGI (r=0.41, p<0.05) (21). The
      relationship between BNP and glucose metabolism has only been partially investigated. Plasma
      BNP rises in response to hyperglycemia, but is not influenced by hyperinsulinemia (22, 23).
      On the other side, the physiological role of BNP on beta cell function and insulin
      sensitivity has not been investigated to date. As BNP levels rise with the degree of heart
      insufficiency and insulin resistance correlates to the degree of cardiomyopathy, we
      hypothesize that BNP influences glucose metabolism in healthy men.

      One gold standard investigation of both beta cell function and peripheral insulin sensitivity
      is the insulin-modified frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test (FSIGT). The
      FSIGT consists in giving intravenously a glucose bolus at time point 0 followed by an
      intravenous administration of insulin at time point 20 minutes (18,19, 20). The determination
      of glucose, insulin and C-peptide at frequent intervals till time point 180 minutes allows
      the calculation of the acute insulin response, glucose effectiveness, insulin clearance and
      insulin sensitivity through the minimal model analysis (13) The intravenous administration of
      3 pmol/kg/min BNP achieves a plateau of increased BNP plasma concentrations after 60 minutes.
      In previous publications, this infusion was administered during 4 hours, achieving a steady
      state plasma BNP between time points 60 minutes and 240 minutes (17). Using this already
      established protocol, we aim to maintain constantly high plasma BNP levels throughout the
      three hours of the FSIGT. The combination of both BNP (17) and FSIGT (13) protocols in an
      interventional study will be an adequate means of investigating the impact of BNP on glucose
      metabolism in healthy subjects.

      The present study aims to investigate the effect of intravenous infusion of BNP-32 (American
      Peptide, Calif., US) on the beta cell function and insulin sensitivity during FSIGT in
      healthy volunteers.

      -65, -60, -30, 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 14, 19, 22, 27, 30, 35, 40, 50, 60, 70, 90, 100, 120,
      140, 150 and 180 min for the measurement of glucose, insulin and C-peptide (8 ml per time
      point: time points -30, 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 14, 19, 22, 27, 30, 35, 40, 50, 70, 100, 140
      and 180 min), for the measurement of BNP and NT-proBNP (4 ml per time point: time points -65,
      -60, -30, 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150 and 180 min) and for the measurement of plasma sodium,
      potassium and creatinine (8 ml per time point: time points -60, 60 and 180 minutes).

      Primary outcome parameter is area under the curve of insulin (AUCinsulin) from time point -30
      to 180 min.

      Secondary outcome parameters are AUCglucose and AUCc-peptide from time point -30 to 180 min,
      BNP- and NT-proBNP levels from time point -65 to 180, plasma sodium, potassium and creatinine
      from time point -60 to 180.

      On study days volunteers will come to the study room at around 07:45 a.m. after an overnight
      fasting. After being weighed, they will remain in bed throughout the study, except when
      standing to pass urine. Two vein flow needles (Venflon, Helsingborg, Sweden) will be inserted
      in the antecubital veins of the right and left arm for the administration of infusions and
      blood sampling respectively. The subjects will rest for approximately 15 minutes before
      obtaining baseline blood samples (at time point - 65 minutes).

      3.0 pmol/kg/min human BNP-32 (American Peptide, Calif., US) which is solved in Haemaccel (10
      mL/h), or placebo (Haemaccel, 10 mL/h, alone) will be continuously administered for 4 hours,
      between time points -60 and 180 minutes, using a syringe pump (Treonic, Vickers Medical,
      Basingstoke, United Kingdom). A washout period of at least 2 weeks will be between the
      administration of BNP and placebo on the two different study days. This protocol has been
      used in the study of Lainchbury et al. (17).

      330 mg/kg body weight glucose will be administered as a bolus during 30 seconds at time point
      0-0.5 minutes.

      0.03 IU/kg rapidly acting insulin (Actrapid, Novo-Nordisk, Denmark) will be infused
      intravenously for 5 minutes starting at time point 20.

      Blood samples will be collected at time points: -65, -60, -30, 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 14, 19,
      22, 27, 30, 35, 40, 50, 60, 70, 90, 100, 120, 140, 150 and 180 min for the measurement of
      glucose, insulin and C-peptide (8 ml per time point: time points -30, 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10,
      14, 19, 22, 27, 30, 35, 40, 50, 70, 100, 140 and 180 min), for the measurement of BNP and
      NT-proBNP (4 ml per time point: time points -65, -60, -30, 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150 and 180
      min) and for the measurement of plasma sodium, potassium and creatinine (8 ml per time point:
      time points -60, 60 and 180 minutes).

      A final safety blood sample will be collected at time point 270 min for plasma sodium,
      potassium, creatinine and BNP, NT-proBNP, sodium, potassium, creatinine, GPT, gamma-GT, total
      bilirubin to ensure that (NT-pro)BNP levels returned to baseline and other parameters are
      within the normal range.

      Total volume of blood withdrawal will be about 230 ml. When voiding, the subjects will be
      asked to collect the urine excreted during the study period (-65 till 180 minutes). for the
      measurement of sodium, potassium and creatinine excretion.

      Heart rate and blood pressure will be continuously monitored during the whole study. If the
      systolic blood pressure is lower than 85 mmHg or the heart rate is less than 50 beats per
      minute BNP infusion will be stopped.

      Data analysis for estimating insulin sensitivity, ß-cell secretion, insulin clearance,
      insulin hepatic extraction and insulin appearance rate will be done by minimal model computer
      analysis of the frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test
