    
      This is a randomized, controlled single-center study observing the clinical utility of
      EVARREST™ against standard of care (SoC) in controlling soft tissue bleeding. Standard of
      care will be manual compression (MC) with or without a topical absorbable hemostat (TAH) or
      any other adjunctive hemostasis technique that is deemed by the surgeon to be his/her
      standard of care. All subjects will be followed post-operatively through discharge and at 30
      (+/-14) days.

      Approximately 150 qualified subjects undergoing intra-abdominal, retroperitoneal, pelvic and
      non-cardiac thoracic surgery requiring adjunctive support for hemostasis for soft tissue
      bleeding will be enrolled in the study. Subjects will be randomized on a 1:1 basis, EVARREST™
      vs. SoC.
