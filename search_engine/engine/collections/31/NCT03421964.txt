      Adjustment Intervention (RAI), or (2) RAI+. After randomization, a second appointment will be
      scheduled. All participants will begin the 7-session treatment during their second
      appointment. The intervention consists of seven 60-minute sessions scheduled over seven weeks
      (see attached RAI Implementation Manual). The intervention will be implemented by
      experienced, licensed therapists (Ph.D. level Interventionists). Participants will be
      randomly assigned to one of the therapists.

      The RAI and RAI+ groups will both complete the post-treatment measures immediately after the
      seventh treatment session and then 3, 4, and 9 months later. Data collection at 3, 4, and 9
      months post-treatment will be completed via phone.

      Furthermore, the RAI+ group will complete 3 booster sessions, spaced approximately 7-10 days
      apart, beginning 3 months after completion of the seventh treatment session (booster sessions
      will occur between the 3 and 4 month data collection described above).

      Data will be analyzed to identify any therapist effects, as well as treatment effects. For
      the RAI and RAI+ groups, demographic, injury severity, and history information will be
      collected at intake using standard procedures and protocols. All participants will complete
      the 4 outcome measures (Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, CD-RISC; Mayo Portland Adaptability
      Inventory-4, MPAI-4; 13 Item Stress Test; and Brief Symptom Inventory-18, BSI-18) at 5 time
      points (intake, post-treatment, and 3, 4 and 9 month follow-up).
