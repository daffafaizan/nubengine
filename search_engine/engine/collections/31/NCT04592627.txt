      hospitalization and receive care from informal caregivers (e.g., unpaid spouses) who are
      often unprepared for the role. Stroke survivorship is an exemplar of a chronic condition that
      detracts from the affected individual and caregiver's capacity to live well within the home
      (e.g., psychosocial distress). Early identification of psychosocial distress is likely to
      lead to timely interventions and, subsequently, decreases in associated morbidity, mortality,
      and disability. Yet, only a minority of survivors are properly identified and treated for
      psychosocial distress, and caregivers are primarily forgotten. In-home, objective measures to
      identify psychosocial distress are lacking. Using facial expression and body motion
      technology by extracting facial characteristics and body joints (skeletal graph) known to be
      associated with psychosocial distress (e.g., frowning) provides new opportunities to support
      in-home telemonitoring. To accommodate real-world, post-stroke home environments, the
      technology needs to be customized to an in-home environment. Toward this end, the
      investigators must consider background variability, possible occlusions, privacy concerns,
      and stroke survivor motor weaknesses, gait impairments, and facial paralysis. Objectives: The
      primary objectives are to customize facial expression and body motion technology and examine
      the acceptability of the technology through a study of 6 stroke survivor-informal caregiver
      dyads within a simulated home environment. The project will serve as a necessary step to
      amass critical information to design future trials using facial expression and body motion
      technology. The ultimate goal is to improve psychosocial well-being for those aging at home.
