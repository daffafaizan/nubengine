      as asthma and rhinitis. Fluticasone Furoate (FF) is a novel corticosteroid with potent
      glucocorticoid activity similar to fluticasone propionate and mometasone furoate. Phase II
      studies have shown FF to be an effective once daily inhaled steroid for asthma and it is
      being developed as a potential steroid component in a once daily combination with GW642444M,
      for once-daily administration for the maintenance treatment of asthma and COPD. FF is
      approved worldwide (including the US, EU and Japan) as an intranasal steroid for the
      treatment of allergic rhinitis (VERAMYST™ /AVAMYS™ /ALLERMIST™). Previous inter-study
      comparisons have indicated potentially higher systemic exposure to FF in Japanese subjects
      compared with treatment groups that recruited predominantly Caucasian subjects. The reasons
      for these potential differences are unclear. This study is being performed to evaluate and
      directly compare the PK and systemic PD effects of FF in healthy Caucasian, Japanese, Korean
      and Chinese subjects when delivered from the novel dry powder inhaler and intravenously. The
      data obtained will be used to facilitate clinical development of the FF/GW642444 combination
      in Japanese and other East Asian populations.
