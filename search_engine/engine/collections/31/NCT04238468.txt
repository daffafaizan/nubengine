    
      Patients undergoing primary or secondary Deep Inferior Epigastric Perforator (DIEP) flap
      breast reconstruction will be included in this monocentric, randomised, controlled,
      double-blinded study.

      After bilateral flank liposuction, the fat will be processed by a special protocol with
      enzymatic digestion. Stromal vascular fraction will be isolated and injected intradermally
      just after wound closure into one site of surgical wound (most lateral 5 cm) at the DIEP flap
      donor site. The other site of DIEP flap donor site (most lateral 5 cm) will serve as a
      control. Part of stromal vascular fraction will be analysed by flow cytometry for the
      viability and cell specification. Ten months after DIEP flap surgery the scars at both sites
      (control and injected site) will be excised and analysed histologically. At that time
      photographs will be taken and scars will be analysed by Patient and Observer Assesment Scale
      (POSAS).
