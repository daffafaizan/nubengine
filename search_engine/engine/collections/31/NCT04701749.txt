    
      Prospective single-centre observational study involving the creation of a data registry of
      patients with anticoagulation-treated non-valvular atrial fibrillation with hematuria on
      radiation cystitis.

      Patients who present a hematuria on radial bladder associated with anticoagulated atrial
      fibrillation will be recruited into the protocol by an urologist from Gabriel MONTPIED UHC
      once they have presented at least one episode of hematuria on radial bladder under
      anticoagulant treatment in the context of a non-valvular ACFA, and once they have given their
      agreement to participate in the HEMOCC research protocol.

      A research associate will meet the patient to finalize the administrative and practical
      aspects of inclusion and the collection of retrospective data. Regardless of whether or not
      left atrial occlusion is performed, the patient's data included in the protocol will be
      collected.

      The urologist will then refer the patient to Pr ESCHALIER's cardiology department for
      cardiological advice regarding an indication of percutaneous occlusion of the left atrium
      (running walk).

      If LAO is indicated and the patient agrees to the procedure, then the procedure will be
      scheduled.
