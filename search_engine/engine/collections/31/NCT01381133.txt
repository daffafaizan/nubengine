      treatment with and without Assertive Continuing Care (ACC) for 320 adolescents with substance
      use disorders. Study participants were randomly assigned to one of four conditions: (a)
      Chestnut's Bloomington Outpatient Treatment (CBOP) without ACC; (b) CBOP with ACC; (c)
      Motivational Enhancement Therapy/Cognitive Behavior Therapy-7 session model (MET/CBT7)
      without ACC; and (d) MET/CBT7 with ACC. All study conditions attained high rates of
      participant engagement and retention. Follow-up interviews were completed with over 90% of
      the adolescents at three, six, nine, and 12 months after treatment admission. There was a
      significant time by condition effect over 12 months, with CBOP having a slight advantage for
      average percentage of days abstinent. Unlike previous findings that ACC provided incremental
      effectiveness following residential treatment, there were no statistically significant
      findings with regard to the incremental effectiveness of ACC following outpatient treatment.
      Analysis of the costs of each intervention combined with its outcomes revealed that the most
      cost-effective condition was MET/CBT7 without ACC.
