      I. To estimate the cost-effectiveness, defined as cost per quality-adjusted life-year saved,
      of risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) versus ovarian cancer screening (OCS) for women
      at elevated genetic risk of ovarian cancer over a five-year period, using data from GOG-0199
      to model survival.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the cost-effectiveness, defined as cost per quality-adjusted life-year saved,
      of RRSO versus OCS for women at elevated genetic risk of ovarian cancer over a lifetime,
      using stage-specific cohorts and population-based data to model long-term survival.
      (Exploratory) II. To use value of information (VOI) methodology to set future research
      priorities aimed at developing evidence-based approaches to the management of women who are
      at elevated genetic risk of ovarian cancer. (Exploratory)

      OUTLINE:

      Outcome data, such as incidence and stage at diagnosis of ovarian, fallopian tube, and
      peritoneal cancers; number and timing of screening and serum tests performed; number and
      timing of pelvic ultrasounds performed; surgical procedures performed; cancer-specific and
      overall survival (if available); and the incidence, type, and grade of significant adverse
      events, are collected from the Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG)-0199 records and analyzed.
      Cost of each medical intervention is also estimated.
