      prospective, randomized, parallel group design.

      In order to pragmatically examine the effectiveness of biventricular pacing in patients with
      an indication for ventricular pacing, the study group with biventricular pacing is compared
      to a control group with standard pacemakers which only allow univentricular (right
      ventricular) stimulation, as it has been the standard outside of clinical studies until so
      far.
