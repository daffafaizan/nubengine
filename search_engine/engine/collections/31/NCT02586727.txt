      treat and extend (TAE) dosing regimen arm, total duration 54 weeks. In the TAE arm the
      patients will receive an intravitreal aflibercept injection first visit, again at the second
      visit at 6 weeks, and then begin treat and extend from second injection forward. Treatment
      will be given at each visit. Patients with improved radiation maculopathy (SD-OCT analysis)
      will extend re-evaluation by two weeks (e.g. first interval 6 weeks; second interval 10
      weeks; third interval 12 weeks, etc). Patients with increased radiation maculopathy (SD-OCT
      analysis) will have re-evaluation decreased by one week. Both arms will consist of 25
      subjects (eyes). Fluorescein angiography will be completed at baseline, after the 4th
      injection (or within three weeks of week 24 for the TAE arm), and at the end of the study in
      all patients. Spectral domain OCT, and clinical evaluation including visual acuity will be
      assessed every visit in all patients. Radiation maculopathy will be graded every visit in all
      patients in a blinded fashion using the following classification system: Grade 1 indicates
      extrafoveal, noncystoid edema; grade 2, extrafoveal cystoid edema; grade 3, foveal noncystoid
      edema; grade 4, mild-to-moderate foveal cystoid edema; grade 5, severe foveal cystoid edema
      and grade 6 subretinal fluid. All patients will undergo comprehensive evaluation including
      adverse event questioning at each study timepoint. Patients in the six-week dosing arm will
      receive a total of 9 intravitreal aflibercept injections during the study window while the
      TAE treatment group will receive a maximum of 9 with a minimum of 5.
