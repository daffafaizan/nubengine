      incidence and mortality. Liver transplantation is the most effective treatment for HCC and is
      in high demand in China. However, recurrence of HCC among liver transplantation recipients is
      still a great challenge and threat to the survival of recipients. So it is of great
      significance to establish molecular subtyping of HCC and achieve precise selection of
      recipients. Based on large scales of samples, the investigator's study aims to establish
      multi-omics characteristic profiles of liver transplantation for HCC in integration of
      apparent biological characteristics, clinical management and prognostic information by
      utilizing genomics, transcriptomics and proteomics, etc. This study will contribute to the
      therapy-oriented molecular subtyping of HCC.
