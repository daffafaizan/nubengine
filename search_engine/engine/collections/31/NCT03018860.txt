      practice. Management of this phase differs between countries. In France, national guidelines
      recommend to limit maternal expulsive efforts to 30 minutes (grade C). Thus, physicians
      (midwives and obstetricians) encourage usually women to push 3 times per contractions and to
      push on every contraction in order to deliver into a 30 minutes timing.

      This study aims to evaluate the impact of an alternative "moderate" management during this
      pushing phase on neonatal and maternal issues and mode of delivery. In the intervention
      group, i.e. "moderate" pushing, women are encouraged to push only 2 times per contractions,
      to respect contractions without pushing and there is no limit of pushing duration.

      The hypothesis is that "moderate" management of the active phase of the second stage allows
      decreasing frequency of neonatal morbidity at birth, decreasing frequency of operative
      delivery and increasing maternal satisfaction.
