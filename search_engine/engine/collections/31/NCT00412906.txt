      insulin-resistance in type 2 diabetics. It is also well-known that septic patients often
      develop insulin-resistance. The pathogenetic mechanisms behind the association between
      inflammation and insulin-resistance is not fully understood.

      In this study we create an experimental inflammation by giving E. coli endotoxin 0,3 ng/kg iv
      to type 2 diabetics and healthy controls. Muscle biopsies are taken at 0, 2, 4 and 6 hours
      after injection, while fat biopsies are taken 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8 hours after endotoxin. mRNA
      for adiponectin, leptin, PPAR-gamma, PGC-1, PAI-1 and cytokines in tissue is later measured
      by RT-PCR.

      Blood samples are drawn on an hourly basis until 8 hours after endotoxin injection for common
      biochemical analyses including white blood cell count. Plasma is spared and later analyzed
      for cytokines, PAI-1 and VCAM-1/ICAM-1.
