      oil filled. However, it has some obvious disadvantages such as the cut of the normal retina
      surrounding, leaving a large area of retinal deficiency and significant exposure of retinal
      pigment epithelium and choroid membranes.

      We proposed a novel multi-endodiathermy retinectomy as a potential surgery. A pilot study has
      demonstrated that the novel multi-endodiathermy retinectomy is feasible, effective and safe
      for inferior retinal redetachments in the silicone oil-filled eyes of adults over a 3-month
      observation.

      Here, the investigators conduct this randomized and multicenter clinical trial to compare the
      efficacy and safety between multi-endodiathermy retinectomy and relaxing retinectomy.
