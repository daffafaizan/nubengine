      precisely removing cancerous tissue while preserving the maximum amount of healthy tissue, a
      characteristic of particular advantage when dealing with NMSC in the highly cosmetic and
      functional cericofacial region. Despite this, few studies have explored the patient
      perspective on their experience with Mohs surgery. Futhermore, treatment for NMSC can result
      in scarring, disfigurement, and changes to function and appearance. Ramifications on identity
      and self, embodiment and aesthetics, interaction and relationships appear likely and
      consequences on function and quality of life might then follow. Using Grounded Theory, this
      project aims to explore the question "what is the experience of Mohs surgery for non-melanoma
      skin cancer patients who have lesions of the head and neck?" Potential patient participants
      are those diagnosed with non-melanoma skin cancer, who have undergone Mohs surgery or are
      scheduled to undergo Mohs surgery on skin located in any area above the shoulders, and are
      referred to the project by their surgeons. They will represent a range of disease, from those
      who have had a single Mohs surgery to those with recurrent NMSC and repeated Mohs. Patients
      will also read and speak English and be at least 18 years of age. Transcribed interviews and
      field notes will be analyzed using constant comparative technique to develop descriptive and
      theoretical understandings of how experience Mohs surgery for non-melanoma skin cancer of the
      head and nexk.
