      older) subjects. The study consisted of a single-dose phase followed by a repeated dose phase
      (3 times daily, at 8-h intervals). Subjects were admitted on the day prior to the first dose
      (Day 1). On day 1, a single dose of 200 mg BIA 6-512 (Dose 1) was administered in the
      morning. On day 2, the repeated dose phase started 24 h post first dosing. In the repeated
      dose phase (Doses 2 to 8) subjects received 200 mg BIA 6-512 every 8 hours until the morning
      of day 4 (approximately 72 hours post first dosing).
