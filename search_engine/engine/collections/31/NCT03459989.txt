      pregnancy in Ain Shams University Maternity Hospital to measure the expected fetal weight by
      hadlock's formula and thigh soft tissue formula and then we are going to measure the actual
      fetal weight after birth of these 200 fetuses and to find out which formula to be more
      accurate in estimation of fetal weight
