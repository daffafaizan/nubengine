      involves 3-week cycles with escalated doses of nab-paclitaxel (80-120 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8)
      and fixed doses of sintilimab (200 mg on day 1) and S-1 (based on body-surface area on day 1
      to 14). The primary endpoints are safety and determination the recommended dose in the
      subsequent phase II study. In the phase II trial, the primary endpoint is 3-year relapse-free
      survival (RFS). Secondary endpoints are 5-year overall survival (OS), 3-year OS, 5-year RFS,
      and quality of life. Exploratory endpoint is time to peritoneal metastasis. Adverse events
      are monitored and graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events
      version 4.0.
