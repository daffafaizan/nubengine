    
      Consecutive patients with suspected malignant peribronchial masses or lymph nodes undergoing
      endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) will be
      enrolled. All participants will have 4 needle aspirations of each targeted peribronchial
      lesion. Two needle aspirations will be performed while applying suction and 2 needle
      aspirations will be performed without applying suction in random order. The investigators
      will compare the diagnostic yield and the quality of the specimens obtained using the two
      techniques.
