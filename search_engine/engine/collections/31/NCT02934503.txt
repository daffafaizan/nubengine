      PD-L1 expression and its influence on optimizing timing and efficacy of checkpoint
      inhibition. All extensive stage SCLC patients are treated with chemotherapy and recent data
      suggests added benefit to consolidation thoracic radiation. A prior study of patients with
      known PD-L1 expression showed a 35% response rate. That study used archival specimens and
      found a 29% PD-L1 positivity rate (at 1% level) suggesting that the expression level and
      prevalence could be higher (and response rate/outcome therefore potentially better) in
      patients who have previously had chemotherapy or radiation. The proposed study seeks to
      evaluate pembrolizumab therapy initiated at different times during the course of SCLC
      treatment: a) up front, in conjunction with initiation of chemotherapy, b) starting after one
      cycle of chemotherapy, c) starting after completion of 1st line chemotherapy (4-6 cycles), d)
      starting after completion of consolidation thoracic radiation therapy and/or prophylactic
      cranial irradiation (PCI). Treatment with pembrolizumab will be preceded by biopsy for
      evaluation of PD-L1 expression with correlative evaluation of changes in PD-L1 expression
      (relative to diagnostic biopsy) and changes in other tissue- and blood-based biomarkers and
      immune markers.
