    
      This is an Open-Label Extension (OLE) study for patients who completed the E2007-A001-206
      (NCT00144690) or the E2007-G000-208 (NCT00416195) double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      dose-escalation, parallel-group studies.

      This study consisted of 3 periods: OLE Titration (12 weeks), OLE Maintenance (424 weeks), and
      OLE Follow-up (4 weeks). During the OLE Titration Period, participants were titrated to their
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of perampanel, up to a maximum of 12 mg/day. The OLE Maintenance
      Period began at completion of the OLE Titration Period; participants remained on the dose
      achieved at the end of the OLE Titration Period unless dose adjustment for tolerability
      reasons was necessary. Participants who either withdrew from the study prematurely or
      completed the OLE Maintenance Period returned for a final visit at the end of the 4-week OLE
      Follow-up Period.
