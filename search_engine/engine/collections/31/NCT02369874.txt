    
      This is a randomized, open-label, multi-center, global, Phase III study to determine the
      efficacy and safety of MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combination therapy and MEDI4736 monotherapy
      versus SoC therapy in the target patient population.

      The main objectives of the study are to:

        -  assess the efficacy of MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combination therapy versus SoC in
           patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN), in terms of overall
           survival (OS), regardless of PDL-1 status

        -  assess the efficacy of MEDI4736 monotherapy versus SOC in patients with SCCHN, in terms
           of OS, regardless of PDL-1 status

      Patients will undergo a screening assessment on their tumor tissue sample to determine PD-L1
      expression per a pre-specified cut-off level. Patients with â‰¥25% of tumor cells with membrane
      staining will be considered PD-L1 positive while those with 0% to 24% of tumor cells with
      membrane staining will be considered PD-L1 negative. Based on the underlying PD-L1 status,
      patients will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive treatment with MEDI4736 monotherapy,
      MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combination therapy, or SoC therapy. Patients who discontinue
      treatment in 1 treatment group may not switch to treatment in a different group.

      Stratification factors include PD-L1 status, human papillomavirus status, (in patients with
      oropharyngeal cancer only), and smoking status.

      Tumor assessments will be performed every 8 weeks until objective tumor response by Response
      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1).
