      exacerbation is still under some discussion. Currently there is no cure for the disorder but
      treatment is of a wide variety.

      This study is meant to image the asthmatic lung at various time points post exacerbation.
      Since pulmonary imaging is currently limited to radiation techniques, this method will allow
      exacerbated images without the unnecessary exposure to radiation.
