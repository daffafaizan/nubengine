      (Ino), and creatine + phosphocreatine (Cr) levels in brain regions of interest in 20 children
      with ADHD between the ages of 12-17 years old, before and after a six-week open treatment
      trial with OROS methylphenidate. For comparison, 1H MRS will also be obtained from 20
      controls matched by age and gender. We also will scan 20 children with ADHD between the ages
      of 12-17 years old that are currently enrolled in the protocol entitled "Prevention of
      Cigarette Smoking in ADHD Youth with Concerta" (2003-P-001313) and on a stable dose of
      Concerta. These 20 children will be scanned once while on medication and once while off
      medication
