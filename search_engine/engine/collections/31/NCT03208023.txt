      with significantly increased risk of morbidity and mortality. The RESIPI model of hemodynamic
      monitoring and management in the perioperative period takes into account the dynamic
      interplay of vascular resistance, inotropy, and fluid management. This study aims to evaluate
      the effect of a novel hemodynamic management and monitoring strategy for reducing cardiac bio
      marker elevations and major adverse cardiac events.
