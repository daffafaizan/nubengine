    
      Part A: Enrolment of up to 54 healthy men and women is planned, in up to 7 groups. Each of
      the first 6 groups will consist of 8 subjects and the 7th group will consist of 6 subjects.
      Subjects will receive either one or two oral dose(s) of either ZF874 or placebo, in the
      fasted state in the first 6 groups. There will be up to 7 dose levels of ZF874. In each of
      the first 6 groups, two subjects (one placebo, one ZF874) are to be dosed in a double-blind
      manner at least 23 hours prior to the remainder of the group. In the absence of any safety
      concerns in the leading subjects, the remaining subjects will be dosed, at intervals of at
      least 10 minutes. Dosing of the first 2 subjects before the rest of the group is not required
      in Group 7, as 6 subjects have already safely received ZF874 at this dose in Cohort 3, and 12
      subjects have already safely received higher doses in Cohorts 4 and 5. In Group 7, all
      subjects will receive a single dose of ZF874 by mouth, after consuming a high-fat breakfast.
      All subjects will be screened in the 28 days before their dose of trial medication. Subjects
      will be resident on ward from 1 day before their dose (Day -1) until 48 hours after dosing
      (Day 3). They will return for a follow-up visit 5-7 days after their dose (Day 6-8).

      Part B will not start until at least 5 dose levels have been completed in Part A. The dose
      level to be tested in Part B will be selected based on review by the Safety Review Group of
      the available safety and pharmacokinetic results from Part A. The data from Part A Group 7
      (food effect) will not be available before the start of Part B. One group of up to 14 PiXZ
      subjects will receive ZF874 or placebo twice daily (12 hours apart) by mouth for 28 days. Up
      to 12 subjects will receive active treatment and 2 will receive placebo. Dosing will be
      staggered: 2 leading subjects will be dosed first, and the remaining subjects will be dosed
      at least 71 h after the first morning dose given to the last leading subject. To maintain the
      blind nature of the study, the 2 leading subjects will be randomised to ensure that 1 subject
      receives active treatment and the other receives placebo. The leading subjects will be dosed
      a minimum of 5 min apart. Provided there are no safety concerns, the remaining subjects will
      be dosed, at intervals of at least 10 minutes. Subjects will be pre-screened to confirm PiXZ
      genotype within 84 days before their dose of trial medication. Once their genotype is
      confirmed, they will be screened in the 28 days before their dose of study medication.
      Subjects will be resident on the ward from 1 day before their first dose (Day -1) until 1
      hour after they receive their second dose (Day 2). They will then attend 6 outpatient visits
      on Days 5, 9, 13, 17, 21 and 25. Subjects will return to the ward and be resident from Day 27
      until 24 hours after the final dose (Day 29). Subjects will consume a standard breakfast
      before their morning dose on Days 1 and 28, and will be offered a meal before any other doses
      given on the ward. They will return for further outpatient visits on Days 36, 43 and 50, and
      for a follow-up visit 28-30 days after their final dose (Day 56-58).
