      existed among 3 different postoperative splinting regimens- no splint, removable splint, and
      plaster non-removable splint- following mini-open carpal tunnel release (CTR) surgery for
      symptomatic, isolated, nerve conduction study positive carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS).

      A total of 249 patients received a mini-open CTR and were subsequently randomized into 1 of
      the 3 splinting regimens to be removed at the first postoperative visit 10-14 days later.
      Patient-reported outcomes included QuickDASH surveys, Levine-Katz Symptom Severity Scale
      (SSS) and Functional Status Scale (FSS) and Pain at Rest and in Action using a Numerical Pain
      Rating Scale (NPRS). Clinical outcomes included wrist range of motion (ROM), grip and lateral
      pinch strengths. All outcomes were evaluated bilaterally at 10-14 days, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6
      months and 12 months after surgery. Demographic information was obtained preoperatively and
      complications were observed for and recorded throughout the study
