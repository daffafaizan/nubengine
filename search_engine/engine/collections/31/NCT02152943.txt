      I. Determine reasonable dose of drugs in treatment combination, including maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) and toxicity profiles, via a brief initial "run-in"/dose escalation.

      II. Evaluate response, in patients with tumors that demonstrate hormone receptor
      (HR)-positivity (> 1% on immunohistochemistry [IHC]) and human EGF receptor 2
      (HER)-positivity (IHC 3 and/or IHC 2/3 and fluorescence in situ hybridization [FISH]
      amplification).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Correlate activity of combination with genomic and proteomic signatures. II. Evaluate 2
      expanded cohorts of patients to include: 1) HR- and HER2-positive breast cancer (n=12) and 2)
      other HR- and HER2-positive tumors that have demonstrated activity in the dose escalation
      portion of the study (n=12).

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of everolimus and trastuzumab.

      Patients receive everolimus orally (PO) once daily (QD) and letrozole PO QD. Patients also
      receive trastuzumab intravenously (IV) over 30-90 minutes once every 3 weeks. Courses repeat
      every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for at least 30 days.
