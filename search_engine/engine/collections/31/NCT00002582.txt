        -  Estimate overall and relapse-free survival of women with early-stage breast cancer
           receiving adjuvant tamoxifen with or without adjuvant chemotherapy and/or ovarian
           suppression.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified by participating
      institution and choice of randomization option.

      Postmenopausal women are randomized to the first or second groups.

      Randomization for pre- and perimenopausal women is based on the clinician's judgement of
      appropriate adjuvant therapy (chemotherapy and/or ovarian suppression). Patients may be
      randomized as follows: among all four groups; for chemotherapy alone (first versus second
      group); for ovarian suppression alone (first versus third group); for ovarian suppression
      with nonrandomized assignment to chemotherapy (second versus forth group); for chemotherapy
      with nonrandomized assignment to ovarian suppression (second versus fourth group).

        -  First group: Patients receive tamoxifen by mouth every day for 5 years.

        -  Second group: Patients receive tamoxifen plus cyclophosphamide, methotrexate,
           fluorouracil (CMF) or doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide (AC). CMF is given every month for 6
           courses; AC is given every 3 weeks for 4 courses.

        -  Third group: Patients receive tamoxifen plus ovarian suppression by oophorectomy,
           radiation castration, or leuprolide or goserelin.

        -  Fourth group: Patients receive tamoxifen plus ovarian suppression plus chemotherapy with
           CMF or AC.

      Patients are followed for overall and relapse-free survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 6,000 women (4,000 premenopausal, 2,000 postmenopausal) will
      be accrued for this study.
