      has to include 224 patients affected by a head and neck cancer which therapeutic sequence
      involves a more or less made sensitized radiotherapy. The beginning of the inclusions is
      planned for May 2016, the end of inclusion 36 months later.

      The nutritional state and quality of life will be evaluated 6 months after radiotherapy.
