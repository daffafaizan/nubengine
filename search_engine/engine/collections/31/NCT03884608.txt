      cardiomyopathy who are treated with implanted ICD and CRT-D devices from many locations
      across the United States. The BIO-LIBRA Study will look at the results of treatment in women
      and men enrollees. The two primary goals are: 1) to learn if there are differences in
      treatment response based on the patient's sex; and 2) to learn if there are differences in
      patient outcomes based on device type.

      There is a special focus on women in the BIO-LIBRA Study. Usually, only about 25% of people
      in prior device studies have been women. Yet heart disease is the number-one cause of death
      for women - one in three deaths each year. The BIO-LIBRA Study would like to have a more
      balanced study which includes more women than in prior studies. The goal is for at least 40%
      of the people participating in the study to be women.

      The study will observe up to 1,000 women and men over a three-year period following the
      device implant. Utilizing information collected at annual doctor visits and scheduled
      transmission reports from the implanted device in between these visits, the BIO-LIBRA Study
      will be able to evaluate some of the common risks of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy.
