      being investigated for the thermal treatment of cancer. In MRg-FU, a specially designed
      transducer is used to focus a beam of low intensity ultrasound energy into a small volume at
      a specific target site in the body. MR is used to identify and delineate the tumour, focus
      the ultrasound beam on the target and provide real-time thermal mapping to ensure accurate
      heating of the designated target with minimal effect to the adjacent healthy tissue. The
      focused ultrasound beam produces therapeutic hyperthermia (40-42Â°C) in the target field
      causing protein denaturation and cell damage.

      Currently, there is no prospective clinical data reported on the use of MRg-FU in the setting
      of recurrent rectal cancer. Recurrent rectal cancer is a vexing clinical problem. Current
      retreatment protocols have limited efficacy. The addition of hyperthermia to radiation and
      chemotherapy may enhance the therapeutic response. With recent advances in technology, the
      investigators hypothesize that MRg-FU is technically feasible and can be safely used in
      combination with concurrent reirradiation and chemotherapy for the treatment of recurrent
      rectal cancer without increased side-effects.
