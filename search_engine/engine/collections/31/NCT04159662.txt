      6 weeks. They will also be invited to undergo clinical and cognitive assessments as well as
      brain imaging before and after 6 weeks of intervention in order to compare the efficacy of
      the intervention. Additionally, their verbal memory and emotion regulation abilities will be
      assessed mid-intervention to examine the specific effect of each CRT module.
