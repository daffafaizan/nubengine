      can be attributed to its evident success regarding pain improvement, deformity correction and
      disability reduction in knee osteoarthritis subjects. However, only a third of the patients
      report no functional problems after surgery, the 20% of then are unsatisfied with its
      functional skills and around a 20% are experiencing pain, high disability degrees and a
      significant quality of life reduction. This results cannot be fully explained by mechanical
      processes, surgical procedures or surgery variations, but it seems to be related to other
      psychological aspects. Chronic pain subjects often develop maladaptive thoughts and
      behaviours (i.e. pain catastrophism, Kinesiophobia, activity avoidance) which contribute to
      make the subject suffer physically as well as emotionally, and affect on the intensity and
      persistency of pain.

      Although many psychosocial factors have been studied, pain catastrophism has emerged as one
      of the most important predictors for persistent pain after a total knee arthroplasty, as well
      as its severity and duration, that's why it is getting more importance when it comes to study
      chronic pain in this subjects. Reducing pain catastrophism has become a key factor to
      determine the success in the rehabilitation of some maladies accompanied by pain, considering
      that its reduction has been associated with the clinical improvement of pain itself. It has
      been observed that treatments using psychological and psychosocial interventions, therapeutic
      education and coping skills training, or physical therapy and therapeutic exercise, are
      effective techniques to reduce pain catastrophism. Nevertheless, it's still necessary to
      determine whether the maladaptive pain related thoughts approach, using physical therapy and
      behavioural techniques, are able to reduce the risk of suffering postoperative chronic pain.
