      play a role in the severity and progression of ALI/ARDS. Recent studies demonstrated that TF
      levels were elevated in plasma and pulmonary edema fluid of ARDS/ALI patients compared to
      control patients with hydrostatic pulmonary edema. These higher plasma TF levels were
      correlated with increased mortality, fewer ventilation-free days, the presence of
      disseminated intravascular coagulation and the presence of sepsis in patients with ALI/ARDS,
      suggesting that systemic activation of coagulation may be clinically important in ALI/ARDS.
      Moreover, the pulmonary TF levels in patients with ALI/ARDS were found to range between 0.5
      and 2 nM, approximately 100-fold higher than simultaneous plasma levels, suggesting an
      intra-alveolar source of TF. Thus, anti-TF antibody blockage of TF activity may therefore
      provide an effective therapeutic mechanism for the treatment of inflammatory disorders such
      as ALI and ARDS. This study will test the hypothesis that administration of anti-TF antibody
      (ALT-836) to septic patients with ALI/ARDS will improve the clinical outcome by shortening
      the duration of mechanical ventilation for these patients.
