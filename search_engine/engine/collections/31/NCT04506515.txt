    
      PSAS (Psychological Stress and Adaptation at work Score) is a self conducted questionnaire
      designed to assess psychological impact in healthcare workers to match times of crisis and
      when the time is scarce. PSAS has a range between 0 and 105, and higher scores represent
      higher stress detected.
