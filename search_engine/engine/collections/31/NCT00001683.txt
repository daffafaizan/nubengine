      the degradation of the extracellular matrix. MMP-2 and MMP-9 have been associated with the
      progression of cancer. It is hypothesized that an imbalance between MMPs and MMP inhibitors
      allows the destruction of the extracellular matrix and enhances the ability of the tumor
      cells to grow and metastasize. By inhibiting MMPs, it is thought that angiogenesis and
      metastasis can be inhibited. This is a phase I study of COL-3, an oral matrix
      metalloproteinase inhibitor, in patients with refractory metastatic cancer. COL-3 is a
      chemically modified tetracycline derivative. Patients must have clinically progressive
      disease documented within 1 month prior to entry to be eligible for treatment. Patients must
      have also failed therapy of proven efficacy for their disease and have an ECOG performance
      status of less than or equal to 2. Patients must be willing to travel from their home to the
      NIH for follow-up visits. Patients with brain metastases or primary CNS malignancies are not
      eligible. Concurrent therapy for their cancer (i.e., radiation therapy, chemotherapy, etc.)
      will preclude participation. We will be defining the maximum tolerated dose, the toxicity
      profile, characterizing the pharmacokinetics, and evaluating the effect of COL-3 on several
      biological endpoints.
