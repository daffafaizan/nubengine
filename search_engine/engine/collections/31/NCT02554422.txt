      experienced and occasional otologic surgeon to record force in three dimensions during his
      standard palpation of each ossicle at surgery and al-lows correlation of his subjective
      impression with objective measurement results. The first task was to incorporate force
      sensing capability into a standard 45Â° angulated 2.5 mm hook, which is commonly used to
      palpate, disconnect and luxate ossicles during middle ear surgery.
