      renal cancer and HCC.

      According to the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging classification, transarterial
      chemoembolization (TACE) has been recommended as a first line-therapy for patients at
      intermediate stage - BCLC B class (multinodular asymptomatic tumors without an invasive
      pattern).

      Because sorafenib may improve the efficacy of locoregional therapy by decreasing post-TACE
      angiogenesis, sorafenib in combination with TACE has attracted considerable attention as a
      promising therapy
