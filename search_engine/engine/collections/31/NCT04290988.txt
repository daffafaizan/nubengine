      individual's neural electrical activity from live EEG recording. Using operant conditioning
      principles, individuals are trained to increase or reduce patterns of brainwave activity to
      modify behavior and performance. Although neurofeedback has not yet been investigated as a
      treatment for aphasia or other communication deficits due to stroke or neurodegenerative
      disease, it may be effective. Previous studies have observed improvement in cognitive and
      behavioral measures in those with conditions such as Attention Deficit Disorder and Attention
      Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. Furthermore, it has been associated with reduced anxiety and
      sleep disruption, which both exacerbate language and communication impairments. Research is
      needed to determine if neurofeedback may be an effective treatment for language disorders
      such as PPA and post-stroke communication disorders.

      It is possible that EEG neurofeedback, which focuses on improving abnormal brainwave
      patterns, could provide certain therapeutic benefits to individuals with PPA or post-stroke
      aphasia, either by directly affecting neural networks that underlie language, or more
      generally by reducing anxiety and inattention through behavioral conditioning. Reduction of
      anxiety in neurological diseases can be beneficial not only for functional performance but
      also sleep duration and quality.
