      post-op, 6 weeks FU, 3 months FU, 6 months FU and 12 months FU). Patients can be inlucded
      prospectively or retrospectively. If properatively recruited patients complete two
      questionnaires (EQ5D and Merle d'Aubign√©) at their preoperative visits. These questionnaires
      are repeated after 6 and 12 months. Surgeons report about the success of the surgical
      procedure in a specifically designed questionnaire.

      During the whole study period, adverse events related to the implant or surgery are collected
      as well as x-rays and CT (as per standard of care).
