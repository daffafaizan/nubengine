      recognized. Many intensive care experts are focusing on maintaining a targeted ''ideal''
      sedation level according to the individual patient's condition to avoid adverse events such
      as prolonged mechanical ventilation, respiratory depression, pneumonia, delirium,
      psychological problems, and increased treatment costs resulting from over sedation.
      Dexmedetomidine is a selective alpha-2-adrenoceptor agonist. It exerts both sedative and
      analgesic effects via mechanisms different from other sedatives such as midazolam and
      propofol, and provides sedation characterized by prompt response to stimuli with no
      respiratory depression. The investigators aim to compare dexmedetomidine with propofol for
      sedation >24h in poly traumatized mechanically ventilated patients. The investigators will
      perform a prospective, single center trial to investigate the safety and efficacy of
      dexmedetomidine for long-term sedation in poly traumatized mechanically ventilated ICU
      patients, in comparison with propofol.
