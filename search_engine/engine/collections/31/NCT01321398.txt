      mechanical ventilation decreases morbidity and mortality. Compared to conventional
      ventilation, high frequency oscillation (HFO) is able to provide much smaller tidal volumes
      (1.1 - 2.5 ml/kg) and thus theoretically may provide additional lung protection. At this
      time, while trials of HFO in adults have been inconclusive, the use of HFO for the management
      of ALI/ARDS has become widespread

      Patients with acute lung injury (ALI) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are
      critically ill and have a high mortality associated with their illness (approximately 50%).
      Currently, esophageal pressure monitors are used to optimize inflation pressures and improve
      oxygenation in conventional mechanical ventilation in patients with ALI/ARDS. With this in
      mind, the purpose of this study is twofold: (1) demonstrate that esophageal pressure monitors
      can easily be inserted in patients undergoing HFO and (2) report the transpulmonary pressures
      in these patients.
