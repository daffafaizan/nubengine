      evaluated. Sixty two patients who met the inclusion criteria [age>18, upper limb arthralgias,
      and DASH (Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand) questionnaire score>10)] were randomly
      assigned to the exercise group (n=32) or the control group (n=30).

      Patients in the exercise group performed a program of strengthening, stretching and
      resistance upper limbs exercises, of 30 minutes duration daily, for 12 weeks. Performance of
      daily activities was evaluated with the DASH and HAQ questionnaires, grip and pinch strength
      with the Jamar dynamometer and pinch gauge tools respectively, dexterity with the Purdue
      pegboard test and the quality of life with the LUPUSQoL questionnaire at 0, 6, 12 (end of the
      exercise program) and 24 weeks for both groups. SLE activity and cumulative organ damage were
      evaluated with the SLE disease activity index 2000 (SLEDAI-2K) and SLICC/ACR-DI,
      respectively.
