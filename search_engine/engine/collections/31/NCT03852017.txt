    
      Eligible patients will be recruited from Northwestern Medicine's Department of Radiation
      Oncology and Northwestern Memorial Hospital. Participants will complete an online question
      prior to beginning the intervention. The intervention will begin on Week 2 of radiation
      therapy. Upon arrival for their treatment visit, they will receive the audio program from the
      clinic staff. They will start the program prior to their treatment. Participants will be
      asked to listen to the audio-program during their radiation treatment visits, using a
      Bluetooth-enabled MP3 player with speaker instead of headphones or earbuds because they are
      not permitted during radiation therapy. The patient's ears need to be free to hear a possible
      communication from the radiation therapists if need be. Audio program recordings will run
      3-12 minutes. Participants will turn off the program after their audio session has ended and
      return the audio program to the clinic staff after their treatment visit. Participants will
      complete an online question immediately after completing the intervention, and again 1 and 3
      months later.
