      improving sleep in elderly persons with dementia and sleep problems. We use a within-subject
      design to evaluate the effect of the music intervention. Participants are persons above the
      age of 60 diagnosed with dementia and suffering from sleep problems. We will examine the
      effect of the intervention on sleep, mood and cognition.
