      depression following Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI). This is because of a lack of randomized
      controlled studies in the treatment of post-TBI depression. This study is designed to examine
      the safety and effectiveness of escitalopram in the treatment of post-TBI depression. It will
      also investigate metabolic changes and neural pathways associated with post-TBI depression
      and metabolic alterations after treatment through neuroimaging.
