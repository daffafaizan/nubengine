      patient and then the the CD30 chimeric-EBV CTLs will be created in the lab. The cells will
      then be grown and frozen for the patient.

      To get the CD30 antibody to attach to the surface of the T cell, the lab will insert the
      antibody gene into the T cell. This is done with a virus called a retrovirus that has been
      made for this study and will carry the antibody gene into the T cell. Because the patient
      will have received cells with a new gene in them they will be followed for a total of 15
      years to see if there are any long term side effects of gene transfer.

      When the patient is enrolled on this study, they will be assigned to one of the following
      dose levels of CD30 chimeric receptor-EBV CTLs.

        -  2×10^7 cells/m2

        -  5x10^7 cells/m2

        -  1×10^8 cells/m2

      The dose level of cells that they will receive will not be based on a medical determination
      of what is best for them, instead the dose is based on the order in which the patient enrolls
      on the study relative to other participants. Subjects enrolled earlier in the study will
      receive a lower dose of cells than those enrolled later in the study. The risks of harm and
      discomfort from the study treatment may bear some relationship to the dose level. The
      potential for direct benefit, if any, may also vary with the dose level. To enroll on this
      study they will need to have recovered from toxic effects of previous chemotherapy for at
      least one week and not be receiving any other investigational agents. Patients cannot have
      received any tumor vaccines within the previous six weeks.
