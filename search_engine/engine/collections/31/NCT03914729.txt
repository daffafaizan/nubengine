      population) that affects primarily young adults. Because of purulent nature it is treated
      with surgery only.

      Traditional surgical techniques encompass midline excision of the purulent cyst and either
      leaving the wound "lay open" for secondary closure or midline primary closure. The latter
      method has a major drawback of high recurrence rate and very long healing and patient
      disability periods. Therefore alternative techniques to close the wound after pilonidal sinus
      excision were proposed. In some a muscular-cutaneous flaps are created and the wound is
      closed in a Z- or Y- or other shape manner. The recurrence rate of these techniques is
      significantly lower than with a traditional midline closure, but healing time and final
      cosmetic results are far from ideal in patient view.

      Recently a new method of wound closure was developed independently by a few groups that
      includes bilateral mobilisation of gluteus maximus muscles fascia and midline closure of the
      wound. Preliminary results demonstrated that this method leads to lower recurrence rate and
      better cosmetic results because the natal cleft is saved.
