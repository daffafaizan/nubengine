      hyperglycemia and assign them to either experimental group (a total of 60 women of
      gestational hyperglycemia) or control group (a total of 60 women of gestational
      hyperglycemia). Data will be collected at the women's six-month gestation, hospitalization
      for childbirth, and six weeks, six months, and one year postpartum. The three-year study
      findings can demonstrate the consequences and risk factors for women with three different
      levels of gestational hyperglycemia to suffer from type 2 diabetes mellitus. In addition, the
      results can be taken as an evidence-based intervention for the perinatal health promotion
      program in preventing the gestational hyperglycemic women to suffer from type 2 diabetes
      mellitus and in decreasing the impact of gestational hyperglycemia on the development of the
      gestational hyperglycemic women's offspring.
