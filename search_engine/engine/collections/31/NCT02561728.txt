      plagiocephaly secondary to pressure on the posterior skull with infant position and furniture
      use or after minimally invasive surgery for craniosynostosis is currently the treatment of
      choice at Cincinnati Children's Hospital (CCHMC). Helmet treatment in children with
      positional plagiocephaly is initiated for infants between 4 and 9 months of age (at CCHMC).
      Helmet treatment for children undergoing surgery for craniosynostosis is initiated following
      endoscopic cranial vault and stip craniectomy surgery after swelling from the surgery has
      subsided (generally within two weeks of surgery). Treatment with helmet therapy has been
      shown to improve head shape in both patient diagnoses. There are two types of helmets
      available to the investigators' patients (Hanger Helmet and P Pod Helmet) and to date, no
      research has evaluated whether one helmet type is more efficient in reshaping the skull than
      the other type. The current study seeks to fill this gap in the literature by comparing the
      outcomes for infants treated with a Hanger Helmet to the outcomes for infants treated with a
      P Pod Helmet. The investigators will measure skull symmetry with a 3dMD camera and take
      routine cross lateral measurements with a caliper designed for this use. Infants
      participating in the study will be randomized using a computerized program, Minim.
