      8-month alternate dose regimen period. Subjects could receive up to a maximum of 15 monthly
      injections of ranibizumab 0.5 mg during the study, 7 injections (Day 0 and at 6 monthly
      visits) in the fixed treatment period and a maximum of 8 injections in the alternate dose
      regimen period. During the fixed treatment period, subjects received 7 monthly intravitreal
      ranibizumab 0.5 mg injections. During the alternate dose regimen period, from Month 7 through
      Month 14, subjects were evaluated monthly to determine whether they achieved the
      study-specific visual acuity and spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (VA-OCT)
      stability criteria. Subjects continued to receive monthly ranibizumab 0.5 mg monthly
      injections until the VA-OCT stability criteria were first met. Upon meeting the VA-OCT
      stability criteria for the first time during the alternate dose regimen period, subjects were
      randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to one of 2 dose regimens, the PRN (pro re nata,
      "as-needed") or the Monthly regimen.

      PRN randomized subjects: Subjects received no injection at the randomization visit and at
      future monthly visits where the VA-OCT stability criteria were met and received a ranibizumab
      0.5 mg injection at future monthly visits if the VA-OCT stability criteria were not met.

      Monthly randomized subjects: Subjects continued to receive ranibizumab 0.5 mg injections at
      each monthly visit.

      Monthly non-randomized subjects: Subjects who did not meet the VA-OCT stability criteria at
      any month from Month 7 through Month 14 were not randomized and received 8 monthly
      intravitreal ranibizumab 0.5 mg injections.
