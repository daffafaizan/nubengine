      completed at least one line of systemic therapy, will be considered for treatment with
      pembrolizumab. Patients who are considered medically unfit for chemotherapy and where no
      other treatment options are believed to be of major benefit may also be considered. Patients
      will receive pembrolizumab for up to 35 cycles.

      Patients, who have received 35 cycles of pembrolizumab or discontinued study treatment of
      another reason than progression, will in the follow-up period be assessed for safety and
      treatment-related toxicity (for up to 90 days), progression and survival.

      Patients who have achieved a clinically meaningful response after 35 cycles of pembrolizumab,
      defined as complete response (CR), partial response (PR), and stable disease (SD) assessed by
      the Investigator by using RECIST, v1.1, and have not experienced any clinically significant
      toxicity of study treatment, may be considered for reintroduction of pembrolizumab, if
      progression is detected > 8 weeks after cycle 35.

      Due to the low incidence of osteosarcoma, the inclusion rate is expected to be low, thus a
      Simon's two-stage design is suggested. Evaluation of efficacy and safety in stage one will be
      performed after the first 12 patients have been treated for 18 weeks:

        -  In case of ≤2 responders; the trial ends.

        -  If ≥3 responders, the trial will continue into stage II to a total number of 25
           patients.
