      associated with both substances. However, few studies have evaluated pharmacological
      interventions, in combination with behavioral treatment, to address co-occurring cannabis and
      tobacco use; these are limited by high participant attrition, poor adherence to
      interventions, and lack of control. Participants were recruited from an urban, outpatient
      substance abuse treatment program that offers both intensive behavioral counseling and
      medication-assisted treatment (MAT) for opioid use disorder. The investigators selected these
      clinical sites because the investigators have successfully recruited and retained
      participants from these sites in prior clinical trials, and anticipated that they would find
      a high prevalence of persons with frequent cannabis use.
