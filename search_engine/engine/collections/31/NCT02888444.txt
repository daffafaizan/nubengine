      cause of death and disability in New Zealand. COPD particularly affects indigenous MƒÅori and
      Pacific people, given their higher rates of smoking. COPD patients tend to have a higher
      level of nicotine dependence and, as a result, often find quitting harder and are more likely
      to relapse back to smoking. A clinical trial (N=262) is planned in Auckland, New Zealand to
      determine whether extended varenicline treatment combined with behavioural support can
      prevent relapse back to smoking in recent ex-smokers with COPD. Smoking cessation and relapse
      prevention are the most cost-effective interventions available for COPD patients that smoke,
      irrespective of their disease stage. The trial has the potential to significantly improve the
      outcomes of this common and chronic health condition in New Zealand.
