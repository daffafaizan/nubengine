      after a short training session. TMS will be used to demonstrate changes in cortical
      excitability (motor threshold) and intracortical inhibition and facilitation. The effect of
      methylphenidate on baseline TMS measures will be evaluated as well as the effect on training
      induced changes in TMS measures (by comparing baseline and posttraining measures). The
      patients will be trained on two separate occasions, to compare the effect of Methylphenidate
      to placebo.
