      will use topical Nifedipine cream 0.2% 4 times a day for 6 weeks (except for menstrual
      period). 10 other women will use topical Nifedipine cream 0.4% 4 times a day for 6 weeks
      (except for menstrual period).

      and double blind. Participants will be examined before starting the treatment, at the end of

      has been prepared in three languages and will be used to compare dyspareunia and associate
      variables between the groups.

      between the groups will be examined, and uni- and multi-variate analysis will be performed.
