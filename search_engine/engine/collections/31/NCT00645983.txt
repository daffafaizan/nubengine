      Chamomile, its use as an anti-anxiety herb is universal. Despite its widespread use and
      acceptance, there have been no studies evaluating the safety and anti-anxiety efficacy of
      Chamomile in human subjects. Given this lack of controlled clinical data, we propose a pilot
      study of Chamomile safety and efficacy in mild anxiety, and propose using the data as a basis
      for statistically powering a future R01 application. We will ask: Is Chamomile a safe and
      effective alternative treatment for Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)? To do this, 60
      patients with a diagnosis of mild to moderate GAD will receive double-blind treatment for 8
      weeks with either (i) Chamomile extract, or (ii) placebo. We hypothesize that Chamomile will
      have a superior anti-anxiety efficacy compared to placebo, and a comparable safety profile to
      placebo.
