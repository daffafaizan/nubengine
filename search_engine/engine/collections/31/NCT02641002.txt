      induction phase followed by a maintenance phase. During the induction phase, treatments will
      be administered in 42-day cycles in Cycles 1 through 4. Following completion of Cycle 4 in
      the induction phase, subjects with non-progressive disease will enter the maintenance phase.
      During the maintenance phase, treatments will be administered in 28 day cycles. Subjects may
      continue CC-90002 for up to a maximum of 2 years (eg, induction phase Cycles 1 through 4 and
      maintenance phase Cycles 5 through 24) or until clinically significant disease progression,
      the occurrence of intolerable toxicity, or physician/subject decision to discontinue
      CC-90002, whichever comes first.
