    
      Background: Integrated care and strict follow up have been recommended for frail patients
      with chronic respiratory failure (CRF) discharged at home.

      Objectives: To evaluate impact and costs on health care resources of a telemedicine programme
      (TM) for severe patients discharged at home with oxygen and/or home mechanical ventilation
      (HMV) with a high risk of hospital readmission.

      Design: Prospective randomised controlled trial. Setting: Respiratory Rehabilitation Unit S.
      Maugeri Foundation between May 2004 and March 2007.

      Participants: 240 CRF patients will be randomised into an intervention group (TM) and a
      control Group, which received current usual care (educational plan, 3 months outpatient
      visits).

      Interventions: one year TM with continuous (h 24) on call accessibility to a nurse and/or a
      pulmonologist, a web-based call centre and a pulse oxymetry tracing.

      Main outcome measures: survival, admissions to emergency room (ER), hospitalisations, urgent
      general practitioner (GP) calls, home relapses; probability to remain free from the above
      events will be also compared among groups. TM and health Care System costs as customer
      satisfaction will be also collected.
