      subcutaneous tissue and plasma are well documented in animal models and human adult studies.
      COP plays a major role in transcapillary fluid balance and is valuable in fluid therapy
      planning in critically ill patients. There are no data regarding interstitial fluid COP
      values in neither sick nor healthy children. Sampling of interstitial fluid by the wick
      method in children who is under general anaesthesia (ear-nose-throat operations) gives the
      opportunity to identify normal COP values in this age group.
