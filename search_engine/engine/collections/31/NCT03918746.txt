      that arises in presence of another's suffering and implies the desire to help. There is a
      growing number of studies pointing out the benefits of Compassion-based Interventions (CBI)
      and their association with psychological health. CBI are focused on training compassion to
      others and/or towards oneself (self-compassion) employing formal and informal meditation
      practices. Recent scientific literature is emerging to prove the feasibility and efficacy of
      cultivating compassion over the Internet and, thus, delivering self-applied online CBI.

      The aim of this study is to investigate the feasibility and acceptability of the internet
      Attachment-based compassion Therapy (iABCT) to promote wellbeing and mental health for the
      general population. A secondary aim is to explore the preliminary efficacy of iABCT at
      post-intervention and 3-month follow-up.

      The principal hypothesis is that the iABCT will be feasible and well-accepted by participants
      in terms of expectations, satisfaction, usability, opinion, and cost-effectiveness. Moreover,
      it is expected that the iABCT will be effective to promote changes in self-reported measures
      of compassion, self-compassion, mindfulness, self-criticizing, attachment, wellbeing, and
      mental health. It is also hypothesized that gains will be maintained at 3-month follow-up.

      A minimum of 35 participants is considered enough to cover the aims of this feasibility study
      and to provide precise and efficient estimations of parameters (i.e., means, standard
      deviations, effect size, and confidence intervals) for powering a larger randomized
      controlled trial (RCT).
