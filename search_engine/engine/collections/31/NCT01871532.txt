    
      Subjects will enter a screening period of up to one month before being randomized at the
      Baseline Visit, which will occur on Day 1 of the subject's menstrual cycle. Each subject will
      then receive up to 4 weeks treatment with Gonal-f®. If adequate follicular development
      (assessed by transvaginal ultrasound) is achieved, the subject will proceed to administration
      of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) within 24-48hrs of last Gonal-f® injection (or
      according to standard site practice).

      Following administration of hCG, subjects will attempt to become pregnant via intercourse or
      intrauterine insemination. The method of conception will be determined by the subject's
      requirements and standard practice at the clinic site.

      All subjects will be followed up appropriately until confirmation of biochemical pregnancy
      (hCG + minimum 14 days) and clinical pregnancy (hCG + minimum 42 days, for subjects with
      positive biochemical pregnancy test).
