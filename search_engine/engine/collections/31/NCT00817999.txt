      will evaluate the effect of GFJ on the maintenance dose (75 mg/day) of clopidogrel. Subjects
      will be randomized to either initially receive GFJ prior to their loading dose of clopidogrel
      or receive GFJ prior to their second loading dose. The subjects who have been randomized to
      receive GFJ initially will drink two small cans (11 oz total) of regular strength GFJ in the
      morning, followed two hours later by a loading dose (300 mg) of clopidogrel and will then
      return to the clinic 6 hours after their loading dose to have their platelet inhibition
      measured. Subjects will have ~ 5 milliliters (1 teaspoonful) of whole blood drawn from an
      antecubital vein in their forearm via a 21 gauge needle attached to a blue-top plastic
      vacuette sodium citrate blood collection (Greiner, Monroe, NC) tube to test inhibition of
      platelet aggregation. After their first loading dose, a 2 week washout period will follow to
      allow for their platelet aggregation to return to normal. Following the washout period, the
      subjects will take their second loading dose of clopidogrel and again return to the clinic
      for platelet inhibition measurement. The same timing will be followed for the loading dose
      taken without prior GFJ.

      During the maintenance dose phase of this study, subjects will take 75 mg/day clopidogrel for
      7 days with or without GFJ. Subjects will be randomized to either GFJ during the first period
      or GFJ during the second period. A minimum 2 week washout period will occur between the two 7
      day courses of clopidogrel. Platelet inhibition measurement will occur at the end of each 7
      day period as described above.
