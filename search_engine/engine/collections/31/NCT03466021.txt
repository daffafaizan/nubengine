      reduced physical activity and quality of life. Obesity is likewise a common disease
      characterized by inflammation, reduced physical activity and quality of life. Targeting both
      obesity and inflammation may turn out beneficial for patients with COPD and obesity, and this
      study explore the possibility to reverse a vicious cycle of COPD, lack of physical activity
      and obesity. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the effect of Liraglutide 3mg
      in patients with COPD on patient reported outcomes as measured by the Transition Dyspnea
      Index. The hypothesis is that Liraglutide 3mg exerts beneficial effects on measures of
      pulmonary function and quality of life in overweight patients with COPD by reducing body
      weight and reducing inflammatory activity.
