      dysembryoplastic neuro-epithelial tumors commonly show microcystic patterns, inconstant
      contrast-enhancement and are preferentially located on the internal face of the temporal
      lobe. The cornerstone of the treatment of these two entities remains surgery, as it provides
      good oncological outcomes and control of seizures. Surgical resection keeps a major role for
      these tumors. Thus, one of the key issues is to clearly define the borders of the tumor
      during surgery, a point of considerable importance for these curable lesions. Then, the
      investigators proposed to evaluate the feasibility of intraoperative fluorescein guidance, a
      technique based on the staining of blood-brain barrier breakdown areas with fluorescein.
      Patients will be identified from the list of patients operated on under fluorescence
      maintained by the department since the acquisition of the technique. Clinical datas will be
      collected and surgical videos will be analyzed to assess the presence of intraoperative
      fluorescence and its subjectively judged intensity (absent, weak, medium, strong). MRI data
      (quality of excision: total, subtotal or partial according to usual criteria) will be
      extracted from the radiological reports. No additional data will be produced
