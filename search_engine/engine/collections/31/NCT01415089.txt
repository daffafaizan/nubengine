      intervention for cancer patients (lung, colorectal, breast, prostate) and their family
      caregivers. This intervention is based on an efficacious, family-based program of care (the
      FOCUS Program) that has been tested previously in three large randomized clinical trials with
      positive outcomes for patients and their caregivers. In this R21 we will translate this
      primarily face-to-face, family-based program to an internet-based version.

      The objectives are: Objective 1. To develop an individually-tailored, interactive, web-based
      and email-based, Family Involvement Module. We will conduct formative testing while
      developing the module using qualitative data obtained from four focus groups. We will conduct
      usability testing of the near final module with data obtained from qualitative interviews
      with patients and caregivers as they complete web-based task assignments using a "think
      aloud" protocol while they navigate the module. Objective 2. To conduct a Phase II study with
      cancer patients and their family caregiver (N = 40 dyads) using baseline (Time 1) and
      two-month follow-up assessments (Time 2). Between Times 1 and 2, all participants jointly
      will complete the web-based Family Involvement Module. We will determine the feasibility of
      delivering the web-based module and will obtain a process evaluation completed by study
      participants. Data will be obtained from three large cancer centers using established
      instruments, and analyzed with descriptive statistics and paired t-tests. Findings from this
      R21 will provide data that are essential to test this innovative, tailored, interactive
      web-based intervention with a larger sample in a R01.
