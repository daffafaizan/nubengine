      polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) leads to increased mechanical properties of the bone-implant
      complex, leading to the assumption that augmentation could reduce mechanical failures in
      patients. While a few clinical studies have already been performed with augmented
      trochanteric nails in proximal femur fractures, no clinical studies exist with the use of
      Proximal Humerus Internal Locking System (PHILOS) and (PMMA) augmentation for the treatment
      of fractures in the proximal humerus.

      In this study a new standardized technique for augmentation of screw tips using high viscous
      PMMA cement (Traumacem V+) with the PHILOS plate will be applied. Fracture treatment with
      PHILOS Screw Augmentation will be compared with treatment with PHILOS without augmentation.
