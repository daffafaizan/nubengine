      clinics in rural South Africa and Uganda. We will enroll 1,000 adults living with HIV who are
      switched from first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) containing non-nucleoside reverse
      transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) to TLD. We will follow participants for one year with study
      visits at enrollment, 24 weeks, and 48 weeks. Study procedures include interviews, body
      measurements, chart review, and collection of blood and urine specimens for retrospective
      testing, including viral load, drug resistance testing, antiretroviral drug level testing,
      and tests to evaluate the effects of TLD on renal, liver, metabolic, and other organ
      function.

      Aim 1: To determine the contributions of resistance prior to switch to TLD from a NNRTI-based
      regimen to risk of treatment failure after six and twelve months on TLD. Hypothesis: People
      living with HIV who experience virologic failure on TLD will have increased odds of NRTI
      mutations prior to TLD exposure, compared to controls with virologic suppression.

      Aim 2: Explore pharmacologic measures of adherence to distinguish virologic failure on TLD
      due to suboptimal adherence versus resistance using 2a) urine tenofovir (TFV) levels and 2b)
      tenofovir diphosphate (TFV-DP) in dried blood spots (DBS). Hypothesis: Absence of TFV in
      urine and TFV-DP concentrations in DBS will distinguish ART failure with versus without
      resistance.
