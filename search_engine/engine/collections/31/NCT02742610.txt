      Management (MSI-CM) for smoking cessation that can be readily available to depressed smokers
      receiving outpatient psychiatric treatment. The intervention will involve a series of brief
      mindfulness training that will be delivered via smartphone, that prompts patients to practice
      a mindfulness exercise multiple times a day while abstinent: 1) 10-days prior to their target
      quit date and 2) during the 2-week incentivized abstinence period (using CM) plus an
      additional 2 weeks (without CM) following their target quit date. We will use CM as an
      adjunct strategy to enhance the efficacy of mindfulness training due to its utility in
      producing short-term abstinence, so as to provide opportunities to practice mindfulness
      without smoking in one's natural environment. We will accomplish this objective by pursuing
      the following specific aims (in 2 phases):

      Phase 1: To develop the MSI-CM intervention intended to improve smoking cessation success
      among depressed smokers receiving outpatient psychiatric treatment.

      1a. We will collaborate with TelASK, Inc. to develop a prototype of a smartphone intervention
      (MSI-CM).

      1b. We will conduct preliminary pilot testing of MSI-CM, in an iterative fashion, with 10
      smokers receiving outpatient psychiatric treatment for depression.

      Phase 2: To conduct a preliminary, randomized controlled trial (RCT) with depressed 60
      smokers receiving outpatient psychiatric treatment.
