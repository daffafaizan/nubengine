      recruited in 2 quarantine hospitals (15th of May hospital, Cairo, and Al Rajhi hospital,
      Assiut), will be randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio (80 patient in each treatment arm), to
      receive either the fixed combination of Sofosbuvir/Ledipasvir (400 mg and 90 mg, orally) once
      daily for 14 days, plus the standard care treatment regimen (SCT) for COVID-19 patients
      according to the Egyptian Ministry of Health (MOH) protocol (Group 1), or nitazoxanide (500
      mg, orally) four times per day for 14 days, plus STC (Group 2), or SCT alone (Group 3). All
      treatment groups will be followed up by laboratory investigations and PCR for SARS-CoV-2
      virus at the time of enrollment, days 5, 8, 11, and 14. Supportive care comprised, as
      necessary, supplemental oxygen, noninvasive and invasive ventilation, antibiotic agents,
      vasopressor support, renal-replacement therapy, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation
      (ECMO). To ensure a balanced distribution of case severities in all study groups,
      randomization will be stratified based on the case severity index issued by WHO
      (https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/clinical-management-of-novel-cov.pdf).

      Written informed consent will be obtained from all patients or the patient's legal
      representative if the patient is too unwell to provide consent. The trial will be conducted
      in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and the Good Clinical
      Practice guidelines of the International Conference on Harmonisation. The authors are
      responsible for designing the trial and for compiling and analyzing the data. The authors
      vouch for data completeness and accuracy and adherence to the trial protocol.
