      done at L2-L3 level has a high possibility to include L1-L2 roots, and thus can be suitable
      for inguinal surgery. In our study, the investigators introduce a modified PCB which will be
      performed in lateral decubitus by a 120 mm stimulated needle inserted at the junction between
      the lateral third and the medial two-thirds of a line drawn at L2-L3 interspace, between the
      interspinous line and a line passing through the posterior superior iliac spine (PSIS),
      parallel to the interspinous line . If twitching of the anterior thigh area is observed, the
      needle is moved slight cranially. When twitching of the inguinal field is observed,
      bupivacaine 0.5% 30 ml, will be injected
