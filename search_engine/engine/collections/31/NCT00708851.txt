      effective treatment for plaque psoriasis that has become impractical in outpatient care
      mainly due to the inconvenience and aesthetic concerns of coal tar. This study aims to
      evaluate the safety, efficacy, and convenience of adding a novel liquor carbonis distillate
      (LCD) (coal tar) solution to standard NB_UVB phototherapy in adults with chronic plaque
      psoriasis. Patients will apply LCD solution to half the body, twice daily at home and receive
      outpatient full-body NB-UVB light therapy 3 times a week for up to 12 weeks. A blinded
      investigator will grade psoriasis severity of body halves and bilateral target lesions and
      monitor adverse reactions. Patients will rate their psoriasis symptoms and LCD solution
      aesthetics. Incorporating an at-home regimen with a novel LCD solution into outpatient NB-UVB
      light therapy is safe, convenient, and effective and can improve psoriasis more quickly than
      NB-UVB light therapy alone.
