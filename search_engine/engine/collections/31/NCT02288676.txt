      the top four cancers in terms of incidence, death and healthcare expenditure. The deaths
      associated with these cancers are largely caused by stage III/IV disease, for which cure
      rates have not changed in three decades, despite escalating costs of treatment. Attempts at
      early diagnosis have been ineffective in reducing mortality, because the high-grade subtypes,
      which account for the majority of deaths, metastasize while the primary cancer is still
      small, has not caused symptoms, and is undetectable by imaging or blood tumour markers.

      In recent years, the recognition that somatic mutations are early steps in carcinogenesis has
      led to a shift from tests such as imaging and non-specific blood tumour markers to technology
      that detects cancer-associated mutations in cervical, uterine, or blood samples. Several
      DNA-tagging technologies have been shown to be capable of identifying small amount of cancer
      DNA among thousands of normal cells, the proverbial needle in a haystack.

      This investigation aims to develop and validate an in-house developed DNA tagging technology
      'DOvEEgene-Haloplex' for the early diagnosis of endometrial and ovarian cancers. The assay
      pipeline for barcoding and agnostic testing of the biofluids must lend itself to automation
      and high throughput testing. It must have good sensitivity and more importantly very high
      specificity, as the only way to corroborate a positive test is to remove the uterus, tubes
      and ovaries.
