      injection of either ARC-AAT or Placebo in double-blind fashion. Up to thirteen cohorts (6
      participants per cohort) will be enrolled. Participants in all cohorts will be confined to
      the clinical facility beginning on Day -1 with discharge on Day 2. Escalation to the next
      dose level will proceed until a participant experiences a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) or
      there is achievement of pre-determined threshold reductions in AAT levels. Dosing in
      participants with AATD will commence based on pre-determined threshold reductions in AAT
      levels for healthy volunteers. For each participant, the duration of the study clinic visits
      is up to 11 weeks, from Screening to the End-of-Study examination. However, including a Day
      90 Follow-Up telephone call, the maximum study duration is approximately 20 weeks.
