      nucleus of the lens, called Dynamic Light Scattering Device (DLS). Preliminary studies have
      shown its potential in the detection of the earliest changes occurring in cataract, at the
      stage where anticataract treatment would theoretically be most effective in reversing,
      delaying or preventing cataracts. A new miniaturized version of this device has been
      developed by NASA using lower energy lasers and offered for further development and testing
      at the NEI. We recently conducted a pilot study to evaluate the usefulness and
      reproducibility of this instrument for quantitating lens changes, and found good
      reproducibility. We also determined that the most useful parameter to use is mean particle
      size derived from particle size distribution. We therefore propose to conduct a study on
      changes on the lens due to aging (age related changes), as well as on the three
      representative types of cataracts (nuclear, cortical and PSC).
