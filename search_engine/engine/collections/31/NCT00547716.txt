      Previous studies have reported steatosis to be an independent predictor of treatment failure
      in patients with chronic hepatitis C infection.

      The pathogenesis of hepatic steatosis in chronic Hepatitis C infection has not been fully
      elucidated. Hepatic steatosis is a manifestation of excessive triglyceride accumulation in
      the liver. Hypertriglyceridemia may benefit from Omega-3 fatty acid (fish oil supplements)
      which, by reducing VLDL production can lower the serum triglyceride concentration by as much
      as 50 percent or more.

      The treatment of chronic hepatitis C results in an average sustained viral response rate of
      54%-63%. We have found response rates of around 50% on treatment of patients. We hypothesize
      that by giving omega-3 fatty acids along with interferon therapy for patients with Hepatitis
      C, we may be able to increase the treatment response rates. Thus, the purpose of the study is
      to look at the effect of omega 3 fatty acids on early and sustained viral response rates in
      patients with chronic HCV infection.
