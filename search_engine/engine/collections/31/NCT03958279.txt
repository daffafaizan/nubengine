      dysfunction. The rise in progesterone related to pregnancy has an inhibitory effect on
      bladder smooth muscle - decreased smooth muscle tonus in lower urinary tract. Weight and
      pressure of pregnant uterus and loosening of some of the pelvic ligaments changes the statics
      of pelvic floor. In addition, delivery itself influence lower urinary tract; an
      overdistension of urinary bladder can occur easily, also as oedema of urethra or urethral
      hinge apparatus injury during "crowning" of the fetal head.

      All of these factors can affect consecutive function of lower urinary tract right after
      delivery. It is known that in 1,5% of women giving birth, symptomatic urinary retention
      develop in early postpartum period, with necessity of insertion of an indwelling catheter.
      Discussed risk factors are: epidural analgesia, instrumental delivery and primiparity. The
      investigators can assume that every woman in early postpartum period has (to some extend)
      even in normal circumstances postvoiding residual volume. There is few evidence in a
      literature about this postpartum residual volume and its predisposing factors.

      Postvoiding residual volume can be risk factor for postpartum urinary infection, which forms
      second largest part in infectious morbidity of women. By determination of risk factors (for
      increased post voiding residual volume) the investigators could narrow the group of women
      which necessitate increased attention in postpartal monitoring.
