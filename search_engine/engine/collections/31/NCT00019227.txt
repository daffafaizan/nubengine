        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of yttrium Y 90 daclizumab (90Y daclizumab) when
           combined with pentetic acid calcium in adults with Tac-expressing T-cell leukemia.

        -  Determine the therapeutic efficacy and toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Monitor patients treated on this regimen for circulating infused antibody (free and
           labeled) and for the serum concentration of soluble interleukin-2 receptor.

        -  Evaluate, in a preliminary manner, the immunogenicity of daclizumab.

        -  Determine the effect of 90Y daclizumab on various components of the circulating cellular
           immune system.

        -  Determine whether there is additional urinary excretion of yttrium Y 90 when compared to
           that observed previously in patients treated without pentetic acid calcium.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of yttrium Y 90 daclizumab (90Y daclizumab).

      Patients receive 90Y daclizumab IV over 2 hours on day 1 and a fixed dose of pentetic acid
      calcium IV over 5 hours for 3 days. Treatment repeats every 6 weeks for a maximum of 9
      courses in the absence of disease progression or circulating antibodies to humanized
      anti-Tac.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of 90Y daclizumab until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2
      of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicities. Additional patients are treated at the
      MTD.

      Patients are followed at 4-6 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Up to 15 patients will be accrued for the phase I portion of the study. A
      total of 30 patients will be accrued for the phase II portion of the study.
