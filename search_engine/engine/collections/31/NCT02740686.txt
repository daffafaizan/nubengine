      and functional capabilities. The effects of pulmonary rehabilitation (exercise) on immune
      function are unclear despite clear benefits of exercise on immune function in healthy
      individuals being identified. Moderate-intensity and frequency of exercise has been shown to
      decrease the risk of upper respiratory tract infections in healthy individuals in comparison
      to sedentary individuals. Respiratory infections, also known as exacerbations, in COPD are
      the main cause of hospitalisation and mortality. Therefore, if exercise can modulate immune
      function in COPD, it can be encouraged further in COPD to reduce hospitalisation risk.
      However, it is important to compare the effects of exercise amongst different phenotypes as
      frequent exacerbators are known to have elevated inflammatory markers, and may consequently
      respond to exercise differently to infrequent exacerbators, paving a rationale for a
      different approach to this subset of patients.
