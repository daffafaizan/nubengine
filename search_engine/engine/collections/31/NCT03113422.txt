      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and 22% of all cases of NHL. The survival rates for patients
      with indolent NHL remained unchanged from the 1950s through the early 1990s, but recent
      evidence suggests that outcomes continue to improve. High-risk patients with FL, defined as
      having advanced stage and high tumor burden have significantly shorter progression free
      survival despite significant advances.

      This is an open-label phase II study of venetoclax in combination with obinutuzumab and
      bendamustine. Patients will receive induction therapy with obinutuzumab and bendamustine for
      six cycles (1 cycle = 28 days). Venetoclax will start with 2nd cycle of induction therapy
      (previously started with cycle 1). There will be a formal, detailed toxicity evaluation after
      21 patients complete 3 cycles of treatment.

      Patients who achieve partial response or stable disease will receive therapy with
      obinutuzumab every 2 months for 12 cycles and venetoclax every month for 24 cycles. Patients
      who achieve a complete response will receive obinutuzumab every 2 months for 12 cycles.
      Patients with progressive disease will not continue onto the maintenance arm.

      Tumor assessments will be performed approximately every 12 weeks during induction and every 6
      months during maintenance therapy.

      Mandatory pre-treatment tumor tissue sample (i.e., obtained during a previous procedure or
      biopsy) will be required for research (if sufficient tissue is available). Optional tumor
      biopsy samples obtained during treatment or post-treatment will also be requested for
      research.
