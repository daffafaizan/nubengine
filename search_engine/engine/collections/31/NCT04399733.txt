      proportion of British Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) patients suffering from
      COVID-19 infections. This disproportionate level of infection and severity of disease has
      raised concerns and worries. Other research from April 2020 showed that 71% of the nurses and
      midwives and 94% of the doctors and dentists that died of COVID-19 infections were from a
      BAME background despite this group representing 20% and 44% of the workforce respectively.
      The survival picture is also grim for Black and Asian members of the public where we see
      disproportionately high rates of deaths. Research estimates that our DNA and the environment
      equally influence the risk for infection. This clinical study plans to better understand our
      DNA. Some of the things we will be looking at is age, sex, ethnicity and any illnesses such
      as diabetes or blood pressure. We will ask people for some spit and look at their medical
      records. This may help us find some of the reasons why this virus has different effects on
      people and how we might protect people from COVID-19.
