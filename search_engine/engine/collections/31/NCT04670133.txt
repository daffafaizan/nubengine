      tissues around the teeth, leading to a loss of connective tissue and the periodontal
      ligament, the resorption of alveolar bone and eventual tooth loss. Periodontal disease can
      also induce dysbiosis in the gut microbiome and contribute to low grade systemic
      inflammation. Prebiotic fibres such as inulin can selectively alter the intestinal microbiota
      to bring back a state of homeostasis by improving gut barrier functions and preventing
      inflammation. Through this mechanism, supplementation with inulin may be able to indirectly
      benefit periodontal health. The primary objective of this trial to determine if inulin
      supplementation, provided pre-sanative therapy (ST) through the healing phase (post-ST) is
      more effective than the placebo at improving clinical outcomes of periodontal health:
      decreasing both the number of sites with probing depths greater than or equal to 4 mm and
      increasing the absence of bleeding on probing (BOP). Secondary objectives include determining
      the effects of inulin supplementation pre- and post-ST on salivary markers of inflammation
      and periodontal-associated pathogens.
