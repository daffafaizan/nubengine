      fractures are supracondylar, lateral condylar, and medial epicondylar fractures. Elbow
      fractures are easy to diagnose and the treatment modalities are studied often. However,
      proximal radius fractures, which include radial neck and head fractures, remain challenging
      to diagnose and manage. In addition, proximal radius fractures are often combined with other
      fractures, most commonly, an olecranon fracture. Most radial neck fractures can be treated
      conservatively if the displacement is less than 3 mm and the angle is less than 30ยบ. However,
      for severe Judet type III and type IV radial neck fractures, surgery is inevitable.

      This study focused on radial neck fractures combined with an olecranon fracture. In this
      study, absorbable rods were used for fixation of radial head fractures, and with no need for
      removal of the inner fixation, we performed anatomy reduction via the same incision with
      direct vision of the olecranon, and we were able to fix the fractures with Kirschner wires
      (K-wires). In this retrospective study, we aimed to evaluate a treatment method for severe
      displaced radial neck combined with olecranon fractures in children using a Boyd incision,
      absorbable rods, and K-wires.
