    
      This is a randomized study in which two groups will be used to compare the effectiveness of a
      computerized psychological therapy compared to an information only control group (pamphlet)
      for reducing fear of dental injections. All patients (96 people with high fear of dental
      injections) will be tested to assess pre-existing dental fear levels prior to being assigned
      to study condition. Subsequently, patients in the active treatment group will complete
      computerized psychological therapy in 1 to 9 weekly 45-minute sessions. Subjects in the
      control condition will meet with a dental assistant once for approximately 15 minutes to go
      over a pamphlet. The pamphlet is based on written information developed by a commercial
      dental web site development company. Following the intervention or control procedures,
      patients will be reassessed for dental fear using computerized questionnaires. They will also
      be scheduled to receive a dental injection. Subjects' willingness to complete the dental
      injection and fear levels during the dental injection will be assessed.
