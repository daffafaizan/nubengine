      contrast agent stimuli prepared in three consistencies: thin, mildly-thick and
      moderately-thick. Subjects will undergo VFSS with simultaneous DDS using up to 5 boluses of
      thin barium stimulus ("THIN-Ba"), and up to 4 boluses of barium thickened to mildly
      ("MILD-Ba") thick and up to 4 boluses of moderately ("MODERATE-Ba") thick barium
      consistencies using Resource Thicken Up Clear Nestl√© Health Science (TUC). 4, 3 and 3 boluses
      for THIN-Ba, MILD-Ba and MOD-Ba will be analyzed using the classifier algorithms for
      sensitivity/specificity results. According to the exploratory trial, VFSS data for safety or
      efficiency can be missing for up to 14% boluses due to quality of VFSS recording. To
      compensate for potential losses of boluses due to missing gold standard (VFSS) data, 5, 4 and
      4 boluses will be collected for the three consistencies respectively . The DDS signals will
      be sent to a dedicated application software installed at the CRO, which interprets the
      acceleration data and displays the examination result. The VFSS recording will be sent to CRO
      and provided for blinded assessment by the independent central VFSS laboratory.The study
      procedure of simultaneous VFSS and DDS measurement will be completed in one day and the
      subject will be followed within 2 business days after the study procedure to monitor for
      adverse events.
