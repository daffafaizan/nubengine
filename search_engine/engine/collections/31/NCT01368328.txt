      of glucose and serum amino acids. Insulin resistance means a decrease in the ability of
      insulin to stimulate glucose utilization because is disabled in the insulin receptor,
      decrease in concentration of receptors or failure mechanism of cell transit. Recently, the
      discovery of a substance called low molecular weight chromium-binding substance (LMWCr),
      showed the ability of this substance in amplifying insulin signaling, increasing the
      sensitivity of insulin receptors in the plasma membrane. This way, the capacity of LMWCr in
      activating the insulin receptor depends on levels of serum chromium. Thus, the hypothesis
      that the nutritional status of individual poor chromium contributes to the decrease in
      glucose tolerance and consequently, for type 2 Diabetes. Thus, it becomes necessary to assess
      the effect of supplementation of chromium in increased insulin sensitivity in patients with
      type 2 Diabetes. This is a double-blind randomized clinical trial, consisting of a period of
      three months of nutritional intervention with chromium nicotinate, biochemical and
      anthropometric evaluation and assessment of food profile and physical activity.
