      involve a prospective and a retrospective component. A blood draw or saliva sample will be
      performed during the participant's admission to BCPP, which may occur at any point during the
      participant's length of stay. When a participant has been deemed 'Ready for Discharge' by
      his/her attending psychiatrist at BCPP, a full phenotype will be obtained via retrospective
      chart review. Genetic analyses and determination of protein levels will be performed after
      chart review. Following fulfillment of the primary study objective, the remaining blood and
      saliva samples will be stored in the biobank over the long-term.
