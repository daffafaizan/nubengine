      study the effects of omalizumab on patients with 2 or more episodes of Idiopathic Angioedema
      (IAE) in the past 6 months, despite current therapy. This study has three periods; screening,
      treatment, and follow-up. Subjects in the screening period will be consented and screened for
      eligibility criteria. 40 qualified individuals will enter the treatment period. Individuals
      will be randomized to either monthly subcutaneous administration of omalizumab 300mg (20
      subjects) versus monthly placebo injection (20 subjects) in addition to their previously
      prescribed management plan for a total of 6 months. Individuals will then enter a follow-up
      period of 4 months. Study visits will occur monthly during the treatment period for update of
      clinical status and administration of omalizumab/placebo injection. After, the treatment
      period individuals will be seen twice for follow-up period. The entire study will consist of
      10 study visits and will last approx. 10 months.
