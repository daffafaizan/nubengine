             1. comparing induction chemotherapy with Cisplatin + 5-Fluorouracil versus adjuvant
                chemotherapy with Cisplatin + 5-Fluorouracil(PF-Pvs P-PF)

             2. comparing induction chemotherapy with Cisplatin + Capecitabine versus adjuvant
                chemotherapy with Cisplatin + 5-Fluorouracil(PX-P vs P-PF)

             3. comparing accelerated fractionation versus conventional fractionation (AF vs
                CF)radiotherapy.

        2. secondary objectives include

             1. comparing induction chemotherapy with Cisplatin + Capecitabine versus induction
                chemotherapy with Cisplatin + 5-Fluorouracil(PX-P vs PX-P)

             2. Comparing concurrent-adjuvant (CA) versus induction-concurrent (IC) chemotherapy
                sequence.
