      and whose course is relatively rapid (median survival 3 years after diagnosis). Palliative
      care, including symptom management, can contribute greatly to improved quality of life. In
      this context, alleviation of fatigue can help maintain function, extend the duration of time
      when employment is feasible for those still working, and can enable patients to more fully
      participate in and enjoy social and recreational activities. Given the prevalence of fatigue
      in this population, identification of effective treatment is a meaningful goal.
