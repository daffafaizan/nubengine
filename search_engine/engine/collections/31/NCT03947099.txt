      shown to lead to increased incidence of post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and increased
      risk of suicide in prehospital personnel. In recent years a growing body of literature has
      shown that ketamine hydrochloride can be an effective treatment for PTSD. This study seeks to
      look specifically at paramedic level emergency medical technicians ("paramedics") with PTSD
      related to their prehospital work and assess whether ketamine infusion therapy can be an
      effective treatment for them. This is an observational study where the results of
      psychological screening tools that are administered before and after a six-infusion series
      are reported. Additionally the same assessment tools will be administered again 30 days after
      the final treatment to measure the durability of any changes. The participants will receive
      the Periodic Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), the PTSD Checklist for Diagnostic and
      Statistical Manual, DSM-5 (PCL-5), the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), and
      the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) before the infusions, after the series of six, and thirty
      days later. Additionally, after the series of six infusions, participants will receive the
      Revised Mystical Experience Questionnaire-30 (RMEQ-30) and a one question survey to assess
      the impact of the experiential aspect of ketamine.
