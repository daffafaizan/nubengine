    
      The syndrome of "amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment" (aMCI) has been introduced for patients
      with intact activities of daily living, with a memory complaint and objective memory decline
      on neuropathological assessment, without significative change in other domains of cognition.
      Follow-up in these patients shows that the memory impairment may remain stable or improve,
      while it worsens or extends to other cognitive domains in others, indicating prodromal AD.
