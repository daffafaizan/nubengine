      About 75% of pancreatitis is caused by gallstones or alcohol. The Atlanta classification of
      acute pancreatitis has been used to differentiate between severe and mild cases of acute
      pancreatitis. According to this classification, patients are diagnosed with severe acute
      pancreatitis if they show evidence of organ failure, Local complications (eg, necrosis,
      abscess, pseudocyst), Ranson score of 3 or higher or APACHE score of 8 or higher. Severe
      acute pancreatitis has a wide range of affection on nearly all body systems with various
      degrees of affection than affect both the clinical picture and the prognosis of the disease.
      the cardiovascular system involvement has been described before ,in the form of ECG changes
      (sinus tachycardia, arrhythmias, conduction abnormalities.. ) and echocardiographic findings
      (diastolic,systolic or combined dysfunction, wall motion abnormalities, pericardial
      effusion..). However the correlation between these changes and the outcome of acute
      pancreatitis has not been and whether they can be used to predict mortality in these patients
      has been controversial.In the current study our aim is to detect echocardioghraphic and ECG
      changes in acute pancreatitis and investigate the significance of these changes on prognosis.
