      Computerized Decision Support System for depression (CDSS-D) during acute care in a primary
      care setting. The basic experimental design was a two-group, two-site study design. Three
      different clinics with a total of 4 primary care physicians agreed and provided informed
      consent and participated in the study. Half of the physicians used the CDSS-D to treat
      patients with MDD and the other half provided Usual Care (UC) treatment.

      The intervention, CDSS-D, incorporated a pre-existing depression treatment algorithm (Texas
      Medication Algorithm Project for Depression, Trivedi et al) with computer decision support
      programming, providing the treatment group physicians with a computerized algorithm.
