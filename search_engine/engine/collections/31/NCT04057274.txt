      mechanisms underpinning the anti-cancer effect of exercise are not yet fully understood. A
      recent theory suggests that each time you exercise, the short-lasting spikes in circulating
      hormones can suppress the growth of cancer cells. Hence, every exercise bout could have a
      direct anti-cancer effect.

      This study will recruit men with an increased of colon cancer and explore whether incubating
      colon cancer cells with serum collected after a bout of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise
      influences cell viability in vitro.
