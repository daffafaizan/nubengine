      18 years, referred to Dental Clinic of the San Raffaele University, with a single failing
      tooth in the upper and lower jaw from second premolar to second premolar, candidates for a
      single implant restoration. After local anesthesia, a split-full-split thickness envelope
      flap, as described for the treatment of multiple gingival recessions by Zucchelli and de
      Sanctis (2000), will be elevated and the tooth will be extracted a-traumatically. The
      immediate implantation procedure will be carried out according to the manufacture protocol
      and 1mm of the transmucosal portion of the implant will be positioned under the buccal bone
      crest. In the group "Implant+CTG" a connective tissue graft (CTG), resulting from the
      extraoral de-epithelialization with the knife blade of a free gingival graft harvested from
      the palate, will be anchored at the anatomic papillae with 2 horizontal mattress sutures and
      positioned 1 mm coronal to the buccal bone crest and in the apical direction 2 mm above the
      buccal crest. Patients will be followed for 6 months after implant placement and 6 months
      after loading.
