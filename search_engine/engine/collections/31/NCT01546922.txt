           considered physiological for patients with adrenal insufficiency. However, it is likely
           that cognition is negatively influenced by higher cortisol exposure to the brain. No
           studies have been performed to assess the effects of treatment regimens with a low
           physiological HC substitution dose on cognition in comparison to a high physiological HC
           substitution dose. These treatment regimens should take body weight and multiple dosing
           into account. In addition, substitution doses should be monitored by clinical evaluation
           and biochemical analysis for adverse effects associated with over- or under-replacement.

        -  Intervention: Patients with secondary adrenal insufficiency will be randomized in two
           groups to receive either a low dose HC (0.2-0.3 mg/kg body weight) for 10 weeks followed
           by 10 weeks of high dose HC (0.4-0.6 mg/kg body weight) or vice versa. At baseline and
           after both treatment periods, patients will be tested.
