      following an aggression. There are intracytoplasmic multiprotein complex activated by
      cellular stress or infections and is responsible for the release of pro-inflammatory
      cytokines, including IL-1Î². One study focused on the role of the NLRP3 inflammasome in
      monocyte during sepsis has shown its early alteration that is correlated with mortality. Most
      studies have analysed inflammasomes in nucleated cells, nevertheless, little is known about
      inflammasomes in platelets. The aim of the study is to analyze the activation of NLRP3
      inflammasome in platelets and leukocytes during sepsis, from patients hospitalized in
      intensive care unit compare to a control group, until its resolution to better understand the
      pathophysiology of sepsis
