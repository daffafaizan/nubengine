    
      This is a Phase 2, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study to
      evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a 2-injection vaccine regimen (Day 0 and 28) with
      Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) virus-like particle vaccine (CHIKV VLP, VRC-CHKVLP059-00-VP) in
      healthy adults ages 18-60 years old that reside in CHIKV endemic regions.

      The hypothesis is that the vaccine regimen is safe and induces a neutralizing antibody
      response to CHIKV. The primary objectives are to evaluate safety and tolerability of a
      2-injection investigational vaccine regimen of VRC-CHKVLP059-00-VP at 20 mcg compared to
      placebo (PBS) in healthy adults in CHIKV endemic areas. The secondary objective is to
      evaluate neutralizing antibody response in vaccine recipients. The exploratory objectives
      relate to assessing incidence of CHIKV infection in vaccine and placebo recipients, as well
      as antigen-specific humoral and cellular immune responses during the study.

      The expected study duration per subject is approximately 72 weeks with intramuscular (IM)
      injections scheduled at Day 0 and Day 28.
