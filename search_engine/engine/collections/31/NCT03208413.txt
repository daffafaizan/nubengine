      (RI). Glucocorticoids and bevacizumab during acute period are optional ways to reduce the
      brain edema. However, glucocorticoids and bevacizumab are unsuitable or ineffective for some
      patients, especially in the early stage of RI. The investigators supposed that angiogenesis
      might play a key role in the pathogenesis of RI, and that thalidomide, as an antiangiogenic
      drug, would reduce immature angiogenesis and improve vessel maturation in RI.

      Primary objectives: This phase II clinical trial aims to evaluate the indications,
      therapeutic effects and safety of thalidomide in radiation-induced brain injury.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase II, open-label, single arm clinical trial. Patients are enrolled and
      administrated with thalidomide. Thalidomide is supplied as 25 mg per pill to be taken by
      mouth.

      Arm Ð†: Patients receive thalidomide with a dosage of 25 mg at bedtime daily one week (days
      1-7), then 50 mg at bedtime daily for one week (days 8-14), then 75 mg at bedtime daily for
      one week (days 15-21), then 100 mg at bedtime daily for 12 weeks (days 22-105), in the
      absence of unacceptable toxicity or severe deterioration.
