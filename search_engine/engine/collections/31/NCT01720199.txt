    
      Diario della Salute (DDS) is a school-based prevention intervention based on the following
      theories:

        1. social-cognitive theory (Bandura, 1977; 1986)

        2. theory of multiple intelligences (Gardner, 1987)

        3. emotional intelligence theory (Goleman, 1997)

        4. theory of planned behavior (Ajzen, 1991)

        5. transtheoretical model of change (Prochaska, Diclemente, 1982; 1992).

      DDS is composed by:

        1. tools for children and their parents on health and social and emotional well-being
           issues:

             1. a diary for teens telling the story of four same-age students (e.g. experimenting
                with risky behaviors, conflicting feelings and thoughts, need for independence and
                control),

             2. a diary for parents telling the experience of a mum and a dad with teenage children
                (e.g. problems in the relationship with teenage children, family conflict, parental
                disappointment, etc.);

        2. five highly-standardized interactive lessons (2-4 hours each) on health issues
           administered by previously trained teachers.

      Assignment of schools to study arms (DDS intervention vs. no intervention) will be
      cluster-randomized. Schools will be matched by number of students and average socioeconomic
      status. In some study areas schools will not be allocated by chance, but they will be
      analyzed separately from other schools.

      Two anonymous surveys focusing on main outcomes (wellbeing, tobacco smoking, alcohol,
      physical activity and diet) will be before and after the intervention. Pre and post surveys
      will be linked through an anonymous code (Galanti, 2006).
