      patients with advanced NSCLC previously sensitive to erlotinib. After six patients are
      enrolled and complete one treatment cycle a safety analysis of adverse events (AEs) will be
      conducted to assure there are no unexpected or prohibitive toxicities of the combination. The
      planned study enrollment will continue to up to 37 patients. Duration of a patient's
      participation in the study will vary. Treatment will continue as long as the patient is
      benefitting from the treatment, has no evidence of disease progression, and does not meet any
      criteria for discontinuation or withdrawal.
