      enhancing brain tissue and cerebrospinal fluid from people with BRAF-V600E mutant recurrent
      gliomas who undergo tumor resection. The exploratory goals are to measure the amount of ERK
      signaling pathway activity, to identify mechanisms of resistance to these drugs, and evaluate
      feasibility of measuring tumor DNA in cerebrospinal fluid.

      People (adults or children) with brain tumors who are already taking dabrafenib and / or
      trametinib and are in need of a surgical resection are potentially eligible. On the day of
      surgery, blood, cerebrospinal fluid, and tumor tissue will be collected for research
      purposes.
