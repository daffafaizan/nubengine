      oxygen treatment (barring contraindications for hyperbaric oxygen therapy). After this
      treatment, eligible patients who provide consent will be randomly allocated to receive two
      sham sessions, or two additional hyperbaric oxygen sessions administered in a double-blind
      fashion.

      Outcome measures will be administered at 6 weeks and 6 months.
