      children after overnight fasting and to what extend the stores are replenished with the
      intake of small breakfast.

      The study is a balanced incomplete crossover design. Participants (children between 8 and 12
      years old) have to be two periods of two days in the study. They will be randomized in 6
      arms, receiving either water, 1 serving of a small breakfast (Breakfast 1) or 2 servings of
      the small breakfast (Breakfast 2).

      An Interim Analysis after 9 completed subjects will be performed in order to calculate the
      total number of subjects needed to adequately power the Primary Endpoint.
