      weakening. The cause is unknown. There is new evidence to suggest that the pathology in IBM
      results from cellular changes induced by a variety of stressful events and diseases. In
      response to these stressful events the body's normal response is to increase the levels of
      Heat Shock Proteins (HSP) to help counteract and stop these cellular changes. In people with
      IBM this increase does not appear sufficient enough to reverse these toxic cellular changes.
      Arimoclomol causes the body to make more of this HSP protein. By increasing HSP levels in IBM
      patients we hope to reverse the toxic cellular changes that might be responsible for the
      pathology of IBM.
