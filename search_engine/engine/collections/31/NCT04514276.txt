      risk of fetal growth restriction (FGR) or pre-eclampsia will be improved and, therefore the
      occurence of children's health problems may be prevented.The pathway allows healthcare to be
      structured, ross-sectoral, inter- and multidisciplinary in consideration of medical and
      psychosocial imensions. The feto-neonatal pathway transfers scientific findings, which
      already determine international routine care, in the project region into clinical routine
      care. The anamnestically increased risk for FGR or pre-eclampsia is validated by ultrasound
      and the identified high-risk pregnancy is attended risk-adapted from birth until the end of
      the first year of life of the child.As a result, the mothers' pregnancy-related risks (death,
      premature delivery, traumatic stress disorders) as well as risks for the child (prematurity
      and associated problems, childhood growth restriction with the risk of metabolic syndrome,
      developmental neurological problems) are reduced and the sustainability of the interventions
      is ensured in the long term through improved health competence of the families. The
      feto-neonatal pathway shows how highly specialised fetoneonatal care of high-risk pregnancies
      can be ensured while ensuring primary care in a health region, and offers the possibility of
      being extended to other indications.
