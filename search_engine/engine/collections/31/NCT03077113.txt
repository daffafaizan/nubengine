      4D-CT imaging will correlate with the current low resolution state-of-the-art (SPECT-CT),
      which is the conventional way of measuring ventilation. HRVI may be a tool that could be
      widely used throughout the radiation therapy community because most radiation oncologists
      routinely employ 4D-CT technology in their own clinics. Investigators plan to test this
      hypothesis by comparing ventilation patterns on SPECT-CT images to HRVIs using a DICE
      analysis. As SPECT ventilation imaging is not included in our standard care, this study thus
      is designed as a pilot study.

      Based on published data, the difference between the two methods for calculating the regional
      ventilation in the lower 50% ventilation volume is expected to have a standard deviation of
      about 0.1. Therefore, the 95% confidence interval for the difference in the regional
      ventilation between SPECT-CT and 4D-CT pre-treatment would have a width of no more than 0.14
      if 10 patients are enrolled and as small as 0.10 when 20 patients are registered.
