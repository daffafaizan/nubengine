      prior prostate biopsy will be enrolled from the University of Illinois (UI) Health Urology
      clinics. All eligible men will be screened and enrolled by the clinical research coordinator.
      Enrolled men will undergo detection protocol MRI at the UIC Advanced Imaging Center (AIC)
      prior to diagnostic biopsy. The MRI will be processed by the study team and evaluated for
      areas suspicious for high grade PCa by a board certified clinical radiologist. Subjects with
      MRI with no suspicious areas for high grade PCa will undergo standard of care (SOC) core
      transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) biopsy. Subject with MRI suspicious for high grade PCa will
      have 2-4 biopsies guided toward each suspicious lesion using MRI/TRUS fusion biopsies
      (maximum of 12 cores). All biopsies will undergo SOC histologic processing and interpretation
      in pathology. Biopsy results will be communicated to the patients by the Urologist performing
      the biopsy and all additional management will be SOC. This visit will signify the end of the
      study
