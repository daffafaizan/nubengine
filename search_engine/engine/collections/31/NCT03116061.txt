      appointments in their offices from July to December 2014. Inclusion criteria were those of
      the EGPRN definition of Multimorbidity. Exclusion criteria were patients under legal
      protection and those unable to complete the 2-year follow-up. Decompensation was defined as
      the occurrence of death or hospitalization for more than seven days. Statistical analysis was
      undertaken with uni- and multivariate analysis at a 6-month follow-up using a combination of
      approaches including both automatic classification and expert decision making. A Multiple
      Correspondence Analysis (MCA) confirmed results consistency and completed the process with a
      projection of illustrative variables. A logistic regression was finally performed in order to
      identify and quantify risk factors for decompensation.
