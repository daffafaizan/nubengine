      weeks. Subjects will be randomized to two treatment groups: Group 1- Spatz3 adjustable
      balloon 12-month implantation; and Group 2 - non adjustable 6-month implantation with
      additional 6 months of dietician follow-up after balloon extraction. Fourth four eligible
      subjects will be randomized to treatment groups 1 and 2 and will undergo endoscopy and
      implantation of either the Spatz3 Adjustable Balloon or the 6-month non adjustable Balloon.
      All subjects will follow a calorie restricted diet designed by the dietician. The initial
      diet will be liquid and will be advanced as per the dietician's recommendations. Changes in
      diet will depend on subject tolerance to the balloon and specific food intolerances and will
      be adjusted frequently by the dietician. The initial balloon volume will be 500 ml of 0.9%
      normal saline with 2 ml of a 1% solution of methylene blue. An adjustment will be performed
      for treatment Group 1 at Week 24 (Â±6 weeks) with the addition of 200-300 ml of 0.9% normal
      saline, as per section 1.6.2.1.3.3. The balloon adjustment procedure is done with an
      endoscopy procedure under the same sedation as the implantation procedure. The subjects will
      have follow up by the PI/Nurse Practitioner and the Dietician/Nutritionist periodically as
      per section 1.7.3. until extraction at 52 weeks. The 6-month non adjustable balloon treatment
      group will undergo balloon extraction at 6 months followed by monthly dietician vists for an
      additional 6 months. The study will terminate at the end of 12 months.
