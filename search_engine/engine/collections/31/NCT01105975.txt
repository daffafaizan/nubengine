      greater than or equal to 150 milligram/deciliter (mg/dL), HDL-C (<45 or greater than or equal
      to 45 mg/dL for men; <50 or greater than or equal to 50 mg/dL for women), and region (United
      States or Europe). After a diet lead-in and prior therapy washout phase, subjects meeting all
      entry criteria will be randomized to one of 10 double-blind treatment groups for a 12 week
      treatment phase. After randomization, patients will self-administer the study drugs once a
      day with a low fat meal as their first meal of the day.
