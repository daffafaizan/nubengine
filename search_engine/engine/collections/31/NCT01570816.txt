      correct hip, knee and ankle function. The electrode leads are connected to an implanted pulse
      generator located in the abdomen. After a typical post-operative period of two to five days,
      the recipient will be discharged home for two to six weeks of moderate activity. Following a
      6 week period of laboratory exercise and training, functional use of the neuroprosthesis will
      begin at home and in the community with follow-up evaluations at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months.
      Laboratory assessments include walking speed and distance, physiologic cost, muscle strength,
      measure of spasticity, and gait analysis with and without stimulation. A number of
      self-reporting instruments are administered to capture individual's participation, quality of
      life and various aspects of perceived community ambulation.
