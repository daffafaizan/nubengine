      brain metabolism, brain activation patterns, and fibre tracks in patients with traumatic CCS.
      The objective of this preliminary study is to evaluate metabolic changes, brain activation
      pattern reorganization and altered spinal cord fibre tracks in patients suffering from
      traumatic CCS to gain a better understanding of the natural history of this condition.
      Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and
      diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) will be used to investigate the changes in brain metabolite
      concentrations, cerebral cortical activation, and fibre tract anatomy, respectively, in
      patients and controls.

      Ten patients having traumatic CCS will be recruited from the Clinical Neurological Sciences
      Department at the London Health Sciences Centre, University Campus. All participants will
      undergo an fMRI, MRS and DTI scan of the motor cortex to measure the volume of activation,
      signal intensity and levels of NAA and glutamate. The CCS participants will have three scans,
      one acutely (up to 48 hours after injury), one subacutely (15 days after injury), and one
      late (6 months after injury). Healthy volunteers will have two scans six months apart to
      determine reproducibility.

      Clinical changes will be measured using validated disease specific scoring instruments
      including the Japanese Orthopedic Association scale (JOA), ASIA/ISCOS Impairment Scale, and
      the Neck Disability Index (NDI). General quality of life will be measured using the 36-item
      Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36). A blinded investigator will administer these instruments
      prior to the scan at all time points.
