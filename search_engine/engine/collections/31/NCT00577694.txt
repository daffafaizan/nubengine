      Primary

        -  Identify the maximum tolerated dose and dose-limiting toxicities of clofarabine when
           administered with gemtuzumab ozogamicin in patients with refractory acute myeloid
           leukemia (AML) or with AML that has relapsed within 1 year after cytarabine-containing
           therapy.

      Secondary

        -  Estimate the rates of complete response and/or partial complete response with incomplete
           platelet recovery in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Estimate the duration of remission in patients treated with this regimen and not
           proceeding to high-dose therapy and allogeneic stem cell transplantation.

        -  Estimate the frequency with which patients enrolled on this study proceed to allogeneic
           or autologous blood or bone marrow stem cell transplantation.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of clofarabine.

      Patients receive induction therapy comprising clofarabine IV on days 1-5 and gemtuzumab
      ozogamicin IV over 2 hours on days 1, 4, and 7 during course 1 only. Beginning in course 2,
      after blood counts recover, patients receive consolidation therapy comprising clofarabine IV
      on days 1-5. Consolidation treatment repeats upon blood count recovery for up to 2 courses in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients in remission after consolidation therapy are
      followed monthly for the first 6 months, and then every 3-4 months for 2 years.
