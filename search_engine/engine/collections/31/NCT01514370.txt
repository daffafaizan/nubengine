    
      The subjects must experience at least one Gadolinium (GD) enhancing Magnetic Resonance
      Imaging (MRI) lesion at the baseline visit or one Multiple Sclerosis (MS) relapse in the last
      6 months before the screening visit.

      Randomization, in a 1:1 ratio, will be done with two arms:

      40 subjects with Interferon (IFN) beta 1 a 44 mcg TIW + Curcumin (BCM 95) and 40 subjects
      with IFN beta-1a 44 mcg TIW + placebo.

      The study will last 42 months: 18 months of enrolment and 24 months of treatment period.

      The study consists of 6 visits per subject: screening visit (Visit 0), baseline (Visit 1), a
      visit 3 months after baseline (Visit 2), 6 months after baseline (Visit 3), 12 months after
      baseline (Visit 4) and 24 months after baseline (Visit 5).
