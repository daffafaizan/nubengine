      Macroglobulinemia (WM) who failed chemotherapy. After baseline evaluations, patients receive
      epratuzumab infused over approximately 30-60 minutes at 360 mg/m2, administered once weekly
      for 4 consecutive weeks (days 1, 8, 15, 22). Post-treatment evaluations occur on the day of
      the last infusion, then at 6 and 12 weeks. Patients without progression of disease continue
      long-term follow up until disease progression or for at least 5 years, with evaluations every
      3 months for 2 years, then semi-annually. Otherwise, follow-up is only required until
      resolution of any treatment related abnormalities.
