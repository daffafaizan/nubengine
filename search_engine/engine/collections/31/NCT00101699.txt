      North American counterparts. One explanation for the disparity is the differences in diet.
      Evidence suggests that Japanese women consume large amounts of soy, a phytoestrogen that is
      structurally similar to the hormone estrogen. However, there is a lack of menopause-related
      research data from non-Western populations. This study will be a long-term observation of the
      effects of soy consumption in menopausal Japanese women.

      This study will last 6 months. Participants will complete a dietary log and a menopausal
      symptom checklist daily. There will be three or four study visits. During these visits,
      participants will complete a diet questionnaire, have a blood sample collected, and be
      interviewed about their menopausal symptoms. Six months after study completion, participants
      will be sent a questionnaire about any recent menopausal symptoms they may have experienced.
