      with 1060nm diode laser and radio frequency for use in aesthetic dermatological procedures
      requiring the ablation, excision, incision, or coagulation of soft tissue. Efficacy will be
      analyzed through histological and molecular analysis. Safety will be analyzed by monitoring
      the occurrence of any adverse events.
