        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of intrathecal busulfan by a limited escalation
           dosage schedule in patients with recurrent or refractory leptomeningeal tumors.

        -  Determine the cerebrospinal fluid and serum pharmacokinetics of busulfan administered
           via intralumbar or intraventricular routes in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive intrathecal busulfan via intralumbar or intraventricular routes twice a week
      for 2 weeks (4 treatments). Any patient with objective or significant clinical response may
      continue treatment by receiving the same dose once a week for 2 consecutive weeks, once a
      week every other week for 3 weeks (2 treatments), and then once a month thereafter until
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of intrathecal busulfan until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2
      of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 12 weeks for 1 year or until disease progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 5-20 patients will be accrued for this study within 1-2 years.
