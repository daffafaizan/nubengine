      of choice in patients suffering from primary insomnia, allowing to obtain a long term (2
      years) sleep quality improvements in 62% of patients. Yoga is another behavioral therapy that
      have shown benefits in patients suffering from anxiety disorders. Few studies have been
      focused on yoga benefits in sleep disorders. The purpose of the study is to assess the
      effects of regular Viniyoga on sleep quality (subjective and objective) in patients suffering
      from primary insomnia.
