    
      This is a planned open-label prospective clinical trial to determine the safety of applying
      dilute bleach compresses to pediatric patients being treated for rhabdomyosarcoma and other
      soft tissue and bone sarcomas with radiation therapy (RT).

      This study is interested in finding out whether dilute bleach compresses are safe to apply
      and evaluating their impact on the frequency and severity of skin changes that occur in
      children who are receiving radiation therapy for cancer treatment.

      This information may help treat other patients receiving radiation therapy for cancer
      treatment in the future.

      The research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment including
      weekly evaluations and follow up visits

      Participants will receive study treatment throughout their radiation therapy and for one week
      after. They will be followed for one month after the completion of radiation.

      It is expected that about 12 people will take part in this research study.
