    
      This study is a double-blind, placebo controlled, randomized study to explore the effects of
      gabapentin peri and post operatively. Physician and families will be blinded to the
      treatment.

      60 subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either:

        -  Gabapentin treatment group

        -  Placebo - control group

      We aim to understand the impact that gabapentin use peri and post operatively has on:

        1. opioid use based of IV morphine

        2. pain scores

        3. opioid related complications such as withdrawal

        4. effects on the level of sedation

        5. Possible adverse effects associated with use of gabapentin

        6. Time to extubating

      The duration of an individual subject's participation in the study will be 7 days or until
      the patient is discharged from UC Davis Hospital, whichever occurs first.
