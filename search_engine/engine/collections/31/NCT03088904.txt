      are given licensed seasonal influenza vaccine. There are no exclusions for gender, ethnicity
      or race. The volunteers will be enrolled into one of 3 groups:

      Group A: Up to 40 healthy monozygotic (MZ) twin volunteers, 12-49 years old, will be given
      inactivated influenza vaccine quadrivalent (IIV4). Each volunteer will complete a total of 3
      visits: Day 0 (pre-immunization), Day 6-8 and Day 28+ 7 post-immunization. All visits will
      consist of drawing blood for study assays and monitoring for serious adverse events (SAEs).

      Group B: Up to 40 healthy dizygotic (DZ) twin volunteers, 12-49 years old, will be given
      inactivated influenza vaccine quadrivalent (IIV4). Each volunteer will complete a total of 3
      visits: Day 0 (pre-immunization), Day 6-8 and Day 28+7 post-immunization. All visits will
      consist of drawing blood for study assays and monitoring for serious adverse events (SAEs).

      Group C: Up to 40 healthy monozygotic (MZ) twin volunteers, 12-49 years old, will be
      randomized within the twin pair to receive either inactivated influenza vaccine quadrivalent
      (IIV4) or live, attenuated influenza vaccine quadrivalent (LAIV4). Each volunteer will
      complete a total of 3 visits: Day 0 (pre-immunization), Day 6-8 and Day 28+7
      post-immunization. All visits will consist of drawing blood for study assays and monitoring
      for serious adverse events (SAEs). This group was terminated in 2016 due to ACIP
      recommendations against the use of LAIV but was reopened in 2018 with the availability of
      LAIV4.

      Each twin is counted as a single participant. All reporting numbers reflect the number of
      participants, not the number of twin pairs.
