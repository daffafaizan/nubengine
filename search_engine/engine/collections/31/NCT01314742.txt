      ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). As the fatality rates for VAP are high, prevention of
      VAP has focused on the use of "VAP bundles". Oral decontamination, by reducing the microbial
      burden within a patient's oral cavity, is an essential part of VAP bundle strategy for
      reducing VAP rates in mechanically ventilated adults and older children. However there are no
      published studies of oral care products for VAP prevention in mechanically ventilated
      neonates. Biotene OralBalance® gel contains antibacterial active ingredients, including
      lactoperoxidase, lysozyme and lactoferrin,all enzymes with bacteriostatic or bactericidal
      activity on selective oral microflora. We hypothesize that by directly reducing the oral
      microbial burden, we indirectly reduce the number of VAP. This will be reflected in the
      reduced time on mechanical ventilation in the group of infants receiving Biotene OralBalance®
      gel.

      This is a prospective, randomized, unmasked, controlled trial with 40 mechanically ventilated
      infants recruited from level IV nursery at Forsyth Medical Center, Winston-Salem, NC. The
      participants will be randomized to two equal groups, stratified by gestational age
      categories: <28 weeks, and >=28 weeks as well as multiple births. Twenty infants will receive
      Biotene OralBalance® gel (Intervention Group) and 20 infants will receive swabs with sterile
      water (Control Group) for timed oral care. Both study groups will receive the NICU standard
      ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) bundle, a combination of strategies aimed to reduce the
      rate of VAP.
