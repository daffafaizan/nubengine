    
      The goal of this mixed-methods, two-arm, randomized controlled trial of MI intervention for
      fall prevention is to evaluate the impact of Motivational Interviewing (MI) as a follow-up
      care to patients who received fall prevention recommendations at Oregon Health & Science
      University Internal Medicine and Geriatrics Clinic provided over 12-months. Older adult
      participants (older than 65) who are at increased risk for falling will be enrolled into the
      study. Patients will be randomly assigned to two groups: MI and the standard of care group.
      All participants will have a baseline and 6-months study visit that will include self-report
      and physiologic assessment. In addition, all participants will receive study measurement
      phone call at 3-, and 12-months. MI will be provided via video, phone, or in-person one week
      after the initial visit and then monthly for 6 months. All MI sessions will be recorded and
      encounter notes will be completed. Purposefully selected participants' MI sessions will be
      transcribed for qualitative analysis.
