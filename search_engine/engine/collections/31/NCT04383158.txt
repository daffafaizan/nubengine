    
      Randomised, controlled, single-centre, prospective, parallel-group qualitative pilot study.
      Objectives: the study aims to characterise wound healing events in the dental extraction
      socket with and without plasma rich in growth factors (PRGF) taking place during early days
      of healing after a dental extraction and their relation to clinical and histological outcomes
      after 90 days of healing. The early healing events of the post-extraction socket will be
      characterized in terms of volumetric changes in relation to intra-oral thermographic changes,
      blood flowgraphy, molecular (proteomic) changes, as well as extra-oral integrated geometric
      thermographic changes in tandem with clinical measures of soft tissue healing, post-operative
      pain assessment. The early healing events will be analysed in relation to volumetric,
      clinical and histomorphometric changes of new bone formation after 90 days of healing during
      dental implant treatment. Dental Implant outcomes will be evaluated up to 12 months after
      loading.

      Duration: Overall, we anticipate that the study will last approximately 28 months. We
      estimate a 3-month study set-up period, followed by a recruitment period of 6 months. Each
      participant will attend 14 visits over approximately 18-19 months. The first 9 visits involve
      a dental extraction and follow-up until 90 days after extraction to obtain a bone core biopsy
      and dental implant placement. Visits 10 to 14 will be for restoring the dental implant and
      evaluating dental implant treatment outcomes.
