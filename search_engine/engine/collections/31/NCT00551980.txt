      the treatment of different types of headache and cervical pain. However the evidence on their
      effectiveness is still limited and the results of recent studies are conflicting.

      In a previous non-randomized-controlled study in which the cognitive and physical programme
      was applied to a consistent number of office workers, a significant reduction of frequency of
      pain in the head and neck areas and of analgesic drug consumption was obtained. The present
      study was designed to confirm the data in a much more extensive working population and
      applying a randomised design.

      The primary objective is to confirm the effectiveness of a workplace cognitive and physical
      programme (Intervention), in reducing the frequency of pain involving the head and neck area
      in a large working community using a randomized design.The Intervention consists of brief
      shoulder and neck exercises to be performed several times a day, a relaxation exercise and
      instructions of how to reduce parafunction and hyperfunction of the craniofacial and cervical
      muscles during the day.

      Secondary objectives:

      To confirm the effectiveness of the Intervention, in reducing the intensity of pain involving
      the head and neck area in a large working community using a randomized design.

      To confirm the reduction in analgesic drugs consumption after the Intervention in a large
      working community using a randomized design.

      To evaluate the persistence of the effectiveness of the Intervention after 12 months in a
      large working community using a randomized design.

      Comparison(s): Group of employees that will receive a cognitive/physical programme
      (Intervention), compared to a similar group of employees that will not receive the
      Intervention (Controls); (frequency of headache and neck and shoulder pain).
