      has been associated with poor outcomes (e.g. difficulty breathing). Pulmonary rehabilitation
      (PR) initiated shortly after hospital discharge following a COPD exacerbation has been shown
      to improve some of these outcomes. However, for many patients, access to PR programs is
      limited due to environmental, physical, and psycho-social reasons. Home-based physical
      activity promotion, combined with education and social support, could help to overcome some
      barriers to access and have been shown to be effective in populations with mild to moderate
      COPD. However, home-based interventions have not been tested in patients recovering from COPD
      exacerbations, a group for whom solutions to safely promote physical activity are urgently
      needed. In PACE2 up to 64 adult participants with a physician diagnosis of COPD will be
      enrolled and randomized to one of two groups: physical activity promotion intervention or
      enhanced usual care. Participants will be enrolled while hospitalized and randomization will
      occur approximately 7 days after hospital discharge. All participants will be provided
      self-management educational materials and community resources both prior to hospital
      discharge and during a home visit shortly after hospital discharge. For the participants
      randomized to the intervention group, physical activity promotion will start following
      randomization and continue for 12 weeks. These participants will also receive a personalized
      plan to attend pulmonary rehabilitation, a guideline-recommended program for patients with
      COPD recovering from exacerbations. The primary endpoint will be the change in physical
      activity (mean daily step counts over 1 week) over time using repeated measures over the 12
      weeks of the study.
