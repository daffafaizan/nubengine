      4 weeks of neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) training. Participants will be
      randomized into the one of two groups 1) NMES-millicurrent or 2) NMES microcurrent.
      Participants will undergo pre- and post-training testing for muscle function, physical
      function, and psychological variables related to physical activity. Blood samples will also
      be obtained pre- and post-training.
