      Treatment with statins has a class I indication after percutaneous coronary intervention
      (PCI), but is often discontinued by patients due to side effects.

      Pharmacologic alternatives shown to be useful after PCI include ezetimibe and nutraceuticals
      (i.e. compounds derived from foods with cholesterol lowering actions).

      It remains unknown, however, which of these two therapeutic approaches is more effective
      after PCI.

      Purpose

      The primary objective of this study is to compare the efficacy and tolerability of ezetimibe
      versus a nutraceutical-based protocol in statin-intolerant patients treated with percutaneous
      coronary intervention.
