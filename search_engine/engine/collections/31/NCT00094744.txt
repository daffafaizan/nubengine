      and middle-aged adults. Patching has been the mainstay of amblyopia therapy. It is generally
      held that the response to treatment is best when it is instituted at an early age,
      particularly by age two or three, and is poor when attempted after eight years of age.

      For severe amblyopia, it is generally accepted that occlusion with patching is the standard
      of care. Other modalities of treatment, such as atropine penalization and optical
      penalization, are widely considered insufficient as initial treatments for severe amblyopia.
      However, controversy exists with regard to how many hours per day of patching should be
      prescribed. Advocates of full-time patching purport that such a regimen is needed to restore
      visual acuity more rapidly and more effectively. Advocates of part-time patching believe it
      to be better tolerated by the child and family, therefore producing less stress on the
      parent-child relationship and producing better results through better compliance. Part-time
      patching may also promote the development of binocularity in patients who have
      "straight-eyes", reduce the chance of a straight-eyed patient developing manifest strabismus
      or losing stereopsis, and reduce the incidence of reverse- or occlusion-amblyopia.

      The study is a randomized trial comparing daily patching regimes for children with severe
      amblyopia. It will consist of about 160 children. Patients in the severe (20/100 to 20/400)
      group will patch part-time (6 hours) or full-time (all or all but one waking hour) of each
      day for the 4 month study period. There are at least two follow up visits during the 4-month
      period. Visual acuity is the major study outcome. It is assessed at the 4-month exam.
