      first bariatric operation. The investigators divided the patients into groups according to
      their pre-operation eating habits: binge, sweet, snack and high volume and compared different
      aspects of the surgery such as weight loss, BMI and distance from ideal weight. The
      investigators also examined the effect of the surgery on the quality of life, sexual life,
      physical activity, eating habits and satisfaction from the surgery by a telephonic survey
      that was conducted up to one year after the surgery.
