      I. To determine the antitumor efficacy of single agent ibrutinib as measured by the overall
      response rate in patients with relapsed/refractory Hodgkin's lymphoma who have relapsed or
      not responded to chemotherapy, immunotherapy and/or radiation.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess duration of tumor control including duration of response (DOR) II. To assess
      progression free survival (PFS). III. To assess the safety and tolerability of 560mg of
      ibrutinib in Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) patients.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the mechanism(s) by which ibrutinib may be active in patients with classical
      Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) by the correlation of potential biomarkers with clinical outcomes.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive ibrutinib orally (PO) once daily (QD). Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days then every 9 weeks
      for 1 year.
