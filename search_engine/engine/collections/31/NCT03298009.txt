      uptake and organ-specific partitioning of dietary fatty acids (DFA). It allows to study
      kidney, liver, skeletal muscles and adipose tissues DFA utilization, whole body fatty acid
      turnover and oxidation rates, myocardial oxidative metabolism and left ventricular (LV)
      function that are other likely targets of SGLT-2 inhibitors. Thus, the PET is ideal to verify
      the very interesting hypothesis that, increase in liver fatty acid utilization and/or adipose
      tissue dietary fatty acid uptake, may lead to reduced cardiac utilization of fatty acids and
      improved cardiac energetic efficiency.
