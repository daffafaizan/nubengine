      Patients with obesity are at increased risk for sedation related adverse events during
      endoscopy. The study evaluated the effect of non-invasive positive pressure ventilation
      (NIPPV) to decrease the incidence of desaturation in patients with severe obesity undergoing
      upper endoscopy. The study was a randomized controlled trial that assessed the effectiveness
      of NIPPV in patients undergoing upper endoscopy. Patients were randomized into experimental
      group NIPPV or control group. Primary endpoints were desaturation events (SpO2 <=94%) and
      desaturation events requiring intervention (SpO2<=90%). A secondary endpoint was the use of
      NIPPV to rescue patients who developed a clinically significant desaturation event.
