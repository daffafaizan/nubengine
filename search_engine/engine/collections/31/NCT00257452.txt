      interval more than placebo. This will be achieved by testing non-inferiority hypothesis.

      Study Hypothesis:

      There is one primary variable to be tested for non-inferiority: tiotropium high dose compared
      to placebo:

      H0: µ(TIO,12) - µ(PBO,12) >= 10 ms vs. H1: µ(TIO,12) - µ(PBO,12) < 10 ms where µ(TIO,12),
      µ(PBO,12) represent the mean change from baseline QTcF between 5 minutes and 2 hours after 12
      days of treatment (taking the mean of the time-matched differences between baseline and
      post-baseline values in each treatment period) with tiotropium 54 µg, or placebo,
      respectively.

      If the data suggest that the Fridericia correction is poor for the study population, an
      alternative correction will be explored (QTcN). The other correction formula would be used as
      a replacement for the Fridericia correction and would be defined before unblinding of the
      data.

      Comparison(s):

      Placebo, moxifloxacin as active control
