      increasing the knee rotational control after the injury, and thus, to improve the clinical
      evolution in the long term. The concept involves restoring knee kinematics by improving
      function by reducing the number of graft failures, delaying or preventing degeneration of the
      joint. Normally, rehabilitation protocols in these cases are more careful with respect to
      knee ROM gain and use of exercises in open kinetic chain, with the purpose of preserving the
      graft.

      Allied to this concept, the use of extra-articular reconstruction associated with ACL
      reconstruction, gained new horizons with the discovery of ALL, signaling to the possibility
      of a better rotational control and, consequently, a decrease in the number of graft failures.

      Due to the particularities of each surgical technique, it is necessary that the
      rehabilitation protocols adapt to the different methods, guaranteeing the functional
      recovery, but without damages to the reconstruction.

      With the proposal of ACL reconstruction surgery associated with ALL reconstruction, it is
      necessary to develop a specific rehabilitation protocol for these patients, considering some
      postoperative specificities of extra-articular reconstructions, since they are data that are
      not available in the literature until now.
