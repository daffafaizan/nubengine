      of the Medtronic CoreValveÂ® System for Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI) in
      patients with severe symptomatic aortic valve stenosis for which treatment via direct aortic
      access (DA) is selected. As part of the study analysis, resource utilization together with
      the Quality of Life questionnaires data will provide an important input into cost
