      chemotherapy for bulky stage I/II cervical cancer. Patients with FIGO stage I/II with bulky
      disease are randomized to either neoadjuvant chemotherapy (BOMP: Cisplatin 14mg/m2 day 1-5,
      Bleomycin 7mg day 1-5, Mitomycin 7mg/m2 day 5, and Vincristine 0.7mg/m2 day every 21 days for
      2-4 cycles followed by radical hysterectomy or radical hysterectomy alone. The primary
      endpoint is overall survival and the secondary endpoints are progression-free survival,
      complication of surgery, completeness of radical hysterectomy, omission of postsurgical
      irradiation, completeness of postsurgical irradiation, response rate, and adverse events. A
      total 200 patients (100 per treatment arm) planned to accrue for this study within 5.5 years.
