      single-centre study to investigate the acute effects of FF/VI inhalation powder 100/25mcg QD
      in lung deflation on cardiac biventricular function and arterial stiffness in adults with
      COPD.

      Subjects will visit the clinic a minimum of 4 times over a 28-day period with a further
      contact which can be either a telephone contact or clinic visit (Visit/Contact 4). A 7-day
      run-in period will be followed by two 7-day (maximum 14-day) treatment periods separated by a
      7(±2) day wash-out period. The first dose of treatment will be taken the day after
      randomisation. A safety Follow-up contact (either visit or telephone) will occur 7(±2) days
      post the last treatment day.

      Subjects will be prescribed appropriate COPD therapy at the end of Treatment Visit 5, if
      required. There are no plans to provide the study drug for compassionate use following study
      completion.

      It is planned to have 44 completed evaluable subjects. Subjects who withdraw early will be
      replaced. In order to ensure 44 evaluable subjects, assuming a 10% protocol deviation rate,
      49 subjects will be randomised. The total duration of subject participation, including the
      follow-up period, will be approximately 36 days.
