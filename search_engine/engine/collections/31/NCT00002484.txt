        -  Determine the maximum dose of external beam irradiation deliverable using conformal
           3-dimensional treatment planning in patients with non-small cell lung cancer.

        -  Determine the feasibility and efficacy of 3-dimensional treatment planning in delivering
           high doses of external beam radiotherapy to these patients.

        -  Determine whether computer-generated dose-volume histograms and normal tissue
           complication probability models can predict the degree of pulmonary toxicity resulting
           from external beam radiotherapy.

        -  Determine the relationship between dose of external beam radiotherapy and the degree of
           pulmonary function change.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study.

      Patients undergo 3-dimensional conformal external beam radiotherapy 5 days a week for 8-10
      weeks.

      Cohorts of 10 patients receive escalating doses of radiotherapy until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which no more than 20% of
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 1 month and then every 4 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60-70 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years.
