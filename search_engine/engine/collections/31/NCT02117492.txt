    
      A Validated questionnaire the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) and total vaginal lengths
      will be used to evaluate patients pre-operatively, at 4-6 weeks post-operatively, and 6
      months post operatively. The FSFI will also be sent to the patient 12 months post
      operatively. These data will be used to assess sexual function and total vaginal length in
      patients undergoing minimally invasive hysterectomy. The study endpoint will occur after the
      12 month follow-up questionnaire. Additionally, all complications following surgery will be
      tracked over the study period for comparison.
