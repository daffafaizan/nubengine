      administration achieves a better response with the vaccine. HSPPC-96 is an immunotherapeutic
      agent made from an individual patient's tumor. The study is being conducted in Houston, Texas
      with patients enrolled into one of two treatment arms. The two treatment arms are either
      subcutaneous injection or intradermal injection, both with HSPPC-96. To be treated with
      HSPPC-96 patients must undergo surgery to remove the kidney tumor and a portion of this
      tissue will be sent to Antigenics' manufacturing facility for processing.
