      Cardiovascular (CV) disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with
      end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Arterial stiffness measured by pulse-wave velocity (PWV) has
      been identified as an independent predictor of fatal CV events in these patients. Our
      long-term goal is to study the impact of interventions that decrease progressive arterial
      stiffness on CV mortality in ESRD patients. Thus, we postulate that measurements of PWV
      during these interventions will predict CV outcome. Before studying this relationship,
      establishing the feasibility of PWV measurements at our centre is necessary.

      Objectives:

      i) To demonstrate the reliability and accuracy of arterial PWV measurements in healthy
      subjects and patients with ESRD at our centre, ii) To assess subject satisfaction and level
      of discomfort associated with the testing procedure, iii) To characterize normative values
      for the PWV in our two subject groups, and iv) To determine the feasibility of recruitment of
      patients with ESRD, as a pre-requisite for a larger trial focused on CV outcomes.

      Methods:

      PWV will be measured consecutively by 2 research assistants in: a) a group of 20 healthy
      subjects; and b) a group of 20 patients with ESRD on chronic hemodialysis at The Ottawa
      Hospital. Two consecutive sets of PWV measurements with a time-interval of 1 week (Â± 2 days)
      will be obtained in the healthy and ESRD groups (pre-hemodialysis, between 2 consecutive
      mid-week hemodialysis sessions). To determine the impact of hemodialysis on PWV measures, in
      a sub-group of 10 ESRD subjects measurements will be taken before and after hemodialysis. The
      order of testing by the 2 assistants will be randomized.
