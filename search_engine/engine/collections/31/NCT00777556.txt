      the label text on the outside of the study package and determine whether and how to use the
      study product without provider direction or assistance. The study product, Plan BÂ® 1.5, was
      to be dispensed only to those subjects who appropriately self-selected and indicated that
      they wanted to participate in the study and receive study product. Subjects could also
      appropriately self-select not to use the study product.

      Follow-up contact was to be conducted at approximately one, four, and eight weeks following
      the date the subject was dispensed study product. At these contacts, subjects answered
      questions regarding product use, health problems since last contact, and pregnancy status.
      Subjects were not to be permitted to enroll more than once in this Actual Use Study, however
      to assess repeat use of emergency contraceptives (EC) (use in addition to the study product)
      subjects were also queried at the one-, four-, and eight-week follow-up contacts regarding
      use of additional EC.
