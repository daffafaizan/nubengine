      frequency, fecal incontinence, as well as sexual dysfunction, is directly affected by
      gynecologic malignancies and the surgical and medical management of those malignancies.
      Increased risk of injury to the urinary tract is a recognized complication of surgical and
      medical therapy of gynecologic malignancies. To date, only a few studies have looked at the
      incidence of lower urinary tract symptoms at the time of diagnosis of gynecologic malignancy
      and prior to treatment, and there have been no published studies describing the incidence of
      sexual dysfunction at the time of diagnosis and prior to therapy of gynecologic malignancies.
      However, sexual dysfunction has been described in patients with urinary incontinence and
      pelvic organ prolapse and following surgery for incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse.
