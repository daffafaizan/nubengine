      Patients will be identified for participation in our ICU Recovery Clinic during their
      admission to the Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU). They
      will be asked to return to the ICU recovery clinic within 1 month of hospital discharge.
      Structured clinic visits as standard of care will include medication reconciliation and
      evaluation by a pharmacist, along with an evaluation by a clinic physician to address acute
      medical issues and provide counselling. They will also undergo standardized testing to
      evaluate physical function, cognitive function, and psychiatric function. Added April 2016:
      They will also undergo a standardized evaluation of speech, swallow, and pain.
