      of different movements or actions. The main purpose of this study is to ascertain whether the
      application of Motor Imagery together with normal practice improves fine motor skills in
      disabled individuals. In this study participated 42 subjects of both genders with
      disabilities, with a mean age of 37 (SD=12). Subjects were randomly divided in two groups: a
      control group and an experimental one. The study procedures were applied on five different
      tasks of the Psychomotor Battery of fine motor skills (BPM). This instrument was applied in
      two stages, at the beginning of the study (pretest) and at the end of the 4 weeks (posttest).
      Both groups performed the tasks twice a week for a month. Motor imagery sessions were added
      on in the experimental group. Participants on the experimental group were asked to mentally
      imagine themselves recreating tasks they had performed earlier on the initial assessment. For
      the analysis of the results, descriptive and inferential statistics were used. The T-test for
      independent samples, and the T-test for paired samples were applied.
