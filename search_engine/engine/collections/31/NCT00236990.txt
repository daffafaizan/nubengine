    
      The objective of this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study is to determine the
      effectiveness and safety of ELMIRON® 100 mg three times per day for 12 weeks, as compared
      with placebo, in patients with chronic non-bacterial inflammation of the prostate gland.
      Safety evaluations will be assessed throughout the study. The hypothesis of the study is that
      ELMIRON® will be more effective than placebo, as based on the change in the total National
      Institutes of Health Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index (NIH-CPSI) score from baseline to the
      final visit (Week 12) and is generally well-tolerated. Patients will receive oral ELMIRON®
      100 mg three times per day orally or matching placebo three times per day for 12 weeks.
