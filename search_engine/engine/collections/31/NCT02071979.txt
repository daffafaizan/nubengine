    
      The proposed investigation is designed to solicit a large number of patients (N=1,500) with
      non-healing wounds (Diabetic Foot Ulcers, Venous Ulcers, or Pressure Ulcers) that have not
      responded to standard wound care in the previous 30 days or more. A prospective,
      interventional, single-blinded, controlled, registry trial will be used. Data will be
      analyzed to compare patients who received PRP therapy (PRP gel application, PRP injection, or
      both) and standard wound care (usual customary care) with patients who received standard
      wound care (usual customary care), only. Wound size, rate of healing, quality of life, and
      recurrence of wound will be measured during the 16-week period at usual office visits.

      Hypotheses to be tested:

        1. Treatment of a chronic wound with standard of care and autologous platelet rich plasma
           (PRP) will increase the velocity of healing (rate of wound closure) over a twenty week
           period as compared to patients receiving standard wound care only (Control Group), which
           results in the patient's ability to return to previous function and resumption of normal
           activities.

        2. Treatment of a chronic wound with standard of care and autologous platelet rich plasma
           (PRP) will result in complete wound healing within twenty weeks, whereas complete wound
           healing will not be observed within twenty weeks in patients receiving standard wound
           care only (Control Group).
