      patients and in a group of age-matched healthy controls using 13C MRS in vivo together with
      systemic i.v. infusion of 13C-labeled glucose.

      The investigators aim to obtain adequate data in 16 subjects grouped as follows:

        -  n=4 pilot subjects (healthy subjects) for testing and optimization of the experimental
           setup.

        -  n=6 healthy controls

        -  n=6 FRDA patients

      In other to reach this goal, the investigators plan to recruit up to 20 subjects, in case
      some subjects withdraw before completion of the MR scan, or in case the measured data are not
      adequate (e.g. technical problem with the scanner).
