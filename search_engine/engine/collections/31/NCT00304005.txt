        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of VNP40101M in patients with Richter
           syndrome or refractory or relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia or other
           lymphoproliferative disease. (phase I)

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this drug in these patients. (phase I)

        -  Determine the efficacy, as determined by overall response rate, of this drug at the MTD
           determined in phase I in these patients. (phase II)

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I dose-escalation study followed by a phase II study.

        -  Phase I: Patients receive VNP40101M IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every
           3-6 weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
           toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of VNP40101M until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. At least 6 patients are treated at the MTD.

        -  Phase II: Patients receive VNP40101M at the MTD determined in phase I.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 35 patients will be accrued for this study.
