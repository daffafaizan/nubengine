      people with disabilities, by determining the long term effects of housing adaptations (HA)
      for clients and society, and transferring this knowledge into guidelines for practitioners in
      the housing and building planning sector.

      Specific research questions are:

      RQ1. What are the long-term effects of HA for clients (individual goals achievement,
      activity, participation, health-related quality of life, usability, falls, functional
      capacity and use of mobility devices (MD), mortality, health care and social services
      consumption, and relocation)? RQ2. What are the long-term effects of HA for society (costs
      and cost- effectiveness)? RQ3. What are the barriers and facilitators to knowledge transfer
      in the area of HA? RQ4. How can evidence based knowledge be transferred into practical
      guidelines for housing and building planning in Sweden?
