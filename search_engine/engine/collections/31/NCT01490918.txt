    
      Eligible subjects will be assigned among 3 groups randomly at a ration of 2:2:1 to the
      following groups and primary efficacy variable analyzed at week 16.

      group 1 : acarbose placebo + metformin + sitagliptin (with switching placebo to acarbose qt
      week 16) group 2 : acarbose + metformin + sitagliptin group 3 : acarbose + metformin placebo
      + sitagliptin (with switching placebo to metformin at week 16)

      After 16 week of treatment, all subjects in 3 groups will be treated as triple combination of
      acarbose + metformin + sitagliptin, and diabetes related variables be collected and analyzed.

        1. Primary Endpoint Changes in HbA1c (hemoglobin A1c) at 16 week from baseline between
           group1 vs grou2

        2. Secondary Endpoints (1) Changes of HbA1c at 24 week between 3 groups (2) Changed of
           post-prandial blood glucose at 2 hour (ppg2h) at 16, 24 week

      for exploratory purpose, following data will be collected and analyzed

        1. continuous glucose monitoring system (CGMS) data among selected subjects in 3 groups

        2. mixed meal tolerance test in only available institution. (glucose, insulin, GLP-1, GIP,
           glucagon ) among selected subjects in group 1 and group 2

        3. oxidative stress markers (8-OHdG, nitrotyrosin, CML)

        4. self monitoring of blood glucose
