      group, single centre study is to evaluate the effect of tapering oral doses of prednisone or
      placebo taken during 25 days following short-term high-dose i.v. methylprednisolone on the
      outcome of a relapse in patients with CIS; RR-MS, PP-MS or SP-MS with superimposed relapses.
      The primary objective is to assess and compare the recovery status in both patient groups 3
      months after baseline by means of Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). Secondary
      objectives are the assessments of clinical parameters at the end of oral treatment, 6, 9
      months after baseline, of MRI markers, of mental and cognitive status, quality of life and
      fatigue at the end of oral treatment, 3 and 6 months after baseline in both patient groups.

      After standard treatment of an acute clinical relapse with high dose, short term i.v.
      methyprednisolone patients will be randomised to one of the two treatment arms. Patients
      allocated to prednisone will be treated with tapering oral doses during 25 days. The initial
      dose of 60 mg will be reduced twice by 20 mg, than by 10 and 5 mg. Each dose regimen will be
      taken during 5Â±2 days. Patients randomised to placebo will receive placebo treatment during
      25 days.
