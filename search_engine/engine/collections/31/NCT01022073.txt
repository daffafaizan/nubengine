      Alzheimer's disease), affects more than a million Americans and is a common condition in the
      Veteran population. Although there is currently no cure for the disease, many of the symptoms
      of the disease can be effectively managed with medications and with deep brain stimulation
      (DBS). This study seeks to build upon the original CSP#468 protocol by providing an efficient
      long-term follow-up study. The objectives of this study are to:

      determine whether the motor benefits of deep brain stimulation persist beyond two years of
      follow-up in patients with Parkinson's disease; determine whether the target of stimulation
      (GPi vs. STN) affects the durability of long-term motor improvement; define the impact of DBS
      on long-term function and quality of life in patients with Parkinson's disease; identify
      clinical features that predict favorable or unfavorable long-term outcome; and describe the
      long-term performance of the DBS devices, including device durability, device explanation
      rate, neurostimulator replacement frequency, and changes in stimulation parameters to achieve
      optimum symptom control.
