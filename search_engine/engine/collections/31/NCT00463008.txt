        -  Determine the feasibility of using microdialysis to study distribution of systemically
           administered methotrexate in the interstitial fluid within a tumor in patients
           undergoing stereotactic biopsy for recurrent high-grade gliomas.

        -  Determine the systemic and intratumoral pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients have an intratumoral microdialysis catheter placed while undergoing stereotactic
      biopsy. Between 18-32 hours after placement of catheter, patients receive methotrexate IV
      over 4 hours. Microdialysis perfusate and blood specimens are collected before, during, and
      for 24 hours after methotrexate administration.

      Patients are followed at 2 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12 patients will be accrued for this study within 6 months.
