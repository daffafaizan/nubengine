    
      Over one year, we will recruit 140 female outpatients suffering from a major depressive
      episode with (n=70) and without any history of suicide attempt (n=70) from a specialized
      clinic for mood disorders and SB.

      First visit: clinical, biological and neuropsychological assessment Second visit: The TSST is
      a standardized laboratory psychosocial stress protocol that involves public speaking, role
      play, and mental arithmetic tasks in front of a panel of confederate judges. Blood samples
      will be obtained before the introduction to the TSST and immediately after and at + 30, + 60,
      + 90, and + 120 min. Self-ratings of emotional states, anxiety, anger and psychological pain
      will be completed at the same times.

      Third visit: Participants will be instructed to carry a smartphone with them for one week,
      and to record at each alarm signal daily life events, negative emotions, psychological pain,
      suicidal ideas, and specific attributions to these events. Participants will be signalled
      five times a day during the period. Subjects will be contacted by telephone halfway through
      the assessment period to monitor and encourage compliance.
