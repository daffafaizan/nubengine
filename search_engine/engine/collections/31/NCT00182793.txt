        -  Determine the feasibility of tandem high-dose chemotherapy comprising melphalan,
           carboplatin, thiotepa, and cyclophosphamide with or without trastuzumab (Herceptin®)
           followed by autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation and helical
           tomotherapy or loco-regional radiotherapy in patients with high-risk stage IIIB, IIIC,
           or IV breast cancer.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo stem cell collection.

        -  Course 1: Patients receive high-dose melphalan IV with or without trastuzumab
           (Herceptin®). One day later, patients undergo autologous peripheral blood stem cell
           (PBSC) transplantation. No more than 7 weeks later, patients proceed to course 2.

        -  Course 2: Patients receive high-dose carboplatin, thiotepa, and cyclophosphamide IV
           continuously over 4 days followed by autologous PBSC transplantation.

      After recover from high-dose chemotherapy and autologous PBSC transplantation, patients with
      stage IIIB or IIIC disease undergo radiotherapy to the chest wall and lymph nodes. Patients
      with stage IV disease undergo radiotherapy using helical tomotherapy or standard radiotherapy
      to oligometastatic sites.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 100 patients will be accrued for this study.
