      hypochlorite as a root canal irrigant on postoperative pain and antibacterial activity
      against E.faecalis in infected root canal. initial pre-treatment root canal sample will be
      taken.These will be designated as sample no.1. after first sample, according to random
      sequence, the patients will be randomly assigned into two groups. In Group I: Sodium
      hypochlorite (NaOCL 2.5%) will be used during instrumentation of the canals.In Group II:
      chitosan nanoparticles (CS-np) will be used. after preparation, the sample no.2 will be
      taken.Pain will be assessed by giving the patient the numerical pain rating scale (NRS) to
      assess his pain at 24, 48 and 72 hours after the first visit.
