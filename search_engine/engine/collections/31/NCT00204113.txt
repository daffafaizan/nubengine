      The study will investigate the feasibility of using functional electrical stimulation (FES)
      of the calf muscles of paraplegic subjects to assist in posture stabilisation during
      standing. We aim to achieve postural stability by combining controlled FES of the lower-limb
      muscles with the voluntary motor control skills of the intact upper body.

      Background:

      In spinal cord injury (SCI), the paralysed muscles generally retain their ability to contract
      and electrical stimulation can be used in rehabilitation as a therapy. With functional
      electrical stimulation (FES) the aim is to restore some normal motor functions such as
      standing, stepping or cycling. A number of studies have investigated the physiological
      effects and potential therapeutic benefits of lower-limb FES exercise. These studies have
      shown that the benefits include restoration of muscle bulk and strength, a reduction in the
      rate of bone demineralisation, improvements in the range of joint motion, and relaxation of
      spasm. Standing is an important part of rehabilitation therapy for paraplegic patients, and
      helps to alleviate some of the secondary effects of paralysis.
