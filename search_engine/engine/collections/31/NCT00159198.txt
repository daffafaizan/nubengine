    
      The objective of this study without direct individual benefit is to confirm the linkage with
      one or another region of the two identified regions (chromosomes 9 and 15) or to identify a
      new implicated chromosomal region, and then to reduce the linkage interval in order to
      identify the responsible gene(s) and characterize the mutations with the study of at least 9
      families with FTD and ALS.
