        -  Determine immune response of vaccination with melanoma associated antigens
           (MART-1:27-35, gp100:209-217 (210M), and tyrosinase:368-376 (370D)) on the number of
           peptide specific CD8+ T-cell precursors in HLA-A2 positive patients with metastatic
           melanoma.

        -  Determine the influence of sargramostim (GM-CSF) and/or interferon alfa-2b (IFN-A) on
           the immune responses of these patients and toxicity of this melanoma peptide vaccine.

        -  Determine any antitumor and anti-pigmentary response that may result from immunization
           against MART-1, gp100 and tyrosinase peptides, and determine the relationship between
           such clinical observations and immune responses against lineage antigens with or without
           GM-CSF and/or IFN-A.

        -  Compare the relapse free survival and overall survival of patients treated with melanoma
           peptide vaccine alone or in combination with GM-CSF and/or IFN-A.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study.

      Patients are randomized to 1 of 4 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive multiepitope peptide (MEP) vaccine comprising MART-1:27-35,
           gp100:209-217 (210M), and tyrosinase:368-376 (370D) peptides. Each peptide is separately
           emulsified in Montanide ISA-51 and administered subcutaneously (SC) (for a total of 2
           injections per peptide) on days 1 and 15.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive MEP vaccine as in arm I and sargramostim (GM-CSF)
           subcutaneously (SC) daily on days 1-14.

        -  Arm III: Patients receive MEP vaccine as in arm I and interferon alfa-2b SC three times
           a week.

        -  Arm IV: Patients receive MEP vaccine as in arm I, GM-CSF as in arm II, and interferon
           alfa-2b as in arm III.

      Treatment continues every 4 weeks for a maximum of 13 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 92 patients (23 per arm) will be accrued for this study within
      13-16 months.
