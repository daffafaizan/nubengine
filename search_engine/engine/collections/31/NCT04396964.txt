      discectomy, laminectomy, or vertebral fixation. We will recruit a cohort of subjects in
      groups with metabolic phenotypes defined by body mass index (BMI) and glycemic control. We
      are choosing to use spinal surgeries as they utilize inhaled anesthetics, run hours in
      length, do not involve ischemic tourniquet time, and use basic elements of the anesthetic
      pharmacopeia including anti-emetics, opioid analgesics, and paralytics. Further the increased
      surgical stress of entering the thorax or peritoneum are avoided. These features provide a
      long steady-state of surgical intervention with minimal additional maneuvers allowing for a
      controlled examination of surgical metabolism.

      The categorical criteria for the groups will be body type: lean (BMI<25), overweight (BMI
      >25, <30), and obese (BMI >30 but <40), and glycemia: normoglycemic (fasting blood glucose;
      FBG <100 mg/dL or HbA1c <5.5%), impaired fasting glucose (FBG >100 mg/dL and <126 mg/dL, or
      HbA1c >5.5% and <6.5%), Type 2 Diabetes (FBG >126 mg/dL or HbA1c >6.5%).

      Subjects will be screened, enrolled, give informed consent, and have a dedicated peripheral
      IV line placed in pre-operative hold. A baseline blood sample will be collected in
      pre-operative hold, after transfer to the table in the operating room, and immediately prior
      to induction of anesthesia. Following induction blood samples will be collected at 15'
      intervals for the initial 2 hours of each case, then at 30' intervals for the remainder of
      the case and for 2 hours in the post-anesthesia care unit. Samples will be processed and
      stored at -80C until analyzed. Intra-operative data from the anesthesia record will be
      collected and included in the study database.
