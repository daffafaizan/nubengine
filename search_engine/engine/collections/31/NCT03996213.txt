      blood pressure monitor) will be applied; intravenous line will be secured, and routine
      pre-medications (ranitidine 50 mg and midazolam 3-5 mg) will be administrated.

      Before induction of anesthesia, patients will be randomly allocated into:supine group,
      head-down group or leg elevation group Baseline mean arterial blood pressure will be obtained
      as average of 3 reading before induction of anesthesia at supine position.

      Induction of anesthesia will be achieved using fentanyl (2 mcg/Kg), propofol (2 mg/Kg), and
      atracurium (0.5 mg/Kg). Endotracheal tube will be inserted after 3 minutes of mask
      ventilation. Anesthesia will be maintained by isoflurane (1-1.5%) and atracurium 10 mg
      increments every 20 minutes. Ringer lactate solution will be infused at a rate of 2
      mL/Kg/hour.

      Any episode of hypotension (defined as mean arterial pressure < 80% of the baseline reading)
      will be managed by 5 mcg norepinephrine. If the hypotensive episode persisted for 2 minutes,
      another bolus of norepinephrine will be administered.
