      everyday function. There are treatments available that can help manage symptoms, but at
      present there is no cure, and no treatment that is effective at slowing the progression of
      AD. AD can begin to cause brain damage decades before symptoms such as memory loss become
      apparent.

      The trial will investigate the effect of the drug JNJ-40346527 on CSF-1R (colony stimulating
      factor-1 receptor), which is a protein on the outside of cells present in the brain. CSF-1R
      is responsible for the regulation of various cells, including microglial cells. Recent
      research suggests that reducing numbers of these microglial cells may be beneficial in
      slowing the progression of Alzheimer's disease. The Investigators want to see how well
      JNJ-40346527 is able to block CSF-1R, and in turn suppress these microglial cells. The study
      is designed to investigate whether or not it is possible to identify changes in levels of
      proteins which interact with CSF-1R, and changes in the activity or number of affected
      microglial cells present in the brain. This evidence may provide useful "biomarkers",
      measures of change in the body, which the Investigators could track to see how the drug is
      working. These "biomarkers" could then be used in further larger studies to more thoroughly
      test the benefits of the drug JNJ-40346527. The present study is not designed to test whether
      or not this drug can slow the progression of Alzheimer's disease.

      If biomarkers are identified in the study, further studies will be designed to test whether
      JNJ-40346527 can slow or prevent the progression of Alzheimer's disease.
