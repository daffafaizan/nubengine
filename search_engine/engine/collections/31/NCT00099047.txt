    
      PRIMARY OJBECTIVES:

      I. Determine the efficacy of celecoxib vs placebo in reducing serum levels of M-component in
      patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance or smoldering myeloma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the effects of this drug on secondary biomarkers as surrogate endpoints in these
      patients.

      OUTLINE:

      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Patients are
      stratified according to participating center and type of monoclonal gammopathy (monoclonal
      gammopathy of undetermined significance vs smoldering myeloma). Patients are randomized to 1
      of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive celecoxib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) for 6 months in the absence
      of unacceptable toxicity or progression to malignancy.

      ARM II: Patients receive placebo PO BID for 6 months in the absence of unacceptable toxicity
      or progression to malignancy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 1, 6, and 12 months.
