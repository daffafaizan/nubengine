      in 2002 it was in two clinical trials demonstrated that mild therapeutic hypothermia in
      comatose OOH-CA victims yields a better cerebral outcome measured by Cerebral Performance
      Category Score (CPC) after 6 month. The optimal mild hypothermia treatment time is however
      not known. The two trials from 2002 apply the treatment for 12 and 24 hours respectively. In
      newborns with cerebral hypoxic damage the standard treatment time is 72 hours. It is
      therefore relevant to investigate the influence of the treatment time on the cerebral outcome
      in OOH-CA victims. In the present study cerebral outcome after mild therapeutic hypothermia
      (target temperature 33 degrees centigrade) in OOH-CA patients for 24 is compared to outcome
      after 48 hours of mild hypothermia. The main outcome parameter is mortality and CPC score
      measured 6 month after the treatment.
