      target-controlled infusion (TCI) of remifentanil and propofol. In the volatile group,
      anesthesia was induced with an intravenous bolus of propofol 1.5-2 mg/kg and TCI of
      remifentanil (effect-site concentration [Ce] of 4.0 ng/ml). In the TIVA group, anesthesia was
      induced with TCI of propofol (Ce of 4.0-4.5 Î¼g/ml) and remifentanil (Ce of 4.0 ng/ml). In the
      volatile group, anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane (0.8-1 age-adjusted minimum
      alveolar concentration [MAC]) and TCI of remifentanil, while in the TIVA group, anesthesia
      was maintained with TCI of propofol and remifentanil. Anesthesia depth was adjusted to
      maintain a PSI(Patient State Index) of 25-50. Endotracheal intubation was performed after
      administration of intravenous rocuronium 1.2 mg/kg and neuromuscular blockade depth was
      maintained to a target of train-of-four of 0-2 with infusion of rocuronium during
      pneumoperitoneum.
