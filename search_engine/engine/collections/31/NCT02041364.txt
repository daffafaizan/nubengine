    
      Patients with breast cancer undergoing adjuvant systemic chemotherapy based on the use of
      anthracyclines will be screened before the start of chemotherapy.

      Patients whose scores on the brief fatigue inventory (BFI) increase after having received the
      first cycle of chemotherapy will be considered as having manifested fatigue. The patients
      whose fatigue won't worse following the first cycle of chemotherapy will be used as controls.
      We will collect blood samples of both groups before and 21 days after the start of
      chemotherapy. We will analyze the following biomarkers: IL2, IL10, TNF and TGFB-1 measured by
      amplification reaction; FSH, LH, estradiol, DHEA, DHEAS and cortisol hormones measured by
      chemiluminescent enzyme immunometric assay
