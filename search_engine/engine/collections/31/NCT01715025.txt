      phase if in two of the three pre-treatment cycles the measured menstrual blood loss (MBL)is
      >80ml. The mean of these baseline MBL measurements will be the comparator for the efficacy
      treatment measurement. Iron studies (serum ferritin, Fe and transferrin) will also be
      measured pre and post treatment and related to women's assessment of their quality of life
      measured on a validated questionnaire.
