      participant on either brain CT or MRI will be a similarly easy to understand quantification
      of damage done to the participant's body. Given the link between smoking and stroke risk, the
      investigators believe that providing this imaging in addition to standard smoking cessation
      education may improve rates of smoking cessation after stroke. If this proves true, addition
      of a patient's neuroimaging to standard post-stroke smoking cessation education would be an
      easy method to improve smoking cessation rates in stroke patients, at minimal cost.
