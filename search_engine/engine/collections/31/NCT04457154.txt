    
      This registry is a prospective, multi-center, single-arm study of pediatric subjects (ages
      18-21 years) who are undergoing implant of the Inspire Upper Airway Stimulation (UAS) System
      for the treatment of moderate or severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Implanted subjects
      will be followed for 5 years post-implant.

      Subjects will be recruited in accordance with the approved Inspire UAS indication for use and
      will only include those subjects who are within the new age indication (18-21 years of age).
      Implanted subjects must meet the registry eligibility criteria. Those subjects that are
      enrolled but fail to meet the eligibility criteria will be considered screen failures.

      This registry will collect safety and effectiveness data on 60 implanted subjects at a
      minimum of 5 qualified clinical centers in the United States.

      Study data will be collected at the following timepoints:

      Baseline (pre-implant) Implant Activation (1 month post-implant) 6 Months post-implant

      1, 2, 3, 4, 5 years post-implant
