    
      ILD is a group of diseases involving pulmonary interstitial, alveolar and (or) bronchioles.
      In the patients receiving allo-HSCT, ILD mainly present as bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome
      (BOS). ILD after HSCT is characterized by non-responsiveness to treatment, leading to high
      morbidity and mortality. MSC has been considered as an effective treatment for refractory
      acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD), but the response to treat chronic GVHD (cGVHD),
      especially refractory BOS, is rarely reported.
