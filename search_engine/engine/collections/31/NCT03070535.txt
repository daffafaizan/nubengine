      epsilon 4 (E4) influences acute cognitive responses to different types of meals. The
      rationale for this study is that we know that a diet high in saturated fat and high glycemic
      index foods (HIGH diet) is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). However we have found
      paradoxically that a Western style HIGH diet acutely improved cognition in APOE E4 carriers,
      but worsened cognition in E4 non-carriers. This experiment will examine mechanisms that
      underlie this differential response between E4 carriers and non-carriers.

      We will enroll older adults who do not have dementia, half of which will be E4 carriers and
      the other half will be non-carriers. Both groups will contain equal numbers of men and women.
      These individuals will undergo two experiments in which they eat either a high or a low fat
      meal, and then after the meal will undergo several tests. The outcome measures include blood
      measures of metabolic markers, cognitive tests that are known to be sensitive to changes even
      after a single meal, and spinal fluid measures of Alzheimer's biomarkers such as
      beta-amyloid, as well as spinal fluid levels of lipids, glucose and insulin. This study will
      allow us to test whether high and low fat meals acutely affect cognitive and Alzheimer's
      biomarkers, and if those changes depend on APOE genotype or gender. It is our hope that this
      work will contribute to our broader understanding about the risks of diet and AD, to help us
      understand more about how to prevent and treat this devastating neurological disease.
