      establish an in-vivo imaging technique to detect SAMS. The central hypothesis of this
      pro-posal is that statins directly inhibit mitochondrial function in SAMS patients. Our
      rationale is based on our own preliminary data indicating that simvastatin - the most common
      statin to cause SAMS - can directly inhibit oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in mice. Since
      such changes can be detected in vivo in humans utilizing 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy
      (MRS) techniques, the investigators will use a state-of-the art 7 Tesla (7T) MRS instrument
      to study the so-leus muscles of SAMS patients. Additionally, the investigators will validate
      the MRS findings by doing func-tional studies in muscle biopsy specimens.

      The investigators propose double-blind randomized, placebo-controlled pilot study in 15 SAMS
      pa-tients and 15 controls. Study participants will be treated with simvastatin 40 mg daily or
      place-bo for 10 weeks. The investigators will perform 7T MRS of soleus muscles at
      randomization and either at first complaint of muscle symptoms or at the end of 10 weeks if
      no muscle symptoms occur, whichever occurs first. Quadriceps muscle biopsies will also be
      done immediately following the second MRS scan.
