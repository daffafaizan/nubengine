    
      Phase I multicenter, open-label, dose-escalating clinical and pharmacokinetic trial of
      PM02734 administered in combination with erlotinib to determine the safety and tolerability
      and to identify the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and the recommended dose (RD) of the
      combination of PM02734 and erlotinib, determine the preliminary pharmacokinetics (PK) of the
      combination, evaluate the preliminary PK/pharmacodynamic correlation, evaluate the
      preliminary antitumor activity, perform a preliminary pharmacogenomic (PGx) study to explore
      molecular predictors of response to ErbB receptor antagonists and PM02734 in patient with
      advanced malignant solid tumors.
