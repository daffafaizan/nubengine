      the efficacy of alkaline phosphatase (AP) in reducing specific pro-inflammatory cytokines
      during and after 3 days of twice daily s.c. treatment. A total dose of 12000 Units AP will be
      administered by 2000 IU s.c. injection twice daily for 3 days. Subjects will be closely
      followed for 8 days and regular clinical observations will be made during 3 months. Close out
      will be 3 months after initiation of treatment.
