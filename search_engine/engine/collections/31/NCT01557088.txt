      Lp-PLA2 and oxidative stress and correlates with the tissue characteristics of plaque
      vulnerability. The investigators will define the systemic and coronary gradient and
      production of markers of inflammation and oxidative stress and the presence of coronary
      endothelial dysfunction in patients with early coronary atherosclerosis.

      Aim II: Hypothesis: The distribution of Lp-PLA2 on the LDL is associated with greater
      coronary endothelial dysfunction and correlates with the degree coronary atherosclerosis and
      plaque vulnerability. The investigators will define the distribution of Lp-PLA2 in patients
      with early coronary atherosclerosis and endothelial dysfunction.
