      H-P-A axis, menstrual function and bone density and bone turnover in high school female cross
      country runners. Our objectives are to: 1)determine energy intake, exercise energy
      expenditure, and fat-free mass to examine energy availability; 2)in a subset of runners,
      using double labelled water, estimate total energy expenditure and indirect calorimetry to
      estimate resting metabolic rate; 3)assess the relationship between energy availability,
      hormones that regulate bone turnover, markers of bone formation and resorption and bone
      mineral content and density; 4)identify the relationship between energy availability,
      hormones that regulate menstrual function and current menstrual status; and 5)determine the
      energy intake and energy expenditure variables exhibiting the strongest associations with
      energy availability.
