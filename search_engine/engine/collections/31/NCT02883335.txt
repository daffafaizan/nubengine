        -  PMSI (administrative French national database for hospitals)

        -  biological and imagery services in Lorraine Procedures (automatic and manual) are used
           to eliminate duplicates Once a patient has been identified its medical file are checked
           by investigators in order to retrieve the relevant information.

      New MS cases are confirmed by neurologists. Automatics (implemented in EDMUS software)and
      manual checks are implemented in the registry database, looking for inconsistencies.
