      distinct from those of healthy individuals. These studies suggest a central role of the gut
      microbial population in CD. The high complexity of the gut microbiome, which is the most
      densely populated bacterial niche, makes the identification of these bacteria a significant
      challenge. The bacterial population is comprised from 1013 - 1014 individuals, all belonging
      roughly to a thousand different species, mostly anaerobic, and most of them (roughly 70% -
      80%) are uncultivable.

      The goals of this project are to examine a potential link between bilirubin metabolism and
      IBD, by comparing fecal extracts from healthy humans and IBD patients, and to investigate the
      underlying mechanism explaining these differences.
