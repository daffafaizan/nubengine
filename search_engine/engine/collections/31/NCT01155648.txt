    
      1. After being placed in the supine position in bed, with head angle elevation at 30°,
           patients were randomized to:group 1 (G1): chest wall compression for ten minutes in
           chest or group 2 (G2): chest wall compression plus increase of 10 cmH2O in IP in PSV for
           ten minutes in chest.

        2. Clinical variables and APACHE II were registered.

        3. Parameters analyzed at the beginning (1) and at the end (2) of the protocol were:
           variation of peak pressure (ΔPp=Pp2-Pp1),variation of tidal volume (ΔVT =VT2-VT1),
           variation of dynamic compliance (ΔCdyn= Cdyn2-Cdyn1).

        4. The amount of variation of mucus secretion aspirated (ΔSa= Sa2-Sa1) at the end was also
           measured
