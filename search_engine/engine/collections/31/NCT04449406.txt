    
      The main aim of this research study is to establish the accuracy of a urinary biomarker panel
      (LYVE1, REG1B, TFF1), and affiliated PancRISK score alone or in combination with plasma
      CA19-9 for early detection of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).

      Samples will be collected from symptomatic individuals with suspected pancreatic cancer, and
      asymptomatic subjects at risk of developing PDAC.

      The results of urine biomarker and CA19-9 analysis carried out on these samples will be
      compared to the imaging and, where available, histopathology data, which will inform the
      development of a predictive model to detect PDAC earlier.
