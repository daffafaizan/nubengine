    
      This is a Phase IB/II multi-cohort study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      targeted agents plus cancer immune checkpoint therapy with atezolizumab in patients with
      recurrent and/or persistent endometrial cancer.

      This biomarker-driven study provides a platform whereby patients with persistent/recurrent
      endometrial cancer will be placed into study cohorts evaluating atezolizumab plus a targeted
      agent selected on the basis of the tumor's specific genomic profile. Prospective patients
      with persistent and/or recurrent endometrial cancer will be prescreened within 60 days of
      treatment assignment to have a tumor tissue sample submitted for next-generation sequencing
      (NGS) using FoundationOne® companion diagnostic (CDx) testing prior to entering screening.

      Based on the FoundationOne® results, patients will be assigned to a study cohort with a
      targeted therapy + atezolizumab. The current study cohorts are as follows:

        -  Atezolizumab + Bevacizumab doublet

        -  Atezolizumab + Ipatasertib doublet

        -  Atezolizumab + Talazoparib doublet

      It is anticipated that 20 patients will be enrolled in each study cohort. Each study cohort
      will open/close independently of other study cohorts. Once a study cohort reaches 20
      patients, it will be closed to further enrollment.

      The study is structured to allow for additional cohorts to be added as the study progresses.
      These additional study cohorts may be proposed by investigators, but requires approval by the
      Steering Committee in order to be added to the protocol.
