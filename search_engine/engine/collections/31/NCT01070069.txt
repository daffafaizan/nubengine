      ProGlide closure has been demonstrated to be feasible. To date, no multicenter, randomized
      controlled trials of the approach are available. Moreover, although the IntuiTrak System and
      the closure devices are commercially available in the US as FDA-approved devices, no EVAR
      device and no closure device is FDA approved for a totally percutaneous EVAR application.

      The IntuiTrak System is indicated for the treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms with aortic
      necks ranging in size from 18mm to 32mm. The System includes a 19Fr integrated introducer
      sheath, which is designed to reduce exchanges, and may be particularly important in a
      percutaneous approach. Moreover, the device is the only currently approved EVAR device with a
      contralateral percutaneous (9Fr) indication.

      Patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm who are suitable candidates for endovascular repair
      using the IntuiTrak System and who meet the prospectively defined inclusion/exclusion
      criteria specific to the trial will be randomized to PEVAR or to standard EVAR using vascular
      exposure access in a ratio of 2:1. Physicians who are established experts in the field of
      percutaneous EVAR will participate in the trial.
