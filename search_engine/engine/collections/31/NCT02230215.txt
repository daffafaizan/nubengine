      total knee replacement surgery. All study patients will undergo an MRI prior to surgery. Half
      (25)of these patients will be randomized to have their MRI used to develop a patient-specific
      instrument to be used during their surgery. The other half (25) will have conventional
      instrumentation (CI) used for their knee replacement surgery.

      All patients will have the same type of knee implant used for their total knee replacement
      (Genesis II posterior stabilized (Smith & Nephew).

      Patients will not know which group they have been randomized to. For patients randomized into
      the patient-specific randomization group, If the surgeon is not happy with the
      patient-specific instrumentation, they have the option to switch to conventional
      instrumentation at any time during the surgery.

      • Length of operation, number of instruments used, amount of OR room waste and number and
      type of adjustments to the patient specific instrumentation will be tracked.

      During the surgery, all patients in the study will have tantalum marker beads placed in the
      bone surrounding their knee replacement. These beads will be used as markers to measure
      implant fixation over the next two years. All patients will undergo a special type of x-ray
      imaging called RSA imaging to quantify implant fixation over time.

      RSA examinations will occur at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years at the
      Robart's Research Institute after their standard of care visit with orthopaedic surgeon.

      Model based RSA software used to measure motion of implant components relative to bone
      markers.

      All patients will complete our standard outcome measures in the form of surveys completed at
      their follow-up visits after surgery. •
