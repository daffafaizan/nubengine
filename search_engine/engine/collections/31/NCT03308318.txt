      temporalis fascia, was investigated in 169 cases operated upon with zygomaticofacial or
      craniofacial fractures using the supratemporalis approach from June 2013 to June 2017. Among
      167 surgeries, this so-called "deep layer of the deep temporalis fascia" was not observed. In
      fact, the superficial temporal fat pad is closely attached to temporal muscle above the
      zygomatic arch.
