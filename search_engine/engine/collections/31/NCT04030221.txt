      Fluid infusion test is a method to determine patients' reactivity to liquid therapy. The
      commonly used Stroke Volume Variation (SVV) and Pulse Pressure Variation (PPV) are good
      predictors of fluid responsiveness, but they are not suitable for operations with increased
      intra-abdominal pressure, such as laparoscopy surgery. Some studies have shown that Pressure
      Gradient for Venous Return (PVR) may has the same effect as PPV/SVV in predicting fluid
      responsiveness (FR). In the case that PPV/SVV cannot be used, PVR may be used alternatively.
      Therefore, our aim is to explore the relationship between the changes of PVR and fluid
      responsiveness during liquid infusion and to determine relevant parameters.

      We will choose patients planed to receive laparoscopic surgery and general anesthesia,
      especially the patients with gastrointestinal tumors because of generally long operation time
      and much infusion volume. In our hospital, these patients will routinely indwelled arterial
      catheters and deep venous catheters during the operation. The former is mainly used to
      monitor direct arterial pressure, and the latter is used for fluid infusion.Through the above
      two pathways, we can collect the hemodynamic parameters of patients, and then establish the
      relationship between PVR and FR.

      In our study, a good FR was defined as a 10% increase in cardiac index (CI) after fluid
      infusion, and PVR is calculated by a special formula based on some specific parameters of
      hemodynamics.
