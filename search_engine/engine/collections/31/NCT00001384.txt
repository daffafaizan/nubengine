      cyclophosphamide) chemotherapy with G-CSF (filgrastim) followed by infusional Taxol®
      (Registered Trademark) (paclitaxel) as adjuvant treatment for patients with high risk stage
      II and stage III breast cancer. Cycles will be 14 days in duration. After 3 fourteen day
      cycles of AC with filgrastim, patients will be treated with 3 fourteen day cycles of 96 hour
      infusional paclitaxel. The goal of this study will be to assess the toxicity and feasibility
      of administering dose-intensive AC chemotherapy followed by infusional paclitaxel in 14 day
      cycles.
