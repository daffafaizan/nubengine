    
      OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if engraftment can be achieved safely in patients with high-risk hematologic
      malignancies who undergo non-myeloablative bone marrow transplantation (BMT) from human
      leukocyte antigen (HLA)-haploidentical donors.

      OUTLINE:

      NONMYELOABLATIVE CONDITIONING: Patients receive fludarabine phosphate intravenously (IV) over
      1 hour on days -6 to -2 and cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on days -6 and -5. Patients
      undergo total body irradiation on day -1.

      TRANSPLANTATION: Patients undergo BMT, from an HLA-haploidentical donor, on day 0.

      POST-TRANSPLANT IMMUNOSUPPRESSION: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on day 3.

      GRAFT-VERSUS-HOST DISEASE PROPHYLAXIS: Patients receive tacrolimus IV over 1-2 hours and then
      tacrolimus orally (PO), once tolerated, on days 4-180, with taper on day 86 in the absence of
      graft-versus-host disease. Patients also receive mycophenolate mofetil PO three times daily
      on days 4-35.

      Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 6 months and then annually
      thereafter.
