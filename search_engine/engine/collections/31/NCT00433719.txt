      tuberculous meningitis Study design: A randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial
      with 2 parallel arms Sample size: 247 Inclusion criteria: Age 15 years or older; HIV antibody
      positive; clinical diagnosis of TBM.

      Exclusion criteria: positive CSF Gram or India ink stain, known or suspected pregnancy;
      antituberculous treatment 8 to 30 days immediately prior to recruitment; previous
      antiretroviral therapy; laboratory contraindications to antiretroviral or antituberculous
      therapy; lack of consent.

      Consent: Written informed consent will be sought for all patients. Verbal consent will be
      considered acceptable when written consent is impossible. In unconscious patients, the
      consent of 2 independent physicians will be considered acceptable.

      Randomization: Patients will be stratified according to TBM disease severity at presentation
      (modified MRC grade I to III). Within each stratum, patients will be randomized to 1 of the 2
      treatment arms: immediate or deferred (2 months) ART.

      Antituberculous treatment: Initial therapy will be with isonazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide
      and ethambutol for 3 months. After 3 months, patients will continue on rifampicin and
      isoniazid for a further 6 months.

      Corticosteroid treatment: Dexamethasone 0.3 - 0.4mg/kg will be administered and tapered over
      6 - 8 weeks, according to TBM grade.

      Antiretrovira l treatment: Antiretrovirals (zidovudine, lamivudine and efavirenz)or identical
      placebo tablets will be commenced at study entry and continued for 2 months. Thereafter, all
      patients will received antiretrovirals.

      Clinical monitoring: Patients will be assessed weekly as an inpatient for 3 months. Hospital
      outpatient review will occur monthly until 9 months. A final follow-up visit will take place
      at 12 months.

      Laboratory monitoring: Routine laboratory tests will be monitored weekly as an inpatient and
      monthly as an outpatient. Blood samples for CD4 T-lymphocyte count and plasma HIV-1 RNA level
      will be monitored 3-monthly. CSF samples will be taken at 0, 1, 2, 3, 6 and 9 months.

      Radiology: Patients will have a chest radiograph performed on admission. A CT or MRI brain
      scan may also be performed if clinically indicated.

      Adverse events: All grade 3 and 4 adverse events will be reported immediately to the Data and
      Safety Monitoring Committee.

      Outcome measures: The primary endpoint will be mortality at 9 months. The secondary endpoints
      will be: mortality at 12 months; fever clearance time; coma clearance time; neurological
      relapse; progression to new or recurrent AIDS defining illness; any grade 3 or 4 adverse
      event; CD4 count response; plasma HIV-1 RNA response; neurological disability.

      Data analysis: Analysis will be based on intention to treat.
