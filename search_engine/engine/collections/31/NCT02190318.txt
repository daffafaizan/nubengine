      life of dialysis patients. It is now recognized as an important factor in the prognosis of
      PD.The RAAS system is involved in the development of renal diseases. Angiotensin II and
      aldosterone are vital in this process. The beneficial effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme
      inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker on residual renal function has been demonstrated in
      peritoneal dialysis patients. Unfortunately, neither ACE inhibition nor angiotensin receptor
      blocker fully supprsses aldosterone production. Now much focus has been placed on aldosterone
      antagonist.
