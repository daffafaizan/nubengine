      paradigm for DLBCL. This was initially established based on the results of 2 randomized
      trials conducted in the 1980s-1990s. In these studies patients were treated with 30Gy after
      chemotherapy (ECOG study) or 40-55Gy (SWOG study). A British National Lymphoma Investigation
      study showed no difference in freedom from local progression, progression-free survival or
      overall survival in between patients receiving 30Gy and 40-45Gy. Additionally systemic
      therapy for DLBCL has significantly improved since these initial studies, with the addition
      of rituximab to standard chemotherapy.

      In a phase II study at Duke University patients with DLBCL NOS or primary mediastinal B-cell
      lymphoma were treated to 19.5-20Gy after achieving complete response to 4-6 cycles of
      chemotherapy containing rituximab. With a median follow-up of 43 months, there was only 1
      local recurrence. The 5-year local control rate was 98%. Progression-free and overall
      survival at 5 years was 81% and 88%. Therefore, there is emerging evidence of long term
      favorable outcomes in localized DLBCL, while decreasing the risk of late effects by reducing
      the dose and volume of RT.

      All participants will receive 20Gy instead of 30-36Gy after completion of at least 3 cycles
      of rituximab with combination chemotherapy. Participants must have a negative post
      chemotherapy PET-CT to participate in this study.
