      atherosclerotic plaque formation in the major arteries of the leg (Mays, Casserly and
      Regesteiner, 2013). The main presenting symptom of PAD is intermittent claudication (IC) -
      exertional pain or discomfort in the calf, thigh or buttock that is relieved with rest. The
      presence of PAD is a very powerful marker of cardiovascular risk and preventable
      cardiovascular deaths. Following the initial diagnosis of PAD, for those patients without
      coronary artery disease the risk of systemic morbidity or mortality in the next 5 years is
      50% (AACVPR, 2013). In 2012, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)
      issued guidelines stating that supervised exercise programmes (SEPs) should be offered as
      first-line treatment for people diagnosed PAD. However, there is a national shortage of
      dedicated SEPs for PAD patients that UK vascular specialists can refer patients to. There has
      been suggestion that an already established network of Cardiac Rehabilitation (CR)
      departments within the United Kingdom (UK) could cater for this group of patients, as they
      already have facilities and staff in place. To date, there has been no investigation into
      whether this would be successful. This research project would investigate if CR programmes
      could get the same outcomes for PAD patients as a stand-alone PAD rehabilitation programme.
      The study would investigate the possible positive and negative impact on both the PAD and CR
      patient groups in attending a combined rehabilitation programme of exercise and education. It
      will also look at the perceptions of the participants regarding the treatment programme
      itself.
