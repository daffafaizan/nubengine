           main coronary bifurcation lesions.

        2. Background: Solid evidence is scant to compare the protective effect between JBT and JWT
           during PCI for non-left main coronary bifurcation lesions.

        3. Study design: This is a multi-center, prospective, randomized study.

        4. Methods

      4a. Study populations: Patients with non-left main coronary bifurcation lesions(Medina 1,1,1
      ), which SBs are less than 2.5mm and more than 1mm, are enrolled in this study. Patients are
      randomized to JBT group and JWT group.

      4b. Procedure: For patients enrolled in JBT group, a monorail balloon is placed at the ostium
      of SB to protect the SB before the stent in main branch(MB) is deployed. Only a PTCA wire
      would be placed in the SB while stenting MB for patients randomized in JWT group. Only
      drug-eluting stent should be implanted in the target vessel.
