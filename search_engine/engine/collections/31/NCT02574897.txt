      arms (autologous transplant vs. allogeneic transplant). Peak symptom burden will also be
      compared between the two study arms within both subgroups of patients (myeloablative vs.
      reduced intensity conditioning). Secondary outcomes that will also be compared between the
      two arms include: changes in patient-reported quality of life, time to supportive care
      treatment changes, length of hospital stay, thirty day readmission rate after discharge, days
      alive and out of the hospital in the 100 days since admission, and overall survival.
      Additionally, measures of physical activity will be captured through physiological monitoring
      in order to explore associations with patient-reported symptom measures. Patient and
      clinician satisfaction will also be evaluated.

      In this study, the investigators will use an electronic survey to assess 16 patient-reported
      symptoms to calculate a symptom score that may range from 0-61 each day. This symptom score
      represents the symptom burden for the patient on that particular day. Symptom burden is
      anticipated to peak between days 7 and 14, so the investigators will define peak symptom
      burden as the average of the symptom scores on days 7, 10 and 14. In both arms, symptoms will
      be assessed on these days in order to compare peak burden.
