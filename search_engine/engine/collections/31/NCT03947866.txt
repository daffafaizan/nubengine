        1. To evaluate the efficacy of a fixed combination of ezetimibe-simvastatin in patients
           with hypercholesterolemia to improve the lipid profile (HDL-C ↑, T-CHOL, Triglycerides
           ↓).

        2. Evaluation of the response of patients with hypercholesterolemia who received a fixed
           combination of ezetimibe-simvastatin to achieve a target according to the category of
           total cardiovascular risk to which they belong.

        3. To evaluate the efficacy of a stable combination of ezetimibe and simvastatin in
           patients with hypercholesterolemia in improving non-HDL-cholesterol (non-HDL-C) levels.

        4. Safety assessment through the recording of Adverse Events during the study.
