      levels of emotional and psychological challenges in their transition to parenthood. This can
      adversely affect their breastfeeding experiences and general well-being, and is associated
      with stress, anxiety, and postnatal depression. While family psycho-education and other
      supportive group programmes are available in health services, they require face-to-face
      education sessions over a long interval, high engagement, and trusting relationships, and
      thus often result in low attendance and high drop outs.

      Mothers have expressed the need for psychological support of peer counsellors, which would
      allow them to support each other. The first month postpartum is a critical period for
      sustaining exclusive breastfeeding and the time when mothers are at high risk of postpartum
      depression. For Chinese mothers in Hong Kong, however, they are often housebound during this
      period due to the tradition of "doing the month", and thus often find it difficult to attend
      support groups or seek help. In view of these challenges faced by primiparous mothers, a
      home-based peer support programme is proposed.

      This randomized control trial adopts a two-arm design to examine the effectiveness of a
      home-based peer support programme for women with low breastfeeding self-efficacy. It is
      hypothesized that those receiving the intervention, when compared to the controls, will have
      (1) longer period of exclusive breastfeeding, (2) higher postnatal breastfeeding
      self-efficacy, and (3) lower post-partum depressive symptoms.
