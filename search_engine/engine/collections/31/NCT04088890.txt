    
      Primary Objective:

        -  Determine the feasibility of manufacturing CD22 CAR T cells using the Miltenyi CliniMACS
           ProdigyÂ® system for administration to adults with relapsed/refractory CD22 expressing
           B-cell ALL or relapsed/refractory aggressive B-cell non hodgkins lymphoma (NHL).

        -  Establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of CD22 CAR T
           cells in adults with relapsed/refractory aggressive B-cell NHL.

        -  Determine the safety of an established dose of CD22-CAR T cells in adults with
           relapsed/refractory CD22 expressing B-cell ALL and the safety of the MTD/RP2D of
           CD22-CAR T cells in adults with relapsed/refractory aggressive B-cell NHL.

      Secondary Objective:

      - Assess the clinical activity of CD22-CAR T cells in adults with R/R CD22 expressing B-cell
      ALL and R/R aggressive B-cell NHL, including overall survival (OS) and progressive free
      survival (PFS).
