      mechanisms of actions are different. Their toxicity is also different, but both spare normal
      hemopoietic stem cells. STI 571 is well tolerated, while conventional *IFN is poorly
      tolerated, especially in the elderly. PEG *IFNs are going to substitute for conventional
      *IFNs because of a better pharmacokinetic and toxicity profile and because require less
      injections (once a week vs. once a day).Resistance to IFN (6-13) and to STI571 (29-34) occurs
      in vitro and in vivo, where it increases with time for IFN and is also expected to increase
      with time for STI571. STI571 and IFN have different mechanisms of action and it has been
      shown in vitro that the combination of STI571 with alfaIFN is more toxic than either agent
      alone against Ph positive cells (35-37). Therefore, a combination of STI 571 with a PEG *IFN
      is worth testing. A phase II, dose-finding, exploratory study is required to investigate
      feasibility, toxicity, safety and tolerability of the combination. In CML, PEG INTRON studies
      are more advanced than PEGASIS studies. These considerations provide the rationale for this
      phase II study of STI 571 and PEG INTRON in CML.
