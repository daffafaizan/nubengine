      treated with fluorouracil and leucovorin calcium with vs without oxaliplatin vs oxaliplatin
      alone. II. Compare the response rate, time to tumor-related symptomatic worsening, time to
      disease progression, onset and duration of complete and partial responses, and duration of
      disease stabilization in patients treated with these regimens. III. Determine the safety
      profile of these regimens in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified
      according to Karnofsky performance status (50-60% vs 70-100%), number of metastatic organs (1
      vs 2 or more), and LDH value (up to 1.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN) vs greater than 1.5
      times ULN). Patients are randomized to one of three treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive
      leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours followed by fluorouracil IV continuously over 22 hours on
      days 1 and 2. Arm II: Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1. Arm III:
      Patients receive oxaliplatin IV concurrently with leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours followed
      by fluorouracil IV continuously over 22 hours on day 1. Leucovorin calcium and fluorouracil
      are administered alone on day 2 on the same schedule as on day 1. Treatment repeats every 2
      weeks for up to 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Patients are followed for 30 days, every 2 weeks for up to 3 months, and then every 3 months
      thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 786 patients (262 per arm) will be accrued for this study
      within 12 months.
