      adult outpatients with AN. 160 individuals with AN, ages > 18, will be randomly assigned to
      receive olanzapine or placebo for 16 weeks together with a medication management treatment.
      Primary outcomes will include weight gain as well as psychological symptoms known to be
      associated with AN, including obsessionality, mood, and anxiety.

      This project is based on evidence from a recently completed 8-week pilot study comparing the
      efficacy of olanzapine to placebo in outpatients with AN (PI: Evelyn Attia, MD), as well as a
      recently published 12-week trial of olanzapine vs placebo (Bissada et al, Am J Psychiatry,
      2007) in which outpatient treatment with olanzapine was associated with weight improvement,
      improved psychological status, and no untoward metabolic effects among low-weight patients.

      The investigators hypothesize that among underweight adult outpatients with AN receiving
      olanzapine vs. placebo, together with medication management treatment: 1)patients with AN
      receiving olanzapine will gain weight at a faster rate than those receiving placebo; and 2)
      patients with AN receiving olanzapine will demonstrate greater reduction in psychological
      symptoms, including obsessionality, mood, anxiety and eating disorder symptoms, than those
      receiving placebo.
