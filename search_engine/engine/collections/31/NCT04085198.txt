      touch' vaginal hysteroscopy does not require a speculum or tenaculum; thus, confers
      advantages in terms of patient discomfort over the traditional technique. The source of the
      pain in traditional hysteroscopy is the distention of the uterine cavity with the saline and
      the contact of the hysteroscopy equipment with the vagina and the cervical canal. The benefit
      in the pain obtained with the 'no-touch' technique is derived from the limitation of the
      contact of the hysteroscopy equipment with the vagina and the cervical canal. Clinicians
      performing the hysteroscopy find their way from the vaginal introitus to the uterine cavity
      through direct visualization of the anatomic structures on their route.

      Physics has been critical in the development of endoscopic techniques such as laparoscopy,
      cystoscopy, and hysteroscopy. The light source provides an illumined environment during the
      imagination with these techniques. During hysteroscopy, the light reflecting from the
      adjacent tissue appears bright, however, this reflection is weaker in farther tissue and
      these structures appear dark. With this in mind, the investigators hypothesize that the
      utilization of the information derived from the 'light physics' would facilitate camera
      navigation during no-touch hysteroscopy and consequently ease reaching the uterus. This study
      aimed to compare the standard no-touch technique with the 'light physics' enhanced camera
      navigation in terms of patient comfort and procedural pain.
