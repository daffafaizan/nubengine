      gemcitabine will be assessed in participants with advanced pancreatic cancer. In this dose
      escalation combination study, participants with advanced pancreatic cancer will receive
      escalating doses of AB680 in combination with Zimberelimab at the recommended phase 2 dose
      (RP2D), and nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine at standard doses. AB680, Zimberelimab,
      nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine are all administered via IV infusion.

      In the dose expansion phase of the study, participants with advanced pancreatic cancer will
      receive AB680 at the RP2D determined from the dose escalation study in combination with
      Zimberelimab at the RP2D and nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine at standard doses or AB680 at the
      RP2D in combination with nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine at standard doses.
