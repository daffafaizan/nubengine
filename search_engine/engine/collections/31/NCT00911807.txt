      various cellular pathways and allow proper neuronal function, survival and regeneration.
      Sufficient supply is therefore regarded as a pre-requisite for neuronal maintenance but
      sudden or chronic pathological changes result in an imbalance of this regulatory system.

      Cerebrolysin is a peptide preparation acting in a similar way like endogenous neurotrophic
      factors. Due to its pleiotropic effects - neuroprotection, neuronal survival, neuroplasticity
      and neurogenesis -, Cerebrolysin is regarded as potential therapeutic tool in complex
      diseases like stroke or dementia. In contrast to naturally occurring neurotrophic factors,
      neuropeptides of Cerebrolysin enter the brain parenchyma by crossing the blood-brain barrier
      after peripheral (intravenous [IV]) administration.

      Another treatment approach for Alzheimer's disease targets the cholinergic system to increase
      cortical acetylcholine. One of these drugs is the anticholinesterase donepezil (Aricept).
      However, anticholinesterases seem to provide only symptomatic benefit for a limited period
      and not to influence the progression of the disease. In view of the different mechanisms of
      action and clinical profile of Cerebrolysin and Aricept, a combination therapy of both may
      provide synergistic treatment effects. The combination of a treatment targeting the
      neurotrophic axis (Cerebrolysin) with a treatment to improve cholinergic neurotransmission
      (Aricept) can arguably be expected to provide additional benefits to AD patients.
