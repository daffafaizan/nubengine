      provides subjects with signals (or "advisories") that they can see and hear to predict their
      "likelihood" of having a seizure. It does this by monitoring signals in the brain. A
      secondary purpose of the study is to learn whether the advisories improve subject quality of
      life or that of their caregiver.

      The SAS is made up of three main components that work together to monitor the subject's brain
      signals and then relay their information to the subject: the leads, the implantable telemetry
      unit (ITU), and the personal advisory device (PAD). The leads will be placed on different
      areas of the subject's brain to record electrical signals. The leads are tunneled down the
      neck to an ITU that is implanted in the chest, similar to a pacemaker. The ITU wirelessly
      transmits information to the PAD, which is carried like a pager. It records and processes
      brain signals and may be able to advise subjects when a seizure is likely or unlikely to
      occur.

      Following implantation with the SAS, subjects will return for five study visits for
      neurological examinations and quality of life assessments. Throughout the study, subjects
      must maintain their SAS; which includes daily recharging and data card replacement.
