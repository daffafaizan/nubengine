    
      Patients will be evaluated for eligibility and then, after gaining informed consent, the
      surgical procedure will be scheduled. Baseline evaluations include physical/neurological
      examination, nerve conduction study and ultrasonography of the sural nerve, and testing for
      erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein and complete blood counts (with white
      blood cell differential). Surgery is done in an operating room under local or monitored
      anesthesia, depending on patient preference. An incision will be made above the ankle.
      Immediately after the surgery, the patient will repeat the baseline physical/neurological
      exams, and sural nerve ultrasonography.

      Participants will be evaluated either in the clinic or by phone on a regular basis and will
      be required to keep a journal and fill out symptom questionnaires for up to 12 months
      post-procedure.

      Development of a grade 4 local reaction at any time will fulfill criteria for review by the
      Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) for implant removal and definition as a failure.
