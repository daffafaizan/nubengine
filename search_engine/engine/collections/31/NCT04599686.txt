      cancer. Ga-68 PSMA PET/CT has high accuracy in the diagnosis metastases from prostate cancer.
      In this protocol, pretreatment Ga-68 PSMA PET/ CT shall be performed in all patients.

      ADT is considered standard of care treatment for advanced prostate cancer. But hormonal
      therapy can have side effects that greatly trouble men and lead to castration-resistant
      prostate cancer (CRPC). Any effort to delay the start of hormonal therapy would be an
      advantage to the patient. Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is highly focused
      radiation, given in a very dose intensive fashion and delivered in usually less than one
      week. SBRT has been shown to be very effective on bone or lymph nodes metastases. Therefore,
      we are studying the safety and feasibility of SBRT on patients with five or fewer prostate
      cancer bone or lymph nodes metastases to determine if we can stall the use of hormonal
      therapy and/or prevent other site metastases from developing elsewhere in the body.
