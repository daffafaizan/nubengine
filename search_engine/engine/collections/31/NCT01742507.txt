    
      This is a prospective, randomised, assessor-blinded, single centre study. Patients with
      symptomatic coronary artery diseases in 2 or 3 coronary vessels requiring PCI are eligible
      for the study. PCI will be performed in the usual manner to all the study lesions in the same
      procedure. In a randomized fashion, each patient will have one artery with critical
      disease(s) treated by the Resolute Integrity Stent(s) and the other artery treated by the
      Biomatrix Stent(s).

      Baseline OCT data will be obtained right after stenting. The remaining coronary artery, if
      diseased and required PCI treatment, will be treated during the angiographic and OCT
      follow-up as a staged procedure. Patients will be randomly assigned into 5 groups with equal
      number, receiving a follow-up coronary angiogram with OCT from 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 months
      interval post-intervention. Each patient will serve as his/her own control comparing the 2
      types of stents. At 9-month post-intervention, all patients will receive a second follow-up
      coronary angiogram with OCT. All OCT data analyses will be performed in a blinded fashion by
      a core laboratory. Phone follow up will be carried out for cardiac events at 1 year and 2
      year of post intervention.
