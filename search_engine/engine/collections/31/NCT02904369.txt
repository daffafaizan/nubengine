    
      The purpose of this multi-center Phase I protocol, titled Exploratory Pharmacokinetic and
      Pharmacodynamic Study of Oral F/TAF for the Prevention of HIV Acquisition is to assess local
      and systemic pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and safety characteristics of
      three oral tablets: F/TAF (200/10 mg), F/TAF (200/25 mg) and F/TDF (200/300 mg).

      The study will enroll healthy, non-pregnant, HIV negative, premenopausal women (aged 18-50)
      who are not at risk of pregnancy and will have two phases: a Single Dose phase (one site
      only) and a Multiple Dose phase (all three sites).

      The enrollment goal is for approximately 72 participants to complete the study. All 72 women
      are expected to undergo the Multiple Dose phase and the 24 women expected to complete the
      study at the EVMS site are also expected to undergo the Single Dose phase.

      In the Single Dose phase, approximately 24 women will be randomized to one of two products:
      F/TAF (200/25 mg) or F/TDF (200/300 mg), and will undergo blood, cervicovaginal (CV), and
      rectal sample collections before and after a single dose for PK and PD assessments. In the
      Multiple Dose phase, approximately 72 women will be randomized to one of three products:
      F/TAF (200/10 mg), F/TAF (200/25 mg) or F/TDF (200/300 mg), and will undergo blood, CV, and
      rectal sample collections for PK and PD assessments before, during and after two weeks of
      daily dosing.
