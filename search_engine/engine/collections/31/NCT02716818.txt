      their standard therapy. Subjects will attend the study site in the morning and have
      17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP) and androstenedione (A4) levels assessed at 15:00, 17:00,
      19:00, 21:00, 23:00, 01:00, 03:00, 05:00, 07:00, 09:00, 11:00, 13:00 and 15:00. Safety
      laboratory tests, a DEXA scan for body composition, and height, weight and waist
      circumference will be recorded. Subjects will then be randomised to Chronocort® or to
      continue on their standard care. Randomisation will be stratified by baseline treatment:

        1. hydrocortisone only or

        2. prednisone or prednisolone, alone or in combination with hydrocortisone

        3. dexamethasone only or in combination with any other glucorticoid

      The initial dose setting at the start of the Chronocort® treatment will be based on
      hydrocortisone dose equivalent of baseline therapy in accordance with standard clinical
      practice. Further dose refinement/titration will be conducted in both treatment groups as
      necessary after 4 weeks and 12 weeks using a standardised titration algorithm after the
      subject has been re-admitted for further 24-hour endocrine profiles. Safety endpoints will
      also be measured at the 07:00 morning sample of each 24-hour profile assessment day. The
      decision to change doses in both treatment groups will be made by a central independent
      blinded physician, with the actual change in dose then being made by the local investigator
      looking after the subject. At 6 months, all the baseline tests will be repeated (including
      the 24-hour profile). All subjects may then continue on Chronocort®, whatever their
      randomised treatment, as part of an open-label extension study (to be conducted under a
      separate protocol). Stress doses of hydrocortisone will be given throughout the study for
      intercurrent illnesses as medically indicated according to "sick day rules".
