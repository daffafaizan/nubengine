    
      This study consists of two parts. Part A is an open-label dose-escalation phase in which
      participants are enrolled in cohorts and will receive one of approximately three escalating
      doses of OXB-102 (AXO-Lenti-PD). Part B is a randomized, double-blind phase in which
      participants will be randomized to either an active group receiving the selected dose from
      Part A, or to a control group receiving an imitation surgical procedure (ISP).
