      neurophysiology, molecular and genetic biomarker discovery, brain imaging, and a clinical
      trial.These data will be utilized to characterize post-traumatic headache and build
      univariate and multivariate predictive models for post-traumatic headache persistence and for
      the response to post-traumatic headache treatment. These studies are described in more detail
      within a separate clinicaltrials.gov record.

      The clinical trial is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled investigation of
      erenumab for the treatment of post-traumatic headache. Participants will be randomized when
      PTH has been present for 35-56 days. Follow-up questionnaires, headache diary data, pain
      threshold results, and brain imaging data will be collected longitudinally during the
      clinical trial to assess for changes over time and associations of such changes with
      post-traumatic headache treatment outcomes.
