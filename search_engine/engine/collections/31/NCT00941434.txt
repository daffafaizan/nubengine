      To evaluate the effectiveness of Ready to Use Therapeutic food and food supplement
      (Nutributter) in the treatment of Moderate and Severe malnutrition in rural Pakistan when
      administered at community level

      Primary objectives:

        -  To assess the acceptability, feasibility and effectiveness of Nutributter and Fortified
           supplementary food (RUTF) in the treatment of moderate malnutrition in children less
           than three years of age in community settings.

        -  To assess the acceptability, feasibility and effectiveness of RUTF in the treatment of
           severe malnutrition in children less than three years of age in community settings.

      Methodology:

      Study Design: Community based, step wedge randomized trial

      Sample size estimation:

      Total Population of the study area: 60268. Estimated under 5 years of age Population: 9040
      (Assuming 15% of Total population. Estimated Population between 6 months to 3 years: 4520
      (Assuming 50% of Under 5 Population)

      Sample Size for Moderate Malnutrition:

      It is estimated that the Prevalence of Moderately Malnourished: 20% Therefore 20% of 4520:
      904. We anticipate recruiting 1000 cases (96 about 10% extra for any loss to follow-ups or
      drop outs)

      Sample Size For Severe Malnutrition:

      It is estimated that the prevalence of Severe Acute Malnutrition is 8%. Therefore 8% of 4520:
      360. We anticipate recruiting 400 cases (40 about 10% extra for any loss to follow-ups or
      drop outs)
