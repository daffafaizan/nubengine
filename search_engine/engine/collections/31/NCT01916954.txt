      artemether-lumefantrine to a 5-day regimen of artemether-lumefantrine in a group of pregnant
      women and a control of non-pregnant women with uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria. The
      pharmacokinetics of lumefantrine is modified in pregnancy and the standard regimen used for
      treatment of adults might not be sufficient to cure malaria, therefore exposing pregnant
      women to sub-therapeutic drug levels and increased risk of clinical failure. Previous
      pharmacokinetic studies have shown that the standard 3-day treatment during pregnancy results
      in reduced plasma concentrations of artemether, dihydroartemisinin and lumefantrine and a
      faster elimination of lumefantrine. Low lumefantrine plasma concentrations at day 7 are
      associated with therapeutic failure. Population-based simulations suggest that increased dose
      and treatment duration are needed for adequate drug exposure in these patients. We propose to
      assess the pharmacokinetics of a longer regimen of artemether-lumefantrine, (10 doses of
      artemether-lumefantrine over five days) compared to the standard regimen, (6 doses of
      artemether-lumefantrine over three days) in a small group of pregnant African women with
      uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria. The longer regimen should ensure that curative plasma
      concentration of lumefantrine is reached, and is unlikely to result in any increased
      frequency of adverse events.
