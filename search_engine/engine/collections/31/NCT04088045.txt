      the pes anserine complex offered better treatment effectiveness as compared with IA PRP
      alone. In this two-year study, patients with moderate to severe degrees of knee OA will be
      recruited and divided into 3 groups. The high frequency PRP injection method will be applied
      (weekly PRP injections for a total of 3 weeks). Group 1 will receive knee IA PRP injections
      only. Group 2 will receive simultaneous knee IA PRP injections and PRP injections to the pes
      anserine complex. Group 3 will receive simultaneous knee IA PRP injections and PRP injections
      to the pes anserine complex, as well as to the genicular nerve blocks using 5% dextrose
      solution. We hypothesize that patients in group 3 will have better treatment outcomes. The
      effectiveness will be examined using proteomics, isokinetic measurements and functional scale
      evaluations. Upon the completion of this study, we will be able to gather adequate scientific
      evidences as to which injection approach and what PRP injection frequency is a better option
      in treating patients with moderate to severe degrees of knee OA.
