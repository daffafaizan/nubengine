      disorder, will receive 6 sessions of ABMT, adapted for an oddball paradigm. two of the
      sessions will also include simultaneous EEG measurement. the goal of the study is to
      determine the emergence of vMMN in response to trials deviating the embedded contingency and
      to examine the correlation between vMMN emergence and clinical improvement of anxiety
      symptoms.
