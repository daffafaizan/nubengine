    
      All patients will receive 6ml /kg/h Ringer acetate solution as a maintenance intraoperative
      fluid. If pulse pressure variations (PPV) is more than 15%, the patient will be considered as
      fluid responder and will receive a 250-ml bolus of albumin 5% to maintain PPV ≤15%. Blood
      transfusion will be given based on a hemoglobin level (< 7 g/dl) in both (control group) and
      (terlipressin group). Other blood products will be transfused guided by lab result; Fresh
      frozen plasma will be given when INR > 2 and platelets will be given when platelets
      <30.000/mm3. The patients will be randomly allocated into 2 groups; Group T (Terlipressin
      group) and group S (Normal saline 0.9%).

      For (terlipressin group) all patients will receive loading dose of terlipressin (1mg diluted
      with 50 ml of normal saline 0.9% solution over 30 min) and it will be maintained by
      continuous infusion at rate of 160 μg per hour (8 ml/h).

      For (control group) all patient will receive 50 ml of normal saline 0.9% solution over 30 min
      and will be maintained continuous infusion at rate of 8 ml/h.

      Drugs will be prepared by the nurse and the investigator will be blinded to the drug given.
