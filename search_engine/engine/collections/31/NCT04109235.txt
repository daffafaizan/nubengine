      appointments at the East Elgin Family Health Team (EEFHT). Participants will be randomized
      1:1 using computer-generated randomization software to receive either a population-based,
      standard activity intervention (control group) or a high-intensity interval training (HIIT)
      intervention, which they will complete on their own time, at the location of their choosing
      (at home, gym, outside, or elsewhere). Data will be collected at baseline (T1), and
      participants will be followed up after 3 months (T2) and 6 months (T3). All data acquisition
      is from standard of care (i.e. patients are already seen every 3 months for diabetes visits).
      Data collection at T1, T2 and T3 will include:

        -  Weight and Height (measured using the Health-O-Meter weigh scale, used to calculate BMI)

        -  Minutes of PA (self-reported by participants using the log books designed for this
           study)

        -  HbA1C (requisition will be provided by Dr. Fernando. Patients will be exempt from
           completing the baseline HbA1C if they have had a HbA1C measurement in the past 30 days &
           the patient has not made significant lifestyle changes or had any blood glucose
           medications changed; in this case, the measurement completed in the past 30 days will be
           used as the baseline measure)

        -  Blood glucose and blood pressure medications
