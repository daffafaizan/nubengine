      processing in BD and MDD subjects using fMRI. Subjects who meet criteria for a major
      depressive episode in the context of BD (n=15); MDD (n=15) and a group of psychiatrically
      unaffected control subjects (CS, n=15) will undergo four fMRI scans while experiencing a
      temporary mood induction through the presentation of affective imagery from the International
      Affective Picture System (IAPS). Both BD and MDD subjects will receive the same combination
      pharmacotherapy to treat the depression, with fMRI data acquired before, and 1, 3, 6 weeks
      following pharmacotherapy initiation. Positive, negative, and neutral affective visual
      stimuli will be presented in a blocked design.

      Comparison(s): The effects of time and group will be analyzed in factorial models. Regions of
      interest that demonstrate significant group-by-time interactions will be further correlated
      with self-report and clinician-rated psychometric indices.
