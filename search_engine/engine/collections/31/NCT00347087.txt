      insulin levels and impaired effectiveness of insulin to utilise glucose in peripheral
      tissues, mainly in skeletal muscle tissue. Additionally, impaired insulin sensitivity, i.e.
      insulin resistance, progresses in parallel to severity of CHF and relates to major clinical
      symptoms such as reduced exercise capacity and muscle fatigue. In survival analyses, insulin
      resistance is a significant predictor of mortality, independently of and additionally to
      other established prognostic markers such as age, NYHA class, peak oxygen consumption, or
      LVEF. These findings indicate that insulin resistance is involved in CHF pathophysiology.
      Importantly, insulin resistance in CHF occurs independently of ischemic etiology. In
      ischaemic heart disease, however, insulin resistance as part of the metabolic syndrome is
      also an important prerequisite for the development of arteriosclerosis. Accordingly insulin
      resistance was found worst in CHF patients with ischemic etiology compared to patients with
      CHF due to dilated cardiomyopathy and those with ischaemic heart disease without heart
      failure. On the basis of these findings we hypothesise that therapeutically improving insulin
      sensitivity may have additional beneficial effects on energy utilisation and therefore
      improve clinical symptoms such as reduced exercise capacity and muscle fatigue.
