      logically after a reflection on the treatment of pain generated by the care in the department
      of Pneumology 1 / septic Thoracic and vascular Cardiac Surgery.

      The arterial puncture for blood gas analysis is an act with aim diagnosis which allows to
      study gases of the arterial blood to watch the hematosis of the patient. This act appears at
      the top of the anticipated care as painful by the nursing teams.

      In the literature, we find no study carried out with the eutectic mixture lidocaïne
      prilocaïne. Other local anesthetics and other local ways of administration were estimated and
      the results diverge as for the efficiency of a local anesthetic for the arterial blood sample
      at the level radial nerve. Finally authors showed a correlation between certain
      factors(mailmen) and the painful character of the arterial blood sample, without defining
      really of population.

      In this context, it is necessary to estimate the interest of a local anesthetic before
      arterial sampling of blood by a study randomized in insu double and versus placebo.
