      VA Medical Center. Subjects will be screened and enter a 2-week run-in period during which
      they will switch to or continue on a diabetes treatment regimen of basal insulin before
      supper and aspart insulin before meals. Run-in will be useful in evaluating compliance to
      treatment and self-monitoring. After run-in, subjects will collect one week of baseline
      glycemic data with regular pre-meal and fasting glycemic levels using both finger stick
      testing and continuous glucose monitoring.

      Subjects will be randomized at Visit 3 to 100 mg of canagliflozin or placebo. If well
      tolerated, this dose will be increased to 300 mg of canagliflozin or placebo at Visit 4.

      Diabetes management will be assured through regular contact with the study team (weekly calls
      and clinic visits at Weeks 4, 8, 16 and 24). Management will be facilitated by diabetes
      management software. Self-monitoring and continuous glucose monitoring will be repeated at
      the end of study participation.
