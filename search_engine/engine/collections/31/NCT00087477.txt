    
      Rationale: Pivanex is a histone deacetylase inhibitor that induces tumor differentiation,
      inhibits proliferation, and induces apoptosis. Pivanex has been generally well tolerated in
      clinical trials and has shown preliminary evidence of efficacy in patients with non-small
      cell lung cancer. Pivanex has shown in-vitro and in-vivo evidence of anti-tumor activity
      against melanoma and, therefore, represents a promising therapeutic approach to patients with
      malignant melanoma.

      Purpose: This open-label trial will determine the response rate of Pivanex in patients with
      malignant melanoma.

      Objectives:

        -  Determine time to disease progression

        -  Determine overall survival

        -  Determine the safety profile of Pivanex in malignant melanoma

      Outline: This is an open-label, single center study in patients with malignant melanoma whose
      disease has progressed or failed to respond to chemotherapy or Interleukin-2 (IL-2). Patients
      will be treated with 2.5 g/m2 of Pivanex administered intravenously over 6 hours daily on
      Days 1 - 3.

      Treatment will be repeated every 21 days until tumor progression or the patient is withdrawn
      from treatment for other protocol-specified reasons. Tumor status will be assessed prior to
      every odd-numbered treatment cycle using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
      (RECIST) method. Patients who continue to experience tumor response or stabilization at the
      time treatment is discontinued will be followed every 12 weeks for tumor status until disease
      progression.
