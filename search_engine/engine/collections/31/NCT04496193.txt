      Assessment criteria:

      1. Efficacy:

        1. The intensity of pain was assessed using a 0 to 10 Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) to
           quantify their degree of pain; where 0 means no pain and 10 the worst pain imaginable.

        2. The analgesic activity was assessed using standard measures during the 48-hour treatment
           period: baseline pain intensity, time to rescue medication, and overall patient
           evaluation of study medication.

      2. Safety:

        1. Record the hemodynamic parameters during the 60-minute observation period in the
           anesthesia recovery room.

        2. The severity of postoperative side effects (nausea, vomiting, pruritus) was quantified
           using different scales. Other side effects, including dizziness and drowsiness, are also
           recorded.

        3. Motor block is assessed using Modified Bromage Scale.

      3. Pharmacokinetics: None

      4. Quality of life:

        1. analgesic activity and duration of action

        2. patient satisfaction
