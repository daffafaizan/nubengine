      patients is very variable, and not too well-argued, especially in the context of prevention
      and individuation of risk factors.

      The increase of surgical management of hernias reparation in renal transplant patients
      justifies the start of a mon-centric type study. The investigators will look for risk factors
      with a retrospective, observational study, by analyzing the type of surgical repair of their
      post-surgical wall defect.

      The analysis of costs/benefits on postoperative, intraoperative, or preoperative prevention
      will be taken into account.
