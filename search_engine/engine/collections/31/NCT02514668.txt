      to 3 weeks, the treatment period and, a follow up period. Treatment with SAR650984
      (isatuximab) may continue until disease progression, unacceptable adverse event, or other
      reason for discontinuation.

      After study treatment discontinuation, an end of treatment visit will be done at 30 days to
      assess safety and PK, and at 30 and 60 days for anti-drug antibody (ADA). If the ADA is
      positive at Day 60, ADA will be repeated every 30 days until ADA is negative.

      Patients with partial remission or better who discontinue treatment for reasons other than
      progression of disease will be followed monthly until progression or initiation of subsequent
      therapy, the final analysis cutoff date, whichever comes first.
