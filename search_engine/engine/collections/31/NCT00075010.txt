      inhibitors. It has been shown that both DNA methylation and histone deacetylation work
      together in affecting gene expression.

      Therefore, drugs that inhibit DNA methylation and those that inhibit histone deacetylase can
      reactivate silenced genes in combination better than they can individually. Decitabine (5
      aza-2'deoxycytidine), a drug that produces marked DNA hypomethylator, has demonstrated
      antileukemic activity at low doses. There are several drugs that have been shown to have
      histone acetylase activity. One of these is valproic acid that has been used safely for many
      years as an anti-seizure medication.
