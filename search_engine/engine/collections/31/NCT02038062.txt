      40 patients. In 20 patients sevoflurane preconditioning is performed five minutes before
      ischemic preconditioning by inducing sevoflurane anesthesia for five minutes. Muscle tissue
      oxygenation is measured bilaterally in the anterior tibial muscle by near-infrared
      spectroscopy (INVOS, SOMANETICS, Troy, Michigan/ USA) during preconditioning and following
      ischemia.Clinically relevant ischemia was defined as a decrease of tissue oxygen saturation
      to 95 % of baseline.
