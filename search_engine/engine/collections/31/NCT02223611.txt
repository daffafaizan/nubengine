      cancer patients are alive 5years or more after diagnosis. Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
      accounts for more than 85% of all lung cancer cases.

      For individuals with stage Ⅱ-ⅢA NSCLC after complete resection, platinum-based chemotherapy
      is the mainstay of first line treatment. Various treatment regimens have been developed to
      improve survival.

      S-1 capsule is an novel oral anticancer drug that combines tegafur, a prodrug of
      5-fluorouracil, with gimeracil and oteracil potassium. S-1 capsule was considered to be an
      active single agent against NSCLC.
