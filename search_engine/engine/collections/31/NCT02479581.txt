      postoperative care concept initiated in the early 1990s aiming to reduce the length of
      hospital stays following elective abdominal surgery. The success of ERAS depends highly on
      multidisciplinary teamwork and patient compliance.

      This study intends to compare the Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) concept applied to
      patients with heart valve disease undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass
      under traditional perioperative management of patients, committed to reducing patient's
      physical and psychological stress by surgical trauma, achieve the purpose of fast recovery,
      in order to establish an effective perioperative management during cardiopulmonary bypass
      surgery, improve patients' satisfaction and to accelerate postoperative rehabilitation
      safely.
