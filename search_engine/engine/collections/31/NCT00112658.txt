      Primary

        -  Compare the objective response rate in patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the
           pancreas treated with oxaliplatin, irinotecan, leucovorin calcium, and fluorouracil vs
           gemcitabine as first-line chemotherapy. (Phase II)

        -  Compare the survival of patients treated with these regimens. (Phase III)

      Secondary

        -  Compare the toxicity of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Compare progression-free survival of patients treated with these regimens. (Phase III)

        -  Compare the overall response rate in patients treated with these regimens. (Phase III)

        -  Compare quality of life of patients treated with these regimens. (Phase III)

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment
      arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours, irinotecan IV over 1Â½ hours,
           leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours, and fluorouracil IV over 5 minutes on day 1 and
           fluorouracil IV continuously over 46 hours on days 1 and 2. Courses repeat every 14
           days.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive gemcitabine IV on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, 36, and 43. Beginning
           on day 57, patients receive gemcitabine IV once weekly for 3 weeks (days 57, 64, and
           71). Courses repeat every 28 days.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 348 patients (88 for phase II and 260 for phase III) will be
      accrued for this study.
