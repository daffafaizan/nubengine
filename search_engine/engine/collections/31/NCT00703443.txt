      cardiomyopathies. Cardiomyopathies are serious medical conditions that result in a wide range
      of cardiac problems, from no symptoms at all to heart failure. The underlying genetics of
      cardiomyopathies are poorly understood. This study will collect personal, family, and medical
      history information to create a database of participants with cardiomyopathies. This
      information will be used to identify inheritance patterns within families with
      cardiomyopathies. In addition, samples from participants will be studied in the lab to see if
      any changes in their genetic information can be identified that would cause a cardiomyopathy.
      Overall, the research study is aimed at determining the cause of these cardiac conditions so
      that tests and treatments might be developed in the future.
