      ratio (55 subjects in each group). Subjects with a weight of at least 25 kg but less than 60
      kg will receive a single IV dose of 1 g cefazolin. Subjects with a weight of at least 60 kg
      will receive a single IV dose of 2 g cefazolin. Dose groups will not be balanced by age or
      gender. Additional subjects may be enrolled if necessary to ensure at least 50 evaluable
      subjects with complete safety data per dose group complete the study.

      In a subset of approximately 40 subjects, 4 PK samples will be obtained to determine the
      cefazolin plasma concentrations in this population.
