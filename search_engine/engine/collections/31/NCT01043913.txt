      Fatigue in patients undergoing Chemotherapy treatment for Breast Cancer. After approval by
      our Institutional Review Board, we included consenting patients with a histological diagnosis
      of Breast Cancer for whom Chemotherapy was indicated.

      Patients who agreed to participate in the study were submitted initially to a screening
      interview with the Brief Fatigue Inventory questionnaire from MD Anderson. If the patient
      presented with a severe fatigue, anemia (HB<11.0), hypothyroidism or psychiatric disorders
      she was excluded. If she presented with a mild or moderate fatigue the follow up continued
      and the patient was assessed 21 days later after her first cycle of chemotherapy with the
      same questionnaire. If an increase in fatigue levels occurred from mild to moderate, mild to
      severe or moderate to severe the patient was randomly assigned to receive either Guaraná 50mg
      or a placebo p.o. q12 for 21 days. At this moment the patient answered a General
      questionnaire, FACIT-F, FACIT-ES, HADS, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and Chalder Fatigue
      Questionnaire (Day 1).

      After the second cycle of chemotherapy the patient underwent a "wash out" period of 7 days
      without any intervention, and after that period she received placebo or Guaraná according to
      the cross over design after answering for the second time the questionnaires above (Day 29)
      and also the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v3.0 (CTCAE). After 21 days (Day
      42) she was assessed again with the same questionnaires used in the second interview.

      The patient's cancer diagnosis, treatment history, concurrent medication was recorded during
      the pretreatment and The Brief Fatigue Inventory was answered before each assessment.
