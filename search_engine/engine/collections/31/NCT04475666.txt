      will enroll subjects in intensive care unit. Patients will be randomized on day 4 of ICU
      admission. Until ICU day 4, protein requirement will be provided according to the local
      practice as long as no intravenous amino acids are given and the average protein intake in
      the first 4 days does not exceed 0.8 g/kg/day. On ICU day 4, patients will be randomized to
      one of the two treatment groups: one with standard prescription without supplemental proteins
      (maximum1.2 g/kg/day) from the primary polymeric formula and another group will receive the
      standard amount of proteins (maximum 1.2 g/kg/day) from the primary polymeric formula AND
      supplemental protein at 1.2 g/kg/day.

      Randomization will be stratified by suspected COVID-19 and then by site and the use of renal
      replacement therapy at the time of randomization (intermittent hemodialysis or continuous
      renal replacement therapy.
