      knee osteoarthritis (LE-OA) using an occupational therapy treatment approach to promote
      activity engagement. We believe that it is necessary to tailor this intervention to the
      specific needs of older adults with LE-OA. Based on the literature, exercise is a necessary
      component of an intervention for older adults with LE-OA. However, this should also be
      coupled with an Activity Strategy Training (AST) component designed to promote lifestyle
      changes and thus more lasting effects. The AST component is based on occupational therapy
      principles and will include behavioral and environmental strategies to increase activity
      engagement.
