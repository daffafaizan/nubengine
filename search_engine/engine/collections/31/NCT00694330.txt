    
      -  Participants will undergo a craniotomy (brain surgery) to remove as much of the tumor as
           possible from their brain. A pathologist will examine the tissue to determine whether
           the cells are viable. If not, we will not be able to make the vaccine and the
           participant will not be eligible to proceed with this treatment protocol.

        -  The dose of the vaccine will be determined by the number of tumor cells that we are able
           to collect from the surgery. We will also be trying to determine the appropriate number
           of GM-K562 cells that can be given safely. We will do this by assigning groups of
           participants to different dose levels of GM-K562.

        -  For the first three weeks of this study, vaccines will be given once each week. After
           the first three weeks, vaccines will be given every other week.

        -  Before the first and after the fourth vaccinations, a small amount of the participants
           own irradiated tumor cells will be injected under their skin to see if their immune
           system will react against it. If the participant develops a rash, they may be asked to
           undergo a small skin biopsy for additional evaluation. These biopsies are optional.

        -  During the course of the study, we will also be collecting blood samples to evaluate the
           effect that the vaccinations may have on the immune system. These tests will be done
           every month.

        -  Participants will have an MRI once every two months.

        -  The following tests and procedures will be done before the participant receive the
           vaccine and every two weeks (During the first month, these will be performed on Days 1,
           3 or 4, 15, 29 and 31 or 32): medical history; physical exam; vital signs; neurological
           exam; routine blood tests; research blood tests.
