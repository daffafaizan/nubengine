    
      A multicenter phase III open randomised trial of the efficacy of exercise in the prevention
      of long-term adverse effects of adjuvant treatments and breast cancer recurrences in women
      with primary breast cancer. The aim of the study is to investigate whether regular exercise
      training could reduce the long-term side effects of adjuvant treatments of primary breast
      cancer and improve quality of life and well being. Large controlled prospective studies are
      needed to confirm the preliminary findings of exercises benefits in cancer patients, and to
      investigate the type, the frequency, intensity and tolerability of exercise training in
      cancer patients, before any clinical recommendations can be given. Prevention of
      osteoporosis, improvement of weight control, and muscular and cardiovascular fitness is been
      waited. The second aim of the study is to investigate, whether regular exercise training
      reduces the risk of breast cancer recurrence, prevents other diseases and reduce all-cause
      mortality and is cost effective in women with primary breast cancer.
