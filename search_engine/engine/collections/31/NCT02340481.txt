    
      This is a randomized (the study drug is assigned by chance), double-blind (neither physician
      nor participant knows the treatment that the participant receives), parallel-group (each
      group of participants will be treated at the same time), multi-center (when more than one
      hospital or medical school team work on a medical research study) study. All eligible
      participants will be randomly assigned to receive either a combination of loperamide
      hydrochloride and simethicone or loperamide hydrochloride. The study includes Screening Visit
      (from -24 to 0 hours), Baseline Visit (at 0 hour) and Concluding Visit (within 48 to 96 hours
      following the start of the trial). The timing of each bowel movement, stool characteristics
      and the degree and duration of abdominal discomfort caused by gastrointestinal gas
      accumulation will be recorded for each participant for 48 hours after the first trial drug
      administration. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.
