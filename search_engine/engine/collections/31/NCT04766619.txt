    
      This study has been designed to evaluate and gain an understanding of the 'real world'
      implementation, fidelity and medium and longer-term embedding and sustainability of two
      prescribing safety interventions: the computerised decision support (CDS) tool - Optimize Rx,
      and PINCER (pharmacist-led information technology intervention for reducing clinically
      important errors in medication management). The longitudinal process evaluation will involve
      observations, interviews, focus groups and questionnaires. The consolidated learning
      exercise, which aims to inform long-term, sustainable intervention use will involve a
      documentary analysis, interviews, focus groups, development workshops and a synthesis of the
      evaluation results.
