      topography will be measured at the Oculus pentacam®. Patients will be classified as dry eye
      or normal eye based on BUT. The tear film breakup (BUT) time of less than 5 seconds will be
      diagnosed as dry eyes.Afterwards, one of two eye drops are instilled in the eye, and biometry
      and corneal topography will be repeated after 5 minutes.

      For all patients, the Barrett Universal II formula will be used for calculation of IOL power.
      Predicted refraction outcome will be referred to as SEQ. The chief surgeon will perform the
      uneventful standard cataract operation with in-the-bag implantation of a HOYA IOL (Model 251)
      through a 2.4-mm corneal incision.

      A Subjective Refraction using plus principle will be performed one month after the operation,
      and ETDRS visual acuity charts will be used to measure best-corrected visual acuity.
      Refraction will be described as SR (postoperative SEQ) and will be calculated as:

      SR = sphere + (0.5*cylinder)
