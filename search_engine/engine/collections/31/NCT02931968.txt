      performance of full-arch monolithic zirconia implant supported fixed dental prosthesis
      (MZISFDP).

      Participants: Individuals with at least one edentulous dental arch (maxilla/mandible) who
      were treated in the UNC Graduate Prosthodontic clinic and Dental Faculty Practice between
      January 1, 2008 to September 1, 2015 with full-arch MZISFDP.

      Procedures (methods): This study is designed as a retrospective descriptive study with a
      single prospective examination of a population of subjects previously restored with full-arch
      MZISFDPs. An estimated 60 participants will be enrolled in the study. The study includes
      retrospective data and radiograph collection from dental records as well as data collection
      from one prospective visit that includes clinical examination, a panoramic radiograph and 2
      patient questionnaires.
