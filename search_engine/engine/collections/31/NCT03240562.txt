      demerits.Thoracic epidural is said to be the gold standard for management of thoracotomy
      pain. However, it is invasive procedure and many side effects. Other options include
      paravertebral block, interpleural block, intrathecal opioids. Especially, paravertebral block
      is thought good alternative to epidural anethesia. Most of these invasive neuraxial
      techniques demand normal coagulation parameters to be present.

      The serratus anterior plane block(SAPB) was done under ultrasound guidance in the
      mid-axillary line at the level of the fourth rib and the catheter was placed superficial to
      the serratus plane. The patient expressed relief in pain within 10 minutes of being given the
      bolus of local anaesthetic.Pain following thoracotomy is chiefly due to rib retraction, and
      damage to the serratus/intercostal muscles and intercostal nerves. A SAPB addresses both
      these aspects. SAPB has been mentioned in previous studies for management of rib fractures
      and breast surgeries. The investigators try to evaluate whether the SAPB is easy to perform
      and provides effective analgesia in patients undergoing thoracotomy with minimal side
      effects.
