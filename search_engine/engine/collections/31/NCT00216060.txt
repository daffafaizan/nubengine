    
      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter, 2 arm study.

      The study population will consist of prostate cancer patients with metastatic bone disease
      for whom androgen-deprivation therapy is planned. After stratification based on the patient's
      age, performance status, and severity of metastatic disease, the patients will be randomized
      at a 1:1 ratio to the following treatment arms:

        -  Daily oral risedronate combined with androgen deprivation

        -  Daily oral placebo combined with androgen deprivation

      Initial clinical evaluation will be performed during the 2-week screening period. While
      patients receive per-protocol treatment, study assessments will be performed every 4 weeks
      during the first 3 months, and every 12 weeks thereafter.
