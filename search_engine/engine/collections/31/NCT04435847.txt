    
      -  Single center, randomized, controlled, parallel-design study in participants with mild
           to moderate hair loss on a Norwood-Hamilton (N-H) Scale

        -  Double-blind: Evaluating Investigator (EI) and participants are blinded; Treating
           Investigator (TI) is not blinded

        -  Investigational product is randomly assigned to subjects upon enrollment and will
           receive either HST 001 or placebo (phosphate buffered saline [PBS]). Injections will be
           delivered via 1 mL syringes with 31 Gauge needles to the target depth of 1.75 mm, using
           a slow injection technique and holding the needle in position for count of 3-4 seconds.
           Each injection will provide 0.1 mL and a total of 20 injections will be given in the
           scalp with particular attention to the leading edge of the vertex and the temporal
           recession areas

        -  Participants will receive intradermal injections at 3 timepoints only: week 0, week 6
           and week 12. At each of these 3 interventional visits they will receive 0.1 mL X 20
           injections spaced approximately 0.8 - 1.2 cm apart from one another. Dosing will be
           split between the leading edge of the vertex region (~10 injections covering 10.18 cm2)
           and in each temporal recession area (~5 injections covering 7.07cm2) in each.

        -  Adverse Events (AEs) will be monitored to ensure safety of participants throughout the
           study

        -  Efficacy will be assessed at Week 18 and Week 26 via macrophotography and TAHC by the
           Canfield HairMetrix System
