      order to standardize growth, the investigator proposes to calculate the weight-for-age
      Z-score related to the WHO Child Growth Standards. Z-scores express the difference between
      the measurement of an individual and the median value of the reference population as a
      proportion of the SD of the reference population taking into account age and gender.

      The hypothesis to be tested is that infants fed with starter formula with prebiotics and
      probiotics blend and those fed only with probiotics will grow as much as infants in the
      reference growth of WHO.

      Other parameters such as digestive tolerance, frequency of morbidity and microbiota pattern
      will also be investigated.
