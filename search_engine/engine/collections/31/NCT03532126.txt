    
      This non-interventional study will evaluate subjects treated with Princess VOLUME PLUS
      Lidocaine for midface volume deficit augmentation. A touch-up treatment will be allowed, on
      discretion of the treating investigator, if the initial treatment didn't provide optimal
      correction. The effectiveness parameters will be evaluated based on a validated scale for
      midface volume deficit scale and confirmed by use of patient reported outcome questionnaires
      as well as based on photographs to be evaluated by an independent evaluator.
