      lowering intraocular pressure in patients with PAC or PACG. The addition of the Hydrus is
      expected to lower IOP and medication dependency, and thus reduce the risk of progression of
      glaucoma. The PCS group will provide a control group to assess the magnitude of the Hydrus
      treatment effect on IOP, medications, and safety.

      Upon successfully meeting the study inclusion/exclusion criteria at both the screening and
      baseline visits, the subject will be scheduled for surgery. Follow up will be continued for 1
      year post surgery, and will include assessments of the subject's IOP, ocular health, and
      visual acuity status. Visits will be conducted at 1, 7, 30, 90, 180, and 365 days.

      A 20% drop in IOP in response to therapy is considered clinically meaningful. The study
      treatment will be considered successful if a patient can obtain this response in IOP using
      the same or a fewer number of medications as pre-operative baseline.
