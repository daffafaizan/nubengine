      single black coffee separated by ~7 days. Each visit commences in the morning after an
      overnight fast of 10-12 hours, with no exercise the day prior, no coffee consumption the
      morning of testing, and completion of a food log for dietary duplication prior to visit 2. A
      fasting blood draw is obtained and cognitive function tests administered, along with
      questionnaires to assess gastrointestinal distress, arousal, and hunger/fullness before
      coffee consumption. Following this, one of the coffee beverages is consumed (randomized to
      each visit). Cognitive testing and questionnaires are completed at 60 minutes after finishing
      the coffee, another blood draw at 90 minutes, and then cognitive testing, questionnaires and
      a final blood draw 180 minutes after consuming the coffee. This procedure is repeated during
      their second experimental visit, in which they consume the remaining coffee based on their
      randomization.
