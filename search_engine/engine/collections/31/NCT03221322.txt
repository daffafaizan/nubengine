      with a BMI >15 and < 18.5 kg/m2 aged 20-40 years, in parallel with an age matched group of
      150 healthy subjects with a BMI â‰¥22 and < 25 kg/m2 as the control group. The investigators
      will screen out any individuals with eating disorders. In both groups, the investigators will
      study their lifestyles in particular focusing on their physical activity patterns and their
      food intake choices (monitored via food intake diaries and supported by metabolomics analyses
      of their urine to detect biomarkers of different food groups). Saliva samples will be
      collected for genotyping. The investigators will SNP genotype the individuals for 30 known
      polymorphic loci previously linked to obesity to establish if they have a particular genetic
      profile linked to their lean phenotype.
