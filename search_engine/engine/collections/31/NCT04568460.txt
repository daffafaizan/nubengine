      for multi-component, multisystem interventions to promote testing, and adherence to treatment
      and care for young people living with HIV. The proposed intervention, Standing Tall, is
      informed and guided by Social Action Theory - a conceptual framework reflecting a holistic
      understanding of health behavior and motivational factors that foster and maintain behavior
      change. Standing Tall, a pilot randomized controlled trial, is designed to address
      multi-factorial barriers using (1) a socio-behavioral group intervention; (2) social support;
      (3) provision of immediate ART and refills. The primary outcome is ART initiation at three
      months, and the secondary outcome is viral load suppression at six months. Other
      tertiary/exploratory outcomes include behavioral outcomes and process evaluation of the
      intervention itself, and the use of point-of-care diagnostics.

      The administrative supplemental funding provides support for an additional objective of this
      study: to understand how best to use point-of-care (POC) testing in clinical practice in
      order to improve HIV care and treatment for South African young people. Understanding patient
      perspectives and perceived barriers is critical to developing feasible, acceptable, and
      effective protocols for implementing POC testing. The primary aim for achieving this
      objective is to assess patient perspectives regarding POC testing through in-depth,
      semi-structured interviews among study participants enrolled in Standing Tall's second aim.
