      medical patients during admission, and increasing up to 80% during standard care procedures.
      Agitation was also reported in 52% of the patients, typically within 4-9 days after
      admission. However, there were studies reporting inadequate pain, agitation and delirium
      assessment and management in real-world clinical practice. The clinical practice guideline
      for the management of pain, agitation/sedation, delirium, immobility, and sleep disruption in
      adult patients in the ICU was recently published in 2018 and emphasized routinely monitoring
      pain, agitation and delirium during ICU admissions. Also, appropriate management of pain and
      agitation in critically ill patients resulted in reduction in ICU length of stay, hospital
      length of stay, delirium and mortality. Therefore, structural pain, agitation/sedation,
      delirium assessment and treatment in the ICUs, Thailand might be necessary.

      Since pain, agitation/sedation and delirium protocol has not yet been initiated in ICUs,
      Thailand, this study is designed as a before-after study in order to assess outcomes by
      comparing between before and after protocol initiation. The objectives of the study were to
      document the impact of pain, agitation/sedation, delirium protocol on clinical outcomes of
      ICU patients admitted to ICUs at Ramathibodi Hospital, a university hospital, Thailand
