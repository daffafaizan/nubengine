      decided to permanently stop recruitment for the study prior to MTD determination.

      Remaining patients on treatment with binimetinib and sotrastaurin who were considered by the
      Investigator to be benefiting from their treatment could have continued treatment and were to
      be followed up as per protocol. No patients were ongoing as of the data cut-off date. After
      the last patient last visit (LPLV) was declared, the study was terminated.
