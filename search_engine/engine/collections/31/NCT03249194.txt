      concern with offering HCV+ kidneys to HCV- recipients is a risk of viral transmission.
      Although data about the long-term impact of HCV+ kidney transplantation in to HCV- recipients
      is unclear, there was a clear suggestion of an increased risk of liver disease in these
      patients based upon studies performed in the 1990s. Traditional therapy with Interferon could
      not be offered to these patients as it can lead of rejection if kidney transplant. It was
      recently reported that nearly 65% (out of a total 6546) of all HCV+ kidneys were discarded
      between the years 2005-2014. These kidneys were otherwise of excellent quality and could have
      benefitted more than 4000 patients with 12,000 plus years of graft life.

      Since the recent FDA approval of Direct Acting Anti-virals (DAA), these drugs have now been
      shown to be safe and efficacious even in the setting of kidney transplant. They could offer a
      unique opportunity to expand the kidney donor pool. For this study, the investigators
      hypothesize that pre-emptive treatment with a direct acting anti-viral HCV medication to cure
      HCV soon after transplant would allow for safe transplantation of HCV+ kidneys in
      disadvantaged and needy HCV- kidney recipients with acceptable risks and improved survivals
      compared with historical cohorts. This novel study will develop pilot data on the safety and
      efficacy of utilizing HCV+ kidneys in high-risk HCV- recipients in order to expand the donor
      pool and reduce the morbidity and mortality of hemodialysis.
