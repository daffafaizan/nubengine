      women who are at the inception of their menopause, will decrease the rate of accumulation of
      atherosclerotic plaque, indicating a likely delay in the onset of clinical cardiovascular
      disease. The study is designed as a multicenter, 4 year randomized clinical trial. It will
      evaluate the effectiveness of of 0.45 mg/day of oral conjugated equine estrogens or 50
      mcg/day of transdermal estradiol via skin patch changed weekly (each in combination with
      cyclic oral, micronized progesterone, 200 mg daily for 12 days per month), versus placebo in
      preventing progression of carotid intimal medial thickness by sonogram and the accrual of
      coronary calcium in women aged 42-58 who are within 36 months of their final menstrual period
      at initiation of treatment. A number of secondary endpoints including biochemical and genetic
      risk factors for cardiovascular and thrombotic disease, and effects on cognition will also be
      studied. The study will enroll a total of 720 women in 2005-6, with an anticipated completion
      of the trial in 2010.
