      major factor contributing to the chronic respiratory manifestations of the disease. Normally
      this host defense mechanism removes inhaled pathogens and toxins from the inner surfaces of
      the lung. In CF, mutations in the CF gene result in dysfunction of the Cystic Fibrosis
      Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) ion channel on the cells that line the airway
      epithelium, causing improper fluxes of ions such as sodium, chloride, and bicarbonate. The so
      called "low volume" hypothesis of CF pathogenesis contends that the liquid lining the airways
      becomes very thin and viscous due to abnormal absorption of sodium from the airways, which
      draws water out of the airways, partially or totally defeating mucociliary clearance. The
      rate at which the mucociliary system clears materials from the lungs can be quantified using
      a nuclear medicine test called a mucociliary clearance scan. This study pilots a new
      variation of the mucociliary clearance scan that uses both "floating" and "penetrating"
      radioisotope tags. The difference in clearance between these tags will provide information on
      how airway surface liquid volume affects mucociliary clearance. This pilot trial will include
      the imaging of n=5 CF subjects and n=5 healthy subjects.
