      Twelve elderly males with chronic heart failure, New York Heart Association class I-II, will
      participate in this study. Participants will be allocated into two equally-sized groups: a
      stair descending group (n = 6) and a stair ascending group (n = 6). At the beginning of the
      study, the volunteers will perform an acute bout of stair descending or stair ascending
      exercise on an automatic escalator (4 sets of 3 min each, speed will be set at 45
      steps∙min-1). Step height will be 20.5 mm. Before and at day 2 post exercise, physiologic
      measurements will be performed and blood samples will be collected. Then, participants will
      carry out six weeks of stair descending or ascending training consisting of three exercise
      sessions per week (the first two weeks the speed will be set at 45 steps∙min-1, the next two
      weeks at 50 steps∙min-1 and the last two weeks at 55 steps∙min-1 for both groups). Afterward,
      they will repeat the acute stair descending or ascending protocol, as carried out at the
      beginning of the study, and the same physiologic measurements will be performed and blood
      samples will be collected.

      Measurements:

      Isometric (at 90 knee flexion), concentric and eccentric peak torque at 60o∙s-1of quadriceps
      femoris, pain-free range of motion, delayed onset muscle soreness and creatine kinase will be
      measured.
