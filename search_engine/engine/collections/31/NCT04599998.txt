    
      Aim: To evaluate medium to late (visit 1: 6-12 months after hospital discharge) effects of
      COVID-19 on lung function, exercise capacity, thoracic CT findings, symptoms and HRQoL in
      patients with confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the relation between these
      parameters.

      Material and methods: Prospective cohort of subjects with laboratory and/or thoracic CT
      confirmed COVID-19 who were treated as inpatients. Participants will perform spirometry, lung
      diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide, 6-minute walk test (6MWT) and cardiopulmonary exercise
      testing (CPET) after 6-12 months (Visit 1) of COVID-19. Clinical, laboratory and chest image
      data during the COVID-19 hospitalization will be obtained from medical records.

      The minimum sample size was estimated as 37 participants.
