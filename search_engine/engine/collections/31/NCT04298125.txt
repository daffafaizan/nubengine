      the research- clinic-based Expecting intervention with pregnant women with obesity in
      community settings. Specifically, the investigators will show effective application of the
      Replicating Effective Programs (REP) framework (e.g., fidelity, feasibility, acceptability)
      to translate the research clinic-based intervention to community settings. REP provides a
      four-phase process for implementing evidence-based interventions and has demonstrated
      effective application to translate clinical interventions to community settings. Built into
      the REP framework is the collection of feedback from community stakeholders, iterative
      piloting of the intervention in the community, and a process for standardizing the
      intervention across community settings. Following adaptation, the updated intervention will
      be piloted. The pilot study will include 60 expecting women. The investigators will randomize
      half to receive the community-adapted Expecting intervention (Intervention, N=30) and half to
      receive standard of care (Control, N=30).
