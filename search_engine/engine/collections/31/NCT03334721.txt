      disorder (CUD); there is a six-fold increase in the prevalence of CUD in individuals with BD
      relative to the general population. Individuals with co-occurring CUD and BD (CUD+BD) have
      substantially worse clinical outcomes than those with either BD or CUD alone. Response to
      mood stabilizing medications appears to be poor, yet little is known about optimal treatment
      for CUD+BD, as there have been no randomized medication trials for CUD+BD to date. Convergent
      evidence supports dysregulated brain Î³-Aminobutyric acid (GABA)/glutamate homeostasis as a
      candidate target for pharmacological intervention in CUD+BD. Preclinical and clinical studies
      have demonstrated that CUD and BD are each associated with prefrontal GABA and glutamate
      disturbances and that impulsivity, a core neurobehavioral feature of both CUD and BD and a
      key Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) construct, is causally related to GABAergic/glutamatergic
      functioning. Gabapentin has been consistently shown in preclinical research to modulate GABA
      and glutamate transmission. In human Proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (1H-MRS) studies,
      both acute and chronic gabapentin dosing have been shown to increase brain GABA levels,
      however, few studies have investigated gabapentin effects on glutamate levels. Researchers
      propose that gabapentin may impact clinical outcomes in CUD+BD individuals both directly and
      indirectly through their impact on impulsivity.
