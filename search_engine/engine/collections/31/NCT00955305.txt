      I. To evaluate the progression-free survival with the combination of carboplatin, paclitaxel,
      and bevacizumab, and +/- IMC-A12 (cixutumumab) in patients with advanced, non-squamous,
      non-small cell lung cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate overall survival and response rate of the above combination in patients with
      non-squamous, advanced non-small cell lung cancer.

      II. To evaluate the toxicities of the above combination in patients with non-squamous
      advanced non-small cell lung cancer.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM A (CPB): Patients receive carboplatin intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes, paclitaxel IV
      over 3 hours, and bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1.

      ARM B (CPB+cixutumumab): Patients receive carboplatin, paclitaxel, and bevacizumab as in Arm
      A. Patients also receive cixutumumab (IMC-A12) IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15.

      In both arms, treatment repeats every 21 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Treatment with bevacizumab and cixutumumab may continue
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for 3 years.
