      risk, and aggressively manage patients with gastrointestinal bleeding within the stipulated
      time in the confines of emergency department. If not managed properly, it is associated with
      high mortality.

      Various clinical prediction scores help in risk stratifying such patients. Among the scores,
      AIMS65 score is the easy to use score and has good mortality predictive accuracy. RDW, once
      thought as marker of chronic blood loss has recently been identified as a good prognostic
      indicator as well as good predictor of mortality in conditions where there is acute blood
      loss.

      Both AIMS65 score and RDW value have been used separately as a predictor of morbidity and
      mortality in patients with UGIB. But there are not much studies so far evaluating their
      combined role as marker of predicting mortality as well as high risk among UGIB patients.
      Hence there is a need for a study to know the predictive value of combination of AIMS6S score
      and RDW in patients presenting to ED with symptoms of UGIB not been much studies comparing
      the relationship between RDW and upper GI bleed.

      The rationale of this study in UGIB patients is to assess whether the prediction of mortality
      and morbidity using AIMS65 score improves when used in combination with RDW in the emergency
      department setting.
