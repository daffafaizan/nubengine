      disease-free survival in patients with hepatoma (HCC). Unfortunately, most hepatoma patients
      present with disease that is not amenable to resection (multifocal disease) or have other
      medical contraindications to surgery (limited hepatic reserve related to advanced cirrhosis
      or chronic hepatitis). Fewer than 15%1 of hepatoma patients are suitable surgical candidates.

      The objective of treatment with TheraSphere is to selectively administer a potentially lethal
      dose of radioactive material to neoplastic tissue in the liver of patients with HCC. Regional
      therapies for HCC may have several advantages over systemically administered treatments.
      Irradiating a cancer prior to treatment with regional chemotherapy may be more effective than
      either therapeutic modality alone. TheraSphere may also be of value as a 'bridging' treatment
      for HCC patients awaiting a donor organ for liver transplantation.
