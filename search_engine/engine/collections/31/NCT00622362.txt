      pharmacological treatment, immunotherapy is the only treatment that could modify the natural
      course of allergic disease. This is a prospective double-blind placebo controlled study with
      three arms of treatment: placebo and two active (one of the active arms will receive
      subcutaneous immunotherapy and the other one will receive sublingual immunotherapy).
