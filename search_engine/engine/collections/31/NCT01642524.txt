      The primary objective of this study is to report feasibility in accordance with the
      methodology described by Lancaster and Dodds, specifically addressing:

        1. baseline survival rates for the treatment and control group to aid in the design of a
           definitive multicentre trial.

        2. randomization compliance rate.

        3. ease of protocol implementation in the out-of-hospital setting.

        4. adverse rate of Hypertonic Saline Dextran (HSD) infusion.

      The secondary objectives include measuring the effect of HSD in modulating the
      immuno-inflammatory response to severe head injury and its effect on modulating the release
      of neuro-biomarkers into serum; evaluating the role of serum neuro-biomarkers in predicting
      patient outcome and clinical response to HSD intervention; evaluating effects of HSD on brain
      atrophy post-injury and neurocognitive and neuropsychological outcomes.
