      screening attendance, targeting women age 35-69 who have not attended screening for at least
      10 years. The women will be randomly allocated to one of three interventions: (i) receive a
      reminder to be screened by a physician; (ii) receive a self-sampling kit; (iii) receive an
      offer to order a self-sampling kit. Comparisons of the screening attendance among the
      interventions will be made. To also address potential effects on inequities, the analyses
      will include comparisons by sociodemographic characteristics. The rates of cervical
      cancer/precancer among the interventions will also be compared. Further, to assess the
      feasibility of and the compliance to follow-up after a positive HPV test in this population,
      half of the HPV-positive women from each self-sampling arm will be referred to initial
      follow-up by their regular general practitioner (GP), while the other half will be referred
      to initial follow-up by a gynecologist. The project will be embedded in the national cervical
      cancer screening program, and will utilize the extensive nationwide registers describing
      performance and outcomes of screening collected by the Cancer Registry of Norway.
