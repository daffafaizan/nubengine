      software-generated randomized numbers to learn the patient's assignment to one of two groups
      to emerge from anesthesia with the ETT still in place or after it had been replaced by an
      LMA.

      Hemodynamic variables were recorded at 8 moments: baseline, in the operating room one minute
      before anesthetic induction; 5 minutes after the end of surgery before awakening (ETT group)
      or before tube replacement (LMA group); and 1, 5, 10, 15, 30 and 60 min after extubation or
      LMA removal (according to group assignment).
