      causes also contribute to the development and maintenance of obesity. Traumatic experiences
      may be a risk factor for it as well. Emotional issues of obese patient often interfere with
      the results of bariatric surgery, where a large number of bariatric patients regain the
      weight or change symptoms.

      The aim of the Effects of EMDR therapy with Severe Obesity Bariatric Surgery Patients
      randomized controlled trial is to determine the effects of 11 sessions of EMDR therapy, prior
      to surgery as compared to a control group. The Big Five personality factors will be used to
      evaluate the results. Both groups of patients will complete the Factorial Personality
      Battery, before the surgery, and 6 months and 12 months following bariatric surgery.

      The initial hypothesis is that EMDR therapy will provide sufficient changes after surgery in
      the personality dynamics of obese patients, which will in turn favor emotional balance and
      weight maintenance as compared to the control group.
