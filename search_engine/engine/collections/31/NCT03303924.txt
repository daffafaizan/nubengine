      6.0 hours after start of the third dose (last dose) administered on Day 2.

      Each subject will undergo one standardized bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) in
      the outpatient bronchoscopy suite at 1.0, 2.5, 3.25, 4.0, or 6.0 hours after start of the
      infusion of the third dose of ETX2514 and sulbactam (6 subjects per timepoint) on Day 2.
