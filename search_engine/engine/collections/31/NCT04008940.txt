      surgical treatment with lateral distal plate osteosynthesis.

      Anatomically pre-contoured locking plates are commonly used. In 2012, the 4.5mm VA-LCP Curved
      Condylar Plate for distal femur fractures (VA-LCP DF, Synthes) was introduced offering the
      option of axis variation of the locking screws.

      Recently, a report highlighted cases of implant failure with this implant, cautioning
      practicing surgeons against the use of this implant in certain type of AO/OTA fracture and
      dislocation classification 33 fractures (AO/OTA classification).

      Based on this report, the current study was designed to perform a retrospective in-depth
      radiological analysis of all cases distal femur fractures of 4 participating sites in which
      the VA-LCP DF, the LCP Distal Femur Plate (LCP DF, Synthes) or the 'less invasive
      stabilization system' for distal femur fractures (LISS DF, Synthes) were used for fracture
      stabilization. The radiological in-depth analysis will be done by an expert review board with
      the aim to identify potential causes and risk factors for the failure cases among all cases
      collected.

      This evaluation will contribute to a better understanding of the mechanical performance of
      distal femur fracture plates and the causes and risk factors for failures.
