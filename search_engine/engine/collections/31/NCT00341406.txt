      human subjects. However, microarray analysis of adipose cell gene expression in high risk
      insulin-resistant human subjects suggests that a reduced rate of adipose cell turnover is
      associated with enhanced adipose cell size and systemic insulin resistance. New technology
      now permits a detailed analysis of adipose cell size including the detection of smaller cells
      which may be in the process of active differentiation. We propose to examine the relationship
      between adipose cell size distribution and systemic insulin resistance in obese human
      subjects. Adipose tissue biopsies will be obtained at Stanford University under protocols and
      consent forms approved by the Stanford University IRB. Only procedures already being
      performed on subjects under these protocols will be used.
