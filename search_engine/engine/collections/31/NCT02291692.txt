      II patients was given 15 mg/kg of paracetamol as postoperative analgesia. In the period of
      postoperative, if the FLACC > 4; it was planned to dose 1 mg/kg of tramadol. Patients'
      hemodynamic parameters, oxygen saturation, sevoflurane concentration were recorded 10, 15, 30
      and 60 minutes intraoperatively. Patients' hemodynamic parameters, oxygen saturation, pain
      scores (FLACC), satisfaction of parents, the number of patients who additional analgesic
