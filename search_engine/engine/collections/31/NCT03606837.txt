      prostate cancer (Gleason score 3+4 and 4+3) include tomodensitometry (CT scan), magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) and bone scintigraphy. However, this group of tumor is highly
      heterogeneous. A distinction exist between tumors with Gleason score 3+4 (lower risk) and 4+3
      which may be closer to high risk prostate cancer.

      Consequently, management of these two sub-groups of tumors differs. The key point for optimal
      management of these tumors is to get specific and non-invasive molecular tools for better
      classification and stratification. This is of critical importance for personalized treatment
      decision-making.

      Novel innovative radiotracers are today available for prostate cancer imaging notably small
      molecules, radiolabeled with 68Ga, targeting the prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) or
      antagonists, radiolabeled with 68Ga, targeting the Gastrin-Releasing Peptide receptor (GRP-R,
      a bombesin receptor subtype).

      There are on growing evidences that Positron Emission Tomography coupled to Computed
      Tomography (PET-CT) with radiolabeled prostate specific membrane antigen analogues (PSMA)
      could be more sensitive and more specific for the detection of lymph node metastasis in
      high-risk cancers, as shown with PSMA-617 in recent studies.
