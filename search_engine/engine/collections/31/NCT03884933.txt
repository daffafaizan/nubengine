      community-based service delivery model in five implementation sites in low and middle-income
      countries and vulnerable populations in high-income countries in Europe to improve the level
      of functioning, quality of life, and mental health outcomes for people with severe and
      enduring mental ill health (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression).

      RECOVER-E's specific project objectives are to:

        -  design, implement and evaluate recovery-oriented care for people with severe mental
           illness in community settings by recognizing the value of experiential knowledge through
           including peer experts as members of the community mental health teams

        -  identify intervention and program elements, as well as contextual factors, which enhance
           sustainable implementation of community-based mental healthcare for people with severe
           mental illness

        -  establish a peer-to-peer capacity building partnership in community mental health, by
           linking a European expert panel with key stakeholders in five implementation sites
           (policy makers, service managers, service providers, users, and carers) to co-create
           community health services for people with SMI

        -  develop evidence-based care pathways and treatment protocols and transition to scale for
           regional and national decision-makers, for continued implementation and scale up after
           the project's life span
