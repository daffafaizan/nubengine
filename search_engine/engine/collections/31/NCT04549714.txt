      patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation who are scheduled for catheter ablation were
      randomly divided into 3 groups, 30 patients in each group. For the first group, the AI target
      value for the front wall and the top wall is 550, and the rear wall and the lower wall are
      400. For the second group, the AI target values for the front wall and the top wall are 500,
      the rear wall and the lower wall are 350. For the third group, the AI target values for the
      front wall and top wall are 450, the rear wall and the lower wall are 300. The pressure value
      at each point is 5-15 g, and the distance between adjacent ablation points is less than 5 mm.
      The relevant indicators such as single-circle isolation rate of the pulmonary vein, operation
      time, the left atrial operation time, and the supplemental ablation site are recoded. The
      incidence of intraoperative and postoperative complications such as stroke, pericardial
      tamponade and steam pop during ablation are observed. Dynamic electrocardiography is
      performed during the follow-up period to evaluate the proportion of sinus rhythm within 1
      year.
