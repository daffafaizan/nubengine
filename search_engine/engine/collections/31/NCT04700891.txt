      between 65 and 80 years old. Recently, many studies have demonstrated a strong association
      between olfactory impairment and overall mortality risk. At the moment, the underlying
      physiopathology linking olfactory impairment to mortality remains unknown and only putative
      mechanisms are suggested.

      Among them, accelerated physiological brain aging seems to be involved, making olfactory
      decline a possible marker of frailty. To date, only a few studies (mostly using subjective
      olfactory assessment) investigated the potential relationship between olfactory impairment
      and frailty. Surgery, and more broadly the perioperative period, remains a major source of
      morbidity and mortality. Meanwhile, the average age of the surgical population continues to
      rise, making preoperative risk assessment an essential step in order to detect the most
      vulnerable patients. Yet, it is well-known that frailty is associated with worse
      perioperative outcome. The first objective of this research project is thus to evaluate
      olfactory identification function of preoperative older surgical patients in light of an
      assessment of their frailty status. Frailty will be tested with the Edmonton Frail Scale and
      handgrip strength, which are both validated tools. The second objective is to correlate
      postoperative morbidity and mortality with preoperative olfactory function. Hopefully, this
      research project will address the misunderstood link between olfactory impairment and
      mortality, focusing on frailty assessment and using surgery as a heavy stressor for the older
      patient.
