    
      Observational study to collect bio-specimens from 2 separate patient cohorts identified to be
      at high risk for subsequent development of pancreas cancer.

        1. Patients diagnosed with a pancreatic cyst undergoing either endoscopic ultrasound or
           surgery. Bio-specimens collected include pancreatic cyst fluid and blood. These will be
           collected using a standard operating protocol within the NIH Pancreatic Cancer Detection
           Consortium.

        2. Patients defined as a high risk individual for pancreas cancer by family history and/or
           known genetic mutations. Bio-specimens collected include blood. This will be collected
           using a standard operating protocol within the NIH Pancreatic Cancer Detection
           Consortium.
