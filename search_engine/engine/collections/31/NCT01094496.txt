    
      CDX-1307 is an experimental vaccine that is designed to generate an immune response against a
      protein called human chorionic gonadotropin-beta (hCG-β). hCG-β is made by several types of
      cancers, including bladder cancer, and has been shown to be associated with shorter times to
      development of metastases and reduced survival in bladder cancer. In this study, it is hoped
      that administering the CDX-1307 vaccine will cause the body's immune system to attack bladder
      cancer cells in order to kill them or otherwise keep them from spreading or coming back.

      Standard treatment for early stage, muscle invasive bladder cancer includes the
      administration of chemotherapy to shrink the tumor followed by surgical removal of the
      bladder (cystectomy).

      This study will compare the effect of adding CDX-1307 administration to this standard
      treatment. CDX-1307 will be given with 3 different immune stimulants to try to increase the
      immune response against the tumor cells; collectively, this is called the "CDX-1307 vaccine
      regimen."

      Only patients whose tumors make the hCG-β protein will be included in this study. Eligible
      patients will receive "standard of care" chemotherapy with the CDX-1307 vaccine regimen
      before surgery, and then CDX-1307 vaccine regimen alone (without chemotherapy) after surgery.
