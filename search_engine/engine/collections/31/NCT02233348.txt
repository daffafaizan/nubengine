      To investigate the neuropsychological, neuroimaging, social cognitive, and psychosocial
      outcomes at adolescence and young adulthood among children with ASD as compared to typically
      developing (TD) controls.

      Secondary Aims:

        1. To examine the changes and stability of ASD core symptoms, neuropsychological function,
           structured and functional connectivity, psychosocial functions over a 4-7 year follow-up
           period.

        2. To identify early individual (clinical, behavioral, and neurocognitive variables),
           family, school, environmental factors to predict the neurocognitive and psychosocial
           outcomes at adolescence and young adulthood.

        3. To validate the neuropsychological functioning (e.g., set-shifting, executive function,
           and visuo-spatial memory etc.) and structural (morphometric,, cortical thickness,
           gyrification, white matter tract integrity) and functional connectivity (resting-state
           and social task fMRI) in fronto-temporal, cortico-striato-thalamic, default mode
           network, and other circuits as effective imaging endophenotypes (biomarkers) by
           demonstrating the stability of these imaging data and the intermediate position of
           unaffected siblings between ASD probands and age-, sex-, handedness-, and IQ-matched TD
           at Time 1 and follow-up.

        4. To correlate the data from structural and functional connectivity, neuropsychology and
           ASD core symptoms stratifying by proband-unaffected sibling dyads, and different
           developmental stages.

        5. To collect blood sample, and to analyze neurodevelopmental and immune genes, cytokine
           level, and environmental exposure.
