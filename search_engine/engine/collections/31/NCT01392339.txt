      wks. Following chronic intermittent hypoxia, a group of 8 rats were removed from the chronic
      intermittent hypoxia protocol and allowed to normoxic conditions over a period of 2 wks. For
      the clinical protocol, the AHI measured by overnight polysomnography will be use to select
      individuals with sleep-related breathing disorders, and controls (30-60 years, Body Mass
      Index (BMI) < 35kg/m2). Moreover, the investigators will evaluate the subjective sleep
      parameters (sleep disorders questionnaire, the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, sleep diaries).
      After standard CPAP titration, men with severe obstructive sleep apnea will be assigned for
      the CPAP protocol for future assessment of the influence of 6 months obstructive sleep apnea
      treatment. A total of 84 genes are evaluated using the Hypoxia Signaling Pathway PCR Array
      (SA Biosciences, EUA).
