      medicine. The European Resuscitation Council (ERC) 2010 cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)
      guidelines suggest that intubators should be able to secure the airway without interrupting
      chest compression. However, ETI with uninterrupted chest compression in patients can be a
      very difficult skill to acquire.
