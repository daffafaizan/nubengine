      ICG dye (2.5 mg, 5.0 mg, 7.5 mg, 10.0 mg) followed by 20 minutes of LFT monitoring. The final
      two cohorts will receive weight based doses of ICG dye (0.1 mg/kg, 0.5 mg/kg) followed by 20
      minutes of LFT monitoring. Additionally the final two cohorts will have serial blood draws
      before the ICG dose and at 5, 10, 15 and 20 minutes post ICG dose.
