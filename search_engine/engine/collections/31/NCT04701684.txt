      when a possible stroke patient arrives at the emergency department, typically first a CT or
      MRI exam is acquired for stroke triage. In case of an ischemic stroke the patient is then
      treated in an interventional suite.

      In the DTAS workflow stroke patients are diagnosed and treated in the interventional suite
      without interruption. The Cone-Beam CT (CBCT) capabilities of the interventional X-ray system
      are utilized to perform triage, directly followed by stroke treatment.

      The primary objective of the WE-TRUST study is to demonstrate that the DTAS triage workflow
      involving CBCT results in superior patient outcome in ischemic stroke patients with confirmed
      Large Vessel Occlusion as compared to the conventional CT/MR triage workflow.

      The WE-TRUST study will be running in 16 sites to enroll 500+ patients globally.
