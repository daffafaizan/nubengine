    
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase II study in which approximately
      36 patients will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive either ARGX-113 Dose A, or
      ARGX-113 Dose B body weight or placebo in 4 infusions administered 1-week apart in addition
      to Standard-of-Care (SoC) treatment. Patients aged 18 to 85 years (inclusive) with confirmed
      primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) who have a platelet count ˂ 30 × 109/L and who are
      receiving oral corticosteroids and/or permitted oral immunosuppressants and/or Thrombopoietin
      receptor (TPO-R) agonist as SoC which must be maintained on a stable dose and frequency for
      at least 4 weeks prior to Screening.

      The study will include a 2-week Screening, a 3-week Treatment period, and an 21-week
      follow-up (FU) period. The study is followed by an open label period where patients will be
      given the option to be treated with ARGX-113 Dose A in cycles of 4 weekly infusions with a
      minimum of 4 weeks apart. Patients may receive rescue therapy during the study at the
      discretion the investigator when deemed medically necessary.
