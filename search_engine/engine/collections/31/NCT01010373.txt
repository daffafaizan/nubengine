      infections. Despite the administration of prophylactic platelet transfusions, these patients
      remain at risk of clinically significant hemorrhage. There is a growing need for new,
      innovative strategies, because the outcome for AML patients, particularly for the older ones,
      has not substantially changed in the last three decades. Thus, novel compounds to target the
      tumor cell's resistance to chemotherapeutic agents are essential for the improvement of
      patients' prognoses. AS101 is a non-toxic, organic, tellurium-based small compound with
      immunomodulating properties which have previously shown bone marrow sparing effect. In
      addition in preclinical studies AS101 has shown synergistic effect with several cytotoxic
      drugs. This study will investigate the safety and efficacy of AS101 formulation in
      combination with the standard therapy for newly diagnosed elderly AML and AML transformed MDS
      patients.
