      non-cachectic cancer patients using PET imaging.

      Patients willbe assessed for sarcopenia using a dual energy X-ray absorptiometry or bone
      densitometry scan (DXA). Given the variables which may affect uptake of BAT in cancer
      patients, this study will standardise patient preparation and PET scan procedure in order to
      obtain the most reliable assessment of BAT activity in all patients on study.

      It is hypothesisd that use of this PET imaging technique, which is part of standard care to
      assess cancer progression, may assist clinicians in early identification of metabolic changes
      in a patient, with potential for early intervention and utility in monitoring success of
      treatments of cachexia.

      A total of 40 patients will be evaluated, 20 patients with advanced/metastatic colorectal,
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or pancreatic cancer without cachexia, and 20 patients
      with advanced/metastatic colorectal, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), or pancreatic cancer
      with documented cachexia, all of whom are referred for standard of care 18F-FDG PET scans.
