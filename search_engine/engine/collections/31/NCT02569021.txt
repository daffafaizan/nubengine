      symptoms of Parkinson's disease, tremor, and dystonia. Patients implanted with DBS experience
      a significant improvement of their symptoms with relatively low risk of intolerable side
      effects. Implanted patients must undergo repeat surgeries to replace the Implantable Pulse
      Generators/batteries (IPG) approximately every 2 to 5 years. The DBS program (at the
      University of Florida) has studied battery consumption and has been interested in potential
      strategies to extend the life of the IPG to reduce the need for frequent battery replacement
      surgeries, while improving symptom-relief, patient satisfaction, and the potential associated
      financial burdens.

      The research study will evaluate the effects of novel stimulation patterns on tremor,
      bradykinesia, rigidity and gait in Parkinson's disease and essential tremor patients.
