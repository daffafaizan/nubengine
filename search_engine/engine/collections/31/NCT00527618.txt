      HIV-1 seropositive and HSV-2 seropositive. Both men and women will be recruited for the
      study. Participants must not be on antiretroviral therapy and must not be planning to
      initiate antiretroviral therapy during the anticipated study period. Participants will be
      randomized 1:1 to receive acyclovir 400 mg twice daily or valacyclovir 1000 mg twice daily.
      After 12 weeks on the initial treatment, each participant will be crossed over to the
      alternative treatment arm for 12 weeks. The treatment periods will be separated by a 2-week
      washout period. During the first four weeks of each treatment period (i.e. weeks 1-4 and
      weeks 15-18), participants will provide self-collected genital swabs daily for HSV DNA
      quantification. Each week during the entire study period plasma samples will be collected
      from participants for HIV-1 RNA quantification.

      Open-label acyclovir and valacyclovir will be used for this trial, as the primary outcome
      measures (genital HSV and plasma HIV-1) are unlikely to be influenced by knowledge of
      treatment assignment. However, laboratory staff performing plasma HIV-1 and genital HSV
      measurements will not be aware of treatment assignment.

      Optional Sub-Study A: Sub-study A will be offered to study participants. The purpose of
      sub-study A is to measure the effect of valacyclovir twice daily on plasma HIV-1 replication.
