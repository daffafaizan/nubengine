      controlled asthma despite high dose treatment or suspected bronchiectasis, who give a history
      of chronic (often 3 months or more) productive cough which improves with antibiotic treatment
      but quickly relapses. Most deny wheeze and on examination there are often transmitted sounds
      from mucus in the large airways but no expiratory wheeze typical of asthma. Investigations
      including spirometry, bronchial challenges, chest X-ray, screen for immunodeficiency and high
      resolution CT (HRCT) scan exclude recognised causes of productive cough but sputum culture is
      often positive for Haemophilus influenzae although sometimes demonstrates normal respiratory
      flora despite being markedly purulent.

      Due to their efficacy in cystic fibrosis and bronchiectasis we have empirically tried
      treatment with low dose macrolide antibiotics over 3-6 months often with dramatic benefit.
      This is however an unproven and unlicensed indication which needs to be more thoroughly
      evaluated.

      The key objective of the study is to determine if 12 weeks treatment of patients with chronic
      productive cough with low dose azithromycin is both effective and safe.

      The secondary objectives of the study are to describe the clinical and pathological features
      of a cohort of patients who present with chronic productive cough (with no evidence of
      bronchiectasis, smoking-related chronic bronchitis or immunodeficiency) to determine if these
      are sufficiently similar to justify a new diagnostic label.
