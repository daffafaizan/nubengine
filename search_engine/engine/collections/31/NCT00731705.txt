      graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) can best be selectively separated from other T cells and
      removed from the cells that will be returned to the cancer patient's body. These other T
      cells may protect against infection when given to patients after a stem cell transplant. The
      removal of cells that cause GVHD would allow doctors to safely give back the T cells that
      protect against infection, without the risk of GVHD.
