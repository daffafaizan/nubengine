      therapy on 1) viral load, 2) safety and tolerability of Genvoya®, 3) clinical outcomes and
      secondarily on HIV-specific immune responses. This study is a sub-study of RV 217 that will
      recruit participants with incident HIV diagnoses from the parent RV 217 cohort. Potential RV
      392 volunteers will be recruited from the RV 217 ECHO cohort if they have been diagnosed with
      incident HIV Infection. Screening procedures for HIV in RV 217 are designed to identify
      participants during acute HIV infection (AHI) or early HIV infection. Participants will
      initiate Genvoya®, a once a day antiretroviral pill within 1 week of enrollment. RV 392
      follow-up visits will largely overlap with RV 217 visits for the study duration of 96 weeks,
      but additional visits will occur early after initiation of Genvoya®. RV 392 participants will
      remain co-enrolled in RV 217 (i.e., RV 217 visits also continue); blood collection will be
      coordinated by the RV 392 team by prioritizing safety labs and then research labs within the
      allotted blood volumes while still meeting scientific objectives for both RV 217 and RV 392.
      Blood tests that are required for both protocols will only be collected once and will not be
      duplicated across the two protocols.
