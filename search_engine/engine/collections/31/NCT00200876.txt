      placebo, can provide actual therapeutic benefits. The µ-opioid receptor system, located in
      the brain, is activated during anticipation of pain relief; this activation suppresses stress
      and pain responses. This study will use brain imaging technology to examine the effects of a
      placebo intervention on µ-opioid neurotransmitters. Examination of the factors that regulate
      these placebo-activated neurotransmitter responses will clarify the overall neurobiology
      underlying variations in the responses to placebos, as well as pain and other stressful
      conditions, ultimately leading to the optimization of medical and psychological
      interventions.

      This study will last several hours during one study visit. Participants will receive both a
      painful and a painless injection while undergoing positron emission tomography (PET) brain
      imaging. The painful injection will consist of small amounts of hypertoninc saline
      (concentrated saline that causes cell shrinkage) in the jaw muscle over a 20-minute period.
      Several minutes after participants receive hypertonic saline, they will receive an injection
      with isotonic saline not associated with pain in the opposite jaw muscle. After participants
      receive the injections, they will either be told or not be told about a pain relief
      intervention. PET imaging will continue as participants either anticipate or do not
      anticipate pain relief. Participants will be asked about their pain levels repeatedly
      throughout the study; their responses will be entered into a computer-controlled system which
      will modulate rates of saline infusion.
