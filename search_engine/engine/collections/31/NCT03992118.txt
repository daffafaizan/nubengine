      disorder and food selectivity. A Multidisciplinary feeding assessment will be conducted and
      factors which contribute to the participant's feeding challenges will be identified.
      Treatment goals will be identified using the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure
      (COPM). Intervention geared to address the goals identified by parents will be delivered by
      the clinician(s) via videoconferencing. Participants will participate in up to 12 weekly 1hr
      visits over the study period.
