    
      Background: The purpose of this double-masked, randomized, controlled clinical trial was to
      evaluate the effects of subgingival delivery of 1.2% Rosuvastatin gel as an adjunct to
      scaling and root planing (SRP) on clinical and radiographic parameters and compare this
      method with SRP plus placebo gel alone in chronic periodontitis (CP) with type 2 DM patients.

      Methods: Eighty CP patients with type 2 DM are included in this study. They were divided into
      two groups: 1) SRP + 1.2% Rosuvastatin gel (RSV group); 2) SRP + Placebo gel (Placebo group).
      At baseline, 3, 6 and 9 months after treatment, clinical measurements, including plaque index
      (PI), modified sulcus bleeding index (mSBI), probing depth (PD), clinical attachment level
      (CAL) and radiographic parameters intrabony defect depth (IBD), percentage change in
      radiographic defect depth reduction (DDR%) were assessed.
