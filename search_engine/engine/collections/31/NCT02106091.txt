      B-cell blasts and is lost only upon maturation to plasma cells. Expression of CD19 on B-cells
      at various development stages makes it an ideal target to treat B-cell associated
      malignancies.The rationale for the use of AFM11 is based on its ability to bind to both
      malignant cells via its anti-CD19 domain and to T-cells via its anti-CD3 domains. This
      results in the formation of the "immunological synapse" and the subsequent T-cell activation
      on leading to killing of malignant cells.
