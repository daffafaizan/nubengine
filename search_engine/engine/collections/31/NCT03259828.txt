      International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements (ICRU) report 62 recommended a
      margin added to the clinical target volume (CTV) to produce the planning target volume (PTV).
      In ICRU report 83, this concept is further extended and refined to yield the internal target
      volume (ITV), which is defined as CTV plus a margin to account for uncertainty within the
      patient. Image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) has been developed as a method to lower the margin
      required in PTV expansion. In current practice, IGRT methods mostly rely on bony anatomy
      alignment. Due to its nature, internal organ motion cannot be compensated by IGRT. Therefore,
      an ITV expansion is still required. The optimal ITV expansion margin depends on the magnitude
      of internal organ motion; the smallest margin that provides adequate coverage is preferred.

      In this study, we aim to quantify organ motion of the sigmoid colon anastomosis site during
      radiotherapy treatment, including movement between fractions (interfraction) and movement
      within the same fraction (intrafraction).
