      will experience different stages of change before the actual behavioral change takes place.
      Ineffectiveness of intervention to instigate behavioral change is largely due to failure to
      take into account the stage of change in which individuals are. The TTM suggests that
      decisional balance, which reflects the relative difference between pros and cons, is
      important for influencing the stage of change. In order to achieve behavioral change, the
      perceived pros of changing must be strengthened to outweigh the cons. In addition, individual
      must be self-convinced that the behavioral change is important for themselves. Furthermore,
      the process for behavioral change can be provided to facilitate behavioral change in
      individuals. The theory of TTM has yet been used to improve the behavior of insulin
      initiation in insulin-naïve patients with T2DM. Thus, this study aims to assess the
      effectiveness of an intervention for insulin injection initiation based on the TTM in
      insulin-naïve patients with T2DM.
