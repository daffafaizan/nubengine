    
      Two interventions will be performed for assessing the research questions and aims:

      A) Randomized cross-over, with a wash out period of 7 days, single-blinded trial where two
      different pre-competitive meals will be followed by an exercise challenge; inflammatory
      neuro-immune and metabolic response will be assessed before and after each challenge.

      Participants will be recruited from advertisement and four different groups will be compared:
      obese-asthmatic; asthmatic non-obese; obese without asthma and non-asthmatic and non-obese.
      All patients will be allocated to a meal challenge in which a high fat poor micronutrient
      meal followed by a Mediterranean meal or vice-versa; meal challenge order will be randomized
      and participants will be blinded to the intervention. The main outcome for this intervention
      will be airway inflammation and lung function. All outcomes will be assessed before and 3h
      after each meal.

      A group of individuals will, in the three hours after the meal, perform an exercise
      challenge, which is aimed to induce acute immune changes.

      B) Randomized controlled trial where participants, after a run-in period and eligibility
      evaluation, will be allocated to an intervention consisting in a reduction of physical
      activity by 50% or maintaining habitual physical activity for two weeks; inflammatory
      neuro-immune and metabolic response will be assessed before and after intervention.
