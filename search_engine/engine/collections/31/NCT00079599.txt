      can relieve suffering and improve quality of life. The role of progression of the disease,
      depression, anemia, and poor nutritional status in the development of fatigue is well
      recognized. However, the impact of micronutrient deficiencies has been minimally explored.
      AIDS patients are at risk for micronutrient deficiencies because of decreased caloric intake,
      increased metabolic requirements, and treatment with medications that can interfere with
      absorption, synthesis, and excretion. Patients with AIDS are particularly likely to be
      carnitine deficient.

      Levocarnitine (L-carnitine) is a micronutrient found in meat and dairy products that plays a
      major role in energy metabolism. Preliminary research has shown that patients with end stage
      AIDS experienced decreased levels of fatigue after L-carnitine supplementation. This study
      will evaluate the effectiveness of L-carnitine to treat patients with carnitine deficiency,
      fatigue, and AIDS.

      Participants in this study will be randomly assigned to receive either L-carnitine or placebo
      for 2 weeks. To reduce the possibility of side effects, the doses of L-carnitine and placebo
      will be titrated over 6 days to the desired study dose. After 2 weeks, participants receiving
      placebo will be switched over to receive L-carnitine. All participants will continue on
      L-carnitine for an additional 2 weeks.
