      body's ability to defend itself against low blood sugar. Normally, when blood sugar levels
      drop below normal, the body creates a series of responses, which increase the sugar inside
      the body to bring blood sugar levels back to normal. The hormone epinephrine is a key defense
      against low blood sugar in people with diabetes. Atomoxetine has been shown to increase this
      hormone level. Thus, any approaches to increase levels of this key defense during low blood
      sugar may have great value.
