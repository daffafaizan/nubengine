      prevalence, increased incidence and associated costs. When conventional
      medical/interventional treatments fail and if cardiac transplantation is contra-indicated,
      alternate options need to be considered. Transplantation of stem cells has emerged as one of
      them. While the optimal cell type still remains debatable, there is compelling evidence that
      cells whose phenotype closely matches that of the recipient tissue look sound candidates. In
      this context, human embryonic stem cells are attractive because of the possibility to drive
      their fate in vitro, prior to transplantation, towards a cardiac phenotype. We have developed
      a process for achieving such a commitment and generating cardiac-directed cells. The
      objective of this study is to assess both the feasibility and safety of this approach. In
      addition, the disadvantages of multiple intramyocardial injections have now been recognized.
      We have then taken advantage of the surgical setting of the trial (which entails concomitant
      coronary artery bypass or a mitral valve procedure) to switch from injections to the
      epicardial delivery of a fibrin gel into which the progenitor cells have been embedded.
      Coverage of this cell-loaded patch by an autologous pericardial flap is finally designed to
      provide trophic factors to the underlying cellular graft with the hope of improving its
      viability.
