      three centers in three countries (Denmark, Australia, and Czech Republic). Relevant ethics
      committee and competent authority approvals were obtained. The study was conducted in
      accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The protocol required the treatment of a minimum
      of 5 patients, and allowed up to twenty patients to be enrolled.

      The primary objective of the trial was to evaluate the safety and potential benefits of the
      IASD Device System in the treatment of patients with symptomatic heart failure with preserved
      ejection fraction, despite optimal medical management.
