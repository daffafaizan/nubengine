      international guidelines, studies are conducted after a drug is marketed to continue to
      evaluate and expand the knowledge regarding its safety. This is a multi-center, open-label
      observational safety study to collect information regarding the dosage, tolerability and
      effectiveness of topiramate in adults and children with epilepsy (or seizures). Patients who
      have not received previous treatment for epilepsy or for whom previous treatment was
      ineffective or intolerable will receive 6 months of treatment with topiramate. Topiramate
      will be given at low doses initially and gradually increased as needed for each patient to
      control seizure activity. Safety evaluations (incidence of adverse events and laboratory
      tests) and assessment of patient health status will be performed throughout the study.
      Effectiveness will be evaluated by recording the frequency of seizures occurring during the
      study. Patient and physician satisfaction with topiramate treatment will also be recorded. At
      the end of the study, the treating physician may continue treatment with topiramate in
      responding patients as appropriate. The study hypothesis is that topiramate will be effective
      in achieving and maintaining control of seizure activity and is well-tolerated. Observational
      study - No investigational drug administered.
