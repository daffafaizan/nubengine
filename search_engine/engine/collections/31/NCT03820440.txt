      showing acute circulatory failure in both intensive care unit (ICU) and operating room (OR),
      aiming at preventing both inadequate tissue blood flow and fluid overload [1]. In fact,
      unnecessary fluid administration can increase morbidity and mortality and length of hospital
      stay of critically ill and surgical patients [2-10].

      Since the only physiological reason to give a fluid challenge (FC) is to increase the stroke
      volume (SV) [11-13] and this effect is obtained only in about 50% of ICU and OR patients [14,
      15], a vast literature investigated the possibility of predict this effect before FC
      administration, but the issue remains extremely challenging [1, 13, 16-18]. Bedside clinical
      signs and pressure and static volumetric static variables, do not predict fluid
      responsiveness [17]. Moreover, several physiological factors affect the reliability of the
      ventilator-induced dynamic changes in pulse pressure and stroke volume [pulse pressure
      variation (PPV) and stroke volume variation (SVV), respectively], and their echographic
      surrogates, in a significant number of ICU and OR patients [19-22].

      To overcome these limitations, the functional hemodynamic assessment (i.e. the assessment of
      the dynamic interactions of hemodynamic variables in response to a defined perturbation), of
      fluid responsiveness has gained in popularity [17, 18, 23]. A functional hemodynamic test
      (FHT) consist in a manoeuvre determining a sudden change in cardiac function and/or heart
      lung interaction, affecting the hemodynamics of fluid responders and non-responders to a
      different extent [17, 18, 23].

      The FHT called passive leg raising (PLR) has been successfully used for assessing the fluid
      responsiveness in ICU patients since 2009 [24] and its reliability has been confirmed by
      three large meta-analyses [25-27]. However, the PLR is not usually practicable in the OR.

      A lot of different FHTs have been proposed, as alternative to the PLR, in ICU and, more
      recently, OR. These tests could be basically subdivided in two groups. A subgroup of FHTs is
      based on sudden and brief variations of the mechanical ventilation to induce a change in
      right ventricle preload and/or after load and, as consequence, of left ventricle SV [24, 28].
      A second subgroup aims at testing the increase in SV after the rapid administration of a
      small aliquot of the predefined FC [29, 30].

      Among the first group, the end-expiratory occlusion test (EEOT) and the lung recruitment
      maneuver (LRM) have been previously successfully tested in surgical patients [31-33]. The
      EEOT consists of the interruption of the mechanical ventilation for 30 seconds, whereas the
      LRM consists in the increase in the peak inspiratory pressure up to 30 cmH20 for 30 seconds
      and in the assessment of the changes in the SV after the maneuvers. These tests are safe and
      can be easily applicable during the surgery to predict fluid responsiveness and optimize the
      fluid therapy.

      The primary aim of the present study is to compare the reliability of EEOT and LRM in
      predicting fluid responsiveness in patients undergoing general surgery.
