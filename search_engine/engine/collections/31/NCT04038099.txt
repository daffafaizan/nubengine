    
      This trial is a randomized, double blind, controlled trial for patients undergoing complex
      cystometric evaluation. Patients will undergo routine complex cystometric evaluation for
      acquisition of baseline data using a small amount of intraurethral aqueous jelly for catheter
      lubrication. Then, they will be randomized to instillation of either placebo (additional
      intraurethral aqueous jelly, 5ml) or intraurethral 2% lidocaine jelly. Participants then
      undergo complex cystometry a second time. Normal variations in studies with placebo will be
      compared to variations within the 2% lidocaine jelly group to determine if cystometric
      parameters are altered in any clinically important ways. Patient discomfort will also be
      evaluated by both the patient and the urodynamics advanced practice nurse.
