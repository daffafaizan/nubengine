      assess the effectiveness of the use of an educational program based on the follow up of a
      hyposodium diet and assessed through the routine use of urine sodium monitoring of the
      hypertensive patient in the primary care setting, in order to optimize treatment, as well as
      to review the clinical control in this group of patients. On the other hand, it is intended
      to establish guidelines in the form of practical guidelines to provide with a standardized
      clinical approach for primary care centers.
