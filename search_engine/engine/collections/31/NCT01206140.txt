    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Compare the progression-free survival of the MEK inhibitor, AZD6244 (selumetinib) alone,
      and the combination of AZD6244 and a mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor (mTORi),
      temsirolimus (CCI-779) in patients with recurrent metastatic or recurrent locally
      unresectable soft-tissue sarcomas.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the rates of apoptosis, autophagy, and proliferation with AZD6244 alone, and in
      combination with temsirolimus by immunohistochemistry in tumor and surrogate skin tissue
      biopsies. (exploratory) II. Assess the activation status of protein kinase B (Akt), 5E-BP1,
      eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4 gamma, 1 (eIF-4G), and ribosomal protein S6 kinase
      (S6K) in tumor biopsy samples and surrogate skin tissue biopsy samples.(exploratory) III.
      Assess inhibition of activated mitogen-activated protein kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) in stimulated
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells. (exploratory) IV. Assess response by Choi criteria. V.
      Compare the response rate and 4-month progression-free survival (PFS) rate in patients
      treated with these regimens.

      VI. Compare the response rate, 4-month PFS rate and toxicity of AZD6244 alone and in
      combination with temsirolimus.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive selumetinib orally (PO) twice daily on days 1-28 and temsirolimus
      intravenously (IV) over 30-60 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and 22.

      ARM II: Patients receive selumetinib as in arm I. Patients who experience disease progression
      may cross over to arm I.

      In both arms, courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up for 30 days.
