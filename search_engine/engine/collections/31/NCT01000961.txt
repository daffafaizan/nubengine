    
      This is a multi-center, open-label, randomized, cross-over study to determine whether
      steady-state, twice a day treatment with Cysteamine Bitartrate Delayed-release
      Capsules(RP103) results in comparable depletion of white blood cell (WBC) cystine levels
      compared to the existing four times a day cysteamine treatment. It will involve up to 20
      clinic visits plus intermittent home use of the RP103. Most of these clinic visits occur in
      clusters of 3-4 consecutive days. Eligible patients will be offered enrollment into a
      long-term follow up study.
