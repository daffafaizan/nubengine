      adenocarcinoma patients, after D2 R0 resection, whose postoperative pathological stage was
      III treated with XELOX as an adjuvant chemotherapy. However, some retrospective clinical
      studies in China suggest that the 3-year DFS rate of XELOX program as an adjuvant
      postoperative chemotherapy program is still low, and the risk of recurrence is higher for
      patients with postoperative pathological stage IIIB/IIIC.In recent years, the success of the
      JACCRO GC-07 trial has provided evidence for the value of Taxoids in postoperative adjuvant
      therapy of gastric cancer. In the FLOT4 trial, the FLOT improved the DFS rate by 3 years
      compared with the ECF/ECX. At present, there is no clinical study data to prove whether the
      combined three-drug regimen can further reduce the risk of postoperative recurrence and
      improve the treatment effect compared with oxaliplatin combined capecitabine two-drug regimen
      for patients with high postoperative recurrence risk (patients with postoperative
      pathological stage IIIB/IIIC). Therefore, the investigators carried out this trial.
