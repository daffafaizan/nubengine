      data in a longitudinal fashion for up to 12 months. The registry captures self-report
      outcomes data as well as comprehensive utilization data including pharmacy and imaging data
      through the electronic medical record system. We are applying for additional funding to
      continue follow-up for up to 4 years from baseline.
