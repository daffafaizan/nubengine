      with insulin. Oral conventional pharmacotherapy consisted of α-glycosidase inhibitors (α-GI),
      sulfonylurea (SU), biguanide (BG), thiazolidinedione (TZD), or combinations of these agents.
      Insulin therapy consisted of subcutaneous injections of long-acting insulin analogues prior
      to sleep and bolus subcutaneous injections of rapid-acting insulin analogues in multiple
      daily injections, or subcutaneous injections of mixed insulin analogues twice a day. In spite
      of the treatments, when the physician in charge judged that their values of HbA1c were
      inappropriate, the physician added the pharmacotherapy combined the insulin to incretin-based
      therapy. 2.3.2. For ethical reasons, patients were treated with various anti-hypertensive,
      anti-diabetic, anti-dyslipidemia and/or anti-hypercoagulation agents during the course of the
      study by the patients' own doctors as a part of continuing standard medical care. As to the
      drugs that have been used for the treatment of other disorders and its complication since the
      time before the study, the content should not be changed during the study in principle unless
      the complication is cured. If any new complication occurs during the study period, an
      appropriate treatment is given by the judgment of investigator.
