    
      Objective: To investigate whether injection of botulinum toxin type A is less painful if
      performed through follicular openings versus traditional non-specific approach.

      Design: Prospective, randomized, single-blinded study.

      Setting: Academic dermatology department.

      Patients: A volunteer sample of twenty female patients aged 25-55 who had no prior history of
      botulinum toxin injection.

      Intervention: Each patient received six randomized injections of botulinum toxin type A
      (BotoxÂ® Allergan). Two injections into the procerus muscle and two into each corrugator
      muscle. Three of the injections were performed through follicular openings and three were
      performed traditionally.

      Main Outcome Measure: Patient discomfort on a 1-10 scale and direct comparison between the
      two injection techniques.
