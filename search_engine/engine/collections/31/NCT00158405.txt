    
      The objective of this study is to assess the non-inferiority of two strategies of structured
      treatment interruption (STI) of highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART) compared with
      a continuous HAART.

      It's a multicentric open labeled randomised non-inferiority trial, which takes place in 5
      health care centres in Abidjan, the economic capital city of Cote d'Ivoire

      The trial was designed in two phases :

        1. Pre-randomisation phase : 840 HAART-naive HIV-infected adults start the following
           continuous HAART regimen: zidovudine-lamivudine in combination with

             -  preferably efavirenz, for HIV-1 infected men, and HIV-1 infected women with an
                effective contraception and no history of nevirapine-containing p-MTCT (prevention
                of mother to child transmission);

             -  ritonavir-indinavir, for HIV-2 infected patients, women not desiring contraception,
                and women with a past history of p-MTCT with nevirapine.

        2. Trial phase : After at least six months on continuous HAART in the pre-randomisation
           phase, patients who meet success criteria (CD4 count over 350/mm3, undetectable viral
           load, absence of current opportunistic infection) are randomised into three arms :

             -  Arm 1: Continuous HAART (1 of 6 patients)

             -  Arm 2: Fixed STI strategy (3 of 6 patients): immutable periods of 2 months on HAART
                / 4 months off HAART

             -  Arm 3: CD4-guided STI strategy (2 of 6 patients): unlimited interruption of HAART,
                and then re-introduction/re-interruption guided by the evolution of the CD4 count.

      Following the DSMB recommendation, the arm 3 has been discontinued in october 2005. The trial
      is continuing for patients in the arms 1 and 2.
