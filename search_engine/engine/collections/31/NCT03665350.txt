      pilot study. Central randomization stratified by center, performed online, will allow a
      comparison of two groups of patients one receiving standard care including insulin, the other
      standard care without insulin. Patients considered not eligible for randomization will be
      included in a registry.

      The first objective of this exploratory randomized study is to assess in patients with heart
      failure and T2DM if a standard anti-diabetic strategy which includes insulin has a different
      safety and efficacy profile than one without insulin. The number of patients to be included
      in this exploratory pilot study will be insufficient to prove or disprove a statistically
      significant beneficial effect of the two antidiabetic strategies on clinical events. Special
      care will be paid to the biologic consistency of the different endpoints, primary and
      secondary, even if none of them will individually yield statistically significant
      differences.
