      hyperlipidemia. Duration of treatment is 60 days. The usual starting dose for Lorelco is 500
      mg administered daily, divided into two (2) doses (250mg BID) and given after meals. The dose
      may be adjusted according to the patient's age and condition. Lipid serum test will be
      obtained at Day 0 (Baseline). In subjects requiring antihyperlipidemics that fulfill the
      inclusion criteria, Lorelco 250 BID will be started. There will be 2 follow-up visits after
      baseline on Day 30 and Day 60. Both lipid serum tests and ECG will be done on these 2
      follow-up visits. During each visit the investigator will assess the subject's vital signs
      and symptoms and check for any adverse events.

      The primary outcome of measure is the percentage reduction or increase in total cholesterol
      and triglycerides from baseline values at Week 0 to Week 4 and Week 8 using the following
      scale:

      Total Cholesterol Triglycerides

        1. Markedly reduced

        2. Moderately reduced

        3. Slightly reduced

        4. Unchanged

        5. Increased Reduction of ≥ 15% Reduction of ≥ 10% but < 15% Reduction of ≥ 5% but < 10%
           Change of < 5% Increase of ≥ 5% Reduction of ≥ 30% Reduction of ≥ 20% but < 30%
           Reduction of ≥ 10% but < 20% Change of < 10% Increase of ≥ 10% The percentage change on
           the last week of treatment will be the final evaluation.

      The secondary outcome is measured by the changes in symptoms and vital signs. Using the
      following scale:

        1. Markedly Improved

        2. Improved

        3. Slightly Improved

        4. Unchanged

        5. Aggravated

        6. Unknown (not assessable)

      Safety will be measured by the incidence of adverse events to be collected.

      Overall efficacy and safety will be evaluated to assess the usefulness of Lorelco using the
      following scale:

        1. Very useful

        2. Useful

        3. Somewhat useful

        4. Not useful

        5. Unfavorable

        6. Unknown (not assessable)
