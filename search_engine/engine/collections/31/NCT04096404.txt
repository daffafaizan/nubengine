      characteristics, height, weight, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), body fat
      percentage (BF%), healthy eating motivation, dietary intake and physical activity) will be
      collected initially from participants at St Mary's University during September and October
      2019. Participants will be genotyped, stratified randomisation (based on genotype and BMI)
      will be used to allocate participants to three different groups (1. Control: no advice, 2.
      Non genetic personalised advice: dietary and physical activity advice based on reported
      dietary intake and physical activity 3. Genotype- based personalised advice: dietary and
      physical activity advice based on genotype, reported dietary intake and physical activity.
      Following allocation to groups participants in groups 2 and 3 will receive appropriate
      dietary and physical activity advice via email (appendix a) and all participants will
      complete the healthy eating motivation questionnaire for a second time. In April/May 2020
      follow up variables (smoking status, weight, BMI, WC, BF%, healthy eating motivation, dietary
      intake and physical activity) will be measured again. These follow up variables will be
      measured every September and April/May until September 2022. After each follow up
      participants in groups 2 and 3 will be resent their dietary and physical activity advice and
      updated information based on their reported dietary intake and physical activity.
