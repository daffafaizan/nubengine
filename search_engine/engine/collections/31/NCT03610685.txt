      inhibition of eosinophilic inflammation, reduces the number of eosinophils in sputum and
      blood, leading to a reduction in asthma exacerbations and a need for systemic
      glucocorticoids. Once this therapy has been initiated for severe eosinophilic asthma, the
      additional role of oral corticosteroids is questionable as their main target is reduction of
      eosinophils and hence responsiveness to oral corticosteroids in patients in a stable state of
      asthma may reduce.

      Using two weeks of high dose prednisolone versus placebo in a crossover design after 12 weeks
      of mepolizumab therapy will allow an understanding of the pathways that remain steroid
      responsive following IL-5 suppression.

      This is an exploratory study with no single primary end point. The objective of the study is
      to assess the change in airway inflammation following oral corticosteroids versus placebo and
      the airway inflammation while on mepolizumab in stable state of asthma.

      Note: Mepolizumab is not an intervention in this study; it is initiated as part of usual NHS
      care.
