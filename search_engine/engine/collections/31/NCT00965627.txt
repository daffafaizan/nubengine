    
      The aim of the present study is to investigated the genetic alterations in tumor samples of a
      series of all WHO-defined subtypes of thymoma patients using high resolution microarray-
      comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) followed by hierarchical cluster analyses of the data
      to identify specific patterns of genetic aberrations and genes associated with each subtype.
      Moreover, tumor samples will be also investigated for some specific potential therapy targets
      by immunoistichemistry, mutation analysis, and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)
      analysis. All these biological data will be correlated with clinical patients characteristics
      and survival data.
