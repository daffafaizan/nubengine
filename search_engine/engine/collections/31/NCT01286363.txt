      muscles during mastication and in generating bite force, smaller occlusal contact area and
      masticatory capacity when compared to brachyfacial individuals.

      Wide, bilateral chewing cycles were related to better masticatory performance, however,
      unilateral chewing was reported to be very common in population, and it has been associated
      to lateral asymmetry on bite force and occlusal contact area.

      It has been reported that dolichofacial subjects need greater muscular effort during
      mastication when compared to meso and brachyfacial subjects. This may cause functional
      overloading of weaker masticatory muscles, and may lead to functional asymmetries.
