      prevalence over the world and causing huge economic loss.

      This research is a double-blind randomized controlled trial. In this study the investigators
      introduce a technique derived from traditional Chinese massage using a special tool made from
      buffalo's horns to perform the massage, so called "buffalo horn technique". The tool is like
      a short rod in about 15-cm length with a cone-like end. During the massage, the therapist
      presses the cone-like end against the painful region of back. Because the cone-like end has a
      small contact area with the participant's body surface, it may release deep layer fascia with
      higher pressure produced by the therapist toward the treatment area. To compare with this
      unique technique that features a deep massage, the investigators design a technique of
      shallow massage serving as a comparative treatment. During the intervention of shallow
      massage, the therapist also uses a similar rod but with an end in a larger surface area then
      that used in the deep massage. Thus it produces a lower pressure on the painful region due to
      a larger contact surface when pressing the rod end against the body of the participant.

      Participants are randomly assigned to either deep-massage group (DM) or superficial-massage
      (SM) group. The participants received two sessions a week for a total six sessions. The
      outcome measures include the structured questionnaire to investigate the pain-related
      outcomes and back pain-related disabilities. The investigators also perform the clinical
      assessments such as range of motion of trunk. All the outcomes are assessed
      before-intervention (pretest) and after the end of intervention (posttest).
