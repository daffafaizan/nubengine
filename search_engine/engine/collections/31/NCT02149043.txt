      ulcerative colitis investigators will demonstrate pathological thermography criteria that
      correlate with standard inflammatory markers such as Mayo endoscopic subscore (ESS), CRP and
      calprotectin in patients with ulcerative colitis.

      Aims: The aim of this study is to record abdominal thermographic images of patients with
      active ulcerative colitis (UC), to create interpretational thermographic criteria for these
      images and to compare them to abdominal infrared (IR) images of healthy volunteers.
      Furthermore, investigators intend to correlate these criteria with standard markers of
      inflammation such as CRP and calprotectin in patients with UC at the beginning of treatment
      and at the end.

      Materials and methods: For the purpose of this work, 36 patients with extensive UC and 30
      healthy individuals will be put throe thermographic imagining, have their stool tested for
      calprotectin and their blood for CRP. In addition, patients with UC will receive colonoscopy
      evaluations.

      Expected scientific contribution: The results of this paper would give an additional
      contribution to existing tools for pursuing ulcerative colitis activity thus demonstrating
      the potential of thermography as a complementary method to standard methods in assessing
      disease activity. Establishing diagnostic criteria for this method would be a good addition
      to present clinical practice.
