      patients own breathing pattern. Asynchrony during ventilatory care may increase the risk for
      complications especially in premature infants with immature lungs.

      In this study investigators will compare currently used ventilation methods to a new neurally
      adjusted ventilatory assist (NAVA). The aim is to find out, whether by using this new method
      it is possible to decrease the complications associated to ventilatory care and to shorten
      the need for mechanical ventilation.
