    
      This is a single arm phase 2 study to obtain a preliminary estimate of efficacy of
      myeloablative double unit umbilical cord blood transplantation (UCBT) as measured by overall
      and disease-free survival at 1 year post transplantation. The UCB graft will consist of two
      (or double) units from two unrelated newborn donors. Patients with hematopoietic malignancy
      at high-risk for relapse or with advanced disease will receive myeloablative conditioning
      with cyclophosphamide (Cy),low dose fludarabine (Flu) and total body irradiation (TBI) with
      post transplantation cyclosporine (CSA) and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) for GVHD prophylaxis.
