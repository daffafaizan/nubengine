      phenolic-rich potato extracts decrease intestinal glucose transport. The aim is to determine
      if these effects extend to the the an in vivo situation. Specifically, the glycemic response
      following consumption of phenolic rich pigmented potatoes compared to white potatoes with
      lower phenolic content will be measured. Gastric emptying will also be measured to show the
      effects are in fact due to rate of carbohydrate digestion and intestinal glucose transport
      and not gastric emptying rate.
