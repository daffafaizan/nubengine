      anesthesia care unit (PACU) and continuing for thirty six hours post orthopedic surgical
      procedure. The patients are randomized into a capnography or standard of care group and the
      percentage of newly identified OSA patients were measured in each group using the criteria
      set forth by 2006 American Society of Anesthesiologist practice guideline (Anesthesiology
      2006; 104:1081-93).

      Background/Changes: Hospital complications are three times higher in patients with
      obstructive sleep apnea and the majority of these complications are related to opioid induced
      respiratory depression (Mayo Clin Proc Sept 2001:897-905). American Society of
      Anesthesiologist 2006 practice guideline for perioperative management of patients with
      obstructive sleep apnea (Anesthesiology 2006; 104:1081-93) lists the criteria for identifying
      undiagnosed obstructive sleep apnea. One of the risk factors in the guideline lists apnea
      (pauses in breathing). Capnography measures apnea episodes and continuously monitors
      respiration rate.

      As previously described, five percent of the general population has obstructive sleep apnea
      (OSA) and the prevalence among patients requiring surgery is 9% (NEJM 1993; 328:1230-1235).
      Between 50-80% of OSA individuals are undiagnosed when presenting for surgery.
