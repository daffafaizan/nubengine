      hospital with acute critical illness, myocardial infarction and stroke. Moreover patients
      with hyperglycaemia have a significantly longer hospital stay, higher rates of ICU admission,
      increased in-hospital mortality and are more likely to require transfer to a nursing home.
      Recently, interventional studies have linked reversal of hyperglycaemia to better clinical
      outcomes especially in acute myocardial infarction, cardiac surgery and in critically ill
      patients.

      In England and Wales, it is estimated that the number of people with COPD is approaching 1.5
      million. The morbidity and economic costs associated with the condition are extremely high
      with approximately 10% of all acute medical admissions caused by exacerbations of the
      underlying condition. As a corollary about 15% of patients with COPD need admission to
      hospital each year.

      Acute hyperglycaemia is common among patients admitted with acute exacerbations of COPD. The
      reasons for this are likely to be multi-factorial including an association between COPD and
      increased risk of developing diabetes at least in women, the elderly nature of the two
      populations and the use of glucocorticoids which markedly increases the risk of
      hyperglycaemia. Admission hyperglycaemia (>11 mmol/l) also appears to predict increased
      morbidity for patients with COPD admitted to intensive care.

      The trial will be a randomised trial of comparison of usual treatment vs intensive insulin
      treatment for patients with COPD who may or may not have diabetes. Patients will take part in
      the trial for the first 5 days during their hospital stay.
