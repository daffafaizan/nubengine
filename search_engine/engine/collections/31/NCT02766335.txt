    
      CO-PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the response rate (confirmed and unconfirmed, complete and partial) among
      patients treated with durvalumab (MEDI4736).

      II. To assess the response rate (confirmed and unconfirmed, complete and partial) among
      programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) positive patients treated with MEDI4736.

      SECONDARY AND EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess investigator-assessed progression-free survival (IA-PFS) among patients treated
      with MEDI4736.

      II. To assess IA-PFS among PD-L1 positive patients treated with MEDI4736. III. To assess
      overall survival (OS) in patients treated with MEDI4736. IV. To assess overall survival (OS)
      in PD-L1 positive patients treated with MEDI4736.

      V. To evaluate the frequency and severity of toxicities associated with MEDI4736.

      VI. To assess immune-related IA-PFS using a modified response criteria adapted for
      immunotherapy (immune-related response criteria [irRC]-IA-PFS) in all patients and in the
      subset of patients determined to be PD-L1 positive treated with MEDI4736.

      VII. To compare IA-PFS, irRC-IA-PFS, OS, toxicity and response rates between patients
      randomized to MEDI4736 versus docetaxel.

      TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE OBJECTIVES:

      I. To identify additional predictive or prognostic tumor/blood biomarkers beyond the chosen
      biomarker.

      II. To identify potential resistance biomarkers at disease progression. III. To establish a
      tissue/blood repository from patients with refractory squamous cell cancer.

      MEDI4736 RE-TREATMENT OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate response rates (confirmed and unconfirmed, complete and partial responses)
      among patients re-treated with MEDI4736.

      II. To estimate median PFS from the date of re-treatment.

      OUTLINE (CLOSED TO ACCRUAL 12/18/2015):

      Patients with tumors that do not match one of the currently active drug-biomarker
      combinations receive durvalumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat
      every 2 weeks for 12 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Upon evidence of progression following discontinuation of 12 months of treatment, patients
      may restart treatment and continue for up to 12 additional months (Arm III).

      ARM I: (Closed to accrual 12/2015) Patients receive durvalumab intravenously (IV) over 60
      minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 14 days for 12 months in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II (CLOSED TO ACCRUAL 4/2015): Patients receive docetaxel IV on day 1. Courses repeat
      every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. (closed to
      accrual with Revision #2 4/22/15)

      ARM III: For patients assigned to Arm 1, MEDI4736: Upon evidence of progression following
      discontinuation of 12 months of treatment, patients may restart treatment with Arm 3,
      MEDI4736 for up to 12 months with the same treatment guidelines followed during the initial
      12-month treatment period. Patients will only be able to restart treatment once; thus a
      maximum of two 12-month periods will be allowed. Patients receive durvalumab IV over 60
      minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 14 days for 12 months in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, all patients are followed up every 6 months for the
      first 2 years and then at the end of the year 3 from date of sub-study/re-registration.
