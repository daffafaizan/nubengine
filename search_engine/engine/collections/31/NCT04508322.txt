    
      Participants (children, 9 years of age) are recruited at the orthodontic specialist clinic in
      Norrk√∂ping, Sweden.

      After informed consent participants are randomized into Group 1, 2 or 3. After randomization
      and registration, treatment with HGA is initiated for Group 1.

      treatment with HGA at the age of eleven.

      Group 3 serves as untreated control group to treatment with HGA.

      Four years after registration, Group 3 starts treatment with FA (3M Victory brackets, .022
      slot size, McLaughlin-Bennet-Trevesi prescription).

      The patients in group 1 and 2 in need of a second phase of orthodontic treatment are treated
      with FA (3M Victory brackets, .022 slot size, McLaughlin-Bennet-Trevesi prescription) in
      early adolescence.
