      hospitalized one day prior to the injection (Day -1), administered a single dose of GX-I7
      solution for subcutaneous injection, and then discharged on Day 3. After completing all
      scheduled tests at the visit 8 (Day 28), safety-related data of each cohort will be evaluated
      by Independent Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC). Dose escalation will proceed under the
      principal investigator, medical monitor, and the sponsor's mutual approval, referring to
      SMC's evaluation.
