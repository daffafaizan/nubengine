      recurrent malignant brain tumors undergoing surgical resection. II. Evaluate the performance
      of the GliaSite RTS in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open label, multicenter study. Patients undergo surgical resection of the
      tumor followed by surgical placement of the GliaSite device in the resection cavity. One to 2
      weeks after surgery, patients receive brachytherapy consisting of an infusion of iodine
      I-125. The I-125 solution is removed and collected 5-7 days later. The device is surgically
      removed within 24 hours. Patients are followed at 24 hours, 14 days, and 1 year post device
      removal.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study.
