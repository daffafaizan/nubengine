      NCT02571244). Background: Research suggests that smokers who receive treatment inside the
      hospital and post-discharge follow up for at least a month is most likely to quit smoking
      than those who didn't receive any intervention. The current challenge is to know the best way
      to support post-discharge quit attempts in the Brazilian context. Objective: The aim of this
      study is compare the effectiveness of personalized text messages (TM) and telephone
      counseling to support smoking cessation between post discharge patients. Methods: All
      patients admitted to the University Hospital of Juiz de Fora (HU/UFJF), between 06/2017 to
      11/2018, will be asked about the cigarettes consumption in the last 30 days. Smokers patients
      will receive brief interventions and nicotine replacement therapy during hospitalization.
      After discharge these patients will be allocated into an intervention or control arm. The
      intervention group will receive mobile phone TM twice a day up to fifteen days. The control
      group will receive usual care (four telephone counseling sessions using motivational
      interviewing approach). Results: At the first and third months, after randomization, the
      patients will be contacted for smoke abstinence assessment.
