      skin biopsy assessment of intraepidermal nerve fiber density. The patients must also have a
      pain score of a least 5 on a VAS Scale. Patients will receive Fycompa 2mg tablets. Each week
      patients will be allowed to titrate up by 2mgs up to a maximum dose of 8mg a day. This dosing
      has been used in numerous pain studies when no single dose has been proven to be effective.
      This does not seem to reduce the validity of the placebo phase. Patients can choose the dose
      they feel is best tolerated and most efficacious. Once patients choose this dose they will be
      randomized into two arms. Each arm will last 6 weeks. Such that patient will receive the dose
      they chose as most efficacious for 6 weeks or matching placebo for 6 weeks. Then each patient
      will crossover to the other arm. Investigator will assess compliance by counting pills at
      each visit. This will provide the ability to see which dose most patients prefer and then
      study the dose in a blinded randomized fashion. There will be 5 office visits and 3 phone
      visits in the study and . Patients will keep a diary of weekly VAS pain scores.
