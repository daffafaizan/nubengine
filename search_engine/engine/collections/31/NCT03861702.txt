    
      This is a phase II, single-arm, open-label, clinical study to investigate the efficacy and
      tolerability of a combination of liposomal irinotecan (nal-IRI) with oxaliplatin, leucovorin,
      and 5-fluorouracil (FOLFOX-nal-IRI) for treatment of patients with locally advanced
      pancreatic carcinoma (LAPC). Each subject will be screened for eligibility by evaluation
      including medical history, physical examination, performance status, blood tests, computed
      tomographic (CT) scans, and electrocardiogram. Within 28 days of screening, the consented
      subjects will have a central venous access device placed and then start treatment.

      For every 2-week cycle of FOLFOX-nal-IRI, each subject will receive nal-IRI (irinotecan free
      base 50 mg/m2 intravenously over 90 minutes), oxaliplatin (60 mg/m2 intravenously over 2
      hours), leucovorin (400 mg/m2 intravenously over 2 hours), and 5-fluorouracil 2,400 mg/m2
      intravenously over 46 hours).

      Tumor response will be evaluated every 4 cycles of treatment with CT scans using RECIST 1.1
      criteria. If the tumor becomes surgically resectable and the subject is a surgical candidate
      as determined by a multidisciplinary team, the subject will undergo surgery (at which point
      he/she would enter survival follow-up). If the tumor remains unresectable and there is no
      tumor progression, each subject will be treated up to a total of 12 cycles of FOLFOX-nal-IRI.

      Following treatment with 12 cycles of FOLFOX-nal-IRI, if tumor remains unresectable, the
      subjects may receive further treatment (chemotherapy using the same regimen or of the
      treating physician's choice, or chemoradiation therapy) or observation as determined by the
      physician. During the course of treatment, if the subjects develop unacceptable toxicity
      and/or disease progression, the treatment will be discontinued, and the subjects will be
      further managed at the discretion of the treating oncologists.
