      of urethral tissue in IUD is not explored although well viewed in perineal ultrasound. Our
      actual knowledge demonstrates that urodynamic ultrasound is reliable to establish the bladder
      neck mobility. And the posterior urethral wall mobility was often associated to the stress
      urinary incontinence. Two elements appeared to indicate the elasticity of the urethral
      environment: functional length urethral variation and urethral closure angle variation during
      Valsalva manoeuvres compared to rest. This study aims to evaluate the correlation of the
      ultrasonic functional length of the urethra and the incontinence urinary disorder for the
      purpose to predict the severity of this syndrome.
