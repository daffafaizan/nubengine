      endometrial cancer (EC) or atypical hyperplasia (AH) patients who met the fertility-sparing
      indications in the hospitals involved in this study were recruited. Then the investigators
      conducted assessment, treatment and follow up according to the standard procedure. General
      information, therapeutic regimen, side effects, oncological and pregnant results were
      collected for risk factors analysis.
