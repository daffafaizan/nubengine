      being tested to treat people who have mccRCC. This study will assess the efficacy and safety
      of MLN0128 and MLN1117 as well as how it is processed by the body in participants with
      advanced or mccRCC.

      The study will enroll approximately 96 participants. Participants will be randomly assigned
      (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the three treatment groups:

        -  Everolimus 10 mg once daily

        -  MLN0128 30 mg once weekly

        -  MLN0128 4 mg once daily for 3 days per week + MLN1117 200 mg once daily for 3 days per
           week

      All participants will be asked to take the study drug at the same time on each scheduled day.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted worldwide. The overall time to participate in this
      study is 2 years after last participant is randomized, or when the last participant
      discontinues study treatment (approximately 3 years). Participants will make multiple visits
      to the clinic including a follow-up visit 30 to 40 days after receiving their last dose of
      study drug or prior to start of subsequent anticancer therapy for safety assessment.
      Participants will then be followed for Progression Free and Overall Survival.
