      are unresponsive to treatment with corticosteroids are further categorized as having steroid
      resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS). Renal biopsy in SRNS patients often reveal the
      histological lesion of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS).

      Genetic research has identified mutations in specific podocyte proteins, which may lead to
      the development of steroid resistant nephrotic syndrome. In addition to being expressed in
      the fetal adult kidney, human podocin mRNA is also expressed in the fetal heart tissue.
      Multiple case reports have described an association between cardiac abnormalities and
      familial FSGS. These findings suggest that this gene may be involved in the pathogenesis of
      cardiac abnormalities seen in this population.

      The objectives of this study is to:

        -  Perform genetic analysis to define the prevalence of each of the known podocyte gene
           mutations in an unselected cohort of patients with FSGS

        -  Perform a comprehensive assessment of cardiovascular status to determine the incidence
           of any cardiac abnormalities in patients with FSGS

        -  Determine if patients with mutations in specific podocyte proteins are more likely to
           have cardiovascular abnormalities

        -  Initiate long-term follow up in all patients to determine whether cardiac prognosis is
           related to any specific genetic abnormality
