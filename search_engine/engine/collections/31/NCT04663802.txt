    
      The study is a 5-arm, stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial of electronic health record
      (EHR)-based implementation strategies set in 12 community and academic ICUs in 5 hospitals of
      UPHS all currently using an EHR-based algorithm to identify patients with Acute Respiratory
      Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and prompt physicians to employ LPV will sequentially add two of
      three EHR-based implementation strategies to further promote LPV utilization among all MV
      patients. ICUs will be randomly assigned to first receive either a default order set
      (Strategy A) or physician-targeted accountable justification strategy (Strategy B). ICUs will
      be assigned to one of six wedges using computerized random-number generation, thereby
      determining the date on which they adopt their assigned EHR-based strategy. The first wedge
      will begin in the fourth month of the trial phase, so that all hospitals will contribute a
      minimum of 3 months of data prior to having adopted the implementation strategy. Six months
      after adoption, ICUs will add on an RT-targeted accountable justification strategy (Strategy
      C). By the end of the 27-month study period, all hospitals will have been utilizing two
      strategies in combination for at least 3 months. This design enables comparisons of outcomes
      before and after implementation within ICUs, as well as at a given point in time among ICUs
      which will have been randomly assigned to different strategies. During the two months after
      the implementation strategy rolls out in each ICU, researchers will perform semi-structured
      interviews of all physicians and RTs who staff study ICUs. After intervention period, there
      will be a 12 month observational period where ICUs will resume usual processes for care of
      mechanically ventilated patients and no study intervention will occur.
