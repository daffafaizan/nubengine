      control group at the end of the procedure (VAS score: 16.5 ± 9.9 vs. 27.0 ± 15.9, atropine
      vs. control, p = 0.00). The change in the degree of secretion between the start and end of
      the procedure was significantly greater in the atropine group than in the control group (p =
      0.00) (Fig. 2). However, the frequency of hypersalivation as predefined (VAS score ≥50) did
      not differ between the groups (p = 0.06).

      The only complication that differed significantly between the two groups was tachycardia (p >
      0.05). Complications such as aspiration, laryngospasm, and apnea were not documented in the
      hospital. There were fewer interventions for hypersalivation in the atropine group, but the
      difference was not significant (p > 0.05). As interventions, O2 administration and
      endotracheal intubation were not needed. After discharge, the control patients tended to have
      more complaints of nausea, vomiting, and ataxia, although the difference was not significant
      (p > 0.05) Heart rate was increased significantly in the atropine group (p = 0.00). The
      frequency of tachycardia according to patient age was also significantly higher in the
      atropine group than in the control group (p = 0.00)
