      Primary

        -  Determine the safety profile of neoadjuvant cetuximab, fluorouracil, and pelvic
           irradiation in patients with locally advanced or locally recurrent rectal cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the activity of this regimen, in terms of pathological complete response rate,
           in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a non-randomized, open-label, pilot study.

      Patients receive cetuximab IV over 1-2 hours on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, 36, 43, 50, 57, and 64
      and fluorouracil IV continuously on days 1-42. Patients undergo whole-pelvic radiotherapy
      once daily on days 1-5, 8-12, 15-19, 22-26, 29-33, and 36-40. Treatment continues in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Approximately 1-3 weeks after completion of study treatment, patients undergo surgical
      resection followed by adjuvant chemotherapy off-study.

      Patients are followed for up to 5 years.
