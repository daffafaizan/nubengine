      group will receive CC (100 mg/day for 5 consecutive days from day 2 of cycle) and estradiol
      (2 mg/day for 5 consecutive days from day 2 of cycle). Women in the CC group will receive CC
      (100 mg/day for 5 consecutive days from day 2 of cycle) and placebo mimic estradiol (for 5
      consecutive days from day 2 of cycle). Transvaginal sonography (TVS) scan will be performed
      regularly for monitoring of follicular growth (folliculometry); starting from day 10 of the
      stimulation cycle and repeated every 2-3 days. When there will be at least one follicle ≥ 18
      mm in diameter, final oocyte maturation will be induced by intramuscular administration of
      10000 IU of human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) and timed intercourse will be advised. If
      there will be no follicle ≥ 12 mm by day 16 of the cycle, monitoring of follicular growth
      will be discontinued and the cycle will be presumed to be anovulatory. Ovulation will be
      documented by TVS scan one week after triggering of oocyte maturation and will be confirmed
      by assessing the midluteal serum progesterone level. Each woman will be subjected to ovarian
      stimulation for a maximum of 3 consecutive cycles except if she gets pregnant in the first or
      second cycle.
