      bupivicaine, was introduced as a long-acting form of bupivicaine, a local anesthetic. This
      new technology has been utilized by numerous orthopedic joint surgeons. Since its
      introduction there have been studies showing varying results in terms of postoperative pain
      control.

      Therefore, it is our purpose to conduct a prospective, randomized control study to compare
      postoperative pain control in a series of patients treated with either:

        1. a local cocktail.

        2. a local cocktail plus Exparel.

        3. marcaine plus Exparel prior to wound closure following knee arthroplasty.

      METHODOLOGY

      Subjects will be randomized preoperatively into three different groups on total knee subjects
      done at three different facilities. This study is single blinded study. The visual pain scale
      from 1-10 will be used to determine pain control at 3, 12, 24, and 48 hour time intervals
      postoperatively. Postoperative narcotic use will also be monitored at the same time
      intervals.
