    
      This study is designed as an epidemiological study with retrospective clinical and genetic
      data collection and prospective quality of life (QOL) data collections and genotyping of
      subjects without current molecular diagnosis. Data on the genetic/chromosomal etiology of the
      condition will be collected through chart review. For those subjects who have not had
      molecular or cytogenetic analysis, molecular and cytogenetic testing will be offered after
      genetic counseling. Those subjects who agree to have genetic testing will have 5-10 ml of
      blood drawn and sent to the cytogenetic laboratory at Weill Cornell Medical College for
      testing to determine the chromosomal complement, and 5 ml of blood sent to Dr. Arupa Ganguly
      at the University of Pennsylvania for the identification of a factor VIII or factor IX
      mutation, and X-chromosome inactivation studies.
