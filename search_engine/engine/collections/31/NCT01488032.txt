      forms of the same disease and whether they have similar pathogenetic mechanisms. Spectral
      domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) is supposed to objectively evaluate retinal
      nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness. The investigators propose a study to compare the RNFL in
      patients with normal- and high-tension-glaucoma. In order to exclude other possible
      differences,which could influence the results, only patients with similar structural optic
      nerve head damage in both groups will be compared.
