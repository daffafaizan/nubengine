      skills are affected by the patients' knowledge, activities and attitude to pain management.

      Therefore, we conduct a cluster randomized clinical trial (C-RCT) that will test the
      effectiveness of SCION-PAIN program against care as usual on self pain management of the
      patient and average pain level.

      As allocation to intervention or control is performed on the level of wards, randomization is
      stratified by ward profile (e.g. gynaecological, haematological, urological).

      Wards were included if they agreed to participate and had more than 10% patients with a
      diagnosis of cancer in 2006. Wards with a pediatric profile were excluded.

      Adult oncology patients with persistent pain will be recruited by the nurses of the
      participating wards under the guidance of a research nurse. Patients are included in the
      trial if they meet the inclusion criteria and sign informed consent. They will receive the
      intervention that the respective ward was allocated to.

      The SCION-PAIN program as a multi modular structured nursing intervention (see Arm
      Description) will be conducted by specially trained ward nurses in cooperation with the
      research nurse. The intervention will include components of knowledge, skills training, and
      coaching (particularly against patient-related barriers to pain medication) to improve cancer
      pain management. Patients in intervention group will receive follow-up telephone counseling
      within 2 to 3 days after discharge. The self management skills of the patients will be
      observed up to 28 days post discharge. Both quantitative and qualitative analyses will be
      conducted to evaluate patient outcomes.
