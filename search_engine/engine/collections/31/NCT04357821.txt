      effective ART. All participants will receive a combination regimen administered during ART
      and then undergo an analytic treatment interruption. Our strategy has five stages

        1. IL-12 adjuvanted p24CE DNA prime (p24CE/IL-12) at Weeks 0 and 4

        2. IL-12 adjuvanted DNA boost (p24CE plus p55gag) at Week 12

        3. MVA/HIV62B (MVA62B) boost at Week 20

        4. single dose of two bNAbs (VRC07-523LS and 10-1074, which target CD4 binding site and V3
           loop, respectively) at week 24 with a TLR9 agonist (lefitolimod) administered weekly
           between Weeks 24 and 33 (10 doses)

        5. ATI with single dose of VRC07 and 10-1074 at Week 34

      Follow-up off ART will occur through at least Week 46 (expected) and on or off ART (depending
      on outcome) through Week 86.

      Should this approach work, viral load would be expected to rebound in all individuals a few
      weeks after the bNAb levels decrease to sub-therapeutic levels. This acute rebound would be
      followed by a new lower viral load set-point and perhaps a long-term remission.
