      anesthesia. EEG recording will continue until the end of anesthesia care. The
      anesthesiologist will be blinded to the EEG results during the study. Peri-operative factors
      such as demographics, vital signs, medications, etc... will also be recoded. Each site is
      expected to enroll up to 75 patients to provide at least 50 evaluable subjects. EEG files
      will be reviewed after recordings.

      After informed consent has been obtained, the subject will receive standard anesthetic care
      as administered by the anesthesia provider, who will be blinded to the EEG display and data.
      EEG recording will continue until the end of anesthesia care.

      After the recording, the EEG file will be reviewed and the number and duration of isoelectric
      events will be analyzed. Additional data that will be recorded include: patient demographic
      and perioperative factors (surgical procedure, anesthetic medications, end tidal anesthetic
      levels, induction and recovery room behavior, physiologic data, and time-stamps for
      intraoperative event. Post-operative questionnaire may also be sent to parents.
