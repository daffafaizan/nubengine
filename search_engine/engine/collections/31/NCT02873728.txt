      Arterial vascular evaluation, Medical past History including medications and surgeries
      Documentation of the chronic wounds by description and photography with scale.

      Base line blood test for CBC, HbA1C, Electrolytes, Urea, Cr, Liver enzymes. IL 1 IL 6 VEGF NO
      CD34 Adenosine All patients will received the standard wound care in use by the staff of the
      chronic wound clinic. Care givers will be blinded as to the study allocation of each patient.
      Patients will be divided randomly into two equal groups. Pressure cuffs will be applied to
      both arms of all subjects. The cuffs will be inflated and deflated intermittently for three
      cycles of 5 minutes each. In the study group, the cuffs will be inflated to 50 mmHg above
      systolic blood pressure while the performing investigator examines the radial pulse to ensure
      complete blood flow obstruction. In the control group, inflation will be up to 10 mmHg only.
      The patients will be followed for 10 weeks.

      During this period, they will be examined every 2 weeks (5 follow-up visits); and in each of
      these visits the above procedure will be repeated including blood collection before
      intervention and 24-48h after intervention.

      In each visit a "blinded" physician will photograph with scale the wound and grade the
      granulation tissue covering the wound on a scale from 0 to 5.

      The primary end point of the study is the number of healed wounds and wound area change among
      the two groups. Secondary outcomes will be the degree of granulation tissue and levels of IL
      1 IL 6 VEGF NO CD34 Adenosine
