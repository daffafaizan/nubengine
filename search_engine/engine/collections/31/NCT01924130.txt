      childhood obesity. No randomized controlled trials have examined the effects of a school
      breakfast feeding program on obesity. We propose to develop and evaluate a School Breakfast
      Policy Initiative (SBPI) that combines classroom feeding, in-school nutrition education,
      social marketing and parent outreach. Specifically, we will promote the benefits of a healthy
      breakfast at school or home and deter buying "breakfast" at corner stores where purchases are
      high in energy, solid fats and added sugars. This intervention will be evaluated in the "real
      world" of urban schools that make frequent use of the SNAP-Ed and the School Breakfast
      Program. The specific aims are:

        1. To develop the SBPI intervention within the context of SNAP Ed and the National School
           Breakfast Program in the School District of Philadelphia.

        2. To conduct a pilot feasibility study among 4 schools (2 intervention and 2 control) to
           assess feasibility and acceptability.

        3. To compare participants in the intervention (n=8) and comparison schools (n=8) on the
           incidence of overweight and obesity. We predict that intervention schools, compared to
           the comparison schools, will have a significantly lower incidence rate of overweight and
           obesity over a 2 y period.

        4. To compare participants in the intervention (n=8) and comparison schools (n=8) on eating
           one breakfast. We predict that intervention schools, compared to the comparison schools,
           will have significantly greater percentage of children eating one breakfast per day over
           a 2 y period.
