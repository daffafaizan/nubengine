      CC-5013-MM-021 (from the start date of lenalidomide treatment), the EAP will allow consented
      subjects who (1) have remained progression free under Rd treatment in Study CC-SO I3-MM-02 I
      to roll over to the Treatment Phase of the LAP to continue Rd treatment, and (2) have
      discontinued Rd therapy and are currently in the Long-Term Follow-up Phase in Study
      CC-5013-MM-021 to roll over to the Safety Follow-up Phase of the EAP for survival and SPM
      outcomes. The maximum duration of this LAP program is at least 5 years from the time the last
      on-study
