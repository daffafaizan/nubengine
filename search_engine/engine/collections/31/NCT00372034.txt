      decreases in lipid layer and tear film break up time during contact lens wear have been
      reported, leading to excessive evaporation, reduced tear volume and an increase in
      osmolality.

      Similar tear film changes occur with Dry Eye Disease. A commonly used therapy in treating dry
      eye is the insertion of punctal plugs to increase tear volume and ease dry eye symptoms.
      Punctal plugs block the tear drainage system, and often increase tear stability, and improve
      ocular surface health.

      This study will evaluate the role of tear volume in discomfort and dryness sensations during
      contact lens wear, and the possible influence on osmolality and ocular surface sensitivity.
      Collagen punctal plugs will be used for this study, as these allow a temporary (3-14 days)
      occlusion of the ocular drainage system, are easily removed if necessary and are inserted
      with minimal risk.
