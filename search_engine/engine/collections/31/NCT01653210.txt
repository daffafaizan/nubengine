      across the menstrual cycle in women with T1DM. A subset of premenopausal women with T1DM
      experience loss of glucose control during the latter half of the cycle (the luteal phase).
      Clinical trials are sparse and tools are limited to focus on this aspect of diabetes care
      which is highly relevant in affected individuals. To obtain data to initialize this
      mobile-based module, we will enroll premenopausal women for approximately three-month
      outpatient study designed to characterize at least three complete menstrual cycles. These
      subjects will wear continuous glucose monitors (CGMs), record self-monitored blood glucoses
      (SMBGs) and utilize an insulin pump to capture insulin dosing. In-home ovulation kits will be
      used to determine relevant days for sex-steroid blood measurements to define menstrual cycle
      phases. Finally, structured at-home meals will be provided during different phases of the
      menstrual cycle for insulin action parameters assessments.

      The software module will be developed in parallel with the data collection from study
      subjects. The software module will not be used with the patients in this study as it is not
      in existence as would be developed in parallel. The goal of the module functionality will be
      to 1) assist patients and providers in the identification and management of glycemic
      variability surrounding the menstrual cycle and 2) add value to and become an integral module
      within the artificial pancreas.
