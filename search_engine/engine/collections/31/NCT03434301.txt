      tack (Protack™) to fixate Symbotex™ composite mesh in the elective repair of incisional
      hernia) is a prospective, single-centre, double blinded randomised trial which aims to
      establish whether the use of absorbable (ABS) compared to non-absorbable (Non-ABS) tacks in
      adult patients undergoing elective incisional hernia repair produces a lower rate of pain
      both immediately and long-term. Secondary outcomes to be explored include seroma formation,
      hernia recurrence, length of postoperative hospital stay, wound infection, reoperation rate,
      operation time, health related quality of life and time to return to normal daily activity.

      Patients entering TACKoMesh will be randomised immediately prior to their operation with a
      1:1 ratio of ABS versus Non-ABS tack arm allocation. The same composite mesh will be used for
      all operations. Follow-up is according to a predetermined schedule, using specifically
      designed Case Report Forms to collect the blinded data.
