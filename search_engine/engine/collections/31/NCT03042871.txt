      specific characteristics, including small dimensions and limited exudative manifestations
      comparing with age-related macular degeneration. However, treatment regimen and re-treatment
      criteria follow the PrONTO protocol. The question of the optimal dose and treatment regimen
      in myopic CNV management is still unresolved. There is no unequivocal evidence suggesting hat
      PRN treatment is more effective than a loading phase followed by an as-needed variable dosage
      regimen.
