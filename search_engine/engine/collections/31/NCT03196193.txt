    
      Objective： To compare fracture reduction maintenance rate at 2-3weeks post-operatively
      between patients operated with AS2 (investigational group) and patients operated without AS2
      (Control group) using same implant system (ZNN CM Asia, Zimmer Biomet).

      Endpoint： Primary： The rate of reduction position maintenance at 2-3 weeks post-operatively.
      Secondary： Surgery time / fracture type / postoperative reduction position / CT assessment /
      Safety information
