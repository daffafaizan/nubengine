      in Australia. Patellofemoral pain syndrome or pain about the knee cap is such a condition
      often treated in primary care. Both the individual and community are affected by this
      condition with an estimated 1 in 4 sufferers having problems and pain up to 20 years after
      first being afflicted. Importantly, it interferes with activities such as walking, jogging,
      gym classes and aerobics, which are often prescribed to prevent serious conditions of the
      heart, diabetes and obesity. Hence, it negatively impacts the health and well being of our
      nation.
