      to evaluate how the impact of prostate cancer among West Africans compares with that among
      African Americans, whose reported incidence rates are among the highest in the world. West
      Africans and African Americans share genetic ancestry but have very different lifestyles and
      environmental exposures. The study aim will be achieved by establishing lower and upper
      bounds on the true incidence of prostate cancer in the capital city of Accra. The secondary
      aim of the study is to establish epidemiological, biochemical, and genetic profiles of West
      Africans for comparisons with African Americans to provide etiologic clues for prostate
      cancer. DESIGN: The study will consist of two components: 1. a clinical survey, a. divided
      into a five-year retrospective, and b. a 3-year prospective phase, and 2. a population
      screening survey.
