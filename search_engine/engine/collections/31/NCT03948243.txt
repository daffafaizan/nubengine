      FDA-approved drugs (caffeine, tolbutamide, dextromethorphan, and alprazolam), and serial
      blood samples will be drawn and analyzed for the concentration of each drug over time.
      Afterwards, participants will take the licorice dietary supplement twice daily for 14 days to
      allow for potential inhibition or induction of drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters.
      Thereafter, the same drugs will be taken again to obtain a second measure of drug
      concentrations in blood over time. Changes in the concentration-time curve values for each
      probe drug obtained before and after ingestion of the supplement would indicate that
      metabolism of the probe drugs is impacted by the licorice dietary supplement.
