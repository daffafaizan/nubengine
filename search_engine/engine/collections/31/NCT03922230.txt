      ct DNA in normal population, patients with p0~pI esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and
      pII~pIV esophageal squamous cell carcinoma by using DNA methylation detection technology. The
      differences in genomic methylation levels between different groups were compared to identify
      the methylolation site system associated with early esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Then,
      using the genomic methylolation technique, 5hmC-DNA enrichment was performed on the
      peripheral venous blood samples of the experimental group before surgery and the peripheral
      venous blood samples of the control group, respectively, and then the high abundance and high
      significance were selected. The 5hmC-DNA fragment was verified by PCR amplification. The
      genes related to esophageal squamous cell carcinoma were verified by ctDNA methylolation.
      Finally, the methylolation genes related to esophageal squamous cell carcinoma were
      identified, and the application of DNA methylation in early screening of esophageal squamous
      cell carcinoma was explored.
