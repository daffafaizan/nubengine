      yet there is little evidence confirming the bioequivalence of generic and brand name
      formulations. We compared the steady-state pharmacokinetics of Lamivudine, Stavudine and
      Nevirapine in HIV-infected subjects who were receiving a generic formulation (Triomune速) or
      the corresponding brand formulations (Epivir速, Zerit速, and Viramune速). An open-label,
      randomized, crossover study was carried out in 18 HIV-infected Ugandan subjects stabilized on
      Triomune-40. Subjects received Lamivudine (150 mg), Stavudine (40 mg), and Nevirapine (200
      mg) in either the generic or brand formulation twice a day for 30 days, before switching to
      the other formulation. At the end of each treatment period, blood samples were collected over
      12 h for pharmacokinetic analysis. The main outcome measures were the mean AUC0-12h and Cmax.
      Bioequivalence was defined as a geometric mean ratio between the generic and brand-name
      within the 90% confidence interval of 0.8-1.25.
