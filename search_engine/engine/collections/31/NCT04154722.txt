    
      Complicated XDR Enteric fever is a very serious systemic disease, caused by an extremely
      resistant mutant strain of Salmonella Typhi ( the H58 S. Typhi superbug,) that as the name
      suggests is resistant to not only the first but also the second tier drugs conventionally
      used for treatment of the same. And as such, warrants immediate antibiotic therapy, but in
      view of the extended antimicrobial resistance the treatment options are limited to only two
      effective drugs viz Carbepenem and Azithromycin, as per culture sensitivity.

      So far, in the absence of universal standardized treatment protocols for XDR complicated
      typhoid fever in children, random use of either one or both in combination is the current
      practice.

      However, keeping antibiotic stewardship in mind, it is imperative to ascertain whether
      meropenum alone is effective or should be combined with azithromycin in the treatment of this
      serious disease.

      Our study therefore compares the efficacy of monotherapy with meropenum or combination with
      azithromycin based on clinical and microbiologic remission, shortened hospital stay and less
      chances of relapse in order to then formulate a standardized protocol to treat complicated
      XDR typhoid in children thus preventing yet further antimicrobial resistance.
