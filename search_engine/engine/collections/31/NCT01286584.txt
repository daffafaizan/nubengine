      the use of the other. Also, since tobacco-related illness is the number one cause of death
      among recovered alcoholics it is imperative that we provide strong evidence-based treatment
      options for this population. Since smoking can be a strong trigger to drink in those who are
      dependent on both alcohol and tobacco, treating both at the same time may result in better
      treatment outcomes. This study will examine the efficacy of starting smoking cessation
      treatment while patients are in residential treatment for alcohol dependence, or outpatient
      in the Alcohol Research and Treatment Clinic. It will compare the effectiveness of
      varenicline, the most effective medication for smoking cessation with placebo. Both groups
      will receive weekly cessation counselling and support by a trained research analyst. We will
      measure abstinence from smoking at the end of the 12-week treatment period and again after
      6-months to determine longer-term smoking cessation.
