      knee replacement (TKR), and to reduce wear in the longer term. This study investigates short
      term functional results with two patient groups who are systematically different in the fixed
      or mobile tibial bearing only.

      Methods: 100 knees in 97 patients are stratified according to age and gender and randomized
      into two groups fixed bearing (FB) with 52 knees and mobile bearing (MB) with 48 knees. All
      receive the same posterior cruciate retaining implant but the tibial tray and bearing (B.
      Braun Aesculap Columbus CR and RP) by two experienced surgeons and follow an identical
      rehabilitation regime. Physical examinations are performed in a double-blinded manner before
      the operation and three, six and twelve months thereafter, using the Oxford and Knee Society
      scoring systems.
