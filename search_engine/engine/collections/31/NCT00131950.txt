        -  Correlate physical activity, diet, and obesity, as measured by body mass index and waist
           circumference, with percent breast density and the absolute estimate of total dense
           breast area in healthy Hispanic women undergoing screening mammography.

        -  Correlate fasting serum insulin growth factor (IGF)-1 and the molar ratio of IGF-1 to
           IGF binding protein-3 with breast density in participants undergoing screening
           mammography.

        -  Correlate insulin concentration and insulin resistance with breast density in
           participants undergoing screening mammography.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Participants undergo blood collection and physical examination. Participants also complete
      breast cancer risk factor, food frequency, and physical activity questionnaires and receive
      breast health and physical activity education. Participants then undergo a digital screening
      mammogram. Participants are notified of mammogram results.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 114 participants will be accrued for this study.
