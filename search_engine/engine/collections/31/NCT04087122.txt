    
      This study is a prospective, pilot study using the Attune Medical ensoETM esophageal heat
      transfer device to actively warm the esophagus during cryoablation procedures. This design is
      appropriate to gather the data needed regarding overall procedural time, compare this to
      historical controls, and estimate a sample size for a larger study powered for statistical
      significance.

      Once patient consent is obtained, the subject will undergo preparation and anesthesia
      procedures following standard practice. Once the patient is intubated, the esophageal heat
      transfer device will be placed into the esophagus according to the IFU. The device will
      remain in place until the ablation procedure is completed and will be removed before
      extubation. Left atrial cryoablation using the standard approach will be performed with the
      ensoETM set at a temperature of 42 degrees C.

      All patients will be followed up in total for 6 weeks (Long Term FU visit) after the
      procedure to document any clinical complication related to thermal esophageal injuries if
      applicable.
