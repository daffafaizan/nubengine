      in Alagille Syndrome. We also hope to learn the effect of this pulmonary artery stenosis on
      the right ventricle in patients with Alagille Syndrome. This information is critical in the
      management of patients with Alagille syndrome, as there is currently no data to guide
      clinicians on the management of pulmonary artery stenosis. Furthermore, the information from
      this study may help physicians manage pulmonary artery stenosis in other patients as well.
      For the third aim, we hope to learn about the different blood vessel abnormalities in the
      brain, and which abnormalities are most likely to lead to stroke.
