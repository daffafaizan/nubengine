      communities receive visual acuity screening during a baseline census, and then half
      subsequently receive screening with OCT and intraocular pressure testing with an iCare
      tonometer. Participants with abnormal results will be referred to the local eye hospital for
      examination and treatment. Repeat visual acuity assessment will be performed 4 years later.
      Those with incident visual impairment at the time of the final census, defined as visual
      acuity worse than Snellen 20/60 (Metric Snellen worse than 6/18; logMAR worse than 0.48),
      will receive a comprehensive eye exam to determine the cause of visual impairment.

      Specific Aim 1 - Visual Acuity: To determine whether an intensive screening program results
      in better visual acuity at 4 years than screening with visual acuity testing alone. The
      investigators hypothesize that individuals from clusters randomized to the intensive
      screening program will have better visual acuity compared to those receiving visual acuity
      testing alone.

      Specific Aim 2 - Eye Disease: To determine whether an intensive screening program reduces the
      incidence of visual impairment due to AMD, DR, or glaucoma. The investigators hypothesize
      that incident visual impairment due to AMD, DR, or glaucoma will be less common in clusters
      randomized to the intensive screening program.
