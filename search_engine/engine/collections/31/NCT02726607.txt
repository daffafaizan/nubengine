    
      The study will be conducted in three phases:

      Phases 1: The researchers will conduct formative research (focus groups and interviews) with
      HIV+ pregnant women and PMTCT providers to customize communication strategies for text
      messaging and inform patient flow and optimal implementation across the various PMTCT-related
      services at the intervention site.

      Phase 2: The researchers will design and refine the HITSystem 2.0 technical components to
      support PMTCT outcomes guided by clinical content experts, technology analysts, and findings
      from Phase 1.

      Phase 3: The researchers will implement HITSystem 2.0 at one hospital over an 18 month
      period, and compare targeted PMTCT outcomes to those at a matched control hospital.

      The study will be conducted at two government hospitals in Kenya. HIV+ pregnant women will be
      enrolled in the HITSystem 2.0 at Kapsabet Hospital. HIV+ pregnant women receiving the current
      standard of PMTCT care at Nandi Hills Hospital will be the comparison group.
