      evidence to show that visualisation of larynx can be improved using VL in failed tracheal
      Intubation (NAP 4 Report). VL has been shown to improve first attempt success compared to
      direct laryngoscopy in many clinical settings including intensive care unit (ICU) and
      emergency department (ED). This is a proposed comparison study of a VL, use in patients with
      a high risk for pulmonary Aspiration and requiring tracheal Intubation. An national,
      multi-center, prospective randomized comparative trial is proposed testing the superiority of
      oral tracheal intubation with the McGrathÂ® MAC versus conventional laryngoscope in adult
      patients under general anesthesia.
