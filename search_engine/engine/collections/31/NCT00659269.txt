      taxanes, and vinca alkaloids. There is clinical and preclinical data that vitamin B6 and B12
      may alleviate neuropathy in experimentally induced neuropathy in animal models, or clinical
      neuropathy such as diabetic neuropathy. This is a randomized phase III study of the use of
      multivitamins with or without vitamin B6 and B12 to prevent or relieve neuropathic toxicity
      from chemotherapy in patients receiving chemotherapy. Patients will be stratified by type of
      chemotherapy agent (3 groups), presence or absence of neuropathy at baseline, and randomized
      to receive placebo or vitamin B6/B12 supplementation.
