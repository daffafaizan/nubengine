      properties, dampens the effects of stress and opioid-associated cues on opioid craving and
      thus may be an effective adjunctive treatment for OUD.

      The central hypothesis of this research is that oxytocin will reduce stress-induced opioid
      craving in patients with OUD treated with buprenorphine/naloxone as opioid replacement
      therapy (ORT). This hypothesis is based on the model of addiction (Koob, Neuron 2008) in
      which chronic substance use and stress lead to neurobehavioral counter-adaptations that
      dysregulate biobehavioral response.

      In this double-blind, placebo controlled, randomized trial, individuals with OUD (N=68) who
      are currently receiving treatment with buprenorphine/naloxone will be randomized to
      intranasal oxytocin (40 international units, IU) or oxytocin-matched placebo, administered
      twice/day for 7 days. On days 5 and 7, participants will complete two counter-balanced
      sessions in which they receive yohimbine (32.4 mg) or yohimbine-matched placebo, and
      responses to opioid cues are assessed.
