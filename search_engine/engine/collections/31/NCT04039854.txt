      There are two types of anaesthetic commonly given to patients undergoing heart bypass
      surgery.

      Propofol is an anaesthetic that is delivered into the patient's vein. Other anaesthetics
      which are inhaled include Isoflurane, Sevoflurane and Desflurane and these are called
      volatile anaesthetics. Preliminary studies over the past ten years suggests that maintenance
      of general anaesthesia using only volatile anaesthetics has the potential to improve health
      outcomes after bypass surgery, when compared with propofol.

      Volatile anaesthetics have been shown to protect the heart, the kidneys and the brain,
      however results of studies have been inconclusive. Currently both volatile anaesthetics and
      propofol are used equally in clinical practice in the UK.
