      The primary aim is to assess safety and tolerability of oral encapsulated FMT in patients
      with peanut allergy aged 18-40 years. A total of 15 patients with peanut allergy will be
      enrolled after they fail a screening food challenge to peanut. 10 patients will be given oral
      encapsulated frozen FMT over 1-2 days. 5 additional patients will receive antibiotics prior
      to being given oral encapsulated frozen FMT over 1-2 days. Patients will undergo a second and
      third food challenge after receiving FMT. The expected duration of the study for each subject
      will be one year. Stool collection, skin testing and blood samples will be done serially.
