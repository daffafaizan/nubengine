      characteristics and needs of the population in question and the OT intervention
      characteristics. These information will now be used to implement this randomized controlled
      trial, designed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the OT intervention on the basis of
      clinically relevant outcome measures.

      This study will be set with exploratory purposes, with appropriate high number, which will
      allow the investigators to quantify the difference between the two groups in terms of
      performance scores derived from the COPM (COPM_p). From the results of this part it will then
      depend on the planning for the subsequent study with the correct sample size.
