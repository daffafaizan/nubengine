      Study progress:

      Stage 1: collection of all data from frozen embryo transfer and fresh embryo transfer groups.

      Stage 2: selection data and check the delivery outcomes Stage 3: analysis data and
      presentation. Including criteria: all patients who underwent IVF. Excluding criteria: No.
      Statistics analysis: chi-test, t-test

      Assessment point:

      Primary endpoint: pregnancy rate Secondary endpoint: implantation rate Withdraw criteria: not
      application. Treatments: not application. Collection number: 500 patients. Scheduled trial
      period: 2017.05.01~2018.04.30

      Expected research results:

      The implantation rate in frozen embryo transfer group which vitrified at 2PN stage is higher
      than fresh embryo transfer.

      The pregnancy rate in frozen embryo transfer group which vitrified at 2PN stage is higher
      than fresh embryo transfer.

      This study is only data analysis, no additional collection of samples. This study does not
      involve vulnerable groups.
