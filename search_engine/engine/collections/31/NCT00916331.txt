      consensus. Many studies have shown no apparent advantage of drainage but routine
      intraarticular indwelling drainage after TKA has been extensively used to avoid complications
      associated with hematoma formation. It is of interest to determine if it is possible to
      reduce blood loss while still using drainage. So we came to think about a new and more
      convenient method-subcutaneous indwelling. Theoretically subcutaneous indwelling method which
      still has the advantages over the intraarticular indwelling method but is more convenient
      than drain-clamping method may be a better option. So we hypothesized that subcutaneous
      indwelling method of vacuum drainage has advantages over the intraarticular indwelling
      method.
