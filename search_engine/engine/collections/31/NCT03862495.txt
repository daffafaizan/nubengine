      in the intervention group will be tested in real time for C. trachomatis and Neisseria
      gonorrhoeae. Patients who test positive for either infection will be linked to physicians at
      the Center for treatment. For the control group, women will be tested immediately after
      childbirth or in the event of an adverse pregnancy outcome. In the event of a positive test
      result, a confirmation test will be run and if positive, the patient will be referred for
      treatment. The endpoint of the study is defined as either the occurrence of an adverse
      pregnancy outcome or delivery of a newborn.

      Qualitative in-depth interviews will also be conducted with 20 of the women to explore their
      opinions, attitudes and feedback on the study process. University of North Carolina at Chapel
      Hill (UNC) investigators will work with the Nanhai Hospital of Southern Medical University
      and staff at Dermatology Hospital of Southern Medical University to oversee the study.
