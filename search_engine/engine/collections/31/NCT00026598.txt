      a cognitive aspect of motor control is supposed to share underlying neural components with
      non-motor, cognitive operations. The present study is aimed to clarify the similarity and
      difference between cognitive processing for motor control and non-motor, cognitive
      processing, especially in terms of the speed of processing. From this standpoint, patients
      with Parkinson's disease who manifest motor slowing as well as possible cognitive slowing
      will provide an interesting model to explore similar control mechanisms of speed for motor
      and non-motor behavioral control. Using psychophysical observations, we will try to clarify
      normal and diseased control of motor and cognitive speed. Furthermore, using functional
      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we will explore the neural correlates underlying control
      of motor and cognitive speed in normal brains as well as pathologic brains.
      Blood-oxygen-level-dependent signal changes measured by fMRI, as an index of the activity of
      a neural population, are expected to reveal underactivity or compensatory overactivity in the
      functionally impaired brain areas responsible for slowing of movement, thinking, or both.
      This study may provide a new framework to explain the relationship between motor and
      cognitive aspects of human behavior and help to clarify the pathophysiology of Parkinson's
      disease.
