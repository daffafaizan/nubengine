      minocycline 150 mg po BID or placebo as add-on therapy for eight weeks each. Each eight week
      arm is separated by a four week wash-out. Spirometry is performed at the baseline and end of
      each arm. Daily symptoms scores, peak flow rates, and oral steroid requirements are recorded.
      A standardized asthma quality of life symptoms assessment is made every four weeks (AQLQ,
      Juniper).
