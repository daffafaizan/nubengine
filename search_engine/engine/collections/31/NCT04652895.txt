      that track total sleep time and heart-rate variability for up to 1 week. During this time the
      participants will also complete surveys regarding symptoms of anxiety. The investigators
      hypothesize that decreased heart rate variability and poor sleep quality will be
      significantly correlated with higher self-reported anxiety following brain injury.
