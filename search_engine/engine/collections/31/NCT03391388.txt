      I. To evaluate the rate of adverse cosmesis (defined as fair or poor cosmesis) with
      accelerated 3 fraction APBI at 3 years, compared to baseline.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the acute and late toxicities of accelerated 3 fraction APBI. II. To evaluate
      local disease control of accelerated 3 fraction APBI. III. To assess the rate of patient
      reported adverse cosmesis at 2 years, compared to baseline.

      IV. To assess quality of life and other patient reported outcomes following accelerated 3
      fraction APBI.

      V. To compare the local control, acute and late toxicities, cosmesis, quality of life and
      other patient reported outcomes between the three radiation therapy techniques (3D-CRT,
      proton, brachytherapy).

      VI. To evaluate clinical features, dose-volume parameters, and genetic variants associated
      with fair and poor cosmetic outcome.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 3 cohorts.

      COHORT I: Patients undergo 3D-CRT APBI for 3-5 days.

      COHORT II: Patients undergo proton beam radiation therapy APBI for 3-5 days.

      COHORT III: Patients undergo brachytherapy ABPI for 3-5 days.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 12 weeks, 12 months, and
      annually for 5 years.
