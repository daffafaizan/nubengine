      safety and effectiveness of the CE-approved Camouflage-coated self expandable RESISTANT
      Camouflage stent system for revascularization of de novo stenotic lesions in superficial
      femoral artery in 120 compliant patients suitable for stent angioplasty. The primary end
      point is the target lesion revascularization after 12 months. Further follow-ups are
      scheduled at discharge, 30 days, 6 and 24 months.
