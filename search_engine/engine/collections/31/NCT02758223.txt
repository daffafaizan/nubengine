      induction of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and the beneficial graft-versus-leukemia (GVL)
      response, both mediated by donor T cells recognizing antigens expressed on cells of the
      recipient. Complete removal of T cells from the graft results in abrogation of severe GVHD,
      but is also frequently associated with removal of the immunity against infectious agents and
      the anti-tumor efficacy (GVT effect), which is reflected by an increased incidence of
      infectious complications and (early) disease relapses after T cell depleted allo-SCT. The
      investigators hypothesize that the prophylactic adoptive transfer of donor-derived central
      memory T cells is a safe and tolerable method to improve overall survival after HSCT.

      TCM are administered in escalating doses at day 30, day 60 and day 90 posttransplant to
      prevent infectious complications and early relapse or disease progression.
