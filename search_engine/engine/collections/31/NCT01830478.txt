      Follow-up phase. Enrolled patients will start the induction phase and receive the courses of
      R-Lenalidomide. At the end of the third cycle of R-Lenalidomide (week 12 of the study), the
      patients will be evaluated for tumor response (complete assessment); the patients with
      Progressive Disease (PD) will be withdrawn of the study. Two weeks after the end last courses
      of R-Lenalidomide (week 26 of the study) patients will be evaluated for tumor response
      (complete assessment). Patients with Complete Response (CR) and Partial Response (PR), and
      with a stable disease will undergo the follow up phase, while patients with PD will be
      withdrawn of the study.
