      I. To assess the activity of AZD6244 (selumetinib) for patients with recurrent or persistent
      endometrial cancer with the frequency of patients who survive progression-free for at least 6
      months after initiating therapy or have objective tumor response.

      II. To determine the nature and degree of toxicity of AZD6244 as assessed by CTCAE v3.0 in
      this cohort of patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine the duration of progression-free survival and overall survival.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore the associations between select biomarkers and response to AZD6244
      (progression-free survival status >6 months and objective tumor response), measures of
      clinical outcome (progression-free survival and overall survival) or disease status including
      histologic cell type.

      II. Mutations and single nucleotide polymorphisms in BRAF, KRAS2, FGFR2, PI3KCA, AKT1, AKT2,
      AKT3 and PTEN in DNA from formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor and/or normal
      blood cells.

      III. Immunohistochemical expression of ERK, pERK, GSK3betta, pGSK3betta, PR-A, PR-B, pPR,
      ER-alpha, ER-beta, BRAF, KRAS, PTEN, EGFR, pEGFR, EGF, PELP1 and MTA1s in FFPE tumor.

      IV. To explore the relationship among the panel of biomarkers evaluated in this cohort
      including mutations and single nucleotide polymorphisms in BRAF, KRAS2, FGFR2, PI3KCA, AKT1,
      AKT2, AKT3 and PTEN as well as immunohistochemical expression of ERK, pERK, GSK3betta,
      pGSK3betta, PR-A, PR-B, pPR, ER-alpha, ER-beta, BRAF, KRAS, PTEN, EGFR, pEGFR, EGF, PELP1 and
      MTA1s.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive selumetinib orally (PO) twice daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Blood and archived tumor
      tissue samples are collected for biomarker studies.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for 3 years.
