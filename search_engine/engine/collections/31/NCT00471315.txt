    
      SOD is a disorder involving the bile duct or pancreas causing a burning pain or cramping in
      the epigastric (upper stomach) area that can radiate (spread) to the back or under the right
      shoulder blade. This discomfort is thought to be caused by tightening of the Sphincter of
      Oddi, which is the muscle opening that controls the flow of bile and juices from the pancreas
      (enzymes) into the small intestine. It can also be caused by contractions of the common bile
      duct (the duct that allows bile from the liver into the small intestine).

      The purpose of this research is to study how well a medication called Duloxetine works when
      used to treat pain associated with SOD. Duloxetine (also called Cymbalta) is a medication
      approved by the FDA for the treatment of depression and for the treatment of pain caused by
      nerve damage associated with diabetes. However, for the purposes of this research, Duloxetine
      is considered investigational (experimental) since it will test how well this medication
      works for the treatment of pain associated with SOD. (Cymbalta replaced with Duloxetine in
      remainder of consent as requested).

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE

      ‚óè Treatment effect as measured by the global assessment of change (PGIC) after 3 months of
      treatment with duloxetine.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES

        -  Toleration of the medication as measured by the duloxetine compliance rate;

        -  Safety as recorded by adverse events (AEs)

        -  Effect of treatment on pain reduction as measured by a pain burden assessment tool
           (RAPID 3 & RAPID 1-Month);

        -  Effect of treatment on quality of life (QOL) as measured by the SF-36.
