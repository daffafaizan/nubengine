      Concurring to a statistically significant outcome the estimated cohort should be minimum 87
      children. Based on Region Zealand's visitation history records the cohort is expected to be
      approximately 100-160 children.

      Group size:

      The number of participants in each treatment group depends in part on how many children have
      been recruited. Given the constraints of our setting, treatment groups generally consist of
      at least two, and up to five participants.

      Staffing: Two group leaders and one student-assistant are present for every five participants
      in the playgroup.

      For the primary efficiency measurements the project uses: ADHD-RS-IV (Attention Deficit
      Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale fourth edition), a scale for evaluating the severity of
      the ADHD symptoms, SDQ-DAN (Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire - Danish translation)
      focuses upon the child's strengths and weaknesses in accordance with activity and attention,
      emotional problems, behavioural difficulties etc. For the secondary efficiency measurements
      the project uses: TCA (Treatment Compliance Assessment) (Halperin et al: in press), which
      establishes how much time the child spends on each TEAMS activity and television/computer
      games each day. Each day the parents fill out the TCA, as part of a logbook which also
      describes compliance with the TEAMS treatment project.

      The questionnaires are continuously catalogued in a database facility (SurveyXact).

      The TCA instrument is completed weekly during the 8 week TEAMS program.
