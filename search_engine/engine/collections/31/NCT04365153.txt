      as a proof of concept to demonstrate that early treatment with canakinumab prevents
      progressive heart and respiratory failure in patients with COVID 19 infection, myocardial
      injury and hyperinflammation. These results will lead to a Phase III randomized
      placebo-controlled trial.

      The study will be performed in approximately 7 months total, starting from the first patient
      enrolled with enrollment expected to complete within 2 months. The follow-up period is 5
      months for each patient enrolled. The end of the study, including statistical analysis and
      drafting of the final report is expected within 1 month from the last patient enrolled.

      A total of 45 patients will be randomized using a 1:1:1 allocation ratio: 15 subjects will
      receive 600 mg intravenous canakinumab (8 mg/kg if </= 40 kg), 15 subjects will receive 300
      mg intravenous canakinumab (4 mg/kg if </= 40 kg), and 15 patients will receive placebo
      infusion.

      The investigator, clinical team, and subject will be blinded to treatment assignment.
