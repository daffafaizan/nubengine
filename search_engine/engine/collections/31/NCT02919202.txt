      routinely used in dentistry in the management of cervical dentine sensitivity(CDS). Both
      interventions are topically applied and well tolerated by patients. The interventions differ
      in mechanism of action. TFV releases fluoride which is incorporated into the organic matrix
      of dentine making the dentine tubules less conductive. Dentinal tubules form the key conduit
      between stimulus and pain perception in the tooth. SEDBA differs in that it penetrates and
      occludes the tubules. It is light cured for an almost instant set time.
