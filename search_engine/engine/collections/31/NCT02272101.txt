      almost all rhinitis studies. Vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency are very common,
      especially in the elderly. Vitamin D may play an important role in respiratory disease as
      shown by studies in asthma. This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled,
      cross-over study. The investigators will look for the effect of vitamin D 4,000 I.U/day vs.
      placebo for six weeks on symptom scores and rhinitis related quality of life. This study will
      be performed in the period Nov. 1, 2013 and March 31, 2014, to try to avoid seasonal
      fluctuations of serum vitamin D due to sun exposure. The investigators will also look for
      possible associations between serum vitamin D at baseline and study subjects demographics,
      treatment, and symptom scores.
