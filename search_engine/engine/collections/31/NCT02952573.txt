      will be FGFR3 wild-type (participants whose tumors have no mutations or changes of a gene
      called FGFR3) and the other group will be FGFR3 mutated (participants whose tumors have
      mutations of FGFR3).

      Participants will receive JNJ-42756493 with dexamethasone for as long as their diseases do
      not progress (worsen) and they do not experience unacceptable side effects for a maximum of
      24 cycles (approximately 22 months).

      While on the study drugs, participants will be asked to visit the clinic about 2 times during
      Cycles 1 and 2 and once during Cycle 3 and subsequent cycles for tests and procedures.
