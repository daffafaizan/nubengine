      general anesthesia, proflavine hemisulfate solution (contrast dye) will be applied to the
      cervix. Images will be collected with the probe from the HRME device. The HRME probe is a
      long thin tube with a camera at the tip. This probe will be applied to the cervix and images
      obtained. These images will be used for research. This should add about 10 minutes to the
      total time you are in the operating room.

      There will be no change to the planned standard-of-care colposcopy and biopsy.

      Follow-Up:

      A member of the research team will call you within 30 days after the procedure to ask how you
      are feeling and if you are having any symptoms. This call should last about 5 minutes.

      Length of Study:

      Your active participation in this study will be over after the biopsy.

      This is an investigational study. The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if it
      is possible to get high-resolution microendoscopy (HRME) images of AIS tissue and/or tissue
      from microinvasive carcinoma right before a biopsy of the cervix. Researchers also want to
      learn if HRME images can show the difference between cancerous tissue and normal cervical
      tissue.
