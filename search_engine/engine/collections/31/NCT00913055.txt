    
      An open-label, randomized, multi-center, parallel-group, Phase I/II study conducted in 30
      male and female patients with acromegaly. Eligible patients received 1 implant, either
      hydrated or non-hydrated, within 7 days of their Screening Visit. The octreotide implant was
      inserted subcutaneously in the inner aspect of their non-dominant arm under local anesthesia.
      Blood samples for the determination of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), growth hormone
      (GH), and octreotide serum concentrations were collected at predetermined timepoints within
      the first 6 weeks after implantation.
