      reduce the need for post transplant immunosuppressant in DCD kidney transplantation. Emphasis
      will be placed on the safety of autologous SVF derived MSC infusion, dosage of
      immunosuppressant, GFR, percentage of acute rejection. 120 patients eligible for the study as
      described below will be enrolled, with 60 patients in intervention group and 60 in control
      group. Kidneys from the same donor of DCD will be random allocated to intervention group and
      control group. In intervention group the investigators will collect SVF from recipients with
      special instruments before transplantation, and culture SVF to abstain MSC. The abstained MSC
      will be infused to the recipients of DCD kidney transplantation during operation and on 7,
      14, 21 POD. The investigators will assess whether induction therapy with autologous SVF
      derived MSC is feasible in DCD kidney transplantation. The effectiveness of autologous SVF
      derived MSC induction therapy on reducing of immunosuppressant, reducing the rate of
      rejection, elevating patient and allograft survival, improving allograft function from day 0
      to 12 months after transplantation. Additionally, the investigators will assess the
      percentage of acute rejection or antibody mediated rejection by Banff criteria, the incidence
      of delayed graft function (defined as the need for post-transplant dialysis within one week),
      and the incidence of adverse events including infection, grade 3 and above non-hematologic
      toxicities, and grade 4 hematologic toxicities.
