    
      Excimer laser vision correction (LVC) is a widely used procedure to correct nearsightedness,
      farsightedness, and astigmatism by reshaping the surface of the eye (cornea). Laser-Assisted
      In Situ Keratomileusis (LASIK) and Advanced Surface Ablation (ASA) and are techniques
      currently used to prepare the cornea for Excimer LVC.

      This review is intended to study whether LASIK is equal in visual outcome (null hypothesis),
      more effective (alternate hypothesis 1) or less effective (alternate hypothesis 2) than ASA
      in clinical outcome up to one year.
