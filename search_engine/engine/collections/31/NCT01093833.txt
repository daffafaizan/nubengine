      1), during which the subject was consented and the inclusion and exclusion criteria
      confirmed, an experimental intervention (Visit 2) and a follow-up visit (Visit 3). The
      experimental intervention was based on an initial glucose clamp involving a basal intravenous
      (IV) insulin infusion and IV insulin boluses plus IV glucose infusion / IV glucose boluses as
      required to maintain euglycemic, hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic plateaus respectively in 41
      subjects with Type 1 or Type 2 Diabetes. At the end of hour five of the study the glucose
      clamp was discontinued and subjects given a standardized meal to stimulate a hyperglycemic
      excursion

      Each subject participated in one experimental intervention. During the glucose clamp
      intervention, the subject's blood glucose was continuously monitored either by means of the
      Biostator or by frequent venous blood glucose measurements based on a standard lab method
      (YSI STAT2300 analyzer), and measured by means of the BD Technologies test devices, and the
      Medtronic Guardian CGM. Once the clamp was discontinued the Biostator was discontinued as
      well. During the unclamped period and meal the subjects BG was monitored via the YSI Glucose
      Analyzer, the BD CGM sensor and the Medtronic Guardian CGM.
