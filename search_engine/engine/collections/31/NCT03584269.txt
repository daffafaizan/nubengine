      transcutaneous CO2 (PtCO2) after 3 months of non-invasive ventilation. Three hundred COPD
      patients on LTOT will be screened and assessed by pulmonary function tests, blood gases and
      nocturnal PtCO2 at their home. This will allow the determination of the prevalence of
      nocturnal hypoventilation in COPD patients on LTOT (a secondary outcome) and to select
      patients who meet the inclusion criteria for the RCT and randomization to NIV + LTOT or to
      continue LTOT alone (n=38). Patients will undergo the same assessments at the end of the
      three-month intervention period.
