      cataract in the absence of significant ocular comorbidity. The patients received 0.09%
      bromfenac ophthalmic solution or control placebo twice a day for 3 days before surgery. Pupil
      diameter was measured at the initiation and finalization of femtosecond laser-assisted
      cataract surgery and pain quantification was assessed by analogous pain scale at one day
      follow-up.
