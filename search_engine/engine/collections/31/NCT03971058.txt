      is to investigate the immune responses following a booster immunisation with the Japanese
      Encephalitis vaccine in elderly subjects (above 60 years of age) in comparison to a young
      study group.Testing the difference of the JEV-antibody titre increase between young and
      elderly adults between visit 1 (before booster vaccination) and up to visit 4 (6 months after
      booster vaccination).

      Testing cellular immunity (cytokine production after JEV as well as TBE stimulation) on visit
      1, 2 (one week after booster immunisation) and 3 between both age groups.

      Testing of surface markers of different T and B cell subsets before and after JE-booster
      vaccination (on visit 1-3) in comparison between both age groups.

      Testing TBE-antibody titres before and after JE-booster vaccination (on visit 1-4) in both
      age groups.

      Testing CMV serology at visit 1 in both age groups.
