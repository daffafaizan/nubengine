    
      This is a Phase II, single center, randomized controlled pilot study. Hospitalized patients
      one week of age to 3 months of age who undergo an abdominal surgical procedure within the
      moderate or severe degree of pain category (see attached Table 1: postoperative pain
      categories) will be randomized to receive standard pain management regimens plus placebo
      (0.9% saline of equivalent volume) or ketorolac 0.5mg IV q8h x 72h plus standard pain
      management regimens. The postoperative management will be unchanged and at the discretion of
      the attending surgeon, as appropriate for the surgical procedure. The patients will be
      followed for 5 days, or 48hrs from the end of ketorolac therapy for primary and secondary
      endpoints.
