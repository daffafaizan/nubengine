      based on low dose letrozole 2.5 mg over 5 days, starting from cycle day 2, overlapping with
      low dose gonadotropins, starting from day 3 of the letrozole at 150 units per day. GnRH
      antagonist wil be introduced to avoid premature LH surge when one or more of the growing
      follicles reached approximately 14 mm in size. The high dose stimulation protocol is based on
      high dose of gonadotropins (â‰¥300 IU/day) throughout the cycle with the usage of
      gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist to avoid premature luteinizing hormone (LH)
      surge as described above.
