      weeks (leading up to a total of 3 experimental sessions and 3 control sessions), each lasting
      for about 15 minutes.

      Each session consists of 5 phases, with an animal present in three of them. In the beginning,
      waiting (with no stimulus presented) serves as baseline measurement. Second, an animal is
      watched, then the animal is placed on the patient's lap and in the fourth condition, the
      patient can stroke the animal with the help of the present therapist. After, there is again a
      waiting condition.

      Control sessions are comparable sessions but with a fur pet instead of a live animal as
      stimulus.

      Measurements are: brain activity (near-infrared spectroscopy, NIRS), skin conductance (EDA),
      heart rate and heart rate variability assessed via photoplethysmography (PPG) during the
      sessions and the BAVESTA score after each session. For further behavior analysis all sessions
      are videotaped.
