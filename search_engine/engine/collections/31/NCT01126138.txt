      1) Histologically or cytologically confirmed breast cancer with unresectable locally advanced
      and/or metastatic disease; 2) Untreated patients with unresectable locally advanced and/or
      metastatic disease; 3) with at least 1 lesion measurable by radiological method(RECIST
      criteria); 4) Karnofsky Performance Status(KPS)â‰¥70; 5) normal Adequate hepatic, renal, and
      bone marrow function; 6) Life expectancy of at least 12 weeks; 7) No previous chemotherapy
      for metastatic breast cancer. Primary endpoint is Progression free survival(PFS), second
      endpoint are safety profiles (National Cancer Institute-Common Toxicity Criteria 3.0, NCI-CTC
      3.0), overall survival and response rate. During Primary study treatment, Arm A:
      Capecitabine: 1,000 mg/m2 per ora(PO) twice daily (day 1-14), Vinorelbine 25 mg/m2
      intravenous(IV) over 3 hours on day 1 and 8, every 3 weeks, 21 days as one cycle and 6-8
      cycles are required; Arm B: Capecitabine: 1,000 mg/m2 PO twice daily (day 1-14), Docetaxel 75
      mg/m2 IV over 3 hours on day 1, every 3 weeks, 21 days as one cycle and 6-8 cycles are
      required. Patients who are responding (complete or partial), or whose disease is stable
      followed by Capecitabine: 1,000 mg/m2 PO twice daily (day 1-14) 21 days as one cycle until
      progression or unacceptable toxicity
