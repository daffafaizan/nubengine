      donor liver graft exudates into recipient with HCC will lead to prevent recurrence of HCC
      after liver transplantation.

      The method we plan to use is to collect NK cells from the cadaveric donor liver perfusate at
      the time of organ recovery. The perfusate will be condensed by centrifuging and liver
      mononuclear cells (LMNC) were isolated by gradient centrifugation. LMNC will be cultured with
      anti-CD3 antibody. LMNC will be separted into a CD3-/CD56+ NK cell fraction and a non-NK cell
      fraction. The purity of isolated fractions will be assessed by Flow cytometric analyses. NK
      cells will be cultured with human recombinant IL-2 in 10% RPMI at 37 ÂºC in a 5% CO2
      incubator. NK cells will be infused intravenously to the recipient with HCC who have liver
      transplant from the same cadaveric donor at post operative day 4 in attempt to prevent the
      metastasis and recurrence of HCC.
