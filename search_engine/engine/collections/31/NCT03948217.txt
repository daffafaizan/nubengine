      affective symptoms, and the secondary aim is to explore the effect of artificial lighting on
      core symptoms of eating disorders (ED).

      If an effect is indicated, the study will provide information on how to improve light
      exposure to ED patients in psychiatric treatment units. In addition, the outcomes may help
      identify a better system for measurement and adjustment of the specific light variables of
      colour temperature and light intensity.

      Several lines of evidence, albeit from hypothesis generation studies, suggest that artificial
      lighting may have a positive effect on well-being, mental health and affective symptoms in
      ED. This is the rationale to investigate the effects of artificial lighting on affective
      symptoms and cores symptoms of ED in inpatients undergoing weight restoration/treatment for
      ED.

      Study design: Single-blind, controlled, pilot intervention study with circadian light (CL)
      comparing two CL regimens effects on mood symptoms.

      Planned number of subjects: 16 patients with a International Classification of Disorders 10
      (ICD-10) diagnosis of Anorexia Nervosa, that completes exposure to at least three weeks of
      the two different CL regimens (L1 and L2) in any order.

      Location: Mental Health Center Ballerup, department 14 (currently Department 5).

      Diagnostic inventory: Eating Disorder Examination-Questionnaire (EDE-Q)
