      (veliparib group) or placebo plus FOLFIRI ± bevacizumab (placebo group), and stratified by
      planned use of bevacizumab (planned bevacizumab use compared to unplanned use of bevacizumab)
      and regions of the world (North America versus rest of world). In this study, the term
      FOLFIRI was used to describe both the standard regimen containing a fluorouracil bolus that
      was administered to participants randomized to the placebo arm, and a modified regimen with a
      saline bolus that was administered to participants randomized to the veliparib arm. One cycle
      of protocol therapy consisted of 14 days, defined as Day -2 through Day 12. Dosing of oral
      veliparib/placebo began 2 days prior to the start of FOLFIRI and continued twice a day for a
      total of 7 consecutive days. At the discretion of the Investigator, bevacizumab could be
      administered intravenously immediately preceding FOLFIRI. Study visits were conducted on Day
      1 and Day 8 of the first and second cycles, then on Day 1 of each subsequent cycle.
      Participants were to continue protocol therapy and study visits until they met one of the
      defined discontinuation criteria. When the Investigator determined that a participant met the
      criteria for discontinuation, a final visit was conducted. Participants were to have had one
      follow-up visit approximately 30 days after the last dose of protocol therapy. Sites began
      collecting post-treatment and survival information 4 weeks after the last clinical
      assessment. Post-baseline radiographic tumor assessment was to be conducted every 8 weeks
      from Cycle 1, Day 1 (prior to the start of a new cycle) until radiographic progression.
