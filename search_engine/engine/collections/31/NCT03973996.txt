      catechins, exerts antiinflammatory activities. However, a fundamental gap exists concerning
      its intestinal-level targets that can prevent metabolic syndrome (MetS) development and
      progression. Studies in obese rodents indicate that green tea inhibits nuclear factor
      kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NFÎºB) activation by limiting gut-derived
      endotoxin translocation to the portal circulation and decreasing hepatic Toll-like receptor-4
      (TLR4) pro-inflammatory signaling. The objective of this clinical investigation is to
      establish evidence-based recommendations for green tea, based on improvements in endotoxemia
      and restored gut barrier function, that promote optimal health. The hypothesis is that green
      tea catechins function to limit metabolic endotoxemia by ameliorating gut dysbiosis-mediated
      inflammation that otherwise provokes intestinal permeability. This will be tested by
      conducting a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized-order, crossover trial in MetS and
      healthy persons to examine the efficacy of green tea on metabolic endotoxemia. Each treatment
      will be one-month in duration and separated by a washout period. The anticipated outcomes are
      expected to be of significance, because they will advance a dietary strategy to help avert
      MetS complications attributed to metabolic endotoxemia by establishing antiinflammatory
      prebiotic and antimicrobial bioactivities of catechins that promote intestinal health.
