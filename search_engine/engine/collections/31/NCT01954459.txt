        1. Warming of the skin and subcutaneous tissue with the InsuPatch device will improve the
           accuracy of a CGM as compared to a CGM used alone when both are calibrated with a
           standard laboratory quality glucose measuring reference standard.

        2. Warming of the skin and subcutaneous tissue with the InsuPatch device will reduce the
           lag time of the CGM, as compared to a CGM used alone when both are calibrated with a
           standard laboratory quality glucose measuring reference standard.

        3. The combination of the InsuPatch device and a CGM will be well-tolerated and not cause
           skin irritation.
