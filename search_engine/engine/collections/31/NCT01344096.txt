      Delineating the cause of the thrombocytopathy in Gaucher disease patients:

        1. Identifying thrombocytopathy among a cohort of 70 Gaucher patients managed (treated and
           untreated) in our clinic using a panel of platelets function tests.

        2. Understanding the etiology for platelets dysfunction in Gaucher disease.

        3. Evaluating the impact of Imiglucerase treatment duration and Gaucher disease severity on
           platelet function
