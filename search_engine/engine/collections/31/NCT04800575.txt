      Semi-permeable film dressing on the incidence of exit-site infection, CRBSIs
      (catheter-related bloodstream infections), skin irritation, total bacterial count, dressing
      intactness and cost-benefit, nursing workload in hemodialysis patients with a non-tunneled
      hemodialysis catheter.

      154 eligible patients in our HD center will be enrolled consecutively and randomly allocated
      to one of the two groups according to computer-generated randomization sequences in a 1:1
      ratio. Experiment group use semi-permeable film as dressing in exit-site of CVC, and a
      sterile gauze and tape in control group. Both groups share same disinfection and dressing
      change procedure. Dressings will be replaced per hemodialysis session, or as needed.
      Socio-demographic data and disease-related information will be collected, as well as
      catheterization site, physician, skin and exit status of the catheterization site at
      baseline. Data as listed in the beginning will be recorded in the next 2 weeks follow-up at
      every session, such as sign of exit-site infection, CRBSIs (catheter-related bloodstream
      infections), skin irritation and dryness, dressing intactness. Before the 2nd dressing
      change, skin around exit of CVC under dressing area will be swabbed by a cotton swab. Nursing
      time of dressing change will be recorded by a third nurses. Cost and benefit will be
      calculated and compared by the end.
