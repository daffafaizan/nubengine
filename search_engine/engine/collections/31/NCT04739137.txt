      application will be referred to patients suffering from macular edema, allowing the
      self-examination of the patient in terms of distant visual acuity. The development of a
      simple but reliable way of self-examination of distant visual acuity would bring beneficial
      results in the overall management of these patients as significantly would reduce the flows
      to the outpatient ophthalmology clinics of the NSS Hospitals, would serve the purposes of the
      social distancing imposed by the current state of the pandemic but also any analogous
      situation and would help the patient to be vigilant and actively involved in the management
      of his disease.
