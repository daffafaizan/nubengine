      and they cause a negative impact on the expression and course of schizophrenia. Improvements
      have been reported after attaining abstinence from alcohol, suggesting that effective
      treatments for AUD lead to clinically meaningful results. Acamprosate is a recently approved
      treatment for alcoholism, and it may be advantageous over other treatments since is not
      metabolized in the liver, and it has been used safely with other psychotropic medications.
      Therefore, acamprosate would be a promising treatment in schizophrenia patients. However,
      there are only few reports in the current literature evaluating the efficacy of medications
      available for the treatment of alcoholism in patients with schizophrenia, and the efficacy
      and safety of acamprosate have never been studied in this vulnerable group of patients.

      Research Design:

      This is a 12-week, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled trial of acamprosate (666 mg
      tid) in addition to neuroleptics in 30 recently abstinent (>5 days) schizophrenia patients
      with comorbid alcohol dependence.

      Methods:

      The study will be conducted at the West Haven, CT VA with support from Forest Laboratories.
      Patients who are between 21 and 65, with a diagnosis of schizophrenia spectrum disorder, (on
      stable psychotropic treatment > 2 weeks) and with current alcohol dependence (>1 recent
      episode of heavy drinking) will be included. Patients will be willing to undergo
      detoxification or self discontinuation >2weeks prior to the randomization. Main outcome
      variables include the TLFB method to document the degree of daily alcohol consumption, and
      PANSS, to assess the psychotic symptoms.
