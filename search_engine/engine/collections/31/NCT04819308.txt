      during exercise in children of all body types and activity levels.

      Children 8-11 years old who have done the MI Energy study will participate. Up to 80 children
      will be recruited to participate in this study at Arkansas Children's Nutrition Center
      (ACNC).

      They will be asked to attend three study visits (baseline, and two exercise visits). For the
      exercise visits they will follow a diet plan and be encouraged to avoid certain foods and
      activities.

      Children will do two testing days with the following measures:

        -  Urine (pee) will be collected

        -  Body weight and height

        -  Exercise test on the bike - children will ride a stationary bike at a set intensity and
           at an intensity relative to their previous bike test during the study MI Energy. The
           order in which they bike will be random. Before and during biking, children will wear a
           mask that will measure the gases in their breath and a monitor that will measure heart
           rate.
