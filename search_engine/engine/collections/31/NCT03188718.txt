    
      This is an investigator-initiated validation study for the WatchPAT 200 device compared to
      the gold standard polysomnography procedure (sleep study). To evaluate the accuracy of the
      WatchPAT device compared to an in-laboratory Polysomnogram (PSG), measurements including
      obstructive apnea hypopnea index (OAHI), apnea hypopnea index (AHI), oxygen desaturation
      index (ODI) and other relevant sleep parameteres and indices will be compared. Ultimately,
      the diagnostic agreement of the WatchPAT device in detecting between normal sleep and mild
      sleep apnea architecture will be assessed.
