    
      This is a single-site, single-arm pilot trial to assess the feasibility and acceptability of
      a CONTINUUM-V for patients with advanced cancer

      The research study procedures include:

        -  A video visit with a nurse practitioner within three business days of hospital discharge

        -  Questionnaires asking about demographic information (e.g. sex, ethnicity, income) and
           participant experience with cancer (e.g. symptoms and confidence in managing their
           health condition)

        -  A satisfaction survey to assess the participants' impressions of the intervention and
           any suggestions the participants may have

        -  Data collection from their medical record

        -  One time interview of participant and clinician for feedback on CONTINUUM-V

      Participants will be in this research study for up to 45 days after hospital discharge.

      It is expected that about 55 people, including patients and clinicians, will take part in
      this research study.

      The Conquer Cancer Foundation and the Rising Tide Foundation for Clinical Cancer Research are
      supporting this research study by providing a Career Pathway Grant in Symptom Management to
      support the research team.
