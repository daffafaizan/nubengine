      women will be randomized to receive either magnesium sulfate (loading dose 6 g over 20
      minutes followed by maintenance dose of 1 g/hour for 24 hours), or placebo in the form of
      sodium chloride solution 0.9% over 24 hours. Fetal middle cerebral artery Doppler indices
      [Peak systolic velocity (PSV), Pulsatility index (PI), and resistance index (RI)] will be
      recorded before and after treatment in both groups. Results of Doppler indices will be
      compared between both groups and before and after intake of magnesium sulfate to find out if
      middle cerebral artery Doppler of the fetus can explain the mechanism behind the use of
      magnesium sulfate for fetal neuroprotection in preterm births.
