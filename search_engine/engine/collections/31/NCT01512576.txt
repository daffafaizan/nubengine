      (WAD), show features of central sensitization (CS), a process characterized by generalized
      hypersensitivity of the somatosensory system. it would be worthwhile identifying treatments
      able of activating the dysfunctional endogenous pain inhibition in patients with CS and
      chronic WAD.

      Acupuncture is a treatment method widely used for patients with chronic pain, including those
      with chronic WAD. The effectiveness of acupuncture for the treatment of chronic (neck) pain
      is supported by several randomized controlled clinical trials, systematic reviews including
      meta-analyses. However, the effect-sizes are rather small and only short-term effects have
      been shown consistently.

      A randomized cross-over trial comparing acupuncture with relaxation is conducted in order to
      examine whether acupuncture vs. relaxation for patients with chronic WAD results in:

        1. Immediate activation of endogenous pain inhibition (i.e. conditioned pain modulation);

        2. Concomitant pain relief;

        3. And reduced disability level. Further it is examined whether acupuncture vs. relaxation
           results in different autonomic nervous system responses.
