      CP, however, few researches investigate these functions in children with CP. Knowledge of
      these developmental patterns in movement and participation in life activities MPLA may be
      helpful in understanding, anticipating, and managing the problems of these children. We
      hypothesize that the course of developmental patterns in MPLA of young children with CP
      evolves with their age. This study investigates the longitudinal course of developmental
      patterns in MPLA of young children with CP in Taiwan. This study includes a validity and
      reliability study and a prospective longitudinal study of young children with CP over
      one-year. This study will be executed in 4 years and a validity and reliability study in the
      first year.
