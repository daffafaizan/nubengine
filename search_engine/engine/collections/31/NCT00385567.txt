      administered intravenously three times weekly, with the potential for dose escalation in
      selected patients. Patients with HIV infection, viral load at least 10 times greater than the
      site laboratory's lower limit of detection and CD4 count of <220 cells/mm3, will be entered
      into the trial. All patients must be taking an optimized background regimen (OBR) of
      antiretroviral agents, as confirmed by the Principal Investigator, in accordance with the
      U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents
      in HIV-1 Infected Adults and Adolescents, May 4, 2006.

      A non-randomized "pilot arm" of 16-20 patients will first receive 2.0 mg/kg three times
      weekly for 12 doses. After a "pilot arm" patient has received at least 12 doses of PEHRG214
      at 2.0 mg/kg, dose escalation to 4.0 mg/kg three times weekly will follow a scheme based on
      adverse event, HAGAR, and viral load assessments for each individual patient, and in certain
      cases, further review by the DSMB. After the "pilot arm" patients have received 12 doses at
      4.0 mg/kg, all subsequent patients will enter the protocol at the 4.0 mg PEHRG214/kg level.
      The subsequent 54 patients will be randomized, in 2:1 ratio within center, to the Treatment
      group and Control group, respectively. The treatment group will receive PEHRG214 at a dose of
      4.0 mg/kg three times weekly for up to 48 doses (16 weeks). The Control group will not
      receive the investigational drug, but will undergo observation while receiving standard of
      care HAART.

      After at least 12 doses of PEHRG214 at 4.0 mg/kg, dose escalation to 8.0 mg/kg three times
      weekly will follow a scheme based on adverse event, HAGAR, and viral load assessments for
      each individual patient, and in certain cases, further review by the DSMB.

      The Control patients will be evaluated every 4 weeks for 16 weeks according to the Schedule
      of Assessments in Appendix 1F. After 16 weeks, these patients will have the option of being
      enrolled in an extension protocol where they can receive PEHRG214.
