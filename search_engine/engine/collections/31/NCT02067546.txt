      unsuccessful. Behavioral therapy such as anorectal biofeedback , have a limited success in
      most hospitals in this country. Toilet seat that lifts the legs and brings us into a sitting
      position closer to squatting (which is the desired physiological position) can relieve these
      patients in the emptying process.

      The Company " Shva-Nach" Ltd. and its design team designed a seat at an angle slightly
      elevated and a toilet stool customized to the personal anatomy of each subject.

      The purpose of the study: evaluating efficacy elevated toilet seat with a support of a
      brackets stool making emptying easier in patients with constipation and difficulty in
      emptying.

      Methods: An open, randomized, crossover study in use of a toilet seat and comparing it to a
      standard seat.
