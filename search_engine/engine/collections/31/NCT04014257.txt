      investigate the safety, tolerability, PK, and clinical activity of NOV1601(CHC2014) in
      subjects with solid organ malignancies. The primary goal of the study is to determine the
      RP2D of NOV1601(CHC2014) in adult subjects with solid organ malignancies.

      Dose escalation will follow a 3+3 design and will be based on prior cohort review. There will
      be 2 branches of the dosing schedule, once a day(QD) and twice daily(BID).
