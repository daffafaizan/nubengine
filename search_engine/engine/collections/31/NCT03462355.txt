      September 2017 by accelerated crosslinking (A-CXL) within the ophthalmology department. From
      the 80 people we phoned, 62 answered. Our questions were regarding family history, allergic
      history, and smoking habits. Family history was considered positive if a first-degree or
      second-degree relative had been diagnosed with KC. Allergies toward any kind of external
      factors were marked as positive. Patients' smoking habits were recorded and classified into
      regular, occasional, ex-smoker and non-smoker. The results were confronted to those of the
      general population by indirect standardization over age and sex according to the "Baromètre
      Santé 2010" INPES survey (French Nation Institute for Prevention and Health Education).
