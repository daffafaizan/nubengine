      state-of-the-art-technology in order to achieve a high standard clinical performance,
      surgical efficiency and safety. Currently, no mid- and longterm clinical data are available
      for the GEMINI SL Fixed Bearing PS knee prosthesis. Therefore, the study is designed to
      generate clinical data of the GEMINI SL Fixed Bearing PS knee prosthesis in the 10-year
      follow-up under routine condition.
