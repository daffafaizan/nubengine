        -  To determine the mutation rates of BRAF, KRAS, and EGFR in patients with non-small cell
           lung cancer treated with sorafenib tosylate on protocol ECOG-2501.

        -  To determine the association between BRAF, KRAS, or EGFR mutation status and clinical
           benefits in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      DNA is isolated from archived plasma samples and analyzed for BRAF, KRAS, and EGFR mutations.
