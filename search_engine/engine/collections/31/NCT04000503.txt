      differences in the effectiveness of cervical cancer screening models using self-collected HPV
      testing on engagement in care. In 31 villages, women will be recruited for self-collected
      cervical cancer and sexually transmitted infection (STI) screening by: 1) Community health
      worker recruitment for self-collection (door-to-door), 2) community health meetings. Visual
      inspection with acetic acid (VIA), cryotherapy and thermocoagulation will be offered in local
      health facilities for all women who test positive for high-risk (HR)-HPV types. Women needing
      advanced cancer care will be referred to the Uganda Cancer Institute in Kampala.

      The unit of randomization (2 arms) will be villages and the analysis will also account for
      clustering within this unit or randomization. All participants will receive an integrated
      package of cervical cancer screening and education and will participate in a survey at
      baseline. Samples will be tested using GeneXpert (XpertHPV) point of care testing at the
      Kigandalo health facility for HPV and high risk HPV (HR-HPV). Intervention arms will be
      implemented in phases by year to avoid temporal contamination.
