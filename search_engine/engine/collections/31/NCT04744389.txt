      availability promoted the use of donation after circulatory death (DCD). Italian law requires
      20 minutes of continous flatline electrocardiogram to declared individual's circulatory death
      and such a long period of warm ischemia time forced the development of protocols using
      abdominal normothermic regional perfusion (NRP) followed by ex-vivo graft reperfusion by
      means of machine perfusion technology (MP) for its potential to minimize ischemia/reperfusion
      damage and promote organ repair and reconditioning prior to transplantation. An extensive
      evaluation of all DCD donors might increase donation rate by 30%, but, while kidney
      transplant from DCD donors is well implemented, no definitive data exist on the optimal use
      of NRP and MP in liver and pancreas transplantation and an organizational model is far to be
      implemented. Moreover, a randomized trial comparing hypothermic vs normothermic ex-vivo
      perfusion has never been performed. The proposed project will perform a pilot, open,
      randomized, prospective trials to evaluate the sequential use of NRP followed by ex-vivo MP
      (hypothermic (HMP) vs normothermic (NMP)) by measuring several indicators of organ damage and
      recovery with the target to set up the optimal organizational model for DCD donation:

        1. Twenty LT from DCD donors after NRP (considered transplantable for the acceptance
           criteria in use) will be randomized 1:1 to ex-vivo HMP or NMP (multicenter study
           together with the center in Milan)

        2. 40 liver grafts from ECD-DBD matching the inclusion criteria are randomized 1:1 to
           hypothermic machine perfusion (HMP) vs normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) and then
           transplanted To assess organ damage and repair capacity, the following investigations
           will be performed: -biomarkers of apoptosis, necrosis, innate-mediated inflammation and
           its resolution, angiogenesis and thrombosis during NRP -circulating biomarkers
           indicating damage, proliferation, angiogenetic and tissue remodelling factors; a
           targeted-metabolomic and lipidomic profiling during ex-vivo HMP or NMP in the perfusate
           and on blood samples in the peri and post-operative period; bile composition on graft
           subjected to NMP. Evaluation of necrosis, apoptosis and proliferation,
           immunohistochemical analysis, a targeted-metabolomic and lipidomic profiling, ATP
           measurement, and electronic microscopy investigations will be performed on liver tissue
           and bile duct biopsies after NRP, before and after ex-vivo reperfusion, and immediately
           after reperfusion in the recipient (only for transplantable grafts) Based on the
           collected data a new algorithm of organ evaluation, procurement, preservation and
           reconditioning will be formulated and disseminated.
