    
      Specific Aim 1: To compare the clinical effectiveness of communicating the body weight and
      BMI using a visual aid alone versus a detailed body fat distribution report including
      individualized images and values relative to normative data using a visual scale in a
      population of overweight and obese adults with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes and at least
      one additional cardiovascular disease risk factor. Hypothesis 1: Provision of a detailed body
      fat distribution report contextualized with information describing the relevance of each body
      fat parameter will be superior to provision of body weight/BMI information alone on risk
      perception, behavioral change (enhanced physical activity, dietary choices, and preventive
      provider practices and medication adherence), and clinical outcomes (reduction in weight and
      waist circumference, blood pressure, triglycerides, and glycosylated hemoglobin).

      Specific Aim 2: To compare the clinical effectiveness of communicating body fat information
      to the medical provider (with the intent that the provider interprets the data and translates
      it to the patient) versus communicating the body fat information directly to the patient.
      Hypothesis 2: Provision of body fat information directly to the patient will be superior to
      provision of the information to the provider on risk perception, behavioral change, and
      clinical outcomes (as assessed in Aim 1).
