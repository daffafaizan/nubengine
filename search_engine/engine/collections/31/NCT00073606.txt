      We aim to determine whether the development of a motor memory in the human spinal cord
      circuitry (expressed as a down regulation of the monosynaptic soleus H reflex) after a brief
      period of learning of a locomotor skill, is intrinsically encoded at the spinal cord level or
      if it is determined by descending suprasegmental influences.

      The results of this study would be useful for designing new rehabilitation strategies based
      upon manipulation of peripheral inputs aimed at activating spinal cord circuitry for motor
      recovery independent of the higher centers.

      Study population

      Seventy (70) healthy volunteers (median age 21-65) will participate in the study.

      Design

      Subjects will complete one training session (using a recumbent cycle ergometer) and will be
      tested physiologically and behaviorally once before training and four times after training
      through 14 to 16 days.

      Outcome measures

      We will assess homosynaptic depression of the soleus H reflex (an expression of the
      excitability of the alpha-motorneuron pool), a phenomenon that is not susceptible to
      descending suprasegmental influences but depends on the history of information arriving to
      the alpha-motorneuron from the periphery. Amount of homosynaptic depression will be
      correlated with the behavioral learning assessed by improvement in control of stepping speed.
