      but exact efficacy and safety of rTMS is not well established.

      Eighty four patients will be recruited and will be divided into two groups. Each group will
      receive the real rTMS or sham rTMS, respectively, over the primary motor cortex of the
      dominant hand. Individual subject will receive ten sessions of rTMS. Each rTMS session is low
      frequency (1Hz), total 1800 stimulations.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate efficacy and safety of rTMS 『TMS』 for upper
      extremity motor function recovery in patients with ischemic stroke.
