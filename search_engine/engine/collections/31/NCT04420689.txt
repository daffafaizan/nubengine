      intravenous (IV) infusion to patients undergoing head & neck surgery. The study will also
      characterize the pharmacokinetics of ALM-488 in this subject population and determine the
      dose of ALM-488 needed to generate a fluorescence signal in nerve tissue to enable
      fluorescence recordings and image analysis with an imaging system. The study will also
      evaluate the effect of timing of ALM-488 administration, relative to surgery, on fluorescence
      characteristics.
