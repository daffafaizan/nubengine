      year of life and in 85% by age 3. Approximately 17% of children suffer recurrent otitis media
      during the first year of life. Following acute otitis media, middle ear fluid effusions can
      persist for weeks to months. Approximately 40% of children with middle ear effusions have
      mild to moderate hearing loss for the duration of the effusion, and several studies have
      found evidence for impaired speech and language development among children with prolonged
      middle ear effusion. Since antibiotic use has become widespread, concern has emerged
      regarding antibiotic resistant S. pneumoniae strains and other bacteria. Children with
      recurrent otitis media commonly receive prophylactic antibiotic therapy or surgical insertion
      of tubes to prevent accumulation of middle ear effusion. The prevalence of pediatric use of
      complementary alternative medical (CAM) approaches for prevention of otitis media has not
      been widely quantified. This study will evaluate the use of osteopathic manipulation and
      echinacea therapy to prevent ear infection in children with recurrent otitis media.
