    
      Patients with hormone refractory prostate cancer are eligible if they have a rising PSA or
      three or fewer metastatic lesions. The experimental therapy uses a patient's own white blood
      cells and "teaches" the cells to recognize a "flag" on prostate cancer cells. This may help
      the immune system destroy prostate cancer cells. Side effects reported from the Phase I/II
      trial include skin reactions of redness, pain & swelling at the injection site, and
      short-lived headache, fever & fatigue. Full details are available in the informed consent.
