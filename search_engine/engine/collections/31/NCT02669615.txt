    
      OVERVIEW: This study is a single-center, open-label study of high-dose Melphalan HCl for
      injection (propylene glycol free Melphalan) conducted in 24 patients, who have symptomatic
      multiple myeloma and qualify for ASCT.

      There will be three distinct evaluation periods in this trial: a pretreatment period, a study
      period and a follow-up period.

      PRETREATMENT:

      Pretreatment Period Evaluations (Days -30 to -3). Baseline assessments will be collected
      within 30 days of dosing with Melphalan HCl for injection (propylene glycol free), after the
      patient has signed the informed consent. These include clinical and laboratory assessments
      (e.g., medical history and physical examination, hematology, urine analysis, creatinine
      clearance), chest X-ray and vital signs.

      STUDY TREATMENT:

        1. During the study period, patients will receive 200 mg/m^2 of Melphalan HCl for injection
           (propylene glycol free) as a one-time infusion on day

        2. Following one day of rest after the myeloablative Melphalan conditioning (day -1),
           patients will receive an autologous graft with a minimum cell dose of 2 Ã— 106 CD34+
           cells/kg of patient body weight (day 0).

        3. Pharmacokinetic, efficacy and safety evaluations will be performed during the study
           period.

      FOLLOW-UP:

      ASCT Day +1 until Day+100. During the follow-up period, patients will return for daily
      laboratory tests (hematology and basic serum chemistry) and will be evaluated weekly by their
      physicians until the engraftment date, with the final end-of-study evaluation occurring up to
      seven days after engraftment date. During the follow-up period, the tests (e.g., physical
      examination, CBC, vital signs, full serum chemistry panel, bone marrow biopsy) will be
      performed weekly until engraftment (unless otherwise specified).
