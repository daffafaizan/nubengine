      the blood levels over time while BPI is being infused through a vein to see if the dose is
      potentially enough to obtain the desired effect. The drug will be started within 8 hours of
      burn injury and continued for 48 hours. Patients will be followed on admission and through
      infusion in the Burn ICU where they will be monitored by ICU standards. They will be seen
      regularly thereafter on post-burn days 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 14 and 28 days while in the hospital.
      If the patient is discharged prior to the 28 day evaluation, they will be evaluated on or
      around the 28th day in the burn clinic. A blood sample will be obtained to look for potential
      genetic markers that may increase a burn patients' risk to develop infection in the post burn
      period.
