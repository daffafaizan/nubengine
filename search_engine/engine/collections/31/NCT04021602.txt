      combined breastfeeding, DPP-based program in a cohort of overweight/obese women to be
      followed during pregnancy through 6 months postpartum. The pilot trial will have three study
      arms: DPP + breastfeeding (Tx1), DPP only (Tx2), and usual care (Tx3). Specific aims are: 1)
      To test the efficacy of Tx1 to improve 6-month postpartum weight loss among women with a BMI
      >/= 25. 2) To test the efficacy of Tx1 to improve 6-month postpartum mean blood glucose
      (HbA1c) and mean arterial blood pressure among women with a BMI >/= 25. 3) To test the
      efficacy of Tx1 to increase any breastfeeding through 6 months postpartum among women with a
      BMI >/= 25.
