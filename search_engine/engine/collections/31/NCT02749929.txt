      are randomly divided into two groups with concealed allocation. The fracture is immobilized
      with a cast of paris, with a small opening where Low Level Laser therapy can be administered
      in skin contact. The patients will receive treatment 3 times a week, for 3 weeks. After
      discontinuation of the cast, the patients swelling, pain, grip strength and function of the
      wrist is measured. The patients will meet for follow-up controls until 26 weeks after injury.
