    
      This is a prospective multi-centre, randomised, controlled study to evaluate the safety and
      preliminary effectiveness of NVD-001 for the treatment of low grade degenerative lumbar
      spondylolisthesis by interbody fusion of one vertebral segment (L1-S1). The study consists of
      a 12-month initialfollow-up period post-surgery and a subsequent 12-month long term
      follow-up.

      NVD-001 is an autologous cellular medicinal product obtained by culture of adipose tissue
      (liposuction) leading to osteogenic cells after ex vivo isolation, expansion and
      differentiation of pluripotent adipose-tissue stem cells (ASC), and combination with an
      allogeneic fully demineralised bone matrix into a 3D bone implant.

      Patients diagnosed with symptomatic degenerative spondylolisthesis grade I or II with an
      indication for spinal fusion of one vertebral segment (L1-S1) who sign informed consent and
      are eligible will be randomised either to the experimental group (surgical intervention for
      spinal lumbar interbody fusion with NVD-001) or to the control group (commonly used surgical
      intervention for spinal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF, PLIF, minimally invasive or open
      approach) with one or two PEEK cage(s) filled and surrounded by locally harvested autologous
      cancellous bone (laminectomy).
