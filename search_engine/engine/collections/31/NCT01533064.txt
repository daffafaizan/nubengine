      psychotropic drug use, including the use of neuroleptics, antidepressants, and
      benzodiazepines, directly after the disaster on March 11, 2011. Changes in other psychotropic
      drugs that are prescribed less frequently, such as lithium or anticonvulsants, were not
      considered in this study. Changes in symptoms that did not require a need to change
      psychotropic medications were not considered as part of a patient's progress. Physicians
      rated the relationship between each change in psychotropic drug and the disaster as direct,
      indirect, or not relevant. Only when three physicians rated the relationship as direct did we
      consider the change in a patient's progress to be due to the earthquake. Worsening or
      improvement of symptoms was defined as a change in psychotropic medications as a result of
      the deterioration or improvement, respectively, of symptoms. The data were stratified by
      disease category and sex and analyzed using chi-square tests.
