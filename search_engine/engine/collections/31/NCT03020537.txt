      vaccination (IIV3). There are no exclusions for gender, ethnicity or race. Following review
      and confirmation of written informed consent, volunteers will be enrolled into the study.

      The 1-2 year-old child volunteers enrolled in Group A cannot have been previously immunized
      with an influenza vaccine. They will receive two single doses of the 2013-2014 pediatric
      formulation of seasonal trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV3), at least 28 days
      apart, given by intramuscular (IM) injection. The child volunteers will complete 4 clinic
      visits with 3 blood sample collections. Study visits will be on Day 0 (first immunization),
      Day 28-32 (second immunization), Day 6-8 post-Dose 2, and Day 28+4 post-Dose 2. The baseline
      blood sample will be drawn prior to immunization at Day 0, followed by two additional blood
      samples at Day 6-8 post-Dose 2, and Day 28+4 post-Dose 2. There will not be a blood sample
      collected at Day 28-32.

      The 18-30 year-old young adults in Group B cannot have been immunized with the 2012-2013
      seasonal influenza vaccine. Participants in Group B will receive a single dose of the
      2013-2014 IIV3 by IM injection. Young adult volunteers will complete 3 clinic visits with 3
      blood sample collections on Day 0, Day 6-8, and Day 28+4. The baseline blood sample will be
      drawn prior to immunization at Day 0.
