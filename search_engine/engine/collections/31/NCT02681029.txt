      ethical committee, and all participants will sign a written consent before enter to study.
      All patients will be randomly divided into two groups of thawed cleavage embryo transfers and
      transfers of blastocysts from thawed cleavage embryos. Embryos will be transferred in hormone
      replacement cycles. Preparation of the endometrium will be started in the second day of
      menstruation and will be continued according to their transfer type (blastocyst or cleavage).
      Î²hCG will be assessed 14 days after embryo transfer. Treatment cycle outcomes will be
      compared between 2 groups.
