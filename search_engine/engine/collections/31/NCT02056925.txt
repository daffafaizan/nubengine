      murmur, chest pain, sport capacity…), which had normal heart after evaluation. If they
      satisfied all inclusive criteria (0 to 17 years old, parental agreement, social security
      fund) and neither exclusive criteria (cardiac, respiratory or muscular problems, chronic
      diseases, drug with heart impact, poor image quality), we randomly execute a second
      echocardiography. Echocardiography are done with Vivid 7 ultrasound (General Electrics)
      and/or IE 33 ultrasound (Philips) by one or two trained operators. Strain loops are taken on
      three standard apical views (two, three and four-chamber views), short axis midventricular
      and aortic views, sub-costal short axis aortic view and sub-costal four-chamber apical views.
      Strain analysis are done in a second steps by one or two trained readers with adapted
      software : Echopac (General Electrics) or QLAB 0.0 (Philips). Strain and Strain rate results
      are collected for each ventricle in each dimension.We compare results between the two tests
      and done statistical analysis with a study of variability : ultrasound variability, operator
      variability, reader variability (correlation coefficient). We also done a feasibility study
      with use of "poor image quality"exclusion criteria.
