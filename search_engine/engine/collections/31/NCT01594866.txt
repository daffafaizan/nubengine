      escalation and evaluate remission rate. This study design is the double-blinded 6-week
      prospective study. It would be useful for clinicians because there were few study of
      high-dose antidepressant treatment in lack of remission in major depressive disorder
      patients. To control of bias, the investigators included patients with lack of remission
      after 4-week escitalopram treatment.
