    
      This is a single group intervention study of adults (18-80 years-old) with dystonia symptoms
      undergoing a 6-week intervention of 30 minute yoga classes delivered remotely through
      videoconferencing 2-3 times a week. Subjects with cervical dystonia will complete yoga
      classes delivered at-home with videoconferencing, receiving one-on-one yoga instruction
      including breathing, postures, and meditation/relaxation for two to three times a week. Data
      collection will occur remotely via videoconferencing at 0-weeks (baseline), 6-weeks (after
      the intervention), and 12-weeks (follow-up). Data collection will include demographics,
      mental health questionnaires, motor assessments, enjoyment, usability, and follow-up yoga
      status. Each yoga session will be video recorded to aide in recording adherence, adverse
      events, and challenges.
