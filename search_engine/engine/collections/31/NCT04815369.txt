      from 200 nursing homes, will show that the use of Guidance UTI for detection and
      identification of pathogens in UTI, and antimicrobial susceptibility information, affords
      more efficacious treatment of UTI compared to traditional standard urine culture (SUC). The
      superiority hypothesis is that GuidanceÂ® UTI is more effective will be measured by the number
      of UTI-related adverse events requiring emergent hospital services, antibiotic ordering
      accuracy, UTI- treatment related C.diff events, and overall urine testing rate for UTI. The
      results of this study will provide evidence-based diagnosis and treatment approach extremely
      common clinical condition among this target group. This could help preserve the efficacy of
      valuable antimicrobials during a time of steadily increasing antimicrobial resistance and
      protect future patients from inappropriate, antimicrobial therapy for their UTI.
