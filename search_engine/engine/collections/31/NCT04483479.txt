      the screening visit, at 6 and 12 weeks, and at the end of the 6th week of the wash-out period
      (end of study).

      The dose escalation period will last up to 20 days, the fixed dose period will last 12 weeks,
      and the wash-out period will last 6 weeks.

      Subjects will begin dosing at the same dose level they were stratified to in the ENT-01-030
      randomized study (i.e., starting at either 3 tablets or 6 tablets,) and escalate up to a
      pro-kinetic dose or a maximum dose of 250mg.
