      A. To assess changes in different ultrasound parameters: E wave , E / A ratio , E / E ' in
      the event of vascular filling and construct a dose response curve for vascular filling.

      B. To determing a threshold value for the mitral E wave velcoity that can predict a positive
      response to volume expansion at T10 defined by a 15% increase in the sub aortic velocity time
      integral (ITV) after 500 ml of crystalloids in 10 minutes.

      C. To determine a threshold value for theITV at T0 that can predict a positive response to
      volume expansion at T10 defined by a 15% increase in the ITV after 500 ml of crystalloids in
      10 minutes.

      D. To evaluate the proportion of responders at T10 becoming non-responders at T20.

      E. To evaluate the proportion of nonresponders at T10 and responders at T30 .

      F. To estimate the proportion of patients changing status regardless of the direction of
      change between T10 and T30 .
