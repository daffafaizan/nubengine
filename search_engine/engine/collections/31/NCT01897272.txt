      each. If you decide to participate in this study, we would first have you come to clinic
      where you would undergo some standard measurements. This includes measuring grip and key
      pinch strength and completing a patient questionnaire. During your visits we will scan the
      cross-sectional area of the median nerve at the pisiform bone level to determine the level of
      CTS with the Ultrasound Biomiscroscopy machine (Vevo 2100). This is a new technique with a
      machine similar to a regular ultrasound machine. The primary difference is that the frequency
      of soundwaves is higher than a standard ultrasound machine. There are no known significant
      risks associated with the use of this machine. At this time the machine is experimental, and
      is not currently approved by the FDA for clinical use. However, this device is not considered
      to pose significant risk. Candidates for this study must have been diagnosed with single
      carpal tunnel syndrome and are going to receive nerve decompression with short incision, over
      the age of 18, and able to give informed consent to participate in a research study.
