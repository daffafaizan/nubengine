      patients down in a situation of restlessness during mechanical ventilation weaning. This drug
      is used for several years to quieten restless patients. Its purpose is to restore spontaneous
      breathing sooner and therefore to reduce the risks of intubation and mechanical ventilation.
      300 patients will participate in the study and will be randomized, after informed consent, to
      receive either loxapine or a placebo.Patients whose proxies refuse participation will be
      sedated according to standard care procedures.
