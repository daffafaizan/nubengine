    
      This cross-sectional study includes cardiologists aged > 40 years: a group of interventional
      cardiologists (coronary interventionists and electrophysiologists) and a group of unexposed
      workers (including cardiologists). Individual information, including risk factors of
      cataracts (age, diabetes, myopia, etc. ...), are collected during a telephone interview. For
      the exposed group, a specific section of the questionnaire is focused on the occupational
      history, the description of the procedures (type, frequency, radiation protection tool) and
      will be used for the classification into "comparable exposure level" groups according to
      estimates of cumulative dose. For all participants, eye examinations are performed to
      specifically detect cataracts even in the early stages (lens opacities, LOCS III according to
      the international standard classification).
