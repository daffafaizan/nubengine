      is a national weight management program for veterans that has moved form pilot to full
      dissemination. Overweight and obesity are rapidly rising in the United States and
      interventions to combat this epidemic are desperately needed. Within the VA population,
      approximately 70% of veterans are overweight and or obese. Participants will be male and
      female Veterans, aged 21 and over receiving health services at one of the 10 study sites, who
      qualify for the MOVE! program. We are recruiting a minimum of 800 -1000 Veterans to complete
      a baseline survey at the 10 VA sites participating in the study. Participants at the 10 VA
      sites are recruited during a primary care visit by primary care provider, they will not be
      chosen based on the presence or absence of any disease, thus health status will vary. The
      primary outcome measures will be participation after enrollment into MOVE! and participant
      weight loss.
