      trial. In dose selection part (any histological types except HCC), patients will be treated
      with an IT boost injection with Pexa-Vec (fixed dose of 1x109 pfu / injection ) alone at Week
      1 followed by IT injections of Pexa-Vec + ipilimumab (up to 4 dose levels) at Weeks 3, 5 and
      9. The dose escalation part will follow a classical 3+3 design. 3 to 6 patients will be
      enrolled at each DL (Dose Level) depending of the number of Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT)
      observed. At the end of each DL cohort, a teleconference (Dose escalation meeting) will be
      organized with the sponsor, in order to select the dose for the next cohort. In Expansion
      cohorts ( up to 3 cohorts) patients will be treated with an IT boost injection with Pexa-Vec
      alone (fixed dose of 1x109 pfu / injection) at Week 1 followed by IT injections of Pexa-Vec +
      ipilimumab (RP2D) at Weeks 3, 5 and 9. In both parts, the treatment with both IMPs should be
      continued as per protocol until Withdrawal of consent, Disease progression as per irRC
      (immune related response criteria), General or specific changes in the patient's condition
      that render the patient unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the
      investigator, Pregnancy or Unacceptable adverse events(s) including DLTs.
