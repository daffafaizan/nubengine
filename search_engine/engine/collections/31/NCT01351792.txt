      disease that can be fatal. The recent Global Burden of Disease Study ranks COPD as the 6th
      leading cause of mortality and the 12th leading cause of morbidity world-wide. Furthermore,
      trends in the use of medical care resources indicate that the economic cost of COPD continues
      to rise in direct relation to the ageing population, the increase in prevalence of disease
      and the cost of new and existing medical and public health interventions.
