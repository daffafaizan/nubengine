      collected includes: ethnicity, gestational age, birth season, age and season at T1DM
      diagnosis, and presence of autoimmunity in family. The prevalence of prematurity among T1D is
      compared to the non-diabetic general population registry of 2000-2013. Additional comparisons
      are between T1D patients born term and preterm, aimed to unveil specific influencing clinical
      and epidemiological factors.

      In the latter part of the study, a multi-centered, paired case-control study is performed.

      Preterm born T1D patients will be paired to matched non-diabetic children at a ratio of 3:1,
      according to medical center, sex, gestational week of birth, season and year of birth. Data
      collected includes: ethnicity, family history of autoimmune diseases, age and type of first
