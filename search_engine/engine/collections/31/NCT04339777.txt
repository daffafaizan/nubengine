    
      Background:

        -  With the availability of whole exome sequencing (WES) and whole genome sequencing (WGS)
           for patients with suspected primary immune deficiency or Primary Immune Regulatory
           Disorder (PIRD), the number of recognized PID s and PIRD s has increased in recent years
           to over 400 distinct immune defects.

        -  Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation represents a potentially curative
           therapy for many hematologic diseases.

        -  Hematopoietic stem cell transplant is now an accepted standard or an appropriate
           experimental approach for treatment of an increasing number of PID

        -  The use of conditioning regimens containing high doses of alkylating agents, often in
           combination with total body irradiation, are considered myeloablative and are essential
           and for suppression of the host-versus-graft response to the donor stem cells (i.e.
           rejection)

        -  We propose to evaluate the efficacy and safety of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell
           transplantation (HSCT) using selected conditioning regimens and selected donor sources
           in reconstituting normal hematopoiesis and immune function and reversing the disease
           phenotype in patients with primary immunodeficiency diseases.

      Objectives:

      -To determine whether allogeneic HSCT results in sustained donor engraftment defined as
      neutrophil recovery with ANC greater than or equalto 500/mm(3) for 3 consecutive days
      associated with > 50% donor T-cell and myeloid cell donor chimerism before day 100 for
      diseases characterized by loss of function and >75% donor T-cell and myeloid cell chimerism
      for diseases characterized by gain-of-function mutations.

      Eligibility:

        -  Participants ages 4-69 years old with a known PID or PIRD, or with clinical evidence of
           a PID or PIRD with a history of recurrent infections requiring prolonged courses of
           therapy, or evidence of immune dysregulation manifested by autoimmune/autoinflammatory
           disease, atopy, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, hypogammaglobulinemia, or impaired
           response to vaccination. A virally-driven malignancy alone will also constitute a basis
           for inclusion.

        -  Have a 10/10 or a 9/10 HLA-matched related or unrelated donor (HLA -A, -B, -C, DRB1,
           DQB1 by high resolution typing; unrelated donors are identified through the National
           Marrow Donor Program), or a haploidentical related donor.

      Design:

      For Recipients with Matched Donors

        -  Patients with PID receiving a high intensity transplant conditioning regimen will
           receive a regimen consisting of fludarabine 40 mg/m(2) IV once daily for 4 days on days
           -6, -5, -4, and -3, busulfan IV once daily for 4 days on days -6, -5, -4, -3 (busulfan
           dose will be based on pharmacokinetic levels from the test dose and will be targeted to
           an AUC of 3200-4000 microMol X min/L (52-65 mg X h/L) (3.2 mg/kg IV per day will be the
           default dose), and HSCT on day 0.

        -  Patients with PID receiving an intermediate intensity transplant conditioning regimen
           will receive a regimen consisting of of fludarabine 40 mg/m(2) IV once daily for 4 days
           on days -6, -5, -4, and -3, busulfan IV once daily for 3 days on days -6, -5, -and -4
           (busulfan dose will be based on pharmacokinetic levels from the test dose and will be
           targeted to an AUC of 3200-4000 microMol X min/L (52-65 mg X h/L) (3.2 mg/kg IV per day
           will be the default dose), and HSCT on day 0.

        -  Patients with PID receiving a low intensity transplant conditioning regimen will receive
           a regimen consisting of of fludarabine 40 mg/m2 IV once daily for 4 days on days -6, -5,
           -4, and -3, busulfan IV once daily for 2 days on days -6, and -5 (busulfan dose will be
           based on pharmacokinetic levels from the test dose and will be targeted to an AUC of
           3200-4000 microMol X min/L (52-65 mg X h/L) (3.2 mg/kg IV per day will be the default
           dose), and HSCT on day 0.

      In all cohorts, patients with clinical evidence of immune dysregulation, alemtuzumab will be
      given at the dose of 0.03 mg on day -11, 0.1 mg/kg on day -10, and 0.2 mg/kg on days -9 and
      -8.
