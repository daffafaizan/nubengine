      will be no BMI restriction. Twenty-three women will be randomly assigned to receive DCI
      (experimental group) and 23 women to receive placebo (control group). The women will be
      studied during the equivalent of the follicular phase of the cycle, as documented by a serum
      progesterone concentration of 2 ng/ml.

      PCOS will be defined using criteria developed at the 1990 NICHD conference on PCOS3 - i.e.,
      all women will have oligomenorrhea (eight or fewer menstrual periods annually) and
      hyperandrogenemia (elevated serum total or free testosterone concentration), and secondary
      causes of hyperandrogenism or ovulatory dysfunction will be excluded (see below: Entrance
      Criteria). All women will undergo a standard oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) to screen for
      diabetes mellitus,16 but impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) will not be an exclusion criteria
      because of the high prevalence of IGT in this population.8,17-19 We intentionally will not
      screen the women for the presence of insulin resistance. Women with PCOS who have disorders
      associated with insulin resistance - such as hypertension21-23 or dyslipidemia21-23 - will
      not be excluded as long as they have been on a stable dose of medication for 6 months.
