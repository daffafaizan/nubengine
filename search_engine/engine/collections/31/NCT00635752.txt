      serious accidents, or natural disasters, may develop severe health problems.

      This study will examine the short and long-term effects of trauma-focused
      cognitive-behavioural therapy on children exposed to serious trauma, and moderating factors
      of treatment outcome.

      The study will use a random control design, and will be implemented in regular clinical
      practice in Norway.

      More knowledge within this field is important for practitioners as well as policy makers in
      planning interventions and therapy for children and their caregivers.
