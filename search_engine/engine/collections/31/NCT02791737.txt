      I. To assess the feasibility of implementing a structured exercise program by evaluating
      recruitment and retention, exercise program adherence, sustainability, adverse events, and
      implementation challenge.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To calculate preliminary effect sizes of the impact of an exercise program in patients
      with hematologic malignancy undergoing therapy, as measured by:

        -  Cancer and Aging Research Group (CARG) Geriatric Assessment Tool parameters.

        -  Change in Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB).

        -  Number and severity of falls.

        -  Impact of motivation and self-efficacy on adherence.

        -  Hospital readmission rates (if applicable).

        -  Length of inpatient stays (if applicable).

        -  Patient Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) for Health related
           quality of life (HRQL).

        -  Correlative analysis of peripheral blood biomarkers of aging and inflammation
           (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A [p16], inflammatory biomarkers, immunosenescence,
           micro [mi] ribonucleic acid [RNA]).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients attend 8 physical therapy visits twice monthly for 4 months or until transplant.
      Patients also undergo an individualized exercise program at home for 6 months. The program
      comprises 3 main components: walking over 30 minutes twice a week, strengthening and balance
      retraining exercise over 30 minutes three times a week.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 6 months.
