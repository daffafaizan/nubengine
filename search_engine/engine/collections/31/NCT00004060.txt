      metastatic, or unresectable ovarian, tubal, or peritoneal carcinoma that is refractory to
      platinum, taxane, and topotecan. II. Evaluate the quantitative and qualitative toxic effects
      of this regimen in these patients. III. Evaluate the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in
      these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified by prior chemotherapy (minimally pretreated vs heavily
      pretreated). Patients receive intravenous DX-8951f over 30 minutes daily for 5 days. Courses
      repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients
      are followed every 3 months until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 37 patients will be accrued for this study.
