      per annum in the UK with a combined cost of approximately Â£21 billion. Chronic alcohol misuse
      in patients who attend hospital for alcohol-related illness/injury is common, with relapse
      and recidivism almost ubiquitous. Patients often report that 'stress' was a catalyst for
      their drinking episodes, but we do not know exactly who is most at risk, how stress leads to
      drinking, or the genetic basis for this risk. This research aims to seek to identify patients
      at higher risk of stress-induced alcohol misuse, or who are more resilient to stress in this
      context, using a combination of analyses ranging from genetic variants to personality tests
      and clinical follow-up. The ultimate goal is that patients engaging with alcohol services can
      receive personalised and focussed treatment and enhance recovery
