      and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works
      in treating a specific disease. "Investigational" means that the intervention is being
      studied.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has approved Abiraterone acetate with
      prednisone as a treatment option for prostate cancer that has spread to other parts of the
      body (metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer).However, in this study it is being
      investigated for the treatment of localized prostate cancer prior to surgical removal of the
      prostate (prostatectomy).

      Abiraterone acetate works by decreasing the production of androgens (male sex hormones),
      which promote prostate cancer growth. Some steroids produced by the adrenal glands can turn
      into testosterone, and prostate cancer cells feed on testosterone. Testosterone is suppressed
      by an FDA approved drug called leuprolide or Lupron.

      The FDA has not approved Apalutamide as a treatment for any disease. In this study,
      Apalutamide is being investigated for the treatment of prostate cancer. Apalutamide also
      works by blocking the effects of male sex hormones.

      In this research study, the investigators are studying the effectiveness of one combination
      of drugs (abiraterone acetate + prednisone + leuprolide) compared to another combination of
      drugs (abiraterone acetate + prednisone + leuprolide + Apalutamide) before surgery to see if
      this will improve surgical outcomes and reduce or eliminate Prostate Cancer.
