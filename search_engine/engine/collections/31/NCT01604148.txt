      evaluated preoperatively with International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), International
      Continence Society male questionnaire short form (ICS-SF), 3-day frequency - volume charts
      (FVC), transrectal ultrasonography, and uroflowmetry with postvoid residual urine volume. The
      patients were divided into two groups; BPO without DO (Non-DO group) and BPO with DO (DO
      group). We assessed the patients postoperatively at 2 weeks, 1, 3 and 6 months after surgery.
