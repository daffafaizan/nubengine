    
      -  Prospective, unblinded, randomized (1:1), multi-center trial of 300 patients allocated
           to one of the treatment arms (IVUS-guided PCI or angiography-guided PCI). Aggressive
           (non-IVUS) strategies to reduce contrast will be used in both study arms

        -  The study population will be composed of patients with renal dysfunction referred for
           PCI of one or more coronary vessels, all of them amenable to IVUS imaging

        -  After discharge, all subjects will be clinically followed-up for 1 year after the index
           procedure, at the following time-points: 30 and 180 days and 1 year.

        -  Unless contra-indicated, all patients elective will receive intravenous hydration during
           12 hours pre- and 12 hours post-PCI. For patients with acute coronary syndrome,
           intensive intravenous hydration should be initiated as early as possible. Saline (NaCl
           0.9%) infusion is recommended at a dose of 1 ml / kg body weight per hour, 25 and
           reduced to 0.5 ml/kg/h for those at high risk of volume overload (e.g. reduced left
           ventricular function or overt heart failure).The use of N-acetylcysteine or sodium
           bicarbonate will be left to operator discretion.

        -  Operators will be strongly recommended to follow strict strategies to reduce the total
           volume of contrast for all patients

        -  All percutaneous procedures will be performed using non-ionic, low-osmolar or
           iso-osmolar, iodine-based contrast media

        -  The study groups will be compared according to the intention-to-treat principle.
           Categorical variables will be compared by Fisher's exact testing and continuous
           variables by Student's T testing. Time-dependent events will be estimated by the
           Kaplan-Meier method and compared by Hazards Cox modeling or log-rank test
