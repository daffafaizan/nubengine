      entrapment at the wrist. Local corticosteroid injections are also an established alternative,
      particularly for EDx mild or moderate CTS, although majority of patients still needs surgical
      decompression within 1 year. Majority of studies concluded that after more than 6 months of
      treatment surgical decompression is better than local corticosteroids injections.
      Furthermore, corticosteroids also have a number of side effects, including crystal induced
      synovitis, tendon rupture, axon and myelin degeneration, soft tissue atrophy, skin thinning,
      steroid flare and hot flushes. Therefore, it would be very useful to have an effective
      alternative substance for injections, without these problems. Perineural injection of
      dextrose also seems to be a promising treatment for entrapment neuropathies. To date only two
      studies investigated the effectiveness of 5% dextrose injections in patients with CTS.
      Authors concluded that this is an effective treatment, that is for patients with mild or
      moderate CTS even more beneficial than corticosteroid injections at 6 months follow-up. It
      was suggested that perineural injection of 5% dextrose decreases neurogenic inflammation. As
      5% dextrose has osmolarity similar to normal saline, this formulation seems particularly
      promising. These expectations were supported in studies including animals and humans
      reporting no harmful effects.
