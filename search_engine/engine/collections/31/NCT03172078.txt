      specialized surgical interventions. Although many other sedative agents are used prior to and
      during endoscopy, none approach propofol in terms of desirable properties. The risk of
      propofol sedation for interventional procedures such as endoscopic retrograde
      cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), and therapeutic endoscopy are
      among the highest for any sedated endoscopic procedure. The reasons are many: the intensity
      of stimulation encountered during these procedures is similar to many minor surgeries; the
      airway management is complex and requires constant attention; the incidence of hypoxemia is
      high, and the time available for recognition and management is limited. In order to reap the
      benefits of advanced endoscopic procedures, anesthesiologists must rise to the challenge.
      This requires a dedicated anesthetic team practicing safe, efficient, and effective sedation
      techniques for advanced endoscopic procedures. Ongoing research into novel infusion methods
      can add safety to the existing sedation techniques and address some of the concerns related
      to sedative quality. This is a randomized controlled and prospective study. To evaluate the
      benefits when we use target-controlled infusion of propofol (TCI) with/without bispectral
      index monitoring in patients undergoing advanced endoscopic procedure. The primary outcome is
      the total amount of propofol. The secondary outcomes are patients' and endoscopists'
      satisfaction, sedative-related adverse events, recovery time.
