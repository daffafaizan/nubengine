    
      20 postmenopausal women who are planned to treat with erythropoietin alpha for their renal
      conditions will be included to the study. Sample size was calculated with proper power
      analysis with accepting the difference of 1 mm in endometrial thickness as a significant
      change. After the informed consent, endometrial thickness (mm), uterine artery and
      subendometrial blood flow by doppler ultrasonography (RI, S/D) will be measured. Same
      measurements will be repeated on the 3rd day and 30th day. Patients' age, BMI,
      co-morbidities, administered erythropoietin doses will be noted. No adverse effect is
      expected with regard to the ultrasonographic examination. Date of the patients who do not
      attend for the appointments for repetitive examinations and uninterpretable doppler variables
      due to the atrophic uterus will be noted as the missing data and will be excluded from the
      study. Proper statistical analysis will be done.
