      photoplethysmograph technology. It measures several vital signs, including blood pressure,
      stroke volume, pulse rate, pulse pressure, heart rate variability, respiratory rate,
      saturation, cardiac output, cardiac index, and more. The data is transmitted to Biobeat's
      application (in both Apple and Google Play), and is available on the individual's cellular
      phone, tablet, or as a full monitoring system in a hospital department. The aim of this study
      is to compare the Biobeat monitor with the invasive method of blood pressure measurement, an
      arterial line. The study population includes 30 patients undergoing cardiac surgery. As per
      local protocol, each one of the participants will come out from the operating room with an
      arterial line. Once in the intensive care unit, the investigators will attach the Biobeat
      non-invasive monitor (either wrist watch or a patch, these two configurations are identical
      in terms of the monitoring system), and monitor the participants for 4 hours. Though both
      methods are continuous, the investigators will record the vital signs every 15 minutes during
      the 4 hours of the study.
