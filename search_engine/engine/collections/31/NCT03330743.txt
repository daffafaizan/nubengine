      positive deviance behaviors among parents of obese Hispanic children using peer mentors. This
      trial will evaluate the efficacy and feasibility of this approach in reducing adiposity among
      a high-risk population of children.

      Our central hypothesis is that children randomized to the intervention with a parent mentor
      using positive deviance methods with have a greater reduction in adiposity as measured by
      body mass index (BMI) compared with a parent mentor using traditional education or a control
      receiving usual education.
