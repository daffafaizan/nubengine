      bacteria, including Bifidobacterium that are indigenous to gut microbiomes. Our underlying
      hypothesis is that the commensal microbiome, including Bifidobacterium, in the proximal colon
      or distal ileum affects the environment of draining lymph nodes and can thus modulate immune
      responses, including to vaccines. In the current study, participants will consume 12
      grams/day inulin or maltodextrin (control) for 4 weeks before the administration of the Ty21a
      typhoid fever vaccine, 1 week during the vaccine, and 1 week after the vaccine. Vaccine
      response will be measured by quantitating T cells and IgG- or IgA-secreting plasma cells
      specific for Ty21a. Gut permeability will be measured before and after the inulin
      intervention, before and after the vaccine administration, and at the end of the study.
      Systemic inflammation and immune activation will be measured by analyzing blood for markers
      of inflammation.
