      characterized by an increase in one or more myeloid lineages. The Philadelphia chromosome
      negative (Ph-) MPN include polycythemia vera (PV) with an excess of red blood cells,
      essential thrombocythemia (ET) with an increase in platelets and primary myelofibrosis (PMF).
      Arterial and venous thromboses are the main causes of morbidity and mortality in MPN with
      reported incidences ranging from 12-39% in PV and 11-25% in ET. The pathogenesis of
      thrombosis in MPN patients is complex and still largely elusive. The overproduction of
      neutrophils could be an important risk factor in the thrombus formation. Indeed neutrophils
      are known to promote thrombosis when they release their decondensed chromatin as a network of
      extracellular fibers named NET for "neutrophils extracellular trap". Increased NETosis has
      been reported in a mouse model of MPN. The main objective of this study is to investigate
      whether NET biomarkers are associated with increased thrombotic risk in patients with ET.
      Indeed, an international thrombotic prognostic score has been published in ET, ie the IPSET
      Thrombosis score (history of thrombosis, age, presence of JAK2V617F, cardiovascular risk
      factors).

      Plasma from MPN patients will be collected, at the time of diagnosis, and measure markers of
      neutrophil activation, including NET biomarkers. The IPSET Thrombosis score will be evaluated
      in patients with ET and the correlation between the IPSET Thrombosis score and these
      biomarkers will be measured.

      No follow-up is required for this study.
