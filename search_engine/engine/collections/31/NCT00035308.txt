      of antibodies to double-stranded DNA. These antibodies are believed to contribute to kidney
      damage in patients with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE). Rising levels of these antibodies
      seem to be associated with exacerbations of kidney disease that are known as "renal flares."
      Currently, anti-inflammatory and cytotoxic drugs are used to treat renal flares.
      Unfortunately, these drugs are often associated with certain unpleasant side effects. The
      purpose of this trial is to determine whether LJP 394 can delay or reduce the number of renal
      flares. It is possible that if renal flares can be delayed or reduced, patients may be able
      to take smaller amounts of anti-inflammatory or cytotoxic drugs and therefore suffer fewer of
      the side effects associated with these treatments.
