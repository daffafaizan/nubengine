    
      Primary pigmented nodular adrenocortical disease (PPNAD) is a pituitary-independent, primary
      adrenal form of hypercortisolism characterized by (a) resistance to suppression by
      dexamethasone and abolition of the normal diurnal rhythm of cortisol secretion, and (b)
      distinctive, bilateral, histopathologic changes of the adrenal glands, such as the formation
      of variably sized, pigmented nodular adenomas, loss of normal zonation and atrophy of the
      extranodular cortex. PPNAD can be associated with a variety of other manifestations, such as
      myxomas of the skin, heart, breast and other sites, psammomatous melanotic swannomas
      involving the peripheral nervous system (PNS), lentigines and blue nevi of the skin and
      mucosae, growth hormone (GH)-producing adenomas of the pituitary, testicular Sertoli cell
      tumors, and possibly other neoplasms (adrenocortical and thyroid follicular carcinoma, and
      ovarian cysts). These associations constitute a distinct clinical syndrome, Carney complex, a
      genetic syndrome. At present, there are no standardized screening tests for the members of
      families with affected individuals and the molecular mechanism(s) of this hereditary single
      and/or multiple neoplasia syndrome have not been completely elucidated (e.g. patients who
      meet clinical criteria for Carney complex but test negative for PRKAR1A mutation . This study
      seeks to define the genetic basis of PPNAD and/or Carney complex in sporadic and familial
      cases and the molecular pathogenesis of their tumors, to identify the carriers of the
      familial forms of the disease, and to determine the prognosis for carriers and affected
      individuals. The methods include standard clinical testing for endocrine and nonendocrine
      pathologic conditions of the subjects of the study, linkage analysis with DNA markers from
      areas of the genome likely to harbor the responsible gene(s), and finally genetic screening
      of these genes. Molecular studies of the tumors of the patients will provide additional clues
      for the pathophysiologic mechanisms leading to PPNAD/Carney complex. The study will
      ultimately provide sufficient data for genetic counseling of families with PPNAD and/or
      Carney complex, and, ultimately, the means for genetic screening and prenatal testing.
