      trial using micro-injections of Restylane® Silk for correction of mid to low cheek fine lines
      and wrinkles. Twenty (20) subjects will be enrolled. Each subject will receive Restylane®
      Silk to a defined area of mid to low cheek in a randomized blinded fashion with the
      contralateral cheek treated by sham injection. The injections will be delivered intradermally
      1mm in depth via multiple 0.02 cc microinjections distributed in a grid array pattern with
      0.5 cm to 1 cm between each injection point over total treatment area. The sham injections
      will be administered in identical fashion and will consist of sterile normal saline.
      Following completion of injection treatment, manual massage will be applied to the full area
      to promote even distribution of the product. The maximum amount of Restylane Silk to be used
      per treatments session/per cheek for balancing treatment is1cc (not to exceed a total of 3cc)
      per treated patient. Three dimensional digital photography utilizing the Vectra 3D System
      (Canfield) will be utilized to document pre-treatment status, sites of injection, and
      post-treatment effect. Subjects will be followed up at 1 week, 2 week, 4 week, day 90, and
      day 180 time points. At the Day 180 time point, every subject will be given the option to
      receive touch up and balancing treatments to both cheeks.
