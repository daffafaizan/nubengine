    
      The primary outcome for this study will be cranial index and cranial symmetry measured at
      hospital discharge; the secondary outcome measure is the incidence of oxygen desaturation
      events (apnea, bradycardia and oxygen desaturation).

      The pilot study was undertaken to evaluate if the cranial cup can be successfully
      incorporated into the NICU patient care regime, the pilot study included 5 infants.

      The main trial enrollment was estimated to be 160 infants from 4 centers. Upon enrollment
      infants will be randomized to one of two study groups

        -  Cranial cup and moldable positioner

        -  Moldable positioner

      Inclusion criteria:

      There are several inclusion criteria for participation in the study:

        1. Infants born at >/= 22 weeks gestation

        2. Infant that are </= 7 days of age

        3. Infants that receive medical clearance from their healthcare team

        4. Infants that have an estimated minimum NICU length of stay = / > 14 days from the time
           of enrollment

      Infants were stratified by study site and weight at enrollment (< 1000 grams versus = / >
      1000 grams).
