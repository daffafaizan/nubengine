      fractures. Subjects are randomly assigned to acupuncture group, laser acupuncture group or
      sham laser acupuncture group with a 1:1:1 ratio. The intervention will be performed on the
      consecutive three day after allocation. Bilateral LI4 (Hegu), SJ6 (Zhigou), ST36 (Zusanli)
      and GB34 (Yanglingquan) are used for each group. The traditional acupuncture group will be
      performed by inserting needles to a depth of 15-35 mm and last for 15 min. The laser
      acupuncture will be performed with the gallium aluminum arsenide LaserPen, which delivered
      0.375 J of energy at each of the acupoints. Subjects in the control group underwent sham
      laser acupuncture treatment without any laser output. The acupuncture points, application
      duration, and total number of treatments were similar to those in the laser acupuncture
      group.
