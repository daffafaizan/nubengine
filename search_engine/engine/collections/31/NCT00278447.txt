      to the treatment of chronic medical illnesses that addresses individual patient and health
      systems barriers to receipt of needed treatment. The objective of this Addiction Health
      Evaluation And Disease management (AHEAD) Study is to test the effectiveness of CDM for
      substance dependence in primary care. The study will enroll and randomize subjects to attend
      a substance dependence CDM program (the AHEAD Unit) integrated into a real-world primary care
      clinic or to referral to usual primary care. All subjects will be assessed regarding alcohol
      and/or drug diagnosis, consumption and problems, readiness to change, health-related quality
      of life, and medical and substance abuse treatment utilization. Primary outcomes are alcohol
      and drug use, alcohol and drug-related problems, emergency department visits, and
      hospitalizations. Additional outcomes are health-related quality of life, readiness to
      change, medical and psychiatric comorbidity, HIV risk behaviors, and treatment utilization
      and costs. The hypothesis is that compared with standard care, a health services intervention
      -- chronic disease management for alcohol and drug dependence integrated in primary care --
      will decrease alcohol and drug use and related problems, and improve health care utilization
      patterns.

      This study contains two studies (and study populations):

        -  1. 320 alcohol dependent subjects with current risky drinking, and

        -  2. 320 drug dependent subjects with current drug use.
