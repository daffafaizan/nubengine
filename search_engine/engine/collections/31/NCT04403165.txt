      associated with: first, CSF tau levels typical of preclinical stages of AD (Aim 1); second,
      reduced REM and spindle density (Aim 2); and third, impaired performance on attention tasks
      (Aim 3). The goal is to test the overarching hypothesis that LC dysfunction occurs in
      preclinical AD stages, can be measured with MRB-PET, and translates into impairment of sleep
      architecture (LC tonic dysfunction) and attention (LC phasic dysfunction).
