    
      The study is designed as a prospective observational study on the emergency department in
      Sonderborg, Southern Denmark.

      All patients above 18 years of age who have given their consent are included. Urinary
      dipstick and albumin creatinine ratio is obtained simultaneously within 48 hours after
      admission on the emergency department.

      Patient with a positive urinary dipstick will be asked to deliver another urinary dipstick
      and albumin creatinine ratio 3-8 weeks later.

      To our knowledge has the specificity and sensitivity of urinary dipstick for protein not been
      described, yet. Our design will give us the possibility not only to quantify specificity and
      sensitivity in the acute phase on the emergency department but in the non-acute phase after
      discharge from the emergency department, as well.
