      patients with metastatic cancer. II. Determine the quantitative and qualitative toxicity of
      LY231514 in combination with irinotecan in these patients. III. Assess plasma
      pharmacokinetics in these patients treated with this regimen. IV. Document any antitumor
      activity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive LY231514 IV over 10 minutes
      followed by irinotecan IV over 90 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the
      absence of disease progression and unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients each
      receive escalating doses of LY231514 and irinotecan. If escalation of one drug in the
      combination results in unacceptable dose limiting toxicity (DLT), the drug is not escalated
      further. Instead, the dose of that drug is decreased to its safe dose, and the second drug is
      escalated until unacceptable DLT results. If DLT occurs in 2 of up to 6 patients at any
      level, dose escalation is stopped. The maximum tolerated dose is defined as the highest dose
      at which fewer than 2 of 6 patients experience DLT during courses 1 or 2.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Up to 42 patients will be accrued for this study.
