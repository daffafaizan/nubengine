    
      Laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) surgery has been performed worldwide since 1990. More
      recently, customized corneal ablation utilizing wavefront-sensing technology to determine the
      optical aberration of a patient's cornea has optimized LASIK surgery results. Prior to the
      introduction of wavefront-guided laser vision correction, the variables used for correcting
      refractive errors were limited to sphere and cylinder. With the introduction of wavefront
      laser vision correction surgeons are now able to provide individualized laser-induced corneal
      tissue resection based not only on sphere and cylinder measurements, but also on an attempt
      to treat 3rd through 6th higher-order aberrations (HOAs) utilizing Zernike polynomial
      wavefront reconstructions and Fourier transformation.

      Advanced Medical Optics, Inc. (AMO) has recently introduced the Advanced CustomVue™ iLASIK
      procedure which utilizes the WaveScan WaveFront® System, a STAR S4 IR™ Excimer Laser System
      and IntraLase™ FS System technology to provide the broadest range of wavefront-guided FDA
      approved usages and an unprecedented level of precision and accuracy for patients undergoing
      LASIK surgery. The procedure leverages Iris Registration, Fourier algorithms, VSS™ and VRR™
      technologies and 3D ActiveTrak™ to ensure precise corneal ablation.1, 2
