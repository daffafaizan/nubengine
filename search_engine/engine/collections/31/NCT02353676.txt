      mandibular third molars requiring surgical removal under local anesthesia. 2% Lidocaine
      hydrochloride with epinephrine bitartrate 1: 80000 in 3ml quantity will be utilized to
      achieve local anesthesia at the surgical site on both quadrants. Additional supplementation
      postoperative at the surgical site will be provided with either 1.5 ml of 0.5% bupivacaine
      with 1:80000 epinephrine solution or saline based on a split mouth randomized study design
      using a color and number coded envelop. All procedures will be performed by a single surgeon
      using a similar technique, under identical conditions at one month apart intervals. Pain
      scores will be assessed by the patient based on a 10cm Visual Analog Scale at intervals of 2,
      4, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, 72, 96 and 120 hours. The duration of soft tissue anesthesia
      postoperatively will be recorded by the patient. The number of analgesics ingested over 120
      hours will be recorded by the patient. Results will be evaluated statistically by the
      Wilcoxon test and two tailed test to determine the ratio. Statistical significance will be
      considered at p < 0.05.
