      efficacy of drug eluting stent (DES) although polymer provides a reservoir for programmed
      drug release. Newer durable polymers may have enhanced biocompatibility and seem to be
      associated with improved clinical outcomes. However, they have still been incriminated in the
      occurrence of inflammation, neo-atherosclerosis, and thrombosis. Therefore, the investigators
      will evaluate the vascular tissue reaction after different kinds of DES implantation under
      the high thrombogenic circumstance of acute myocardial infarction (AMI).
