      inhibitor/Protein Kinase B (PI3K/AKT) mitogenic cascades are 2 upregulated cell signalling
      pathways in MG that contribute to several hallmark phenotypic features of these tumors.
      Regimen of Zactima + imatinib mesylate represents novel anti-glioma strategy because it
      targets 3 key mediators of dysregulated cell signalling involving VEGF & PI3K-AKT pathways
      including VEGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) & platelet derived growth
      factor(PDGFR). Furthermore by combining Zactima w imatinib mesylate, VEGF & PI3-k/AKT
      pathways can potentially inhibit multiple mediators of each of these pathways. Regarding
      PI3-K/AKT signalling, regimen can inhibit activation of EGFR & PDGFR. Regarding VEGF
      signalling, regimen has potential to inhibit 3 components of VEGFR directed angiogenesis.
      1st, Zactima can directly inhibit VEGFR activation. 2nd, both Zactima & imatinib mesylate can
      indirectly decrease activity of VEGF pathway by diminishing positive input from activated
      PI3-K/AKT signalling. 3rd, imatinib mesylate may inhibit PDGF-regulated pericyte maturation
      of tumor blood vessels.

      We have previously demonstrated that regimen of imatinib mesylate + hydroxyurea is active
      regimen among recurrent glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) pts. Furthermore this activity appears
      substantially better than that reported for imatinib mesylate alone. Although mechanism of
      enhanced activity for imatinib mesylate when combo w hydroxyurea is unclear, it is logical to
      build upon combo of imatinib mesylate + hydroxyurea in subsequent studies rather than
      imatinib mesylate alone. Current study will therefore determine MTD of Zactima when combo w
      standard doses of imatinib mesylate & hydroxyurea among RMG pts. Ph II study will then be
      performed, incorporating maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of Zactima + imatinib mesylate in order
      to evaluate anti-glioma potential of regimen.
