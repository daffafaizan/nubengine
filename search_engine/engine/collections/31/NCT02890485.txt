      function in those with patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS) of the knee. Variables of interest
      will include self-reported pain scores, self-reported functional outcome and disability
      questionnaire scores, and various objective clinical measures including muscle strength,
      joint range of motion, and movement patterns during basic tasks related to activities of
      daily living. Patients who are referred to physical therapy with PFPS will be recruited.
      Patients will be randomly and equally allocated into one of the following groups: 1. Gluteal
      dry needling (GLUTE) 2. Quadriceps dry needling (QUAD) 3. Sham gluteal dry needling (SHAM
      GLUTE) 4. Sham quadriceps dry needling (SHAM QUAD) 5. Control group (CONTROL) Groups 1-4 will
      receive 2 sessions of dry needling or sham dry needling to the gluteal and/or quadricpes
      muscles on their painful lower limb over 2 consecutive weeks in addition to standard physical
      therapy. The CONTROL group will only receive standard physical therapy. The sham treatment
      groups (groups 3-4) will receive a placebo treatment that does not penetrate the skin or
      muscles. Measurements will be performed at baseline prior to any physical therapy
      interventions and then at week 3.
