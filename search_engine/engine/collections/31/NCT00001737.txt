      patients, aggressive systemic immunosuppressive therapy fails to control inflammation and can
      lead to serious side effects. Oral Cyclosporin A (CsA) has been shown in several human trials
      to be effective in treating chronic uveitis. This pilot study will assess the safety, and to
      some extent efficacy, of a novel intraocular CsA release implant in patients with active
      inflammation and poor visual acuity in one eye despite immunosuppressant therapy. Patients
      will be randomly assigned to receive in one eye a 1 or 2 mg CsA implant releasing at either
      0.8 microgram per day or 1.4 microgram per day respectively. The main purpose of the study is
      to assess the safety of the CsA implant. Secondary outcomes will include a change from
      baseline in the ocular inflammation, visual acuity, and the need for concomitant
      anti-inflammatory medications.
