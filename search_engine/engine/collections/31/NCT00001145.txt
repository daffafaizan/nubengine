      administration of recombinant human CD40 ligand (rhuCD40L) in up to 5 patients with X-linked
      hyper IgM syndrome (XHIM). XHIM is a rare genetic disease caused by mutations in the gene
      encoding CD40 ligand (CD154) and is characterized by hypogammaglobulinemia, opportunistic
      infections, and an increased risk of neoplastic disease. Despite treatment with intravenous
      gamma globulin, the expected survival of patients with XHIM is less than 20% by the age of
      25. The proposed protocol is a proof of principle study designed to determine if
      administration of rhuCD40L can reverse the core immunologic defects of patients with XHIM. To
      this end, we will immunize patients with neo antigens, specifically keyhole limpet hemocyanin
      (KLH) and Bacteriophage Phi-X 174 (PhiX174) to evaluate antigen-specific B and T cell
      responses. Clinical response and toxicity will be evaluated using routine hematological and
      clinical evaluation, quantitation of KLH and PhiX174 specific IgG in serum, measurement of
      proliferation and cytokine production to KLH simulation in vitro, and FACS analysis to
      quantitate memory B and T cells. Our long-term goal is to define a therapeutic regimen that
      will provide effective immunological reconstitution to patients with XHIM and improve life
      expectancy.
