    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Assess the activity of paclitaxel and sargramostim (GM-CSF), in terms of objective
           clinical response rate (complete response [CR] and partial response [PR]), in patients
           with advanced unresectable melanoma.

      Secondary

        -  Evaluate the duration of response, time to progression, and overall survival of patients
           treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine serum cytokine levels (GM-CSF, IFN-Î³, aldesleukin, recombinant interleukin-4,
           and IL-10) in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.

      Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 1 and sargramostim (GM-CSF) subcutaneously
      on days 4-17. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving complete response (CR) receive 2
      additional courses of therapy beyond CR for up to 12 courses.

      After study treatment, patients are followed every 3-6 months for at least 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 42 patients will accrued for this study.
