      Geographic atrophy is the advanced form of dry age-related macular degeneration, and
      currently has no effective therapy. Little is known about the risk factors that drive the
      progression of geographic atrophy, and yet they are crucial to understand the mechanisms of
      the disease. Therefore, the identification of risk factors associated with a faster spread of
      atrophy may help contribute to identify the causes of the disease and, ultimately, to develop
      new therapeutic strategies to manage the disorder.

      The current prospective, observational, natural history study has the following objectives:

        -  Describe the natural history of geographic atrophy in anatomic and visual terms

        -  Identify risk factors associated with a faster enlargement of atrophy

      The main hypothesis is that lipofuscin accumulation at the borders of atrophy as seen with
      fundus autofluorescence imaging is associated with a faster progression of the disease.
