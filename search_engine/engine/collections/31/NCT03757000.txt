    
      This is a two-part study comprised of a dose escalation part and a dose expansion part.

      In the dose escalation part single patient cohorts will be dosed until a single related
      toxicity of Grade â‰¥ 3 or a Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) is observed. If this occurs, the
      study will switch to a conventional oncology 3+3 design (3 patients per dose cohort, with the
      potential to add an additional 3 patients if toxicity is observed) and escalation will
      continue until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is reached and a recommended Phase II (RP2D)
      dose is determined. Once the MTD is established a separate dose expansion part will enroll up
      total additional 12 patients at the RP2D.

      In this clinical trial, YY-20394 is given orally once daily. A treatment cycle is defined as
      28 days. YY-20394 was given until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal
      from the study. The protocol was initiated with a single-patient cohort, treated with oral
      YY-20394 20 mg once daily (QD). Subsequent cohorts used a 3+3 design and evaluated doses of
      40-320mg QD. Adverse events (AEs) were graded by NCI-CTCAE v4.0. Efficacy was assessed
      according to IWG-NHL and CLL consensus response criteria.
