      medical treatment decreases pain for patients with chronic nonspecific low back pain.

      This goal will be evaluated at 3 months by comparing

        -  the 3-month change in the level of pain observed in arm 3 (classical medical treatment +
           osteopathic treatment) versus that observed in arm 1 (classical medical treatment), and

        -  the 3-month change in the level of pain observed in arm 3 (classical medical treatment +
           osteopathic treatment) versus that observed in arm 2 (classical medical treatment+ sham
           osteopathic treatment ).
