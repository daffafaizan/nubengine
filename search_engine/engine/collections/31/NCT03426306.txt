      Tomography-ventilation (4DCT-ventilation) imaging and post-surgical lung function. To
      determine whether 4DCT-ventilation is a better predictor of post-surgical lung function than
      nuclear medicine imaging using pulmonary function tests (PFTs). To determine whether
      4DCT-ventilation is a better predictor of post-surgical lung function than nuclear medicine
      imaging using quality of life (QOL) questionnaires. Evaluate cost-effectiveness of using
      4DCT-ventialtion and VQ scans for pre-surgical assessment. To use longitudinal (pre and
      post-surgical) 4DCT-ventilation imaging to derive novel post-surgical prediction formulas.
