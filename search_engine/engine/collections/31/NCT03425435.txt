      quality of life questionnaire.

      Patients will be recruited at the participating hospital by their treating physician before
      discharge and will continue their study participation after discharge.

      The documentation period for the individual patients will be 3 months.

      The questions of the patientÂ´s questionnaire cover areas of interest like: satisfaction with
      discharge management, nutrition, satisfaction with HPN.
