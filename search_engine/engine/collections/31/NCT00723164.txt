      Each group received either a NaCL placebo (NaCl), or a premedication consisting of fentanyl
      0,6 ug/kg and midazolam 9 ug/kg (FM), five minutes before tidal volume sevoflurane 8%
      induction with 6 L/min O2. Times to LER and LMA insertion were recorded. Adverse events were
      also noted. Systolic blood pressure (sBP), heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR) and tidal
      volume (Vt) were recorded at one-minute intervals. End-tidal sevoflurane (EtSevo) and
      end-tidal CO2 (EtCO2) were noted immediately following LMA insertion. Anxiety levels (0-10
      verbal scale) were registered before and after premedication. Patients were contacted 24
      hours postoperatively and were asked if they remembered the mask being applied to their face.
