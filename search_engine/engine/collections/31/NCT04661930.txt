      COVID-19 infected patients requiring inpatient hospital admission. Open-label patients will
      be matched at least 1:10 with observational retrospective Propensity score-matched (PSM)
      patients' medical files. The double-blinded step will be randomized 2:1 to daily Fenofibrate
      or placebo for 10 days or hospital discharge.
