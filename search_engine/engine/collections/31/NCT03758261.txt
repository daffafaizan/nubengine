      Multimodal analgesia for thoracic surgery is key to allow faster recovery and diminish
      postoperative complications. Paravertebral nerve blocks as well as epidurals are among the
      regional anesthetic techniques utilized for these procedures. Recently, a newer technique,
      the erector spinae plane block, has been used and described to be effective in treating pain
      for patients undergoing thoracic surgery. At UPMC, the investigators have had clinically
      significant pain control for thoracic surgery with both types of blocks. The previous case
      reports/series and our clinical observation has led us to propose this study of comparing the
      clinical efficacy of erector spinae plane block vs. paravertebral nerve block.

      Though ESP and paravertebral blocks have been documented to be efficacious for this
      procedure, there has been no direct comparison between the two approaches. The ESP block is
      considered to be a safer technique with less theoretical adverse events possible and thus,
      would become a viable alternative to the more technically challenging paravertebral nerve
      block. If ESP is found to be superior or non-inferior to paravertebral in terms of pain
      management and safety, this would be a major finding, as ESP is considered safer and
      technically easier to perform than paravertebral nerve block.

      Study design and methods

      The investigators present a prospective randomized trial comparing the efficacy of continuous
      paravertebral nerve blocks vs. ESP blocks for video assisted thoracoscopy surgery (VATS) at
      UPMC Passavant.
