      closed surgical incisions. This research is being done because incisional negative pressure
      wound therapy is a new application of negative pressure wound therapy that is applied over a
      closed incision area instead of an open wound. Negative pressure wound therapy is commonly
      used to help heal open wounds. It involves the use of a piece of foam, an adhesive drape, and
      a battery-powered device that places negative pressure on the wound. Currently, there are no
      trials utilizing incisional negative pressure wound therapy of closed wounds after below knee
      amputations (BKA), transmetatarsal amputations (TMA), Knee Disarticulations (KD), and Above
      Knee Amputations (AKA). This is a pilot study that compares incisional negative pressure
      wound therapy and standard dressings in patients.
