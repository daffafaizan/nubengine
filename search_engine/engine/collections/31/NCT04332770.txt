    
      A prospective observational cohort study including two groups.

      Hypothyroid group:

      Patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma underwent total thyroidectomy Patients who are
      planned to withdraw their levothyroxine for radioactive iodine therapy Biosignals will be
      monitored continuously using Fitbit devices

      Control group:

      Patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma underwent total thyroidectomy Patients who are
      planned to get rhTSH (not to withdraw their levothyroxine) for radioactive iodine therapy
      Biosignals will be monitored continuously using Fitbit devices Thyroid hormone levels and
      continuously collected bio signals including activity, heart rate, and sleep data will be
      obtained during study period.

      Association between thyroid status and bio signals will be investigated.
