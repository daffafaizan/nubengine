        -  Describe the motivations, perceptions, and expectations of patients enrolled in a phase
           I clinical trial.

        -  Assess the influence of age, education, and gender upon the perception of these
           patients.

        -  Compare the difference in perceptions, motivations, and expectations of patients who
           have previously participated in a phase I clinical trial vs those who have not.

        -  Determine whether patients' perceptions, motivations, and expectations change while
           enrolled in a phase I clinical trial.

        -  Validate an interviewer-administered tool measuring the perceptions, motivations, and
           expectations of these patients.

        -  Assess patients' perception of the information they were given while enrolled in a phase
           I clinical trial.

      OUTLINE: Patients are interviewed over the phone to evaluate their perceptions, motivations,
      and expectations of phase I clinical trials. Patients complete a questionnaire comprising 24
      questions over 30-45 minutes. Interviews are conducted within 1 week after enrolling in a
      phase I clinical trial (prior to the first dose of study agent) and then again 2 months later
      (or at the time the patient stops treatment). The first 10 patients enrolled complete an
      additional 6 questions over 15 minutes during the first interview to validate the
      questionnaire, but do not complete a second interview.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 120 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.
