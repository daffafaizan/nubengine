      intratumoral injection of dendritic cell (DC). Patients received 5,040 centigray (cGy) EBRT
      in 28 equal fractions. Radiation was delivered 5 days per week (Monday-Friday). DCs (10^7
      cells) were injected intratumorally three times on the second, third, and fourth Friday
      during the course of radiation. One additional DC injection was given several days before
      surgery to assess DC migration. Tumors were surgically resected 3-6 weeks after the
      completion of EBRT.
