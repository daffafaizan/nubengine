      in infancy, but suboptimal nutrition still persists. In one study, 60% of infants diagnosed
      by NBS achieved their birth weight percentile by two years of age, while 40% did not. The
      many factors that contribute to this poor growth have not been defined and persist despite
      pancreatic enzyme supplementation. Although published guidelines for the clinical management
      of infants with cystic fibrosis in the U.S. and Europe exist, there is an alarming scarcity
      of evidence to dictate care. In order to proceed with large scale randomized studies to
      evaluate the range of interventions for infants with CF, we need to not only develop precise
      techniques for measuring growth but also pursue unexplored factors that may contribute to
      poor growth.

      This is a multi-center observational clinical study with a nested interventional PERT
      sub-study. The observational study was designed to follow in a prospective manner incident
      cases of CF for up to 12 months. The PERT sub-study is a randomized, double-blind, crossover
      sub-study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of two doses of PERT (pancreatic
      enzyme replacement therapy) for improving coefficient of fat absorption (CFA) in the stool of
      infants with CF. The PERT sub-study was unable to enroll and closed. No results available.
