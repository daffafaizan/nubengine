      the automated bed will be applied in order to induce a change in the sleeping position. Two
      approaches to influence the position will be investigated:

        1. Lifting the upper body up, which has been suggested as a method for reducing habitual
           snoring. This intervention will be provided by an adjustable bed (AmbianceE-Motion,
           manufactured by Elite SA, Aubonne, Switzerland) referred to as ISABel Bed 1. This bed
           contains four motors for changing the inclination angle of the head, trunk, leg, and
           foot support. Only the position of the trunk and head support is changed during the
           study. The inclination angle is set to the maximum inclination angle the bed allows:
           this is 50° at the slatted frame which results in approximately 40° inclination of the
           hip of the user. The reference angle (0°) is represented by the supine position.

        2. Inclination of one side of the bed. This intervention will be provided with a
           custom-made, adjustable bed base prototype, referred to as ISABel Bed 2 (produced by
           Sensory-Motor Systems Lab, ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland). The bed is equipped with
           two motors which allow sideward inclination of up to 40 °. The inclination to be applied
           in this study is set to 30 ° based on a pre-study with healthy human subjects. Both beds
           are equipped with non-invasive, cable-free sensors (cardio-ballistography, microphone,
           and force sensor). A closed-loop control algorithm, which has been developed using
           machine learning techniques, continuously monitors these signals and triggers the
           positional intervention, when it detects that the participant is experiencing an apnoea
           event.
