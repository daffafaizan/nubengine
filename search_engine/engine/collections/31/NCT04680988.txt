    
      This is a randomized, open-label, 3-arm Phase 2 study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      SHR-1210 alone or with SHR-1020 versus physician's choice chemotherapy in recurrent or
      metastatic cervical cancer patients. All enrolled patients will be randomly divided into 3
      groups and receive treatment until disease progression, intolerable toxicity，any criterion
      for stopping the study drug or SHR-1210 treatment for up to 2 years.The primary study
      hypotheses are that the combination of SHR-1210 plus SHR-1020 is superior to SHR-1210 or
      physician's choice chemotherapy with respect to: 1) Progression free survival(PFS) in
      recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer patients(SHR-1210+SHR-1020 versus SHR-1210；2) Overall
      survival(OS) in recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer patients(SHR-1210+SHR-1020 versus
      Physician's choice chemotherapy).
