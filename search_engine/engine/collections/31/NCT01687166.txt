      trial is designed to demonstrate that the safety and effectiveness of the BlazerÂ®
      Open-Irrigated Ablation Catheter are non-inferior to the safety and effectiveness of the
      control catheters, for the treatment drug refractory, recurrent, symptomatic, paroxysmal
      atrial fibrillation. The control catheters are open-irrigated radiofrequency ablation
      catheters that are approved in the United States for the treatment of drug refractory
      recurrent symptomatic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, when used with compatible
      three-dimensional electroanatomic mapping systems.
