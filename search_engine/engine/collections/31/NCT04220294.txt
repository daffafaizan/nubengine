      emergent cesarean section will receive an explanation regarding the study and sign informed
      consent. Patients will then be divided randomly to one of 2 treatment groups based on the
      type of subcutaneous tissue closure:

        1. Interrupted sutures.

        2. Continuous sutures. Information regarding medical and obstetric history will be
           collected for each patient.
