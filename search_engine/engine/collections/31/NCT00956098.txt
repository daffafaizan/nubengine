      cancer chemopreventive agent. Comprehensive mechanistic and phase IIa studies supported the
      notion that oltipraz exerts chemopreventive effects, as supported by Phase IIa human clinical
      studies of oltipraz on cancer chemoprevention, conducted in Qidong, China. Hepatic stellate
      cells cause synthesis of large quantities of extracellular matrix. Transforming growth factor
      beta1 (TGF-beta1), as a key fibrogenic mediator for fibrogenesis after injuries through
      deposition of extracellular matrix and inhibition of collagenase activity in the liver, is
      associated with the regulation of cell growth and differentiation and causes synthesis of
      extracellular matrix proteins and cellular receptors for matrix proteins. Previously, we
      reported the effectiveness of oltipraz in regeneration of cirrhotic liver, which includes
      reduction of the intensities of liver fibrotic and cirrhotic nodules, elimination of
      accumulated extracellular matrix, and regeneration of cirrhotic liver in animal models.
      Oltipraz completely resolves fibrosis in the cirrhotic liver, thereby improving viability.
      TGF-beta1 signaling plays an important role in liver fibrogenesis and cirrhosis as evidenced
      by receptor knockout experiments. No therapeutic agent that is active in interrupting
      TGF-beta1 signaling is available, proposing that C/EBP serve as a molecular target for the
      treatment of liver cirrhosis.
