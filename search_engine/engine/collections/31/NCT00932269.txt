      Vaccine related objectives:

        -  To estimate the seroprevalence regarding vaccine preventable diseases in the cohort of
           children about to enter adulthood (as a "receipt" of the vaccination program's
           functionality), and thereby form a basis for decision-making regarding recommendations
           about continuous vaccination in adult age

        -  To evaluate the concentration of antibodies that full-term newborns receive from their
           mothers, and to estimate plausible consequences to optimize the schedule of the NIP for
           each vaccine preventable disease

        -  To, in different age groups, evaluate changes over time and concentration of antibodies
           compared to a study conducted in 1997

        -  To evaluate plausible changes in the seroprevalence, for instance among children,
           related to an increased use of combined vaccines

        -  To document the age-specific seroprevalence against other diseases that will be vaccine
           preventable before start-up of new vaccination program

        -  To estimate the population seroprevalence against certain diseases against which
           vaccines have been developed during recent years and that might be introduced into the
           vaccination program within a couple of decades

      Method:

        -  Adults: one blood sample of 10 mL blood from vein in arm from each individual

        -  Children: one blood sample of 5-10 mL blood from vein or capillary in arm from each
           individual

        -  Cord blood: one blood sample of 10 mL cord blood will be collected from each newborn in
           connection with childbirth

      The objectives of the sub study are:

        -  To conduct the same type of analysis on foreign born 14-16 year olds as on 14-16 year
           olds being born in Sweden

        -  To also examine the immunity and infection situation with regard to Hepatitis B

        -  To conduct the corresponding examinations and priorities among the 14-16 year olds born
           in Sweden serving as control group
