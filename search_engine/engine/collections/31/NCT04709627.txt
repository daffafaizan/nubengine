    
      Eligible subjects from the study will be recruited from patients with scheduled surgeries.
      After being informed about the study and potential risks, patients given informed consent
      will undergo scheduled surgery with the use of enFlow IV Fluid and Blood Warming System. The
      following temperature measurements will be collected during surgery:

        -  Baseline temperature measurement (0-15 minutes prior to induction)

        -  Induction temperature measurements (15 minutes, 30 minutes, 60 minutes, 90 minute
           post-induction)

        -  Continued temperature measurements (every 30 minutes, plus end of surgery)

        -  OR ambient temperature at induction and end of surgery.

      Temperature will be measured and collected post-surgery upon arrival to the PACU and 30
      minutes post-arrival.
