      members after genetic counseling. Genetic linkage analysis is performed on these blood
      samples. Unaffected individuals undergo x-rays and technetium bone scans to detect the
      presence of bone disease. Affected individuals undergo bone densitometry, MRI studies,
      thallium scans, ophthalmologic examination, electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, and skin
      biopsies.

      Affected family members identified after radiologic studies receive additional genetic
      counseling.
