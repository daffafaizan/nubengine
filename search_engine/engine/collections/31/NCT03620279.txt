      a "Magic Camp" on the improvement in upper limb motor function, health-related quality of
      life, and emotional stress among children with spastic hemiplegic CP. After the baseline
      evaluation, eligible participants will complete one-on-one "magic trick" training 3-hours per
      day for 2 consecutive weeks. The primary outcome measures will be unimanual function as
      measured by the Jebsen Taylor Test of Hand Function, bimanual coordination as measured by
      kinematic parameters using motion analysis, and spontaneous use of the more affected limb in
      real-life activities that demand the use of both hands as measured by the Children's Hand
      Experience Questionnaire. Secondary outcome measures will include HRQoL as measured by the
      Cerebral Palsy Quality of Life Questionnaire, in-depth dyad qualitative interviews of the
      caregivers and children, and emotional stress as measured by the fingernail cortisol levels.
