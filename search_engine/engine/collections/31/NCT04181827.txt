    
      Multiple myeloma is a malignant plasma cell disorder diagnosed annually in approximately
      86,000 participants worldwide. JNJ-68284528 is an autologous chimeric antigen receptor T-cell
      (CAR-T) therapy that targets B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA), a molecule expressed on the
      surface of mature B lymphocytes and malignant plasma cells. The primary hypothesis for this
      study is that JNJ-68284528 will significantly improve progression free survival (PFS)
      compared with standard therapy (PVd or DPd), in participants who have previously received 1
      to 3 prior line(s) of therapy, that included a proteasome inhibitor (PI) and an
      immunomodulatory drug (IMiD) and who are refractory to lenalidomide. This study will be
      conducted in 3 phases: Screening (up to 28 days before randomization), Treatment, and
      Follow-Up. Assessment like patient-reported outcome(s) (PROs) assessments, electrocardiogram
      (ECG), vital signs, pharmacokinetic will be performed during the study. Safety evaluations
      will include review of adverse events, laboratory test results, vital sign measurements,
      physical examination findings, and assessments of cardiac function, Immune Effector
      Cell-associated Encephalopathy (only for Arm B) and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
      performance status. Safety data will be periodically reviewed by an Independent Data
      Monitoring Committee (IDMC). The duration of the study is approximately 6 years.
