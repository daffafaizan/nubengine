      aggressive or futile care. Despite this, more than half of Americans die in a hospital.
      Advance directives provide the opportunity to provide, in advance, one's wishes for end of
      life care, however their completion rates are low. The overall objective of this project is
      to assess if an active choice intervention can increase AD completion rates. Eligible
      participants for this study will be all new employees of the University of Pennsylvania
      Health System (UPHS) who need to complete their online employment paperwork via the On
      Boarding portal. Participants will have an advanced health care planning task programmed as
      part of their On Boarding online employment paperwork. Upon selection of the task, each
      participant will be directed a designated Advance Healthcare Planning (AHCP) website.
      Participants will be randomized into either the active choice or control arm of the study and
      proceed through steps to complete or not complete an AD according to the decision making
      process of the given study arm. All participants in both groups will have access to
      additional online and telephone resources thought the entire study for any questions.
      Participants in the active choice group will be given directions stating they are required to
      complete either the advanced directive or the declination form in order to complete their On
      Boarding process. Participants in the control group will be given directions stating that
      completion of the AD is optional.
