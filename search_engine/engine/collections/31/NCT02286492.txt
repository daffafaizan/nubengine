      availability for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who have been previously treated
      with, or are not candidates for fluoropyrimidine-, irinotecan-, and oxaliplatin-based
      chemotherapy, an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy, and an
      anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) therapy.

      Serious adverse event information (whether or not related to TAS-102) as well as reports of
      pregnancy, overdose, or medication error will reported. In addition, all grades of adverse
      drug reactions (ADRs, adverse events related to study medication) and any adverse event that
      results in treatment discontinuation will be recorded as study data on CRFs.
