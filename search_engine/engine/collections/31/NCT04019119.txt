      ad hoc in health products. Attempts to incorporate game concepts into digital health
      applications have not led to demonstrated success. Recent studies have shown that only 4% of
      the best rated health apps in Apple stores and Google Play (based on revenue and download)
      have gamification elements, but less than 5% of these health apps have been included in the
      application library of National Health Service. In addition, very little of 5% was developed
      for industry and health professionals.

      If the power of digital technologies, such as games for clear clinical benefits, is not
      released, opportunities for social and economic burial will be lost for all stakeholders in
      the digital health and digital economy ecosystem.

      A number of factors in this barrier:

        -  The best techniques for the design of activities. The majority of health gamification
           has little consistent support of health or clinical theories.

        -  The high cost and complexity of the digital game development process. The majority of
           gaming functions are based on best practices in the development of digital games.

        -  Little participation of researchers in health, professionals and participation of the
           end user in the process of gamification development. Very little health gamification is
           formally evaluated clinically.

      The initial hypothesis is that after 12 weeks of participation in the original iGAME
      application, participants will increase the quantity and distribution of energy consumption,
      through the estimation of results, data based on acceleration and questionnaires. automatic
      information In addition, it will also improve satisfaction and lifestyle, as well as the
      consumption of health services.
