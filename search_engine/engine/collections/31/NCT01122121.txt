      to treat people who have prostate cancer. This study will look at the overall survival of
      people who take leuprorelin SR in addition to radiation therapy compared to those who take
      only leuprorelin SR.

      The study will enroll approximately 273 patients. Participants will be randomly assigned to
      one of the two treatment groups.

        -  Combined Radiotherapy and Hormone Therapy

        -  Hormone Therapy alone. All participants will receive leuprorelin injection every 3
           months and flutamide tablets thrice daily for first 30 days as part of hormone therapy.
           Participants randomized to combined radiotherapy and hormone therapy group, will also
           receive radiotherapy 70 +/- 4 Gy in 35 fractions at a rate of 5 fractions of 2 Gy per
           week.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in France and Tunisia. The overall time to
      participate in this study is 8 years. The scheduled duration of hormone therapy was 3 years
      in both arms, with an additional treatment-free follow-up period of 2 years i.e. a total
      follow-up period of 5 years. Post-protocol collection of information relative to survival
      will be performed after the end the 5-year follow-up period.
