      given with induction and concurrent chemotherapy in HPV-positive oropharynx, unknown primary
      or nasopharynx cancer. Eligible, consented and registered patients will receive three cycles
      of Docetaxel Cisplatin and 5-FU (TPF) induction chemotherapy. After 3 cycles, the patients
      will be assessed for clinical, radiographic and pathologic response to TPF. Patients with a
      clinical or radiographic CR or PR will be randomized on the second phase of this study, where
      patients will undergo a 2:1 randomization to reduced (5600 cGy) or standard (7000 cGy) dose
      radiotherapy with weekly Carboplatin. Patients not meeting the response criteria will be
      treated with standard dose CRT. Patients not completing 3 cycles TPF for reasons of toxicity,
      progressive disease, choice, or other medical necessity will be treated with standard dose
      CRT or surgery depending on their primary site and overall medical condition and followed for
      survival. Toxicity will be assessed by Symptom scores, QOL and SAE monitoring. The primary
      end point of the trial is equivalent local regional control and PFS at 3 years. Patients will
      be followed for 5 years.
