      order to reduce or eliminate the need for opioid pain medications. Reductions in pain and
      edema along with improvements in range of motion encourage quicker recovery of joint function
      and normal activities. Pulsed radio frequency (PRF), a type of electromagnetic field
      treatment is proven to effectively modulate postoperative pain and edema in plastic surgery.
      Therefore, PRF has potential as an adjunct therapy for patients recovering from TKA.

      The purpose of the current double-blind, randomized, sham-controlled clinical trial is to
      determine the effectiveness and safety of the Ivivi Torino II, a device that delivers pulsed
      radio frequency (PRF), a type of electromagnetic field treatment, in patients recovering from
      TKA for treatment of severe knee OA.
