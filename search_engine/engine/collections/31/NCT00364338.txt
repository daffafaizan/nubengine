      gourmet medical cooking workshop. The workshop will consist of 9 lessons with the following
      lessons: introduction, fats, phytoestrogens, carbohydrates and fibers, calcium and low
      calorie diet, party's recipes, shopping and farewell dinner. All the lessons will start with
      half an hour theoretical introduction, followed by a 2.5 hours "hands on" session under
      supervision of a medical chef. The study population will include healthy women attending the
      menopause clinic. 72 patients will be recruited and will be randomly divided into two groups:
      an intervention group of 36 will commence the workshop during 2007 and a control group of 36
      who will take part in dietitian consulting sessions only. During 2008 the control group will
      commence the workshop and will add to the study group.
