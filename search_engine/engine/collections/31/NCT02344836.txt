      behaviors (exercise, diet, etc.) and provide social support which has the potential to play a
      powerful role in health promotion. The objective of this study is to refine and pilot test
      the Social POD app for personalized health monitoring and interaction founded on a
      combination of social networks, recommender systems, motivational research, and health
      behavior theory. Currently, we are recruiting for usability testing among obese and
      overweight (BMI >25 kg/m2) adults (n=20) with our basic Social POD app. Our proposed project,
      which seeks to supplement our current line of research investigating mHealth interventions
      for overweight and obese adults, has two aims:

      Aim 1: Refine our intelligent social agent mobile app (Social POD) based on results from our
      usability testing and develop new components (i.e., incentive system) for use in a 3-month
      randomized controlled pilot trial (RCT).

      Aim 2: Conduct a 3-month pilot RCT among overweight and obese adults (N=150) comparing a
      theory-based podcast (TBP) plus self-monitoring using a commercially-available calorie and
      weight tracking app (current most popular diet self-monitoring method)9 versus TBP plus
      self-monitoring and social support/incentive points for participating with the Social POD app
      (TBP+Social POD).

      Once the final intervention is developed through Aim 1 including the incentive system, we
      will recruit 150 overweight adult Android smartphone owners (BMI 25-49.9 kg/m2; age 18-65;
      >30% AA) to participate in a 3-month pilot of our enhanced intervention. Detecting
      differences in weight among the two groups is our primary research goal.
