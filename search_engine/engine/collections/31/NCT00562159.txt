    
      This is a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study in
      participants 18 to 65 years of age, of either sex, and of any race with a history of grass
      pollen induced rhinoconjunctivitis with or without asthma. While receiving treatment,
      participants will receive either grass sublingual tablet or placebo. Open-label rescue
      medications for the hinoconjunctivitis and asthma symptoms will be provided. Participants
      will visit the study site for at least 12 visits. A total of 10 allergic symptoms, 6
      rhinoconjunctivitis and 4 lung symptoms, will be recorded daily on an electronic diary by the
      participant.

      The start and end of the grass pollen season (GPS) was determined based on the regional grass
      pollen count, and lasted up to 162 days. For each region, the GPS is defined as the first day
      of 3 consecutive recorded days with a grass pollen count of ≥ 10 grains/m^3, to the last day
      of the last occurrence of 3 consecutive recorded days with a grass pollen count ≥ 10
      grains/m^3, inclusively.
