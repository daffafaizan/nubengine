    
      In this double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 300 patients are randomized to 1 or 2 reverse
      transcriptase inhibitors of their choice plus blinded therapy on Arm A or B as follows:

      Arm A: DMP 266 placebo plus indinavir. Arm B: DMP 266 plus indinavir. After 16 weeks,
      patients may switch the NRTI portion of their regimen if they meet a treatment failure
      criterion. After the completion of the 24-week period, patients have the option to continue
      on open-label DMP 266 and indinavir.
