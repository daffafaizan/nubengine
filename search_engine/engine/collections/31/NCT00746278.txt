      benign ovarian cyst and has gained increasing acceptance among gynecological surgeons(1).
      However, the safety of this technique in terms of ovarian damage to the operated gonad caused
      by electrocoagulation has recently been questioned. Many evidences support that the removal
      of ovarian cysts is associated with an injury to ovarian reserve. On the contrary, some
      retrospective studies did not show adverse outcomes compared with the control group (tubal
      infertility) . There is a lack of good clinical and scientific evidence such as randomized
      controlled study to report definitively the impact of electrocoagulation on ovarian reserve
      after laparoscopic excision of ovarian cyst.
