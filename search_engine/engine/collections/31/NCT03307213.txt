    
      The BioFreedom™ QCA trial is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the BioFreedom™
      CoCr DCS coronary stent system compared to the Biofreedom™ stainless steel DCS coronary stent
      system, in a randomized controlled trial on an all-comers patient population.

      The primary objective is to measure non-inferiority of the BioFreedom™ CoCr stent compared to
      BioFreedom™ DCS as measured by the difference in angiographically measured late lumen loss at
      9 months, and the main secondary endpoint is to assess safety as measured by MACE and ST. Two
      hundred (200) patients will be randomized 1:1 to either stent, allowing for a direct
      comparison, and will be followed-up to 2 years to measure for late MACE and ST events.
