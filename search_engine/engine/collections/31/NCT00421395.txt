      patient had prior high-dose chemotherapy with a marrow or stem cell transplant. Patients with
      both indolent and aggressive types of NHL will be enrolled at each dose level without
      segregation. However, at the conclusion of the trial, with the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)
      defined, a minimum number of 6 patients with indolent NHL, 6 patients with aggressive NHL,
      and 6 patients with >25% bone marrow involvement will be studied at that dose level.
