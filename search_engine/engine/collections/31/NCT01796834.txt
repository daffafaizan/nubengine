      patients with diabetes on measures of HbA1c, blood pressure, perceived stress, depression,
      patient self-efficacy and quality of life. Feasibility will be assessed via: a) the interest
      of patients in taking part in an MBSR program; c) the effectiveness of strategies for
      recruiting patients with diabetes into the study; d) rates of participant compliance with the
      MBSR; and, e) patient compliance with the program evaluation plan.

      Estimate the effect of a MBSR program for patients with diabetes. It is expected that MBSR
      program participants will evidence a trend toward better clinical outcome measures of HbA1c,
      blood pressure, and standardized measures of diabetes self-management, perceived stress,
      depression, self-efficacy, and quality-of-life.

      Secondary Objective: To explore the experience of people with diabetes who participate in an
      MBSR course through the use of semi-structured interviews.
