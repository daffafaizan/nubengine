      chemotherapy is traditionally for locally advanced disease, converting an inoperable tumor to
      a resectable one.In the present study, investigators will focus on breast cancer patients
      whose primary tumors are large or have lymph node metastases and need to receive neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy from 2018 to 2019. Circulating tumor DNA(ctDNA) will be obtained from peripheral
      blood,and the blood samples will be taken before the neoadjuvant chemotherapy、during the
      chemotherapy、 before the surgery and post surgery visit (within 24 hours after surgery)
      .Investigators will collect tissue samples both from the breast lump biopsy and the curative
      surgery. Investigators aim to investigate whether circulating tumor DNA is a sensitive marker
      to monitor the efficacy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer.
