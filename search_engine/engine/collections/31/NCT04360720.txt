      dual antiplatelet therapy, which consists of the association of acetylsalicylic acid with an
      oral antagonist of platelet P2Y12 receptor. Clinical trials have shown that dual antiplatelet
      therapy reduces ischemic events, despite of increasing the risk of bleeding complications.
      Because dual antiplatelet therapy has a positive net effect, such an approach is currently
      recommended by international guidelines and recognized as the therapy of choice for acute
      coronary syndrome subjects. It is known that the acetylsalicylic acid dose is directly
      proportional to the bleeding risk. However, so far, all new antiplatelet drugs have been
      tested and used in association with acetylsalicylic acid for a varying period of time. This
      study is carried out in such context and intends to evaluate the clinical performance of new
      inhibitors of platelet P2Y12 receptor given solely, as monotherapy, to acute coronary
      syndrome patients, to test the hypothesis that an antithrombotic monotherapy with such agents
      (i.e., acetylsalicylic acid withdrawal) sustains efficacy by preventing ischemic
      complications while reducing the bleeding potential of this drug dosage regimens. It is a
      Phase-3, randomized, multicenter, parallel-group study with blind evaluation of endpoints and
      intention-to-treat analysis. Subjects with acute coronary syndrome treated with a successful
      percutaneous coronary intervention will be enrolled. The general purpose of the study is to
      test the non-inferiority hypothesis for ischemic events and the superiority hypothesis for
      bleeding events resulting from platelet P2Y12 receptor inhibitors given as monotherapy in
      comparison with conventional dual antiplatelet therapy in the context of the Unified Health
      System in Brazil.
