      misdiagnosed disorder termed cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS). As CVS is better understood,
      gastroenterologists are increasingly recognizing the importance of timely diagnosis and early
      management for this chronic and debilitating disorder. Currently, the only gold standard
      diagnostic strategy involves evaluating clinical criteria set by the Rome Foundation, such as
      vomiting frequency and duration of episodes. Outside of these subjective criteria, no
      definitive and objective diagnostic strategy for cyclic vomiting syndrome exists.

      Developing diagnostic strategies has been difficult given the exact etiology of CVS is still
      unknown. One physiologic theory includes rapid gastric emptying (GE)-or a dumping-like
      syndrome related to impaired gastric accommodation. A retrospective analysis observed rapid
      gastric emptying by standard 4-hour scintigraphic gastric emptying study in 80% of subjects,
      suggesting a relationship with CVS and rapid GE. In turn, rapid emptying has been
      hypothesized to relate with abnormal gastric accommodation - the reflex allowing storage of
      food through increased fundic volume. This physiologic abnormality can be readily and easily
      measured using non-invasive tools, but have never been tested in CVS. To explore this
      further, we aim to determine if CVS patients have abnormal gastric accommodation measured by
      nutrient drink test.
