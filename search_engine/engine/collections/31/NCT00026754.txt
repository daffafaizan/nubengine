    
      Background:

      -Patients and healthy volunteers who are being evaluated for NIH Intramural Research Program
      (IRP) protocols must be screened to determine whether they meet the eligibility criteria
      prior to enrollment.

      Objectives:

        -  Evaluate patient or healthy volunteer eligibility for participation in NIH IRP research
           protocols.

        -  Collect results of screening test for use on subsequent research protocols as baseline
           (e.g., pretreatment) values.

        -  Collect specific research samples required for the primary research protocol as part of
           a screening test or procedure in order to avoid from having to subject the patient to a
           painful procedure on multiple occasions.

      Eligibility:

      Patients and healthy volunteers who are being evaluated for and treated on protocols within
      the NIH IRP.

      Design:

        -  This protocol is not a research study of an investigational drug or device.

        -  Screening tests and procedures that are required by the primary research protocols are
           conducted in order to establish eligibility for these protocols.

        -  In some cases, specific research samples required for the primary research protocol may
           be collected during the screening process in order to avoid from having to subject the
           patient to a painful procedure on multiple occasions.

        -  Tissues and biological fluids that are obtained during the screening process will be
           stored.

        -  Once a patient or healthy volunteer completes the screening process and is either
           enrolled onto another NIH study or is returned to the care of their local physician they
           will be taken off study.
