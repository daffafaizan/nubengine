    
      A single-center, cohort clinical study. Subjects of both sexes aged 18 to 65 inclusive with
      genetically confirmed diagnosis of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type R2, who have signed
      the written informed consent form for this study.

      The control and case groups should be age- and gender-matched.

      Study Objectives:

        -  To evaluate a clinical status of a subject (MMT score; 6-minute walk test; North Star
           Assessment for dysferlinopathy (NSAD));

        -  To assess blood biochemistry;

        -  To characterize muscle involvement based on MRI results;

        -  To evaluate the progression of muscle involvement based on repeated MRI;

        -  To assess cardiac function with ECG, EchoCG and MRI;

        -  To determine a gait pattern and balance characteristics in patients with limb-girdle
           muscular dystrophy using electrophysiological techniques (Neurosoft Gait Assessment
           System Steadys; stabilometrics and plantography with "SIDAS");

        -  To characterize changes in subpopulation compositions of T- and B-lymphocytes,
           phagocytic activity of leukocytes (a phagocytic index, a phagocyte number, an index of
           phagocytosis completeness, lysosomal-cation and NBT tests);

        -  To assess average blood cytokine levels in subjects with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy
           (type R2) in various regions of the Russian Federation;

        -  To assess average blood cytokine levels in healthy subjects from various regions of the
           RF;

        -  To analyze the relationship between blood cytokine levels and the presence of a mutation
           in the dysferlin gene;

        -  To study the expression (immunohistochemistry and western-blotting) and distribution of
           dysferlin in impaired muscles of subjects with LGMDR2.

      The clinical study includes the stages as follows:

        1. Subject enrollment - 24 months

        2. Data collection and analysis - 12 months

        3. Study Report - 30 days.
