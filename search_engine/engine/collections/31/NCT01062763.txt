    
      The primary object of the study is to estimate the effect of addition of low dose
      spironolactone to antihypertensive treatment with at least three antihypertensive drugs in
      patients with type-2 diabetes and blood pressure over 130/80 mmHg.

      Secondary aims are to estimate how many of these patients have their blood pressure
      controlled by the addition of spironolactone, to investigate whether the addition of
      spironolactone affects insulin sensitivity and urinary protein secretion and to estimate the
      incidence of adverse effects of the aldosterone antagonist.
