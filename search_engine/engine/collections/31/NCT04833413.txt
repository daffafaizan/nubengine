      with type 2 diabetes, collect the basic information and biochemical information collection,
      including gender, age, duration of diabetes, intensive glucose-lowering treatment plan before
      treatment, diabetes complications, merger disease, smoking, drinking, height, weight, blood
      pressure, fasting glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin and glycosylated serum protein, insulin,
      c-peptide, liver and kidney function, blood lipid, blood routine, hypoglycemia is happening
      almost 1 month. Follow-up was conducted in January, March and June. Endocrinologists decide
      whether to continue the original hypoglycemic regimen or adjust it according to the glycemic
      control goals, islet Î²-cell function, diabetes complications, complications, hypoglycemia and
      other combination drugs, as well as patients' treatment willingness and compliance. To
