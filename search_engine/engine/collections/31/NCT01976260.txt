      acne scars on at least one 2 x 2 cm area on each side of face. Subjects will be randomly
      assigned to receive fractional radiofrequency treatment to either the right or left side of
      the face and the contralateral side will receive 1550-nm fractional photothermolysis.
      Subjects will receive treatments at baseline, week 4, and week 8 for a total of three
      treatments. Follow up visits will take place at week 16, two months following the last
      treatment visit. This study is a pilot study designed to determine feasibility of these
      procedures.
