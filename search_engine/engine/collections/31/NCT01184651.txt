      answer questions about the things they do and are interested in, how they think and feel, and
      complete some cognitive tasks. Girls will also provide saliva so we can examine their
      hormones and determine the CAH gene mutation they have. Parents will also be asked to
      complete questionnaires about their own activities and interests and about their daughter's
      behavior.

      Shortly after the home visit, interviewers will telephone girls and their parents on several
      days and ask what the girls did during the day.
