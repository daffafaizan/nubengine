    
      This is a Phase 1 Randomized, Double-Blind, Parallel Group, Placebo-Controlled Study to
      Assess the Safety of Ascending Doses of UNI911 INHALATION in Healthy Volunteers in
      Preparation for Evaluation in Adults with COVID-19

      64 subjects will be sequentially enrolled to receive dosage of UNI911 INHALATION or placebo.
      4 sentinel subjects (one per cohort 1, 2 ,3 and 4 ) will be treated in an open-label manner
      to confirm the safety of each dose sequentially. 40 subjects will be randomly assigned (3:1)
      to either active or placebo. For the last 2 cohorts, a total of 20 healthy volunteers will be
      enrolled to receive multiple doses of UNI911 INHALATION.
