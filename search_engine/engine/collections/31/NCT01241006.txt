      single dose of oral dexamethasone to 5 days of oral prednisone in the treatment of asthma.
      Oral corticosteroids are commonly prescribed following an asthma exacerbation as it has been
      demonstrated that these medications prevent relapse.

      Oral prednisone is the most common corticosteroid prescribed for asthma relapse prevention.
      The half life is around 4 hours and is typically prescribed for minimally 5 days.

      The study is evaluating the efficacy of a single dose of dexmethasone. The drug's efficicacy
      has been shown to be longer acting and up to 72 hours. A single dose would eliminate the need
      for a prescription for a drug like prednisone to hopefully improve compliance.
