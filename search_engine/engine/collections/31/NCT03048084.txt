      depends on the physicians' preference, as there is no robust evidence from randomized
      controlled trials supporting the use of one specific anticonvulsant above the other in glioma
      patients.

      Levetiracetam and valproic acid are the most commonly used AEDs in glioma patients. Both
      drugs are used for the treatment of seizures, have similar toxicity profiles and are
      non-enzyme inducing AEDs, therefore not interfering with chemotherapeutic drugs. However, it
      is not known whether one drug is more effective than the other in reducing seizures.
