      inflammation among patients with rheumatoid or psoriatic arthritis (n = 76). Two cannabis
      formulations will be administered via vaporization (placebo and medium THC [1-5%]/medium CBD
      [1-5%]) across two experimental sessions using a counter-balanced, double-blind, crossover
      design. Blood will be collected during each session (pre-vaporization, 10 minutes
      post-vaporization, 60 minutes post-vaporization). Self-reported pain and affect will be
      assessed at the same time points. The effect of cannabis on pain, affect, and inflammatory
      biomarkers will be assessed. The study will recruit 76 patients to obtain a final sample of
      66 with complete data (15% attrition). This study will be the first to investigate the effect
      of cannabis on pain, affect, and markers of inflammation among patients with rheumatoid or
      psoriatic arthritis. This study has the potential to guide clinical decisions pertaining to
      use of cannabis to treat arthritis symptoms with more precise recommendations regarding
      cannabis formulation.
