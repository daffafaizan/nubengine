      with ritonavir, in Thai patients. Data will be collected in patients participating in the
      randomized study, "Monitoring Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART) in HIV-infected
      patients in Thailand (PHPT-3)" (HSC 10668). The first 20 patents in PHPT-3 will have
      steady-state pharmacokinetic sparse sampling performed at pre-dose, and 1, 2.5, 4 and 12
      hours after drug intake 1 and 2 months after initiating IDV/r 400/100 mg, twice daily. IDV/r
      plasma concentrations will be determined by high performance liquid chromatography. This
      spare PK data will be pooled with indinavir concentration data collected within an intensive
      pharmacokinetic studies of IDV/r [Cressey TR, et al 2005, JAC, 55, p1041-44]. Population
      means and variances of indinavir and ritonavir pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated
      using non-linear mixed effects regression models (NONMEM Version VI). The validity of the
      final model was evaluated using a visual predictive check (VPC) and bootstrap re-sampling
      techniques.
