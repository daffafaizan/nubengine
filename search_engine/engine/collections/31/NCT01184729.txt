      functional change in the ambulatory population. A similar clinical and research outcome
      instrument that is responsive to changes in aerobic capacity and function are lacking for
      persons with spinal cord injury (SCI). A 6 minute push test, adapted from the 6 minute walk
      test may fill the void. The primary aim of this project is to assess if distance traveled in
      6 minutes of wheelchair propulsion changes after an increase in aerobic capacity. We
      hypothesize that participants will push farther in 6 minutes after their aerobic capacity
      increases. The secondary aim is to explore the correlation between 6MPT distance and
      handicap, depression, wheelchair satisfaction, and self-reported avoidance of environmental
      features. We hypothesize increasing 6MPTdistance will be correlated with decreasing
      depression, decreasing handicap, decreasing self-reported avoidance of environmental
      features, and increasing wheelchair satisfaction. This is a low risk, high benefit study.
