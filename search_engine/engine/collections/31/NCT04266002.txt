      Deficit Score, after the following 10 standardized battery test: Grooved Pegboard for
      dominant and non-dominant hand, Grefex Verbal Fluency, California Verbal Learning Test
      (CVLT), Digit Span Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale III, modified Paced Auditory Serial
      Addition Test (60 items), WAIS III Digit Symbol Test, Trail Making Test A&B, recall of CVLT
      and Wisconsin Card Sorting Test; and after the Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI), Inventory
      of Activity Daily Living part II (IADL) and 10-items Cognitive Complaint Questionnaire (CCQ).
      The global CNS Penetration Effectiveness (CPE) score of ARV treatment are the sum of the
      scores of each ARV the patient received, according to the last published scoring. For each
      drug class, we considered treatment intensification only for drugs with CPE score reaching at
      least 3 (no intensification if switch in same drug class with same CPE score). CPE score was
      corrected by drugs resistance status, using cumulative genotype interpreted with the 2012
      ANRS algorithm (www.hivfrenchresistance.org; v.2012) at inclusion (CPE=0 if resistance).
