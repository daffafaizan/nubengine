      routine care, warm dry and stimulate during the 1 minutes transfusion. The second arm will
      receive routine care PLUS administration of CPAP and if need positive pressure ventilation.
      The outcome is to determine whether the addition of ventilation provides a larger placental
      transfusion and a smoother transition at birth.
