      confirmed COVID-19 will be reviewed to include in the study. Multiple centers from the
      eastern Colombian prairies caring for this population will participate to provide an
      understanding of the behavior of the epidemic and accurate clinical comprehension of the
      disease. Healthcare centers involved in providing an evaluation of patients infected with
      SARS-CoV-2 will be invited to participate.

      The study will focus on the routine or new treatment strategies provided and a large
      population of patients analyzed would be desirable. It will allow identifying the most
      relevant factors associated with clinical outcomes, complications, and prognosis, with an
      appropriate statistical methodology for the analysis of observational nature.

      Variables of individuals assisted will be recorded as well as the end results, such as
      baseline characteristics of individuals and disease, and main outcomes such as mortality,
      need for ICU attention, mechanical ventilation, and length of stay.

      These results will be used to promote an improvement in the quality of care and individual
      and cluster decisions in the region.
