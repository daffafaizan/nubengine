      both in the provision of helpful, and avoidance of harmful fluid volumes. As such, much work
      has been done to develop and assess measures of volume responsiveness; that is, tests that
      indicate whether additional fluid administration will increase cardiac output by at least
      10%. The passive leg raise (PLR) providing a reversible "auto-bolus" has been demonstrated to
      be the most predictive assessment of fluid responsiveness.

      Recent studies of changes in carotid artery blood flow suggest it can be used as a surrogate
      for changes in cardiac output with moderate reliability. This has been assessed in several
      populations with anticipated changes in volume status (e.g. before/after blood donation), and
      more recently assessed by Sidor et al. against several preload augmenting maneuvers.
      Interestingly, while decreasing preload resulted in a decrease in cardiac output and systolic
      carotid blood flow, it did not result in a decrease in corrected carotid flow time, although
      a PLR produced an expected increase in all measures.

      In our study we seek to validate these results, questioning if there is a lower limit of
      corrected carotid flow time that de-couples the relationship between carotid systolic flow
      and corrected carotid flow time.
