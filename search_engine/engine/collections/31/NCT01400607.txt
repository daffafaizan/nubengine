      treatment to reduce pain, restore joint mobility, and prevent further damage caused by the
      progression of osteoarthritis. The lack of effective cartilage repair approaches or products
      for restoration of defective articular cartilage to its native, hyaline morphology only
      continues to exacerbate the incidence of osteoarthritis as these initial defects enlarge and
      degrade over a 10 to 20 year period. The repair of cartilage, especially in the knee, remains
      a formidable clinical challenge. Regenerative medicine approaches to cartilage repair have
      only begun to be explored as possible options and there is a clear trend toward biological
      solutions for the repair and regeneration of damaged or diseased articular cartilage. The
      study was designed to compare how well the Neocartilage Implant works against the
      microfracture therapy, a widely used and accepted cartilage repair therapy. Data to be
      collected include Pain and Function in Daily Living scores, symptoms, Function in Sports and
      Recreation, and Knee Related Quality of Life. Additionally, MRI and X-rays will be collected
      to evaluate the cartilage repair progress. These assessments will be used through the five
      years of post-operative follow-up.
