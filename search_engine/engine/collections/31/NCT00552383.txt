      [an intervention that has greatly changed clinical neonatology]. The number of infants
      required to demonstrate a clinically relevant outcome [Length of Hospital Stay] has been
      calculated a priori. The infants will be tracked for outcome data after transfer to
      peripheral nurseries [a reality in today's healthcare environment], allowing generalisability
      of results to other high risk, referral Neonatal Intensive Care units. Neurodevelopmental
      outcomes will be evaluated at 18 months; [these data are sparse from previous studies]. This
      RCT will therefore demonstrate whether NIDCAP based care is truly an effective intervention
      for the very low birth weight infant.
