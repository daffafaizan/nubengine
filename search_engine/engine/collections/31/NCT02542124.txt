    
      This is a single arm, open-label, non-randomized study with NM-IL-12 dosed in combination
      with low dose TSEBT in CTCL patients. This study is planned to be conducted in 10 patients,
      18 years or older in age, undergoing low dose TSEBT of 12 Gy over a 3-week period.

      The study will initially enroll 4 patients and then will be expanded to enroll 6 additional
      patients (total 10 patients) depending on the presence or absence of Dose Modifying Criteria
      (DMC). Decision whether to de-escalate will be made after first 4 patients are followed up
      for 28 days from the first dose of NM-IL-12.

      Safety monitoring will continue throughout the whole period of drug administration and the
      treatment will be discontinued if intolerable toxicity or disease progression occurs during
      this period.
