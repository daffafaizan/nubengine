      the survival benefits of statins in breast cancer patients with dyslipidemia (low and medium
      risk of ASCVD). The control group used dietary intervention instead of statins. The main
      endpoint was 3 and 5 years DFS. The subjects were breast cancer patients. In this study, 348
      patients were randomly divided into two groups according to patients' wishes and written
      informed consent. The experimental group: control group = 1:1. Subjects were screened and
      administered continuously until the disease progressed and the toxicity was intolerable.
      Informed consent was withdrawn or the researcher decided that the drug must be discontinued.
