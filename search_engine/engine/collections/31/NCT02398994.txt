      people, which causes significant long-term disability in approximately one third. Current
      initial treatment is with corticosteroids, although evidence for their use is based on
      extrapolation from trials in adult multiple sclerosis relapses. In view of the severity of
      the condition, additional treatments have been trialed.

      Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is often used as second-line treatment in
      steroid-unresponsive central nervous system demyelination, although evidence for its efficacy
      is limited to small case series and case reports. Randomized controlled trials have
      demonstrated that IVIG reduces inflammation and enhances remyelination in a number of
      neurological conditions, although there have been no randomized controlled trials testing its
      use in adults and children with TM.

      This study will evaluate if additional and early treatment with IVIG is of extra benefit in
      TM when compared to the current standard therapy of intravenous steroids alone.
