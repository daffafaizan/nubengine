        1. Phase I-To identify the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of Abraxane given with
           carboplatin plus concurrent IMRT (AC-RT)

        2. Phase II-To evaluate efficacy in the phase II portion of the study by evaluating 2-year
           disease-free survival

      Secondary Objectives

        1. To evaluate the safety and tolerability

        2. To estimate the overall response rate

        3. To estimate 2-year overall survival

        4. To evaluate functional outcome at 2 years with respect to speech, swallowing and overall
           quality of life (QoL), by determining mean duration of PEG-dependence and change in
           FACT-HN scores from baseline to 3, 6, 12 and 24 months.

      STATISTICAL DESIGN:

      The Phase I study followed a standard 3+3 dose escalation design. Four potential dose levels
      of Abraxane ultimately were under evaluation including a de-escalation dose level -1. [Note:
      Erbitux was originally planned to be given with carboplatin and Abraxane, but removed due to
      toxicity experienced at dose level 1.] The DLT observation period is the 7 weeks of
      treatment. The Phase I incorporated a10-patient expansion cohort to ensure that the toxicity
      at the MTD for AC-RT was acceptable. Planned enrollment for the Phase II study was 34
      patients primarily to test whether 2-year disease-free survival was consistent with 75% rate
      as opposed to the null hypothesis of 53.5% based on prior research (RTOG 99-14).
