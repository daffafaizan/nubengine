      SARS-CoV-2, have no evidence of prior infection with SARSCoV- 2 based on serologic testing,
      and give informed consent for a vaccination with AV-COVID-19. The patient population will
      include the elderly and others at higher risk for poor outcomes after COVID-19 infection. For
      this reason, individuals will not be excluded solely on the basis of age, body mass index,
      history of hypertension, diabetes, cancer, or autoimmune disease.

      After enrolling for screening, subjects will undergo a nasal swab test to exclude active
      COVID-19 infection and a rapid test for anti-coronavirus antibodies to exclude pre-existing
      anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. 50 mL of blood will be collected, from which peripheral blood
      monocytes will be isolated and differentiated into DC before incubation with SARS-CoV-2
      S-protein, during which time the protein is digested into 9 to 25 amino acid peptide
      sequences presented on the dendrites of DC in conjunction with histocompatibility class I and
      class II molecules. Safety and quality testing will be performed on a small quantity of the
      batch, and the remaining AV-COVID-19 will be cryopreserved for shipping to the treatment
      site.

      Once the Study Drug is ready, if eligible, the subject will be seen at Study Week-0 for
      treatment. Prior to injection of the Study Drug, a nasal swab test will be collected to
      confirm that they are still negative for COVID-19, and blood will be drawn to determine
      baseline levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. At the treatment site, the product will be
      thawed and admixed with saline or (saline with GM-CSF), and within 5 hours of thawing, will
      be injected SC via a 25- gauge needle
