      attending 4 HIV clinics in the UK. Participants will be asked to complete an entry survey in
      which behavioural information, gynaecological and sexual history, will be collected, with the
      aim of characterising the study population for the risk factors of HPV infection. Women's
      attitude towards the current cervical screening and their view on a change to HPV testing
      will also be assessed. Participants' relevant clinical data will be collected form their
      medical notes. Women will be instructed to perform a self-taken vaginal swab for the
      detection of HR HPV while in clinic, and they will be reminded of the annual cervical smear
      (which can be offered in clinic or performed at their GP practice as per local policy). After
      six months, women will be asked to take another vaginal swabÍ¾ this can be offered in clinic,
      during the regular HIV follow up, or can be sent via the post. Another sample for HR-HPV
      testing will be collected one year later, at the next routine HIV appointment. The annual
      smear test will be due and this will be offered in clinic or done at the GP practice,
      according to local policies. After this visit, an exit questionnaire will be undertaken to
      evaluate the acceptability of the study procedures.
