      Primary

        -  Determine the feasibility of adjuvant low-dose capecitabine in patients with squamous
           cell carcinoma of the head and neck who have undergone prior curative surgery,
           radiotherapy, and/or chemotherapy.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the time to recurrence, local-regional control, and survival rate in patients
           treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the incidence of second primary tumors in patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.

      Patients receive oral capecitabine once daily for 1 year in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then
      every 6 months for 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 41 patients will be accrued for this study.
