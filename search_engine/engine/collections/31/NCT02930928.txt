      zurich. Patients planned for surgery in general anaesthesia with intubation, aged 0 to 16
      years and with a body length suitable for CLAWAR. Patient and parental information is
      performed during the pre-anaesthetic visit.

      After written consent the patient will be included. Patient ÃÅs length and weight will be
      measures earliest one day before data collection. Data collection during anaesthesia has no
      influence on the daily anaesthesia routine and has no impact on patient safety and
      anaesthesia. Patient's data is made anonymous for further inspection. Data is documented in
      Microsoft Excel and statistical analysis calculated with SPSS.

      500 patients are needed for a power of 80%. Primary outcome parameter is the accuracy of
      length based weight estimation using either patient habitus by visual estimation or an
      improved version of the algorithm CLAWAR using the mid upperarm circumference.
