      decreased intraoperative blood loss, better visualization of surgical field and better cement
      fixation of the implants, compared to the TKA without using tourniquet. However, there
      remains a controversy about the timing of tourniquet release, so the tourniquet may be
      unreleased throughout the whole operation time or released early just after cement fixation
      of the implants, atc. Early tourniquet release is generally aimed to control hidden arterial
      bleeding which would not be revealed if the tourniquet was unreleased. This method was
      reported to reduce arterial bleeding and its related complications, but it was also known
      that increase intraoperative bleeding, incidence of transfusion, and operation time. On the
      other hand, late tourniquet release, which the tourniquet is unreleased until the wound is
      closed, is reported to increase tourniquet-use time and related complications owing to longer
      tourniquet time, although it gives shorter operation time. The investigators have been used a
      way of reinflation of tourniquet after early release, once the arterial bleeding was
      controlled sufficiently, to balance the advantages and disadvantages of the early tourniquet
      release. The investigators were able to control arterial bleeding during the time the
      tourniquet was released, and the remained procedures were performed conveniently with good
      visualization of the surgical field after the tourniquet was reinflated again. However, there
      was no previous studies about the efficacy and the safety of the way of reinflation after
      early release of the tourniquet in the literature. Therefore, the investigators ask in this
      study whether the reinflation after early tourniquet release has advantages over the method
      of early tourniquet release without reinflation, in terms of efficacy and safety.
