      effects on gastrointestinal-mediated glucose disposal (GIGD). GIGD reflects the percentage of
      an individual's glucose disposal following oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) which is caused
      by the oral route of glucose administration. In healthy subjects GIGD amounts to ~60%. GIGD
      describes not only the impact of the incretin effect (insulinotropic substances released upon
      intestinal stimulation) but includes all factors affecting glucose disposal differently
      during oral vs. iv administration of glucose (including neural reflexes, activation of
      afferent nerves in the intestinal mucosa, differences in glucagon secretion, hepatic glucose
      production and first-pass hepatic uptake of glucose, differences in portal and venous blood
      glucose concentrations and/or at the present unknown factors. It is likely that the incretin
      effect (pancreatic effect) constitutes a major contributor to GIGD, but so far it has been
      impossible to discriminate between pancreatic and extrapancreatic mechanisms underlying GIGD
