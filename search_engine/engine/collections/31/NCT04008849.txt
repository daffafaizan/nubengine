    
      This is a follow-up study to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy outcomes of patients
      with inherited metabolic disorders (IMDs) who received MGTA-456 for HSCT in the core study.
      MGTA-456 is an expanded CD34+ cell therapy product candidate given after myeloablative
      conditioning to induce rapid and sustained hematopoietic engraftment. In patients with
      selected IMDs, transplant is expected to replace defective or missing protein, and preserve
      neurodevelopment. Patients with Hurler syndrome (also referred to as mucopolysaccharidosis-1H
      (MPS-1H)), cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy (cALD), metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) or
      globoid cell leukodystrophy (GLD) enrolled in the core study will be eligible to participate
      in this follow-up evaluation.
