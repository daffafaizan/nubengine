      structural abnormalities of cilia, which are microscopic hairs found in organs and cells
      throughout the body. Patients with this condition typically develop upper respiratory tract
      symptoms such as sinusitis and glue ear, lower respiratory tract problems such as recurrent
      chest infections, and fertility problems. There is currently no evidence that patients with
      PCD have a higher incidence of balance problems. However, recent animal studies have shown
      that cilia may also be important in the development of part of the inner ear balance
      (vestibular) system, specifically the part that detects linear movement known as the otolith
      system.

      The investigators hope to determine whether patients with PCD have absent or reduced otolith
      function compared to the normal population. Balance problems are not currently screened for
      in PCD patients, and could be unrecognized and therefore untreated. It is also possible that
      PCD patients have compensated for absent otolith function and so are unaffected under normal
      circumstances; any additional insult to their balance system would cause more pronounced
      difficulties than expected and treatment might need to reflect this.
