      dose reduction of at least 20% when the valve-gated pump is implanted. A study participant
      has a significant potential to bias when informed they will get less drug with the new pump
      than they were receiving in the old pump this could subjectively affect pain scores as well.
      After valve-gated pump implant and dose reduction, the appropriate pain therapy will be
      provided to adequately address pain management in the opinion of the study investigator using
      standard of care processes and VAS scores.

      Once subjects have been implanted with the valve-gated pump they will be started on a minimum
      20% dose reduction (same medications and concentrations prior to explant). If at any time
      during the subjects' treatment it is determined by the investigator that the subjects'
      treatment dose needs to be increased, the dose can be increased in increments not to exceed
      5% (no change to concentration) based on VAS scores at current and last visits.
