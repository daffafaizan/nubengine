      The purpose of "Madres para la Salud" (Mothers for Health) was to explore the effectiveness
      of a culturally specific intervention using walking "bouts" to affect changes in the health
      of Hispanic women following childbirth. The project will advance our understanding of the
      relationship between moderate increases in physical activity and consequent body fat loss and
      decreased postpartum depression symptoms in sedentary Hispanic women during the postpartum
      period. This was accomplished by having a group of women who participated in supportive
      information and walking sessions, both alone and with study personnel, and an attention
      control group who received monthly phone calls to address common postpartum health concerns,
      but who did not participate in the walking program. Both groups received weekly
      health-focused newsletters with no content related to the intervention. The women had a
      random assignment to a group.

      Study Aims

      The purpose of this social support intervention program was to test the theory-driven Madres
      para la Salud with Hispanic women by conducting a formative evaluation of the intervention:

      Aim 1: Examine the effectiveness of the Madres para la Salud, a theoretically driven social
      support intervention for reducing the distal outcomes in: (a) body fat; (b) systemic and fat
      tissue inflammation; and (c) PPD symptoms among postpartum Hispanic women compared with an
      attention control group, at 6 and 12 months, after controlling for dietary intake.

      Aim2: Test whether the theoretical mediators, intermediate outcomes, of social support and
      walking, and environmental factor moderators, affect changes in body fat; systemic and fat
      tissue inflammation; and PPD symptoms among postpartum Hispanic women completing the Madres
      para la Salud intervention compared with an attention control group, at 6 and 12 months,
      after controlling for dietary intake.

      Aim 3: Determine the relationship between the immediate outcome of walking (minutes walked
      per week) and change in the distal outcomes of: (a) body fat; (b) systemic and fat tissue
      inflammation; and (c) PPD symptoms.
