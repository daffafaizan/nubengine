      delivered with or without intensive day treatment among individuals exiting residential
      opioid detoxification.

      Design Random assignment to one of three conditions: recovery housing alone (RH),
      abstinence-contingent recovery housing with reinforcement-based treatment RBT (RH + RBT) or
      usual care (UC). RH and RH + RBT participants received 12 weeks of paid recovery housing
      contingent upon drug abstinence. RH + RBT participants also received 26 weeks of RBT,
      initiated concurrently with recovery housing. Assessments were conducted at 1, 3 and 6 months
      after treatment enrollment.

      Setting Out-patient drug-free substance abuse treatment program in Baltimore, Maryland.

      Participants Patients (n = 243) who completed medication-assisted opioid detoxification.

      Measurements Primary outcome was drug abstinence (opioid- and cocaine-negative urine and no
      self-reported opioid or cocaine use in the previous 30 days). Secondary outcomes included
      abstinence at all time-points (1, 3 and 6 months), days in recovery housing and employment.
