    
      This is a proof-of-principle study to investigate the effects of "Remind-to-Move" (RTM) using
      wearable devices at home for promoting upper extremity recovery in stroke patients after
      discharge from subacute hospitals.

      A multi-center, parallel-group, randomized controlled trial with blinded assessment was
      carried out in four hospitals. Eighty-four eligible participants who had suffered from stroke
      with less than 6 months and could slightly move their arms were randomly allocated to either
      an experimental, sham, or control group stratified by hemiplegic arm functional levels.
      Patients in the experimental group were treated by RTM using wearable devices, 3 consecutive
      hours daily, for 4 weeks. The sham group used sham devices. The control group received the
      usual care. A masked assessor evaluated the participants at 0, 4th, 8th and 12th weeks.
      Outcome measures included arm function tests, motor activity log, movement amount and
      percentage recorded by wearable devices. All patients allocated to treatment were included in
      intention-to-treat analysis.
