      demyelinating disease of the central nervous system mainly affecting young adults. There is a
      tremendous need to understand the mechanism of action of the treatment and how they might
      work in multiple sclerosis patients. Most recently, teriflunomide (AubagioTM) has been
      demonstrated to act as an immune modulatory therapy for patients with multiple sclerosis.
      Although one biochemical mechanism of action is understood to be related to inhibition of
      dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) which affects synthesis of pyrimidine nucleotides, there
      have also been reports that the functions of regulatory T cells are promoted by these drugs
      independent of DHODH. Much accumulating evidence suggests that specialized subsets of B
      lymphocytes are important inducers of regulatory T cells, as well as having killer functions
      that may preferentially target TH1 and TH17 cells.

      This study aims to address the mechanism of action of teriflunomide in a phase IV open label
      trial with Teriflunomide in multiple sclerosis
