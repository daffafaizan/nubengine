      treatment will be confirmed. Ivabradine will be administered to eligible patients with
      increasing dosage during the titration period (TP) which will last from a minimum of 3 days
      to a maximum of 15 days. This will be followed by a maintenance period (MP) of the drug for a
      further 14 days. The follow-up period (FU) will last 4 months.

      The dose of ACE inhibitors will be introduced after 72 hours of clinical stability after the
      introduction of titrated ivabradine at maximum dose according to protocol. The
      anti-aldosterone will be introduced 24 hours after the introduction of ivabradine. The
      diuretic will not be modified during the titration phase of the drug, unless there is
      clinical necessity.

      During the FU ivabradine will be continued at stable dosage, in order to maintain the target
      heart rate (HR) reached during the maintenance phase (HR > 80 bpm, in the group of patients
      older than 6-12 months, or HR > 70 bpm in patients aged 1-3 years or HR > 50 bpm between 3-18
      years). In all patients, the drug dose will be decreased or discontinued in case of
      bradycardia (HR< 80 bpm in patients 6-12 months, HR< 70 bpm in patients 1-3 years of age or
      HR< 60 bpm in patients 3-18 years of age) and/or symptoms related to bradycardia or for other
      safety reasons.
