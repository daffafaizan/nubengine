    
      This was a Phase 3, randomized, open-label, active-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy
      and safety of 150 milligrams (mg) of migalastat hydrochloride (migalastat) (equivalent to 123
      mg of migalastat) once every other day (QOD) and ERT in male and female participants with
      Fabry disease who were receiving ERT and who have an Î± Gal-A mutation that is amenable to
      migalastat, based on the clinical trial HEK assay. This was a 2-part study. Part 1, the
      18-month randomized phase, evaluated participants who received either migalastat 150 mg QOD
      or ERT per prescribing physicians' instructions for efficacy and safety. Part 2, the optional
      12-month open-label extension (OLE) phase in which all participants received migalastat, also
      explored efficacy and safety. For Part 2, all participants who received ERT in Part 1 were
      given migalastat. Data presented in this posting include efficacy data from the 18-month
      randomized period and safety data from the entire study (18-month randomized period and
      12-month optional OLE [total of 30 months]).
