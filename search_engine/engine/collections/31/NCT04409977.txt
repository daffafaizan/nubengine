      rhythmicity. The aim of this study is to investigate circadian changes in the functional
      connectivity, spectroscopy, iron deposition and perfusion of the brain. In addition, we plan
      to investigate circadian changes in the pain threshold of the brain using quantitative
      sensory testing (QST). Finally, we will investigate changes in the autonomic nervous system
      measuring the pupillary response.
