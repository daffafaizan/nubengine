      I. To determine whether treatment with 2 Gy x 2 to a painful myeloma bone lesion achieves
      patient-reported pain reduction comparable to current standard of care at 4 weeks.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess quality of life (QOL) in patients treated with 2 Gy x 2 to painful myeloma bone
      lesions.

      II. To quantify analgesia use/reduction following 2 Gy x 2 to a painful myeloma bone lesion.
      All opioid analgesia use will be converted into morphine equivalent in order to compare
      across the entire population.

      III. To measure time to pain relief and duration of pain relief with 2 Gy x 2.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To record cytogenetics and International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) response criteria at
      diagnosis and prior to and following radiotherapy (RT).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive low-dose radiation therapy at consecutive business days 1 and 2 in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with no pain relief may
      receive additional radiotherapy at 4 weeks following initial radiotherapy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 2, 4, and 8 weeks and also
      at 6 months.
