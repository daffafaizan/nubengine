      condition leading to the most hospital admissions in young children. It is also probably the
      most common serious illness of childhood lacking evidence-based treatment. Evidence both for
      and against the effectiveness of corticosteroids such as dexamethasone has been published.
      Editorials, expert reviews, and a recent report from the Agency for Healthcare Research and
      Quality recommend a study such as this one.

      Patients will be drawn from the emergency departments at participating medical centers in the
      Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network, created by the Emergency Medical Services
      for Children program and the Maternal and Child Health Bureau of the Health Resources and
      Services Administration to study health problems of high acuity and high incidence in
      children.

      Comparisons: The primary outcome (hospital admission after 4 hours of ED observation) and
      secondary outcomes will be compared between treatment and placebo groups.
