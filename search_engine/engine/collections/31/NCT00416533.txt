      Primary

        -  Assess prostate specific antigen response rate to docetaxel, doxorubicin hydrochloride,
           and prednisone in patients with hormone-refractory advanced prostate cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Assess if treatment with docetaxel, doxorubicin hydrochloride, and prednisone will
           improve health-related quality of life of these patients.

        -  Assess the toxicity of docetaxel, doxorubicin hydrochloride, and prednisone.

        -  Assess response rate in measurable disease.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 1, doxorubicin hydrochloride IV
      over 15 minutes on days 1 and 8, and oral prednisone once daily on days 1-21. Treatment
      repeats every 21 days for at least 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, on day 1 of each course, after completion of 3
      courses, and at disease progression.

      After completing study treatment, patients are followed every 6 months for 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 47 patients will be accrued for this study.
