    
      This is a prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled trial. The study consists of 3
      phases as follows:

        -  Randomization phase: subjects undergo screening, baseline, interim and 90-day follow-up
           visits

             -  PKG+ Group (standard of care clinical evaluation plus use of PKG data)

             -  PKG- Group (standard of care clinical evaluation without use of PKG data - the MDS
                is blinded to PKG data)

             -  Randomization ratio will be 1:1 with assignments generated in advance of the start
                of the trial by the unblinded statistician who will provide a list containing group
                assignments that will be available in an Electronic Database (EDC) for site use.

             -  The clinical investigator, study site staff, and subject will not be blinded to the
                randomization assignment during the randomization phase of the study

        -  Open-label phase: at the end of the 90-day randomization phase visit for PKG- Group
           subjects, the MDS will report on the PKG and review it with the subject, the subject
           will complete follow-ups with the MDS using the PKG information during the clinical
           assessment following the same process as the PKG+ Group during the randomization phase

        -  Extended open-label follow-up phase: annual follow-ups for all subjects at 1, 2, and 3
           years during which the MDS will use the PKG information during clinical assessments for
           all subjects.
