      prospective randomized trial. A standardized anesthesia induction and intubation with
      propofol and rocuronium will be used. Patients will be randomized in two groups. Group
      Esmolol (Group E n=30) will receive esmolol 500 mic kg-1 loading dose and a 50-500 mic kg-1
      min-1 infusion and Group Remifentanil (Group R n=30) will receive remifentanil 0.1-0.3 mic
      kg-1 min-1 infusion to induce controlled hypotension. A 50-60 mmHg mean arterial pressure and
      a minimum 50 beat min-1 heart rate is targeted. Heart rate, blood pressures, peripheral
      oxygen saturation and bispectral index spectrum (BIS) will be recorded. Anesthesia
      maintenance will be provided with O2/N2O and desflurane-propofol balanced anesthesia and a
      BIS value 40-60 is targeted. The quality of the surgical field will be assessed by the
      surgeon by using a 10 point visual analog scale (B1) and a 6 point scale (B2) during surgery
      with 5 minute intervals. The amount of bleeding will be calculated at the end of surgery from
      the amount of blood and irrigation fluid collected in the suction tube. All complications and
      side effects will be recorded.
