           Mometasone which is one type of steroid. This application has been approved for use by
           the FDA.

        2. Nasopore soaked with triamcinolone. This "packing' is a sponge-like material which
           dissolves while releasing triamcinolone, which is another type of steroid. Triamcinolone
           has been approved for use topically elsewhere on the body, although the specific use of
           Triamcinolone in the sinuses has not been approved by the FDA.

      Both of these procedures are currently used regularly by Dr. Pearlman in practice at the
      conclusion of ESS for treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis. As standard of care, treatment is
      determined intraoperatively (during surgery), at the discretion of the surgeon. In this
      study, each subject will have both treatments (one in each cavity). The 'experimental' aspect
      relates to directly comparing the two procedures.

      This research study is being done because there is currently a lack of consensus regarding
      the optimal nasal packing regimen. There have been no comparison studies and practice
      patterns vary widely. Our study looks to compare the Propel implant to Nasopore packing
      soaked in Triamcinolone.
