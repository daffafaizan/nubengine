    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Evaluate the use of 3'-deoxy-3'-[18F] fluorothymidine (FLT) positron emission tomography
           (PET) imaging to measure tumor proliferation and the DNA synthetic pathway (thymidine
           kinase levels) in patients with cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the efficacy of FLT PET imaging in detecting lesions and estimating response
           to treatment.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo up to four 3'-deoxy-3'-[18F] fluorothymidine positron emission
      tomography imaging procedures.
