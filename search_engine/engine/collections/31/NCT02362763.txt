      area (study group), or five acupuncture sessions designed for tranquility (controls).
      Participants and evaluating gynecologists were blinded to randomization. Participants were
      examined clinically before treatment and one month after completion of assigned treatment; at
      both visits they completed the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) questionnaire.

      FSFI scores for pain during intercourse and total score were used to evaluate change. The
      examining gynecologist evaluated the degree of sensitivity to touch and the degree of local
      erythema. Response to treatment was evaluated for each group before and after treatment, and
      for study group compared to the control group.
