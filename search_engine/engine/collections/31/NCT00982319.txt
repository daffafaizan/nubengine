    
      A double-blind randomized Phase II chemoprevention trial of BSE versus placebo will be
      conducted in up to 35 women diagnosed with DCIS on core biopsy prior to their definitive
      surgery (study diagram below). The primary study endpoint will be a decrease in the mean
      proliferative rate measured by Ki67%.

      Women diagnosed with DCIS on core or incisional/excisional biopsy scheduled for definitive
      surgery at Johns Hopkins Hospital will be recruited for this study. Participants will be
      placed on a cruciferous free diet for the 14 days prior to their surgical date and drink a
      randomized intervention beverage (mango juice with or without broccoli sprout extract).
      Additionally participants will provide 2 blood and 2 urine sample collections, report
      medication use and adverse events using prepared forms and complete a daily diet check list
      during the 14 day intervention. On the day of definitive breast surgery, 1-2 grams of breast
      tissue (including normal adjacent breast tissue) will be collected during surgery.
