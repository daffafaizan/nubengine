      general acceptance about the need of implant removal for obvious reasons, such as infections
      or implant failure, little is known about the beneficial aspects in cases of minor reasons.
      Therefore, we initiated this study to define patients' benefit of elective implant removal
      following plate osteosynthesis of displaced clavicle fractures.

      Patients and Methods Prospective evaluation of patients was conducted before implant removal
      and 6 weeks postoperative. Subjective and objective criteria included patients' satisfaction,
      pain rating on a visual analog scale (VAS) and active range of motion (ROM) pre- and 6 weeks
      postoperative. Functional scoring included the SPADI, DASH score, the Constant Score and the
      Munich Shoulder Questionnaire (MSQ).
