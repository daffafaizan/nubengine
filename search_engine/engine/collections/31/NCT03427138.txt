      both when a person performs an action and when that person observes someone else performing
      the same action. This system emerges in infancy and develops over time to support more
      complex social abilities. It has been hypothesized that autism involves fundamental
      impairments to the MNS, which can explain the deficits in joint attention, imitation,
      communication and social cognition.

      This study investigates the MNS in 100 toddlers and preschoolers recently diagnosed with
      autism or with a suspected diagnosis of autism. First, children with (suspected) autism
      complete a battery of behavioral measures and MNS activity will be assessed using
      electrophysiology (EEG; event-related potentials) while the child participates in specific
      tasks. Then, the children with (suspected) autism will be randomly assigned to one of two
      behavioral intervention programs (i.e., targeted joint attention intervention or parent
      education intervention) that will be carried out by interventionists and parents for 10-12
      weeks. At the end of the intervention, these children will be re-evaluated on behavioral
      tasks and EEG to investigate changes as a result of the intervention.

      The investigators hypothesize that the joint attention intervention will lead to significant
      changes on both the neural and behavioral measures of MNS functioning.
