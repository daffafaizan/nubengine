      patients with mild to moderate disabilities. ESD service was developed to facilitate patient
      to their daily livings at home, reduce the length of stay in the hospital with possibly
      better or equivalent outcomes for patients and caregivers.

      ESD service has been proven to be non-inferior in the functional and quality of life measures
      as well as cost-effective, compared to the conventional rehabilitation service in many
      countries, however the effectiveness of ESD service may differ among countries and medical,
      economical circumstances. This study aims to examine the effect of ESD service on the acute
      stroke patients with mild to moderate disabilities in Korea and demonstrate its feasibility
      as an alternative medical service option to those patients.
