      chemoradiotherapy followed by brachytherapy in cervical cancer clinical stage III. Secondary
      endpoints comprises security profile, survival rates, quality of life and related costs.

      The data obtained by this protocol will allow to determine the effect of hypofractionated
      radiation therapy and its possible adverse effects. Side effects will be classified according
      to version 4.03 of CTCAE guidelines. The highest CTCAE grade will be obtained for each type
      of event, for each patient and the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) scale will be
      applied to evaluate the events related to conventional and hypofractionated radiotherapy, as
      well as brachytherapy.

      Quality of life (QOL) will be evaluated using EORTC QLQ-CX24 and EORTC QLQ-C30, both have
      been validated and available in Mexican Spanish.

      Direct and indirect expenses related to the treatment will be evaluated based on the
      treatment costs stipulate by the institution and the information obtained by the social
      workers.
