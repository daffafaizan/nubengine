      States and has a five-year survival of 40% after surgical resection. Metastatic gastric
      cancer has an even poorer prognosis and most patients die within the first year of diagnosis.
      Most patients are diagnosed in advanced stages of the disease due to non-specific or lack of
      symptomatology and treatment options are then limited to systemic chemotherapy. The
      peritoneum is the most frequent site of metastasis as well as cancer recurrence. Peritoneal
      Carcinomatosis (PC) results in adverse clinical sequelae and is ultimately responsible for
      60% of all gastric cancer-related deaths. While visceral metastases originating from primary
      gastric cancer are relatively chemosensitive, peritoneal carcinomatosis is particularly
      challenging to treat because of inadequate drug delivery from systemic circulation. The
      primary purpose of this trial is to determine the safety of administering intraperitoneal
      docetaxel in conjunction with the standard of care treatment regimen of intravenous mFOLFOX6
      (5-Fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin) in patients with primary gastric cancer with
      gross peritoneal carcinomatosis.
