      The objective of this study were:

        -  to assess the prevalence of anemia and the therapeutic and prophylactic response to
           ferrous sulfate and folic acid.

        -  to compare the effect of folic acid supplementation with ferrous sulfate on the linear
           and weight growth of anemic and non-anemic.

      A double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trial was conducted with 196 children 6 to 24
      months of age enrolled in municipal daycare centers in Goiânia, Goias State, Brazil. The
      children were assigned to two treatment groups that received a daily dose (5 times a week) of
      either 4.2mg/kg/day of ferrous sulfate + folic acid (50μg) or 4.2mg/kg/day of ferrous sulfate
      + folic acid placebo. One of the prevention groups received 1.4mg/kg/day of ferrous sulfate +
      folic acid (50μg/day) and the other 1.4mg/kg/day of ferrous sulfate + folic acid placebo.
      Supplementation lasted approximately three months.
