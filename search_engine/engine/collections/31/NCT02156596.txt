    
      Renal colic are a frequent cause of consultation in the emergency departement (ED).

      They count for approximatively 20% of patients presenting to the ED with severe acute onset
      abdominal pain.

      For acute treatment of renal colics (RC), guidelines recommend the use of intravenous (IV)
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAI) drugs in association with antalgics like Paracetamol
      or Morphine.

      But the NSAID present many inconvenient and cannot be used in some type of patients; that's
      why the investigators investigated the use of other drugs, such as nebulised morphine, in the
      ED treatment of renal colics.

      the NM has the adequacy of being quickest, more practical to use and more tolerated than the
      IV NSAID.

      In this study, the investigators aim to assess the feasibility, efficacity and safety of
      nebulised morphine compared to intravenous NSAID in the treatment of RC.
