      organ-preserving procedure should be carried out whenever possible in order to maintain
      kidney function. Partial nephrectomy can be performed through the conventional open technique
      as well as through a robotic-assisted approach. Although both methods belong to the standard
      care, there is still no published data from randomized controlled trials in the scientific
      literature comparing them. The ROBOCOP-trial is designed as a single-center comparison of the
      two surgical approaches in preparation for a phase III study. 50 patients are to be included
      in the trial within a period of 15 months. The primary endpoint is feasibility of patient
      recruitment. In addition, potential primary outcomes for a confirmative trial such as
      perioperative complications, quality of life, inflammatory response, survival and ergonomic
      aspects for the operating surgeons will be investigated.
