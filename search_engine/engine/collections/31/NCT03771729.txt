      condition of disease and tolerance,the dose will be doubled every 2 weeks until the target
      maintenance dose 200mg twice daily is reached unless potassium or change in kidney function
      preclude a dose increase(reduction in dose will be permitted if the larger dose will not be
      tolerated, and temporary interruption will be permitted at any time if required for clinical
      reasons).The trial will be followed up for 12 weeks. Study visits will be scheduled at
      2,4,6,8,10and12 weeks (and additional visits will be arranged where necessary to monitor
      participant safety).
