      compliance with inclusion and exclusion criteria, laboratory assessments, pelvic examination,
      and imaging of the pelvis. Following conventional catheter angiography to confirm catheter
      placement and the uterine vasculature, each patient will undergo transarterial embolization
      with Occlusin 500 microspheres.
