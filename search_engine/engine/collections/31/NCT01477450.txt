      tissue oxygenation and ECG. The mean seal level oxygen saturation will be recorded.Subjects
      exposed to an altitude of 14,000 feet will experience moderate hypobaric hypoxia. The mean
      oxygen saturation at this altitude is 83%. Subjects will receive oxygen from both an oxygen
      concentrator or a cylinder of oxygen following exposure to hypobarism. Oxygen from each
      source will be increased in 1 liter per minute increments until the oxygen saturation returns
      to the baseline sea level oxygen saturation.

      The oxygen requirement to return oxygen saturation to baseline values will be recorded. The
      flow from the concentrator and the cylinder will be compared.
