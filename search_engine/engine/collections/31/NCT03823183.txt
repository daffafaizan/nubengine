      and physical exercise. The cognitive component will be either a brain training video game
      program selected from Lumosity (cognitive intervention, CI) or video games not specifically
      designed to train attention and executive control (cognitive control, CC). The physical
      exercise component will be either Body-attack, a combination of dance, aerobic, strength, and
      muscular resistance (exercise intervention, EI) or its control condition composed of
      stretching, toning and relaxation (exercise control, EC).
