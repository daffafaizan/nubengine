      suited for selectively enhancing the tumor radiosensitivity. In human xenograft models
      (non-small cell lung cancer and breast cancer) treated with gefitinib and irradiation,
      combined therapy has shown a significant increase in tumor growth delay as compared with
      monotherapy of irradiation or gefitinib. The epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase
      inhibitor ZD1839 selectively potentiates radiation response of human tumors in nude mice,
      with a marked improvement in therapeutic index. The authors concluded that gefitinib
      profoundly enhanced the antitumor action of RT against the tested tumors without significant
      adverse effects, increasing the therapeutic selectively of ionizing radiation in certain
      model systems. Substantial benefits for this multimodality therapy in patients could be
      expected.

      While there are no published data on the feasibility and efficacy of combined gefitinib and
      radiation therapy in Chinese population who might be susceptible to gefitinib monotherapy,
      clinical studies have demonstrated that combining gefitinib with external beam radiation to
      66-74Gy and concurrent weekly chemotherapy after induction chemotherapy were tolerated
      without excessive toxicity. In the present trail, we hope to build on our own experience of
      using combined gefitinib and thoracic radiation with 3D-CRT or intensity-modulated
      radiotherapy (IMRT) technique in a phase I setting for stage IIIb and selected stage IV
      NSCLC. We will follow this treatment (RT and gefitinib) with 60 days gefitinib at standard
      systemic doses.
