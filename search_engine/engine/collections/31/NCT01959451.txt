      invasive treatment of blocked coronary vessels (percutaneous coronary intervention = PCI) a
      potent platelet inhibition is needed to reduce the risk of thrombotic complications which is
      particularly high within the first week after PCI. On the other hand, the use of potent
      platelet inhibitors such as prasugrel is associated with higher bleeding risk particularly
      when used at long-term. A combination of a potent antiplatelet drug (prasugrel) within the
      first week with a less potent antiplatelet drug (clopidogrel) thereafter might lead to a
      higher net clinical benefit - means less bleeding and thrombotic complications. This
      hypothesis is being investigated in the current trial.
