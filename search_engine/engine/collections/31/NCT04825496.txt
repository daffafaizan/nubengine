    
      This is a single arm, open-label, non-randomized, dose-escalation, phase I study to determine
      the safety and efficacy of ssCART-19 in the treatment of patients with CD19 positive relapsed
      or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

      Primary objectives:

      Determine the safety and tolerability of ssCART-19 cells in patients with refractory or
      relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

      Secondary objectives:

        1. Observe the anti-tumor response of ssCART-19 cells to refractory or relapsed acute
           lymphoblastic leukemia.

             -  Overall remission rate (ORR) assessment during the 3 months after ssCART-19
                administrationï¼ŒORR includes CR and CRi

             -  Duration of response (DOR)

             -  Progression-free survival (PFS)

             -  Overall survival (OS)

        2. To characterize the in vivo cellular pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of ssCART-19 cells.

        3. To characterize the pharmacodynamic (PD) profile of ssCART-19 cells.
