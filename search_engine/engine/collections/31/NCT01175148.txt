    
      This is a phase II study of atorvastatin for the prophylaxis of acute GVHD in patients
      undergoing matched-sibling allogeneic HSCT. This study will explore a two-pronged acute GVHD
      prophylaxis strategy, consisting of pre-treating consenting sibling donors with atorvastatin
      before stem cell collection, followed by the addition of atorvastatin to
      methotrexate/tacrolimus-based GVHD prophylaxis.
