    
      This is a prospective, double-blind (patient and neuropsychologist), randomized, cross-over
      study to evaluate the safety of deep brain stimulation of the nucleus basalis of Meynert
      (nbM) in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) who are
      undergoing globus pallidus internus (GPi) stimulation for their motor symptoms. Six patients
      with PD who are eligible for GPi DBS for improvement of their motor symptoms and who have a
      clinical diagnosis of PD-MCI (amnestic, single or multiple domain) per Movement Disorder
      Society (MDS) criteria will be enrolled and implanted with bilateral electrodes in in the nbM
      in addition to the globus pallidus internus (GPi). Conventional stereotactic implantation of
      the electrodes will be guided by intraoperative computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic
      resonance tomography (MRT).
