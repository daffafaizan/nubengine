      failure of the primary arteriovenous fistula, and they are the first choice in case of an
      acute need for extracorporeal therapy. Microbial adhesions and biofilm formation have been
      implicated in serious infections associated with the use of indwelling catheters.

      In view of the necessity to reduce catheter-related bloodstream infections and of the
      inadequacy of currently available antimicrobially coated devices, a new antimicrobial
      catheter surface was developed.

      The clinical study described below aims at providing further data on antimicrobial efficiency
      and a supposed additional preventive effect on catheter-related infections.
