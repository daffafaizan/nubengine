      I. To determine the safety and potential toxicities associated with infusing donor CD8+
      cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) clones specific for Proteinase 3 (Myeloblastin) in patients
      with relapse/progression of high risk myeloid leukemias after transplant.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the in vivo persistence of transferred T cells and assess migration to the
      bone marrow, a predominant site of leukemic relapse.

      II. To determine if adoptively transferred proteinase 3 (PR3)-specific T cells mediate
      antileukemic activity.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive allogeneic CD8+ PR3-specific CTLs intravenously (IV) over 1-2 hours on days
      0, 7, 14, 28, and 49 and aldesleukin subcutaneously (SC) twice daily on days 28-41 and 49-63
      in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 1-3 months.
