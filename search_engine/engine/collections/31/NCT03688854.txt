      arms (placebo, high-dose of SCFA, and low-dose of SCFA). The high and low doses of SCFA are
      equivalent to 20 and 10 grams of fiber respectively. Healthy male participants follow a
      low-fiber diet for the study duration (11 days). On day 4, baseline measurements are taken in
      the lab, including biological samples and psychophysiological measurements. Participants then
      consume placebo or SCFA for one week and revisit the lab on day 11 for a second measurement
      of the outcomes of interest. Specifically, we investigate the effect of SCFA supplementation
      on affective processing, including stress sensitivity, fear-related processes (e.g.
      extinction learning), and attentional bias to emotional stimuli. Volunteers also respond to
      questionnaires in relation to mood, and provide biological samples (blood and faecal samples)
      for analysis of circulating short chain fatty acids and microbiota composition, respectively.
