      (1.50, 1.65 and 1.75 mM) in the bath with 1 mM citrate which allows the equivalence of
      calcium balance (Ca_eq) in a sitting HD compared to traditional concentrated with 3 mM of
      calcium acetate and 1.5.

      Secondary objectives

        -  Evaluate the purifying performance of small and medium-sized molecules in HD with
           concentrated with 1 mM citrate and Ca_eq compared to traditional concentrated with 3 mM
           calcium acetate and 1.5.

        -  Observe the effects on hemodynamic of the concentrate through the variation of the pre
           and post-dialysis blood pressure and intradialytic symptoms (cramps, hypotension,
           headache).

        -  Evaluate the variations of the parameters of mineral metabolism: Predialytic values of
           PTH, alkaline phosphatase treatments with concentrated Cit (1 mM citrate and Ca_eq) and
           concentrated with traditional Ac (3 mM calcium acetate and 1.5).
