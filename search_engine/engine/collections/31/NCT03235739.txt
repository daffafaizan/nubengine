      produce uncomfortable side effects such as urinary retention (an inability to completely
      empty the bladder), constipation and nausea/vomiting. Clinical evidence demonstrates that
      Naloxegol can safely and effectively block these undesirable side effects while maintaining
      the painkilling effects of opioids in outpatients suffering from opioid-induced constipation.
