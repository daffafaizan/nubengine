      VP-102 Topical Film Forming Solution [0.7% (w/v) cantharidin] in subjects 2 years and older
      with Molluscum Contagiosum. Up to 40 subjects will be enrolled in the study with the goal of
      16 meeting criteria for, and completing all scheduled blood draws outlined in the exposure
      portion of the trial. Subjects that do not have enough molluscum lesions to participate in
      the exposure study but do meet all other criteria to participate in the study will be
      enrolled in the standard treatment group. No more than 16 subjects will complete exposure
      group activities; up to 16 subjects will be enrolled in the standard treatment group. The
      additional 8 subjects may be used for replacement patients. At least 3 patients in the
      exposure group will be from 2-5 years of age. All subjects will receive VP-102 containing
      0.7% cantharidin to molluscum lesions every 21 days for a maximum of 4 sessions or until
      complete clearance.

      In the exposure group, blood samples for systemic exposure evaluation will be collected on
      Day 1, prior to the drug application, and 2 (± 30 minutes), 6 (± 1 hour) and 24 (±3 hours)
      hours post-application. A dermatological examination will be performed by a qualified
      investigator quantifying molluscum lesion counts at every study visit.
