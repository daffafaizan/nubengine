    
      Axicabtagene ciloleucel (axi-cel) is a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy
      directed against CD19 which has been approved for the treatment of relapse/refractory diffuse
      large B-cell lymphoma DLBCL and primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL) after 2 or
      more lines of systemic therapy.

      But administrating CAR T-cells earlier in the therapeutic strategy may be beneficial to
      patients.

      Axi-cel will improve the outcome of patients with DLBCL who are refractory or relapse early
      (i.e. within 1 year from end of treatment) after first-line therapy and who are not eligible
      for Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation (ASCT).

      Transplant-ineligible patients will include those who are deemed ineligible for high-dose
      chemotherapy and Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT) due to age, comorbidity, or
      prior ASCT.

      The primary endpoint will be complete metabolic response (CMR) at 3 months after Axi-cel
      infusion.
