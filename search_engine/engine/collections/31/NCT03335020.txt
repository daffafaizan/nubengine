        1. To describe whether contrast-enhanced ultrasonography, strain imaging, and 3-D volume
           ultrasonography are helpful to characterize affected arteries and improve the imaging of
           arterial wall among patients with Fibromuscular Dysplasia (FMD) and segmental arterial
           mediolysis (SAM).

        2. Evaluate the arterial elastic properties of individuals with FMD and compare to normal
           individuals, those with atherosclerosis disease, those with personal history of
           spontaneous coronary artery dissections (SCAD), and/or personal history of segmental
           arterial mediolysis (SAM) by elastography.

        3. Identification of vulnerable arterial elastic properties using contrast-enhanced
           ultrasonography, shear wave elastography, strain imaging, and 3-D volume ultrasonography
           to predict short-term and long-term outcomes among individuals with FMD, normal
           individuals, those with atherosclerosis disease, those with SCAD, and/or SAM.

        4. Develop risk factor profiles and risk score systems of patients undergoing
           contrast-enhanced ultrasonography, shear wave elastography, strain imaging, and 3-D
           volume ultrasonography among individuals with FMD, those with atherosclerosis disease,
           those with personal history of SCAD, and/or personal history of SAM.
