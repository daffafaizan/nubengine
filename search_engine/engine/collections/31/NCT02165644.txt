      standard of care or standard of care only for four days. This means:

      The subject will be given acetazolamide tablet orally with standard care for subarachnoid
      hemorrhage or standard of care only, for a maximum of 4 days. If the subject cannot take
      medication orally then the investigators will put a tube through the nose to stomach or small
      intestine. Being part of the study does not exclude the subject from receiving the standard
      therapy. The subject will be given the current standard of care therapy irrespective of being
      in the study or not. The investigators will review the subject's medical records and collect
      information from standard of care procedures that would have been done even if the subject
      were not enrolled in this study. This information will include, but will not be limited to,
      the subject's imaging data, sub arachnoid hemorrhage assessments and medical history. The
      subject's Hunt and Hess scale score and (World federation of neurologic surgeons) WFNS scale
      score will also be collected. Hunt and Hess and WFNS scale are used to assess the level of
      damage to neurologic functions of a person caused by sub arachnoid hemorrhage.

      The subject will be asked to come for the follow-up at 3 months after the discharge from the
      hospital. The following data will be obtained from each subject at 3-month follow-up.

        1. Modified Rankin Scale (m-RS) scores

        2. Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) scores
