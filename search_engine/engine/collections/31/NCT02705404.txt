      The management decision is based on determining if multiple cancers represent true
      independent primary cancers or related metastasis. This determination is critical to the
      appropriate staging of the cancers and treatment. Indeed, this distinction represents the
      difference between aggressive local therapy with either surgery or radiation therapy for
      primary early stage lesions, or palliative chemotherapy or best supportive care with
      appropriate symptom management for advanced stage metastatic disease.

      No existing pathologic or molecular test is currently capable of making the distinction
      between multiple independent lung primaries from metastatic disease with accuracy. The recent
      release of preliminary data from the NLST screening trial, suggesting survival benefit for
      screening high risk patients with CT scanning, will only increase the number of patients
      facing these treatment dilemmas. The research team has recently developed a test that allows
      this distinction with great accuracy. This test allows determination of lineage between two
      tumors using the identification of large genomic rearrangements using mate pair next
      generation sequencing (MP). The test has been developed using fresh frozen tissue from
      resected lung tumors and is currently being validated for a clinical test.

      The investigators' goal is to develop the test using cytology and small biopsy specimens.
