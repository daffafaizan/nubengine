      assessment visits and at least 24 hours of no lens wear the day prior to the visit. Each
      subject will be randomized to a crossover sequence of 4 periods. Different study lenses will
      be worn during 3 of the periods, for at least 8 hours each, and the remaining period will
      have no lens wear.
