      multiple-dose study to assess skin irritation and skin sensitization in healthy subjects.

      Subjects will be randomized prior to the first TDS application. The total duration of the
      study from Screening to Follow-up is approximately 95 days for subjects participating in the
      Induction Phase and the Challenge Phase of the study and potentially up to 156 days for
      subjects requiring to complete Re-Challenge Phase.

      Skin irritation will be monitored by visual scoring scales. TDS adhesion will be assessed
      during TDS wear period. Safety will be monitored throughout the study by clinical and
      laboratory evaluations.
