      adriamycin and cytoxan, alternating with the newly developed regimen ifosfamide VP-16 as well
      as the efficacy of this therapy in addition to radiotherapy in producing complete responses
      and disease-free survival in patients with Ewing's sarcoma, primitive sarcoma of bone,
      peripheral neuroepithelioma, and soft tissue sarcoma. This will not be a randomized study but
      will be comparable to the large data base of similar patients treated on successive Pediatric
      Branch studies.
