      (PAM) and the duration (PT) of the terminal phase of P-wave in lead V1, shows early delay in
      left atrial conduction, observed earlier that the dilatation of left atrium.

      Aim. We aim to follow PT, PAM and Ptf changes during 5-year follow-up (5FU) and examine the
      relation of these changes to the number of AF episodes requiring hospitalisation (HOSP) for
      restoration of sinus rhythm (RSR).

      We hypothesise that, in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF):

        1. the index parameters (PT, PAM, Ptf), characterising left atrial repolarization,
           correlates the number of future hospitalisations (HOSP) aimed for restoration of sinus
           rhythm (RSR) in 5-year follow-up (5FU)

        2. in 5FU the number of HOSP aimed for RSR correlates with the progression of left atrium
           electrical remodelling, expressed as PAM5,PT5, Ptf5 at 5FU.
