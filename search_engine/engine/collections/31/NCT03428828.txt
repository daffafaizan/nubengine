      to standard pharmacological and psychological interventions and will be considered treatment
      resistant (TR-MDD). Decreased reactivity to positive stimuli, indexed by low amygdala
      reactivity to positive autobiographical memory recall, may be a causal mechanism interfering
      with recovery from TR-MDD. Previous work in our lab suggests that individuals who do respond
      to antidepressant medications show increased amygdala activity that is indistinguishable from
      controls relative to baseline, while TR-MDD individuals fail to show this increase in
      amygdala activity. Furthermore, the investigators have found that MDD participants (more
      generally, not specifically TR- MDD) are indeed able to increase their amygdala response
      during positive memory recall via real-time fMRI neurofeedback (rtfMRI-nf) training, and that
      this increase is associated with large and rapid reductions in depressive symptoms. Here, the
      investigators propose to evaluate whether rtfMRI-nf training to increase the amygdala
      response to positive memories may serve as an intervention for TR-MDD. 100 TR-MDD individuals
      will be randomly assigned under double-blind conditions to receive 5 amygdala rtfMRI-nf or 5
      control rtfMRI-nf sessions where they are trained to regulate a parietal region putatively
      not involved in emotional processing or MDD. The investigators will assess changes in
      amygdala activity, severity of clinical symptoms, and autobiographical memory deficits.
      Success will suggest a new non- pharmacological, non-invasive intervention for a
      traditionally treatment-resistant population of MDD individuals.
