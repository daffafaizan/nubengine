      risk of deep infections arising from hematomas, wound separations, and superficial
      infections. If wound additives can prevent these early complications, their universal
      application would be cost effective. This study examined whether two wound additives,
      Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP) and CellerateRXÂ® (activated collagen), would improve postoperative
      wound healing and reduce complications in primary total joint arthroplasty.

      Methods: A prospective, randomized, controlled study using three cohorts with 30 patients
      each (Group 1: PRP, Group 2: activated collagen, Group 3: control) were examined
      postoperatively at two and six weeks, at which time the following data were recorded: six
      wound measurements, total postoperative blood loss, complications of superficial infections,
      and reoperations.
