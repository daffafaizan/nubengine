      pain of injection and avoiding the child's discomfort remains an important aim for both
      parents and health care workers. Withdrawing blood and intravenous insertion (IV) in children
      is also time consuming, especially when the child is uncooperative and stressed.

      We, the researchers at Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario, have been searching for an
      effective, rapid and inexpensive method to alleviate the distress associated with
      venipuncture and IV insertion.

      Medications by mouth, such as anti-anxiety drugs, are helpful but usually do not
      significantly reduce the pain. The most commonly used anti-anxiety drug at our institution is
      midazolam, but unfortunately onset of action takes 20-30 minutes. There are various forms of
      topical creams that can numb the skin. EMLA, a mixture of two local anesthetics (Lidocaine
      2.5% and Prilocaine 2.5%), is applied as a topical cream and is covered with an occlusive
      dressing. It requires at least 1 hour to be effective. It is not only time consuming but
      expensive (~$1.30 per application). Ametop (Tetracaine PH. Eur.4%w/w) is another effective
      topical cream, which works in 30 minutes, but it is more expensive than EMLA (~$3.00 per
      application). Vapocoolant sprays applied for ~10 seconds immediately before injection have
      been shown to be faster, less expensive and as effective as EMLA in reducing pain at the site
      of injection during immunization.

      The current investigation will evaluate the quality, efficacy and costs associated with the
      use of a new vapocoolant spray, Pain Ease, in reducing pain associated with IV insertion for
      school age children.
