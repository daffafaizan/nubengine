    
      ASPIRE is focused on the first trimester, a critical and vulnerable period when all of a
      baby's organ systems form and the placenta - the crucial connection between mom and baby -
      develops.

      Currently, there are no data about the effects of COVID-19 infections in the first trimester.
      The study will provide critical information to:

        1. Guide the care of pregnant women

        2. Protect the safety of their babies and families

        3. Help those considering pregnancy in the future understand what it means to be pregnant
           in this new era

      The investigators are recruiting 10,000 women from the start of pregnancy and will track
      COVID-19 exposures using frequent serology testing. The investigators will collect
      information during and after the pregnancy to try to determine the effects of COVID 19 for
      mom and baby.

      Participants will be asked to do the following throughout pregnancy:

        -  Submit frequent, quick (<1 minute each) symptom tracking reports using your mobile phone
           and/or computer.

        -  Collect finger-stick blood samples from home at several points throughout your
           pregnancy.

        -  Give permission to review medical records related to your pregnancy, delivery and baby's
           development.

        -  Complete questionnaires online about your health during your pregnancy and after
           delivery of your baby.
