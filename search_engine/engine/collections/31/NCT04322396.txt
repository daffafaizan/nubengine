      sparse data in the course, risk of various complications, and in particular how patients who
      are hospitalized are best treated to ensure high survival and short hospitalization. Despite
      the rapid spread of the disease globally, there is no solid data yet to recommend any
      specific treatments, which is why symptomatic, organ supportive therapy including respiratory
      therapy in acute pulmonary failure is recommended. There has been reported a high incidence
      of bacterial super-infections in patients with COVID-19. Patients with COVID-19 also have a
      higher risk of dying because of septic shock. Thus, there is an urgent need for treatment
      that can improve the patient's chance of the shortest hospitalization possible, and treatment
      that can lower the risk of secondary infection and death.

      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded multi-center trial evaluating the
      effect of azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine treatment in patients with COVID-19 during
      hospitalization. The aim of the study is to investigate whether the treatment can shorten
      hospitalization, reduce the risk of non-invasive ventilation, admittance to Intensive Care
      Units and death.
