      with psoriasis, affecting around 150,000 people in the United Kingdom (UK). The 2015 European
      League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) Treatment recommendations for PsA incorporating as its
      first recommendation that "treatment should be aimed at reaching the target of remission or,
      alternatively, minimal/low disease activity, by regular monitoring and appropriate adjustment
      of therapy". Despite the evidence and the EULAR recommendations supporting 'treat to target'
      in PsA, it has not been widely implemented due to concerns about feasibility and
      cost-effectiveness. This cohort will establish a pragmatic feasible 'treat to target'
      approach in a real-life clinic population which we believe can provide similar clinical and
      health-related quality of life outcomes.

      The primary outcome will be the proportion of patients achieving a good response measured by
      the PsA Disease Activity Score (PASDAS) at 48 weeks. Additional domains including
      participation, fatigue and emotional wellbeing will be assessed for the first time. Finally
      the costs of this pragmatic intervention will be established using health economic
      analysis.All patients will receive treatment as usual following the current British Society
      of Rheumatology (BSR) and EULAR guidance as standard of care.

      As a cohort for a "Trials within Cohorts" or TWiCs design, the patients consenting to
      participate will also be asked if they consent to be approached for future interventional
      trials linked to the cohort and whether they consent for their data to be used as a
      comparator in these future interventional studies.
