      safety, tolerability, and efficacy of crizotinib combined with etoposide followed by
      autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for relapsed and refractory ALK-positive
      ALCL. A total of 20 patients are planned to be enrolled into the study. Patients with
      diagnosis of relapsed and refractory ALK-positive ALCL will be treated with crizotinib plus
      etoposide capsules followed by autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The
      primary end points are objective responder rate (ORR) and progression free survival(PFS) and
      the secondary end points include overall survival(OS) , and adverse events.
