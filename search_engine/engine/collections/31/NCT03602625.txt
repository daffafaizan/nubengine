      first 4 weeks of life) and raised to the leading cause of death among children under 5 years
      of age, responsible for approximately 1 million deaths in 2015. In China, the prevalence of
      preterm increased from 4~5% in 1990s to 7~10% in 2010. Preterm birth become a burden to both
      the family and society. Therefore, the risk factors of preterm birth become the critical
      issue of both Obstetrics and Neonatology. More importantly, few multicenter prospective
      studies on risk factors of preterm birth included potential reasons such as maternal
      occupation, psychology condition and lifestyles during pregnancy were conducted in China.
      Thus, the aim of our study is to explore the perinatal risk factors of preterm birth nowadays
      in China.
