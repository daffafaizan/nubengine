    
      Patients with acute rhegmatogenous retinal detachments managed by scleral buckling surgery
      will be recruited into 3 groups. (Please see attached appendix A)

      We define the area of the macula as the area within the temporal vascular arcades with the
      horizontal radius defined between the optic disc and the foveal centre.

      Group A: Macula not detached Group B: Macula partially detached i.e. detachment stops within
      the macula Group C: Macula is totally detached

      After scleral buckling surgery for the retinal detachment, the patients will be examined at
      Day 1, week 1, month1, 3 and 6. During these visits, they will be examined clinically, as
      well as undergo tests - refraction, colour vision (D-15) & contrast sensitivity testing, OCT
      and multifocal ERG. (Please see attaced visit schedule).
