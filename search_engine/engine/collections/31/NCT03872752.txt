      Jewish women and 52% of Arab women are obese. Diabetes rates are rising in accordance with
      the rise in obesity. Because of these factors, it is predicted that this generation will see
      increased cardiovascular disease (CVD) and decreased life expectancy. Sustained lifestyle
      changes including small changes in nutrition behavior, can substantially reduce the risk of
      CVD.

      Eating habits are affected by different abilities, circumstances, and skill sets, however,
      most nutrition programs focus on nutrition facts, and less on skills that can help translate
      knowledge to positive health behaviors and health outcomes. In the last decade a new field
      has emerged, Food literacy (FL), which acknowledges the importance of addressing skills such
      as nutrition knowledge, competencies, self-efficacy, literacy and health literacy, so as to
      enable positive change in nutrition behaviors. FL, in summary, is the capability to make
      healthy food choices in different contexts, settings and situations.

      The proposed program seeks to improve nutrition behaviors in disadvantaged communities via a
      train-the-trainers program, that will provide community leaders with the tools necessary to
      disseminate food literacy skills through the framework of existing community
      social-structures.

      In stage I of the study, community lay leaders from pre-existing community frameworks of Belz
      Hasidic Haredi community and Arab lay leaders from East Jerusalem will undergo training in a
      manualized program that enables lay leaders to effectively disseminate FL skills through
      engaging visual and game-based tools.In stage II the lay leaders will implement the program
      in their communities.
