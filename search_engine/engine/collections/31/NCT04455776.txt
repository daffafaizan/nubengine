      under sedation. Propofol is a common drug used in this settings. In our institution, sedation
      is most often done by a propofol bolus of 2-5 mg/kg in order to reach a deep level of
      sedation as defined by Coté et al. If judged necessary by the attending anaesthesiologist, a
      additional propofol bolus of 0.5-1 mg/kg may be given. For longer lasting exams, the
      attending anaesthesiologist can chose to use a continuous infusion of propofol. The
      investigators will review the charts of 4 month of magnetic resonance imaging, which will
      give us a cohort of about 100 patients. Baseline characteristics, detailed sedation technique
      used will be recorded. Adverse events defined as:

        -  Oxygen desaturation measured by transcutaneous oximetry SpO2≤94%

        -  hypercapnia measure by end-tidal CO2 >45 mm Hg

        -  movement of the patient

      Assuming a non-normal distribution (tested by a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test), variables will be
      reported as median and interquartile range. Statistical tests will be done by non-parametric
      tests, Mann Whitney U. Non continuous variables will be analyzed by a Chi-square test.
