      included in the study with a recruitment goal of 144 completers. A group of 80 healthy
      subjects with a history of military service during the period of OIF without a history of
      deployment and without PTSD and 80 healthy subjects with a history of deployment without PTSD
      will serve as comparator groups. All subjects will undergo baseline imaging of the brain with
      PET FDG and with measurement of brain blood flow during a memory task and with exposure to
      trauma related reminders (slides and sounds) and MRI and baseline psychometric assessments,
      following which PTSD subjects will be randomized to receive paroxetine or placebo for three
      months, with repeat imaging and assessments. After this PTSD subjects will be treated with
      three months of open label paroxetine, followed by a repeat of imaging and assessments. This
      will be an intent to treat analysis, therefore all subjects who were randomized and took at
      least one dose of study medication will be assessed at three months, regardless of whether
      they were able to stay on study medication. This will complement our currently VA Clinical
      Trial Merit funded application to measure hippocampal volume, NAA, and cortisol response to
      stress before and after early intervention with paroxetine in returning Iraq vets with early
      PTSD.
