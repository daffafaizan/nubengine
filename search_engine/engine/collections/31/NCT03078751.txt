      ribociclib to standard adjuvant endocrine therapy (ET) in patients with hormone receptor (HR)
      positive, Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor2 (HER2) negative high risk early breast
      cancer (EBC).

      Originally, this was a randomized, Phase III, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center,
      international study to evaluate efficacy and safety of ribociclib with ET as an adjuvant
      treatment in patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative, high risk EBC.

      Patients were randomized at a ratio of 1:1 to receive either ribociclib or placebo for
      approximately 24 months in combination with a standard adjuvant ET with ET continued for at
      least 60 months.

      However, following a review of the ribociclib development program strategy, a decision was
      taken to explore a different approach by initiating a single Phase III study for simplicity
      of trial logistics and for the purpose of analyzing the overall population through a single
      clinical trial. Therefore, this study was closed to enrollment early and was amended to be an
      open label, multi-center Phase II study conducted in the US only. All randomized patients
      were unblinded; patients randomized to placebo were permanently discontinued from the study
      and patients randomized to ribociclib were offered the option to continue treatment with
      ribociclib + ET.

      The study included a screening phase (28 days), a treatment phase composed of maximum of 26
      cycles of ribociclib in combination with ET (approximately 24 months) or until disease
      recurrence, intolerable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or discontinuation from the study
      treatment for any other reason, whichever was earlier, and a 30 days safety follow up from
      last dose of ribociclib. Ribociclib was given orally once a day on days 1 to 21 in each 28
      days cycle.

      Safety was assessed for each patient until 30 days after the last dose of ribociclib and
      included routine safety monitoring except in case of death, loss to follow up or withdrawal
      of consent.
