      such as patients with hematologic malignancies and/or hematopoietic stem cell transplant.
      These patients can be infected by a broad range of potential pathogens, including viral,
      bacterial, and fungal etiologies and sometimes with multiple pathogens simultaneously.
      Diagnostic testing often fails to identify a microbial etiology for lower respiratory illness
      even with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). In fact, culture methods, PCR, and antigen testing on
      BAL samples yields a positive result only 30-67% of the time. Additionally, Idiopathic
      Pulmonary Syndrome (IPS), a non-infectious pulmonary complication of transplant, can have
      many overlapping symptoms with infectious pneumonia. Treatment for IPS is administration of
      steroids which can exacerbate infections. Given these reasons, there is a need for better
      diagnostics to aid in the management of immunocompromised patients with pneumonia.

      Karius has developed a microbial cell-free plasma next-generation sequencing test for
      pathogen detection capable of detecting >1,000 organisms including DNA viruses, bacteria,
      yeasts, molds, and other eukaryotic pathogens. The test is performed in a
      CLIA-certified/CAP-accredited laboratory with results typically provided within one day from
      sample receipt. Given the need for a more sensitive diagnostic test for pneumonia in this
      population, we are evaluating the performance of the Karius Test for pathogen detection.
