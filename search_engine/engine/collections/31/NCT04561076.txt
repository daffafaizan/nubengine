    
      A randomized, double-blind, single-dose by intravenous administration, placebo-controlled,
      dose escalation, first-in-human study is proposed to evaluate the safety, PK, and
      immunogenicity of HLX70 in healthy subjects. The investigators plan to enroll 8 subjects in
      each of the 3 dose cohorts at 3 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, and 30 mg/kg, of which 2 receive intravenous
      injections of placebo and 6 receive intravenous injections of the investigational product
      (IP). A total of 24 subjects will be enrolled.
