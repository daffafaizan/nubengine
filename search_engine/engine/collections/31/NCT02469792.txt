      liposuction from front abdominal wall under local anesthesia. After that autologous ADRC will
      be extracted using Celution 800/CRS System (Cytori Therapeutics Inc) from harvested adipose
      tissue. Same day patients will undergo knee arthroscopic surgery followed by one-time
      intraarticular freshly isolated ADRC administration (directly into anterior cruciate ligament
      close to the rupture).
