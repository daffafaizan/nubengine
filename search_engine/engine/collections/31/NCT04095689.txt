      interleukin 12 (IL-12) gene therapy and L-NMMA to pembrolizumab in patients with early-stage
      triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) receiving standard of care neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
      Chemotherapy given before breast cancer surgery is called neoadjuvant chemotherapy. It
      shrinks the breast tumor so it is easier to remove during surgery. Docetaxel, doxorubicin,
      and cyclophosphamide chemotherapy (called TAC chemotherapy) is often used for the neoadjuvant
      treatment of breast cancer. Unfortunately, a lot of breast tumors do not shrink with TAC
      chemotherapy treatment.

      Pembrolizumab is a type of treatment that stimulates your own immune system to attack cancer
      cells. Your immune system is normally your body's first defense against threats like cancer.
      However, sometimes cancer cells produce signals that prevent the immune system from detecting
      and killing them. Pembrolizumab helps your immune system so it can detect and attack cancer
      cells. Chemotherapy plus pembrolizumab has been shown to be better than chemotherapy alone
      for shrinking breast tumors before surgery. To increase the cancer-fighting ability of your
      immune system, you will be given 1 or 2 more treatments. These include IL-12 gene therapy and
      L-NMMA.
