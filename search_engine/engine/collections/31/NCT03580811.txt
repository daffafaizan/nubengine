      from 4 to 13. Any implant system is acceptable since the objective of the study is to
      evaluate soft tissue contour due to graft placement, not to evaluate the implant. Once
      selected for participation immediately prior to treatment, they are randomized for a
      treatment group by a coin toss. Fifteen patients will receive Alloderm alone (Positive
      Control Group) while another fifteen will receive Alloderm plus Bovine derived Xenograft
      (Test Group). The graft will be placed simultaneously with the dental implant. A blinded
      examiner Dr.Jodie Lusby will be used. Should the examiner become unblinded the subject will
      be excluded from the study. Means and standard deviations will be calculated for all
      parameters. A paired test will be used to evaluate the statistical significance of the
      differences between initial and final data. An unpaired t-test will be used to evaluate
      statistical differences between the test and control groups. A sample size of 12 will afford
      ≥ 80% statistical power to detect a difference of 0.4 mm soft tissue thickness between
      groups. P value will be set at p≤0.05.
