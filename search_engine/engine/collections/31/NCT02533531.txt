    
      This study is a two-phase evaluation of the use of a 1 Lead Patch System to monitor
      electrocardiogram (ECG) data and send the data to the LifeWatch Service Center, in the same
      manner as the existing ACT ambulatory telemetry system. It will be used in parallel with the
      standard 3 Lead ACT testing equipment used to monitor ECG outside the hospital. This study
      will not address safety or effectiveness and no comparator groups will be used. This study
      will not be treating any particular disease or condition and no randomization or blinding is
      required. Subjects will be selected in conjunction with their need for current outpatient
      telemetry monitoring.
