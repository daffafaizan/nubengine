      world each year.

      One in five people who survive brain haemorrhage have an irregular heart rhythm called
      'atrial fibrillation', which puts them at risk of stroke and other blood clots.

      Blood-thinning medicines, known as 'anticoagulant' drugs, are used in everyday clinical
      practice to protect people with atrial fibrillation from developing blood clots. However,
      these drugs also increase the risk of bleeding and are usually stopped when the brain
      haemorrhage occurs.

      But when patients recover from brain haemorrhage, they and their doctors are often uncertain
      about whether to start or stop these drugs to prevent further clots occurring, or whether to
      avoid them in case they increase the risk of brain haemorrhage happening again.

      Investigators want to find out whether starting or not starting an anticoagulant drugs is
      better for those patients.

      A network of hospital doctors, nurses, and other staff will identify people who survive brain
      haemorrhage and have atrial fibrillation. If a patient and their doctor are uncertain about
      whether to start an anticoagulant drug, they may invite the patient to participate.

      In the pilot phase, investigators aim to recruit at least 60 participants to determine the
      feasibility of recruiting the target sample size of at least 190 participants in the safety
      phase of the trial.

      Investigators will follow-up all participants for at least one year to determine whether
      prescribing an anticoagulant drug reduces the occurrence of all serious vascular events like
      heart attack, stroke compared with a policy of avoiding oral anticoagulant.
