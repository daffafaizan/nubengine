      blood glucose level. Low GI foods are recommended as Participants will have a lower impact on
      blood glucose concentrations. The research sets out to determine the effect of GI on 24 hour
      blood glucose profiles in healthy Chinese male participants. There will be two test sessions
      where participants will consume either a high or low GI breakfast, lunch, snack and dinner.
      Participants will take part in two test sessions (each spanning over 3 days and to monitor
      the participants' glycemic response using a Continuous Glucose Monitoring System (CGMS)
      throughout the period.This study specifically attempts to see how having high and low GI
      locally consumed meals impact on blood glucose.
