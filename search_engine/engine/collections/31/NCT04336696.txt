      retrospectively. patients ablated by total thyroidectomy only who failed to achieve ablation
      with the first dose of iodine 131I may be dynamically risk stratified as high-risk category
      and managed aggressively. N0 patients will benefit and ablated by total thyroidectomy and
      prophylactic central neck dissection, PCND decreases the residual, increase the RFS and
      patients without residual do not need adjuvant RAI therapy except in high risk group.
      Histological grading, size of the primary tumour, the extension of PTC, the extent of surgery
      were found to be a strong predicting factor for recurrence-free survival

      Locoregional recurrence cases always found more in male patients aged more than 45 years old.
      Size of the primary tumour and the extent of surgery was a significant factor for RFS,
