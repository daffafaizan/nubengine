      progression from an early or intermediate stage is crucial, since prompt intervention after a
      choroidal neovascularization (CNV) event and geographic atrophy (GA) monitoring can greatly
      improve visual outcomes. Patients at higher risk of progression should have more frequent
      follow-up visits, since progression often occurs before any visual changes are noticed by the
      patient. Previous work has determined the risk factors for AMD progression based on drusen
      features in fundus photos, Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and from genetic factors.
      However, current models are limited by their ability to make predictions over short
      intervals, which limits their utility in guiding screening intervals.

      In this study we will recruit patients with early and intermediate AMD in at least one eye
      who are at risk of converting to wet AMD or GA expansion. We will perform a randomized trial
      where we will randomly assign them to a control or test group (personalized follow-up care
      starting at 3 months based on their predicted risk from algorithm results), and collect
      baseline genetic, demographic, imaging, and clinical data and first follow-up data at the 3
      month and 6 month follow-up time points. Outcomes will be measured to determine if an
      algorithm predicting early follow-up for high-risk patients (3 month) is advantageous over
      the standard 6 month follow-up time point.
