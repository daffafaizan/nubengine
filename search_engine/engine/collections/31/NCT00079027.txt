      Primary

        -  Compare the survival of patients with advanced unresectable primary hepatocellular
           carcinoma treated with intravenous doxorubicin hydrochloride vs doxorubicin
           hydrochloride chemoembolization.

      Secondary

        -  Compare the response rate in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare time to progression in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the toxicity of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Compare the quality of life of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the health economic implications of these regimens in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, controlled, multicenter study. Patients are stratified
      according to participating center, stage of disease, and alpha-fetoprotein levels (< 500
      ng/mL vs â‰¥ 500 ng/mL). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I (control arm): Patients receive doxorubicin hydrochloride IV over 3-5 minutes on
           day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease
           progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm II (chemoembolization arm): Patients undergo transarterial chemoembolization using
           DC Bead and doxorubicin hydrochloride. Chemoembolization repeats every 8 weeks for a
           total of 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline and at weeks 10 and 24.

      Patients are followed at 4 weeks and then every 12 weeks thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 280 patients (140 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
