      about 85% of all lung cancer cases, which is the leading cause of cancer mortality, and
      adenocarcinoma is the most prevalent subtype. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
      adenosine triphosphate-competitive tyrosine kinase inhibitors gefitinib showed success in the
      treatment of advanced adenocarcinoma NSCLC following the failure of front-line chemotherapy.
      However, the efficiency of treatment as second or third-line in patients with advanced
      adenocarcinoma NSCLC is also low. It is necessary to further improve the efficiency of
      treatment in patients with advanced NSCLC. Biological treatment is an effective adjuvant
      treatment in comprehensive cancer treatment. Immunotherapy with cytokine-induced killer cells
      (CIK) characterized as fast amplification, strong anti-cancer activity and broad anti-tumor
      spectrum, this effect may improve tumor control and survival, as well as a better quality of
      life. This study is to evaluate the efficacy of Autologous CIK Transfusion plus Gefitinib for
      advanced, recurrence, metastatic adenocarcinoma NSCLC.
