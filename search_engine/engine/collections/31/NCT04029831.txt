      various medical procedures such as Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangio-pancreatography (ERCP).
      The addition of ketamine to propofol may counteract the effect of respiratory and
      cardiovascular depression of propofol. There has been limited studies evaluating the sedation
      effect of different ketofol dose ratios associated with hemodynamic changes, recovery time,
      dose and side effect. Thus, the study was aimed to compare the effect of ketofol between 6:1
      and 4:1 ratio in patients who underwent ERCP
