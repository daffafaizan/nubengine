    
      ESRD patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism in 3 hemodialysis centers were enrolled.
      They were assigned to either oral daily or pulse (trice a week) alfacalcidol treatments using
      block-of-4 randomization. Alfacalcidol in both groups were equal at the dose of 6 microgram
      per week. Clinical and laboratory data were obtained at baseline and were monitored every 4
      weeks for 12 weeks. Primary outcome was the difference of the mean PTH reduction between two
      groups at the end of the study by unpaired-T test. All possible adverse events were carefully
      monitored.
