      destruction and inadequate platelet production. Its incidence is of three cases per 100,000
      people a year, with a prevalence in women in young and older adults.

      Splenectomy is, still today, the therapeutic approach that offers a bigger guarantee of a
      long term response (around 60+70%). Nevertheless, splenectomy may be accompanied by
      peri-operative complications in almost 10% of patients, which in rare cases may be fatal.
      These are normally hemorrhagic complications due to low platelet count. Thus, a previous
      therapy to increase platelets is advisable before any splenectomy.

      In patients who are refractory to corticosteroids and immunoglobulins or when its use is not
      indicated, splenectomy has a potential risk of more complications. Since the last few years,
      we count with TPO-mimetic drugs, specific for c-MPL receptor, able to stimulate platelet
      production, such as romiplostim and eltrombopag.

      Nowadays, TPO-mimetics are allowed in Italy when patients refuse splenectomy or when
      splenectomy is not contraindicated, but being ITP with a low platelet count (< 20-50.000/mmc)
      a potential contraindication to splenectomy due to hemorrhagic events, these drugs should be
      considered. Nevertheless, there are no data on therapeutic risks and safety of these agents
      when used for this indication. The aim of the present study is to verify, on an Italian
      national scale, the frequency of use, its impact and the safety profile.
