        -  Determine the incidence and types of acute complications in patients undergoing
           stereotactic radiosurgery for brain tumors or other brain disorders.

        -  Determine the time frame for development and resolution of these complications in these
           patients.

        -  Determine the severity of these complications in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo stereotactic radiosurgery. Patients also complete questionnaires
      about the side effects they experience from radiosurgery. The questionnaires are completed at
      baseline and at 1 week, 1 month, and 2 months after radiosurgery.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 94 patients will be accrued for this study.
