      These patients will undergo a preparative regimen of Fludarabine/Cyclophosphamide/TBI
      followed by haploidentical bone marrow transplantation. Post-transplant Cyclophosphamide will
      be administered on Days 3 & 4. Immunosuppression with Tacrolimus and MMF will begin on Day
      +5; MMF will be discontinued on Day +35 while Tacrolimus continues until Day +180.
      Investigators hypothesize that haploidentical transplantation with the above-mentioned
      preparative regimen will have a <30% graft failure rate. The one-sided exact Binomial test at
      5% significance level will be used to test this hypothesis. The size of 20 patients provides
      the power of 92.5% for confirming the 30-day graft failure rate <30%.
