      anxiety disorder in primary and specialized care. Factors that may influence remission such
      as disease history and severity of the anxiety disorder, the type of treatment, the presence
      of co-morbid depression or anxiety disorder as well as socio-demographic factors will also be
      evaluated. The study will also assess patient functioning and compare functioning in patients
      who do and do not achieve remission.

      The objectives of the study are:

      Primary: To determine the prevalence of remission in patients treated for generalized anxiety
      disorder in primary care and specialized care. Secondary: To determine patient functioning
      and work loss days and compare these in patients who do or do not achieve remission. To
      determine the effect of disease factors on remission rate such as disease history, duration,
      severity, co-morbidity with depression or other anxiety disorders. To determine the effect of
      treatment factors on remission rate such as setting, type of treatment, duration and
      adherence. To determine the effect of socio-demographic factors on remission rate such as
      gender, age, region (language), marital status, educational level and employment status.

      This will be a cross-sectional observational study looking at the point prevalence of
      remission in treated patients with generalized anxiety disorder in general practice and
      specialized care in Belgium. General practitioners and psychiatrists will assess remission
      rates in patients treated for generalized anxiety disorder during 1 routine visit of these
      patients.

      The participating physicians will have 3 months to evaluate remission at a routine visit in 5
      to 10 patients that have been treated for generalized anxiety disorder since at least 3
      months
