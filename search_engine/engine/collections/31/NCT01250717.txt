           chemotherapy will be placed in a bag of fluid and will be given by vein every three
           weeks. Participants will take Decadron (dexamethasone) by mouth 12 hours and 1 hour
           before docetaxel and again 12 hours after docetaxel. They will also take estramustine
           and casodex by mouth at home. Zoladex (or lupron) will be given subcutaneously (under
           the skin) 4 times every three months. They will also be started on coumadin beginning at
           the time of the first docetaxel infusion and continuing until 3 weeks after the 4th
           cycle of chemotherapy.

        -  After 2 months (or cycles) of therapy, participants will be evaluated in order to assess
           the response and toxicity of treatment, including a review of medical history, physical
           examination, blood tests, including PSA. If there is no evidence of progression or
           excessive toxicity, treatment will continue for 2 more months in the same manner.

        -  At the end of 4 months of chemotherapy, participants will be reassessed by the medical
           oncologist and urologist regarding surgery to remove the prostate.
