      addresses both health and behavioral domains through a family-based intervention. The
      home-delivered prevention intervention includes content on strengthening positive behaviors
      in children, managing misbehavior, and addressing healthy lifestyle choices. Families engage
      in practical skill building and have the opportunity to practice these skills and receive
      feedback.
