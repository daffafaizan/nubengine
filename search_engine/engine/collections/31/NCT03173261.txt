      systematic review showing pooled sensitivity of 88% and pooled specificity of 98% for
      diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis, but evidence (as of March 2012) for using Xpert MTB/RIF
      for diagnosing extra pulmonary tuberculosis is still comparatively weak Globally, there is
      still a dearth of studies involving the use of Xpert MTB/RIF in extra pulmonary tuberculosis
      specimens, and few provide definitive answers. This is due mostly to the studies having small
      sample sizes across a range of various specimen types and differences in pre-processing
      methodologies and in input volumes and to studies having been conducted in different
      populations (adults, children, Human immunodeficiency virus infected).
