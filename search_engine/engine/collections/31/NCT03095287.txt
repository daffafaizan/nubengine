      (BU) will be screened before the planned start of ITI treatment. Subjects continuing to meet
      the entrance criteria will enter the ITI Treatment Phase and receive daily doses of Alphanate
      100 IU/kg/day for up to 33 months, with a one-time option to increase to a dosing regimen of
      200 IU/kg/day at any time after 90 days of ITI treatment.

      Subjects will continue to receive their daily Alphanate dose for up to 33 months until the
      titer is negative (<0.6 BU) on 2 consecutive assessments and treatment success is confirmed
      by FVIII:C pharmacokinetic assessments, at which time they will enter the 12 month
      Prophylactic Phase.

      In addition, subjects who have achieved partial immune tolerance at the completion of 33
      months of ITI treatment will enter the 12-month Prophylactic Phase. Subjects who do not
      achieve partial immune tolerance at the completion of 33 months of ITI treatment will be
      discontinued as treatment failures.

      The Prophylactic Phase begins with an 8 week taper period for subjects tolerized with 100
      IU/kg/day or with a 12-week taper period for subjects tolerized with 200 IU/kg/day to bring
      the dose down in a step-wise manner to a prophylactic dose of Alphanate 50 IU/kg every other
      day or 3 times per week, at the investigator's discretion. During the Prophylactic Phase,
      subjects will be monitored monthly for the first 4 months and then every 2 months for the
      remaining 8 months to assess sustainability of immune tolerance.
