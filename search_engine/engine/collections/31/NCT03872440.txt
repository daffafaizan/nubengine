    
      EGFR mutations are detected in approximately 15% of all patients diagnosed with lung cancer.
      There are several types of EGFR mutations including both the common L858R and exon 19
      deletions (accounting for 85%) or the rare exon 20 insertion (accounting for 5-8%) EGFR
      mutations.

      Different types of therapies are being used for these two groups of EGFR mutations.
      Osimertinib is an EGFR inhibitor approved for patients newly diagnosed with EGFR exon 19 or
      L858R mutations and for patients who have been treated with a prior EGFR inhibitor but have
      developed EGFR T790M as a resistance mechanism. In contrast, there are no approved EGFR
      inhibitors for patients with EGFR or HER2 exon 20 insertion mutations although several
      therapies are under evaluation in clinical trials.

      The Addario Lung Cancer Medical Institute (ALCMI) would like to focus on studying the cancers
      of patients previously treated with osimertinib or those with EGFR or HER2 exon 20 insertion
      mutations. The goal is to better understand how these tumors respond to drugs, and what
      happens when tumors stop responding to drugs. By studying these cancers ALCMI hopes to
      accelerate the development of new therapeutic approaches for patients with EGFR mutant lung
      cancer.
