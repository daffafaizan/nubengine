      However, 10-15% of direct maternal deaths are associated with Pre-eclampsia and
      eclampsia(WHO, 2011). There is a considerable evidence that generalized endothelial
      dysfunction underlies the clinical manifestations of the disease (Oladipupo et al., 2014).

      It has been demonstrated that peripheral nutritive blood flow is impaired in pregnancies
      complicated by pre-eclampsia and precedes onset of the disorder (Kenny et al., 2014).

      The pathophysiological mechanism is characterized by a failure of the trophoblastic invasion
      of the spiral arteries which may be associated with an increased vascular resistance of the
      uterine artery and a decreased perfusion of placenta. (Al-Jameil et al ; 2014 ) Ultrasound of
      the brachial artery, and Doppler ultrasound of the carotid artery and uterine artery are
      propaedeutic , non-invasive methods that contribute to the understanding of the
      pathophysiology of PE and Eclampsia (Takata et al., 2002 ).

      Doppler assessment of the placental circulation plays an important role in screening for
      impaired placentation and its complications of preeclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction
      and perinatal death. Assessment of the fetal circulation is essential in the better
      understanding of the pathophysiology of a wide range of pathological pregnancies and their
      clinical management(Ghidini & Vergani, 2012).
