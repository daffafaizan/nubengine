    
      OROPAP is a monocentric exploratory study with retrospective inclusion of patients.

      The retrospective study focus on patients who have had surgery for HPV-positive oropharyngeal
      tumors whose survival is at least 2 year.

      Frozen and or FFPE biopsies of these tumors and frozen blood samples are available via the
      HEGP biological resources platform.

      The HPV molecular signatures will be identified by the capture-HPV technique.

      For each patient, clinical-anatomo-pathological data such as tumor size, tumor stage,
      presence or absence of metastasis, histological stage, different treatment lines and 2-years
      survival data will be collected through the use of data warehouse available on the HEGP.
