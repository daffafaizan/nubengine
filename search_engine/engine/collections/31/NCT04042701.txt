    
      This phase 1b, open-label, 2-part, multicenter, non-randomized, multiple-dose study will
      evaluate DS-8201a in combination with pembrolizumab in participants with advanced/metastatic
      breast cancer or non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

      In the dose escalation part of the study, escalating doses of DS-8201a in combination with
      pembrolizumab will be assessed. DS-8201a and pembrolizumab 200 mg will be administered on Day
      1 of every 21-day cycle. The initial dose administered for DS8201a will be 3.2 mg/kg Q3W.
      Escalation to the next dose (5.4 mg/kg Q3W) will be based on acceptable safety signals based
      on the earlier dose cohort.

      Upon completion of dose escalation with the recommended dose of escalation (RDE) established,
      the dose expansion part of the study will begin. The dose expansion part will include 4
      cohorts: Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2+) breast cancer participants with
      prior ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1), HER2 low breast cancer participants with prior
      failed standard treatments, HER2-expressing NSCLC participants who have not received any
      prior treatment with anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or HER2 agents, and HER2-mutant NSCLC
      participants who have not received any prior treatment with anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or HER2
      agents.
