      considered for enrollment. Standard HAI therapy requires a laparotomy and placement of an
      intrahepatic arterial catheter that is connected to one of several commercially available
      subcutaneous electronic pumps. The pump is then used to deliver FUDR directly to the liver,
      usually beginning four weeks after surgery and lasts on average for a period of six to twelve
      months after the study. Current HAI therapy regimens often alternate FUDR with systemic
      chemotherapy. This study will examine the addition of a one hour isolated hepatic perfusion
      with 5-FU and Oxaliplatin prior to this standard treatment. Subjects will be given the
      consent form to review and after sufficient time to review the information, interested
      subjects will have the opportunity to ask questions of the investigators. Subjects interested
      in enrolling in the trial will then sign informed consent and clinical data will be collected
      from their chart to ensure that they meet eligibility requirements. The study will consist of
      a one hour isolated liver perfusion that will be performed at the time of the laparotomy to
      place the HAI therapy pump. Following surgery subjects will be monitored in the ICU for 24-48
      hours and potentially in the hospital for an additional 5-7 days. Subjects will be free to
      start standard HAI therapy regimens four to six weeks following surgery. The duration of
      treatment, dose of HAI therapy and the decision to combine HAI with systemic chemotherapy
      will be at the discretion of the treating physician.
