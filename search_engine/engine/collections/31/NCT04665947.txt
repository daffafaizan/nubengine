      DOTA-5G /[177Lu]Lu DOTA-ABM-5G theranostic pair in patients with locally advanced or
      metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). PET imaging using [68Ga]Ga DOTA-5G will
      be used to diagnose patients who are eligible for the [177Lu]Lu DOTA-ABM-5G. The overall
      purpose of this study is to identify the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and recommended phase 2
      dose (RP2D) of [177Lu]Lu DOTA-ABM-5G. A 3+3 study design in is proposed to identify the RP2D
      of [177Lu]Lu DOTA-ABM-5G. An expansion group will receive the RP2D in order to obtain initial
      estimates of response and additional information on safety of [177Lu]Lu DOTA-ABM-5G.

      The hypotheses of this phase I study are that a) [68Ga]Ga DOTA-5G will detect lesions in
      patients with locally advanced or metastatic pancreas cancer b) the theranostic pair [68Ga]Ga
      DOTA-5G/ [177Lu]Lu DOTA-ABM-5G will be safe and well tolerated c) we will be able to identify
      a Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) for [177Lu]Lu DOTA-ABM-5G therapy to be used in subsequent
      Phase II trials.
