      motors) to study muscle delay and how muscle fatigues for both individuals possessing
      movement disorders and healthy individuals. Individuals with movement disorders are often
      susceptible to partial or total paralysis. This paralysis often leads to an increasingly
      sedentary lifestyle. By implementing the intelligent closed-loop control of FES-cycling,
      FES-therapy can be made more effective, combating the effects of sedentary lifestyles. Using
      data obtained from non-invasive sensors, the study team will apply analytical techniques to
      quantify FES muscle delay and how well individuals can track a desired cadence as the muscle
      fatigues. A challenge associated with FES-induced cycling is that there exists a delay
      between the time when FES is applied and the time when the muscle contracts. There is
      likewise a delay between the time FES is removed and the time the muscle ceases to contract.
      Previous studies have measured this delay and determined that it varies with fatigue. A goal
      of this project is to measure this delay on an FES-cycle and to determine how this delay
      varies as a result of FES-induced cycling. Another goal is to determine what effect the crank
      angle has on the delay as well as on the muscle control effectiveness. This study will
      provide insight into how engineering can be combined with healthcare and therapy to better
      both fields and bridge the gap between engineering and medicine.
