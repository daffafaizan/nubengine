      express the CXCR4 receptor. The CXCR4 receptor is a marker of poorly differentiated cells.
      Pentixafor is a peptide that targets these CXCR4 receptors. By combining it with gallium-68,
      a radionuclide, pentixafor can then be evaluated as an imaging agent to detect high-grade
      neuroendocrine tumors.

      [68Ga]Pentixafor is a radio-labelled imaging agent used for positron emission tomography
      (PET). The dose is small, known as a tracer dose. It is designed to capture information about
      the body and how the body is working without interfering or causing an effect.

      The goal of this study is to evaluate how the [68Ga]Pentixafor is distributed through the
      body after injection and how it is taken up by the organs of the body. The study will also
      examine if the imaging is reproducible to determine if the PET images show the same uptake of
      the study drug across different scans.

      This study is an RDRC study - the equivalent to a phase 0 study. The [68Ga]Pentixafor has not
      been shown to target tumors; specificity and sensitivity have not been established. For this
      reason, images obtained for this study cannot be used clinically or shared with treating
      oncologists.
