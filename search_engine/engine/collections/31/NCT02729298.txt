      pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamic study of TP-0903 administered once daily for the first
      21 out of 28 days.

      There are 2 phases in this study. In Phase 1a (dose escalation), sequential cohorts of three
      (3) patients will be treated with escalated doses until the MTD is established. In the
      absence of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), the dose will be increased using a modified
      Fibonacci dose escalation scheme.

      Once the MTD has been established, dosing will change from BSA-dependent to a flat dose based
      on the average of the dose administered in the MTD expansion safety cohort. Once the MTD has
      been established, in Ph 1b (expansion), 5 additional cohorts of up to 20 patients each with
      specific tumor types (up to 100 additional patients total) may be enrolled at the MTD dose
      level to confirm safety, explore potential biomarkers, and evaluate potential signals of
      activity when TP-0903 is administered to specific groups of heavily pretreated patients or
      given in combination with immunotherapy or a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). Ten patients in
      each of these 5 Expansion Cohorts will be required to consent to undergo pre- and post-dose
      tumor biopsies. All patients who undergo these biopsies will comprise the 'Biopsy Cohorts'
      (Phase 1b).

      Patients who successfully complete a 4-week treatment cycle without evidence of significant
      treatment-related toxicity or progressive disease will be permitted to continue to receive
      treatment with the same dose and dosing schedule.
