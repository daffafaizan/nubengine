      female adult volunteers aged 18-45 years with no history of oral polio vaccination for a
      Phase I randomized controlled double-blind trial evaluating the safety, reactogenicity and
      immunogenicity of a single dose of fIPV-dMLT versus a single dose of fIPV administered
      intradermally. Study volunteers will be screened with eligible volunteers enrolled who will
      randomized to receive a single dose of fIPV-dmLT or fIPV (2:1) on study day 0. The primary
      study objective is to determine the safety and reactogenicity of a single dose of adjuvanted
      fIPV-dmLT vaccine in healthy adults, as assessed by the frequency of systemic and local
      injection site adverse reactions (ARs) defined as vaccine-related adverse events (AEs),
      graded by severity, occurring within 28 days of dosing. Secondary objectives are to determine
      the safety of a single dose of adjuvanted fIPV-dmLT vaccine in healthy adults, as assessed by
      the percentage of subjects with at least one vaccine-related serious adverse event (SAE)
      occurring within 28 days of dosing. In addition, the systemic immune response to a single
      dose of vaccine in healthy adults, as assessed by poliovirus-specific serum neutralizing
      antibody responses in fIPV-dmLT recipients versus fIPV only recipients will be examined.
