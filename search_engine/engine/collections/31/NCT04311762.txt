      into lung tumors using endobronchial ultrasound guided-transbronchial needle injection
      (EBUS-TBNI). This technique relies on the use of a bronchoscope with an integrated ultrasound
      transducer allowing real-time visualization of, and delivery of cisplatin into, tumors lying
      in proximity to the central airways. Prior work has utilized this technique to treat loco
      regional recurrence in a previously radiated field. The goal of the current study is to
      identify the initial dose for intratumoral cisplatin.
