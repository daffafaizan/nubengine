      be asked to refrain from alcohol for 24 hours. Tea and coffee will not be permitted for at
      least 12 hours before each visit. Studies will be conducted in a quiet,
      temperature-controlled room.

      On arrival at the Clinical Research Centre on the study day, a brief medical enquiry and
      examination will confirm the ongoing suitability of the subject for the study. An intravenous
      cannula will be inserted into the antecubital fossa of each arm. We have developed a basic
      protocol described fully in our previous studies that allows us to measure systemic
      haemodynamics by the well validated technique of bioimpedance and renal function by standard
      para-aminohippurate (PAH; renal blood flow) and inulin (glomerular filtration rate) clearance
      studies.

      Urinary protein excretion will be measured by collecting urine over 30 minute time periods.
      To ascertain the contribution of renal haemodynamics to any change in protein excretion renal
      blood flow and glomerular filtration rate will be measured. In addition, blood and urine will
      also be assayed for sodium, creatinine and osmolality to allow calculation of fractional
      excretion of sodium and free water clearance.

      Systemic haemodynamic monitoring will be performed at 15 minute intervals during drug/placebo
      administration and at 30 minute intervals outwith these periods.
