    
      This is a clinical study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of ZYT1,
      following oral administrations in healthy volunteers.

      The study is divided into four plans as given below:

        1. Plan I: Single dose escalation trial: A study is to evaluate safety, tolerability and PK
           of ZYT1 in healthy volunteers.

        2. Plan II: Multiple dose escalation trial: A study is to evaluate safety, tolerability, PK
           and, if demonstrated, capture the Pharmacodynamics of ZYT1 in healthy volunteers.

        3. Plan III: Food effect trial Effect of food on pharmacokinetics will be studied in a
           cross over study, with selected dose and based on limit of detection of the
           investigational medicinal product (IMP) in analytical methods.

        4. Plan IV: Gender Effect trial . The gender effect study will be conducted after the
           completion of Panel S5 of single dose safety and tolerability study

      The safety and tolerability shall be evaluated using physical examinations, Standard
      laboratory tests (hematology, biochemistry and urine examination), electrocardiogram (ECG)
      and thyroid scanning. Spontaneously reported and solicited adverse events will also be used
      for safety parameters.
