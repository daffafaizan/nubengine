      Infections due to S. aureus in children, particularly those due to methicillin resistant S.
      aureus (MRSA), are a growing world-wide public health concern.

      Daptomycin, a cyclic lipopeptide antibacterial agent, shows rapid in vitro bactericidal
      activity with concentration-dependent killing for Gram-positive organisms, including S.
      aureus. Surveillance studies have demonstrated a daptomycin MIC90 of 0.5Âµg/ml for both
      methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) and MRSA with >99% of MRSA isolates being
      categorized as susceptible by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), European Committee of
      antimicrobial susceptibility testing (EUCAST) and Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute
      (CLSI) breakpoints (5). Clinical trials in adults demonstrated that daptomycin was safe and
      efficacious in complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSI) and bloodstream
      infections caused by S. aureus, including right-sided infective endocarditis (RIE). However,
      information on the safety and efficacy of daptomycin for use in children is lacking.

      The intent of this study in children is to confirm the safety of daptomycin at mean steady
      state systemic exposures (AUC) similar to those reported for adults treated at 6 mg/kg for
      bacteremia.
