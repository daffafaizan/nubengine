      employed for PEDs in AMD, including laser therapies and intravitreal injections of anti-VEGF
      antibodies. However, eyes with PEDs were excluded from the larger clinical trials that used
      macular laser, photodynamic therapy, or ranibizumab to treat neovascular AMD; therefore, the
      efficacy of such options is still unclear for eyes with PEDs in neovascular AMD.
      Additionally, PED lesions have been reported to show less morphological and functional
      response to anti-VEGF monotherapy than eyes with other CNV lesions subtypes.

      Based on the generally poor prognosis of PEDs and the lack of sufficient data in the
      literature regarding the effectiveness of fixed monthly dosing of LucentisÂ® (Ranibizumab)
      therapy, the investigators designed a prospective study to evaluate the effect of intensive
      fixed monthly dosing of Ranibizumab for the treatment of SRF associated with PED in
      neovascular AMD which is persistent to previous anti-VEGF monotherapy.
