    
      Hypothesis Alemtuzumab manifests efficacy (e.g. improved MS Severity score, and treatment
      stability in relapse rate and Expanded Disability Status Scale [EDSS] progression) and
      serious adverse events (SAEs) equivalent or better than standard of care treatment strategies
      used prior to treatment for treatment-refractory multiple sclerosis.

      Objectives Treat prospectively documented clinic patients treatment-refractory multiple
      sclerosis that are na√Øve to alemtuzumab.

      Obtain retrospective disability, relapse, and adverse events in alemtuzumab-experienced
      subjects previously treated outside of clinical trial settings for treatment-refractory MS.

      Obtain prospective safety and efficacy data for multiple sclerosis symptoms, disability, and
      adverse effects following the use of alemtuzumab for treatment-refractory MS in a population
      with exposures to prior cytotoxic and monoclonal antibody therapy.

      Transition alemtuzumab-experienced clinic patients into a clinical trial setting for
      additional treatment with alemtuzumab as needed for refractory MS.

      Coprimary outcomes will be: change in EDSS and converted EDSS to MS Severity scale.

      Secondary outcomes: changes in annualized relapse rate, days of high dose corticosteroids,
      MRI-based cerebral volumes and burden of disease (in selected subjects), serious adverse
      events, and corticosteroid use. A questionnaire will be used to assess patient satisfaction
      with alemtuzumab as compared to prior therapies.

      Safety outcomes will be assessed and tabulated.
