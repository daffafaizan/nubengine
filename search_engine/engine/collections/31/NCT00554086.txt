      rising PSA on MAB with bicalutamide 50 mg daily will be dose escalated to MAB with 150 mg
      bicalutamide daily. Subjects will receive trial treatment for 12 months, or until disease
      progression, unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal of consent. Open label treatment will be
      offered thereafter if the subject demonstrates clinical benefit at the end of one year.
