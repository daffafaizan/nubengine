    
      This is a prospective, multi-center, split-face, randomized pilot trial to determine the
      clinical feasibility of the Ulthera System prototype simulines transducers, that is,
      transducers which deliver two lines of treatment simultaneously (at once), in comparison to
      the standard transducers which deliver a single treatment line, by collecting average pain
      scores in the treated regions, as well as efficacy and treatment efficiency data. There will
      be 3 study arms with each arm having 2 treatment groups. Enrolled participants will be
      randomized to one of two study arms, and one of two treatment groups within each study arm.to
      determine which side of the face will be treated with Ulthera System standard transducers and
      Ulthera System prototype simulines transducers and the energy level for treatment.
      Participants will receive one dual-depth treatment at 4.5 millimeter (mm) and 3.0mm depths.

      Clinical feasibility will be assessed based on comfort level of standard transducers versus
      simulines transducers by comparing average pain scores obtained during study treatment.
      Efficacy will be determined based on qualitative masked assessment of post-treatment
      photographs compared to pre-treatment photographs and quantitative eyebrow lift measurements.
      Patient satisfaction questionnaires will be obtained.
