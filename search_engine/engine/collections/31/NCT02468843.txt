      effectiveness against current symptoms. There will be two different stimulation patterns that
      will be performed and can occur at different clinic dates. Each of the stimulation patterns
      will have times varying between 2-3 hours per stage. One part of the study will deliver
      stimulation in a continuous manner, while the other part of the study will deliver
      stimulation based upon responses obtained from changes in brain wave patterns. These
      procedures can be performed while in the clinic for regular programming visits or at
      different visits. The current DBS setting will be recorded and at the end of the session the
      setting will be reset to back to the previous settings. The participant will have the option
      of participating in both or just one part.

      During the visit, the participant will be analyzed for tremor and slowness by using the
      Trigno wireless Electromyography (EMG) and the Kinesia system. The system includes a unit
      composed of two modules: a wrist module, which is the size of an I-Pod and will be attached
      to the wrist over a comfortable wristband, and a sensor module, which will be placed over the
      index finger.

      The entire visit will be videotaped and UDRS (Unified Dystonia Disease Rating Scale) and
      BFMDRS (Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale) scores will be evaluated by two scorers.
      Pre-DBS "off" and "on" scores will also be taken.
