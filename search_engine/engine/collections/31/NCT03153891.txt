      medical procedures) but nature has not been examined as an intervention strategy to address
      chronic pain. Second, the mechanism though which nature might reduce the experience of pain
      is not well understood. Participants are cognitively intact individuals aged 60-90 who
      experience chronic pain and who rate their health as fair, good or excellent. Participants
      are randomly assigned to one of three conditions: virtual reality (VR) nature; VR built
      environment; or control. Researchers examine effects of VR nature exposure on the experience
      of chronic pain, pain catastrophizing, and on attention restoration as well as the relations
      among these variables.
