      with fibrotic Interstitial lung diseases (F-ILDs). eHealth could be a possible solution for
      close monitoring and detecting disease progression, at a low burden for patients and
      healthcare providers. The main aim of the I-FILE study will be to evaluate feasibility of a
      patient-led registry using home spirometry to monitor disease progression in patients with
      F-ILD. The secondary aim will be to better validate existing health-related quality of life
      questionnaires to assess the impact of disease and treatment in these patients.

      In total 500 patients with newly diagnosed F-ILD will be included. Patients will perform
      daily home spirometry in the first three months followed by once weekly measurements with a
      follow up period of 2 years. In addition, patient-reported outcomes (PROMs) will be completed
      online every 6 months. Results are encrypted and directly sent to a secured server through
      the online I-FILE application.
