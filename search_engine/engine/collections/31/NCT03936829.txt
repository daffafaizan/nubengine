      have difficulty in blood glucose management due to the presence of both severe insulin
      resistance and complete insulin deficiency. It is often necessary to use insulin doses
      several times that of other children of the same age with type 1 diabetes.

      Since autoimmune response is the main cause of panniculitis associated acquired lipodystrophy
      syndrome, immunosuppressive agents can suppress immune response, prevent and alleviate the
      progression of panniculitis and acquired lipodystrophy syndrome, and improve insulin
      resistance caused by subcutaneous fat deficiency.

      Cyclophosphamide is a classic immunosuppressive agent. This study hopes to improve insulin
      resistance of patients with panniculitis associated acquired lipodystrophy syndrome and type
      1 diabetes by cyclophosphamide treatment, thereby reducing insulin dosage and improving
      glucose metabolism.
