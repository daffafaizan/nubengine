      with Chlorambucil 6 mg/m2 daily p.o for 42 consecutive days (weeks 1-6) in combination with
      intravenous Rituximab 375mg/m2 on day 1 week 1 followed by subcutaneous Rituximab 1400mg on
      days 8, 15 and 22 (day 1 of weeks 2, 3 and 4). After restaging (CT scan to be performed
      during weeks 7-8, i.e. between d42 and d55), responding patients (CR, CRu, PR) and those with
      stable disease will be treated in part B (induction phase II). In part B, starting from d56,
      (month 3) patients will receive Chlorambucil 6 mg/m2 daily p.o for 14 consecutive days
      (d1-14) every 28 days for 4 cycles in combination with subcutaneous Rituximab 1400mg on day 1
      of each 28-day cycle. After restaging (CT scan to be performed at the end of month 6)
      responding patients and those with stable disease will be treated in part C. In Part C
      (maintenance phase) patients will be treated with subcutaneous Rituximab 1400mg every two
      months for 2 years (in total 12 injections). During maintenance phase, CT scans will be
      performed every 12 months and patients responding or with stable disease will stay on
      treatment for a total of two years as above reported.
