      opportunities of modern society. Some studies have suggested that sleep restriction would be
      an important factor in predisposing to obesity. However studies of sleep restriction in obese
      individuals have not yet been conducted. Still, the time of sleep restriction varies greatly
      between studies, making it difficult to compare results.

      The investigators aim to recruit 20 young adults, 10 obese and 10 normal weight individuals.
      The study will be conducted as a randomized, crossover study with three conditions. Each
      participant will be subjected to reduction of the beginning of sleep (from 3-7h), reduction
      of the end of sleep (from 23-3h), and normal sleep (from 23-7h), in random order, for three
      consecutive nights.

      In each condition, subjects will stay for 4 days in the laboratory. Three control meals will
      be offered. Visual analogue scales will be applied before and after each meal to assess
      hunger and appetite for different food categories. Blood samples will be collected hourly
      during 24 hours.
