      resistance in obese subjects. Yet, endurance athletes have high intramyocellular lipid
      content and very low insulin resistance. There are several explanations for this paradox.
      This study will use a new magnetic resonance imaging technique to look at the amount of fat
      in the muscle and its depletion with exercise. We hypothesize that overweight subjects will
      have higher amounts of fat and deplete this fat more slowly than lean subjects.
