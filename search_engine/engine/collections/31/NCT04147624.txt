      information and scheduled for a screening visit via virtual encounter. At the screening
      visit, participants meeting criteria are enrolled, and a baseline visit is scheduled (same
      day, or separately.) The participants are then randomized to either the test product
      (specific multi-nutrient) or placebo. Study parameters will be assessed at baseline, and 6
      months via a virtual online platform. Patients will be contacted monthly via telephone to
      promote compliance and monitor progress. An optional sample of blood may be provided by the
      participant if willing to participated in this optional sub-study.
