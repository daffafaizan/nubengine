      non-invasive brain stimulation. Therefore, the two arms of the study are 1) implementation of
      this protocol in a controlled laboratory setting and 2) implementation of this protocol in a
      patient's home, being set up by the patient but controlled remotely using a blue-tooth system
      by an investigator in a different location. The two arms of this study will occur
      successively with the first arm being completed with three patients followed by the second
      arm being completed with a second group of three patients.
