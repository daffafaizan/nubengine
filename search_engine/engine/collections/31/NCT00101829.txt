      destroying the glands that produce tears and saliva, and occurs more often in women than in
      men. Currently, there are no established disease-modifying treatments for SS. Traditional
      treatment strategies for SS primarily address dryness symptoms. Rituximab targets the CD20
      antigen on the surface of B cells, and was approved in 1997 for the treatment of patients
      with low-grade or follicular B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. In a small study, rituximab was
      also shown to relieve the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. Because SS is associated with the
      development of B cell-related cancers and rituximab has the potential to treat autoimmune
      disease, rituximab may alleviate the symptoms of SS. This study will evaluate the safety of
      rituximab in people with SS.

      This study will last 1 year. At 4 and 2 weeks before the start of the study, patients will
      undergo medical and medication history assessment, a physical exam, blood and urine
      collection, rheumatologic evaluation, an eye exam, and salivary gland tests. The screening
      visit 4 weeks before study start will also include an electrocardiogram (ECG), a chest x-ray,
      and a tuberculosis exam. Patients will receive IV rituximab at study entry and at Week 2;
      blood collection will occur prior to infusion and post-infusion for pharmacokinetics studies.
      There will be 6 follow-up study visits that will occur at Weeks 4, 8, 14, 26, 30, and 52.
      Blood and urine collection; a physical exam; rheumatologic evaluation; and eye, skin, and
      salivary gland tests will occur at selected study visits.
