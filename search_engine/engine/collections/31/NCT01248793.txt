    
      Golimumab is a type of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor. TNF is a naturally occurring
      substance in the body, and this substance may cause long-term inflammation. Golimumab may
      help fight disease by blocking the activity of TNF in the body and reducing inflammation and
      pain. Each patient who is allowed to join the study will be put into a group randomly, like
      flipping a coin. Patients may get either golimumab or placebo (which looks like the drug
      being studied but has no active ingredients, for example a sugar pill). The chance that the
      patient will get golimumab is 1 to 1, so 50% chance to receive golimumab and 50% change to
      receive placebo. Patients who do not have an improvement in total back pain and morning
      stiffness at the Week 16 visit compared to when the patients entered the study, and are in
      Group 1 (placebo group), will receive golimumab 50 mg every 4 weeks starting at Week 16. If
      the patient is in Group 2 (golimumab 50 mg), they will continue to receive golimumab every 4
      weeks starting at Week 16. If the patient is in Group 1 and still receiving placebo
      injections, because there was improvement in total back pain at Week 16, they will receive
      golimumab 50 mg every 4 weeks starting from Week 24. If the patient is in Group 2 (golimumab
      50 mg) or are already receiving golimumab injections at week 24, they will continue to
      receive golimumab every 4 weeks. Safety will be monitored throughout the study, including
      drawing blood and looking at laboratory tests, vital signs (eg, blood pressure), and the
      frequency and type of adverse events (side effects). The patient will be in the study
      approximately 56 weeks. Patients will receive placebo or active compound (golimumab 50 mg
      subcutaneous injections) every four weeks until Week 48.
