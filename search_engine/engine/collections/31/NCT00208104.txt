    
      The objective of this randomized control trial is to evaluate, among 190 African-American
      patients with poorly controlled hypertension followed in a community-based primary care
      practice, whether motivational interviewing is more effective than usual care (routine
      counseling) in achieving adherence to prescribed blood pressure medications at 12 months.

      The project aims to: 1) determine whether patients who receive motivational interview
      counseling have greater reduction in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure than those in
      the control group at 12 months. Clinic blood pressure readings will be assessed at baseline
      and at every three months thereafter for one year and 2) assess the effect of self-efficacy
      and intrinsic motivation as potential mediators of motivational interview on adherence.
      Self-efficacy and intrinsic motivation will be assessed at baseline and every three months
      thereafter for one year.
