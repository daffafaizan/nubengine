      Primary: Prophylactic administration of metabolically active insulin can prevent or delay
      clinical onset of diabetes in a high risk group of nondiabetic siblings as defined by
      positivity for autoantibodies against IA-2 (IA-2-A).

      Secondary: 1) Untreated siblings with positivity for IA-2-A develop clinical diabetes
      significantly faster than untreated offspring with the same marker positivity. 2) Plasma
      proinsulin levels increase disproportionately before clinical onset of Type 1 diabetes both
      in siblings and offspring. 3) Prophylactic administration of metabolically active insulin
      reduces the plasma proinsulin/C-peptide ratio in non-diabetic antibody positive siblings and
      offspring. 4) Prophylactic administration of metabolically active insulin reduces the
      presence and/or levels of diabetes-associated autoantibodies directed against islet cell
      components.

      Endpoints: Fasting glycemia; fasting and stimulated plasma C-peptide and proinsulin values;
      islet cell autoantibodies; incidence of hypoglycemia; body weight gain.
