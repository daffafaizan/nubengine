      associated with increased mortality and length of stay. In 2014,European guideline have
      recommended promp infusion of 3%NaCl 150 ml in 20 minutes to raise plasma Na to 5 mmol/L and
      improve symptoms. The recommendation was the result of studies with small numbers of
      patients, and expert opinions.

      Methods: A single center opened-label randomized controlled-trial,we will randomly assign 40
      patients with severe symptomatic hyponatremia (plasmaNa<125mmol/L) in Rajavithi Hospital into
      two groups:

      First group receive intermittent bolus of 3%NaCl 150 ml in 30 minutes and follow plasma
      sodium until achieve target of goal plasma sodium = 5 mmol/L in 6 hours (no more than 12
      mmol/L in 24 hr and 18 mmol/L in 48 hr),another receive traditional continuous drip of 3%NaCl
      start with rate = 1ml/kg/hr and follow plasma sodium every 1 hour until achieve target of
      plasma sodium 5 mmol/L in 6 hours .The primary end point is change in plasma sodium in 6
      hours and improvement of glasglow coma scale.The secondary end points are change in plasma
      sodium in 24,48 hours,overcorrection rate in 24 and 48 hours ,ODS rate ,hospitality days and
      mortality rate.
