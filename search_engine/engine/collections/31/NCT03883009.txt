    
      Aim 1: Descriptive epidemiology and risk factors for (post-discharge) SSI: using the
      Swissnoso SSI Surveillance data, the investigators will determine patient and institution
      level risk factors for SSI in Switzerland (with a focus on those occurring post-discharge),
      explore protective factors (such as antimicrobial prophylaxis and its timing), and describe
      the epidemiology of SSI in terms of time of occurrence, microbiology, severity, patient
      outcome, and variation by procedure type, case-mix, and hospital size.

      Aim 2: Determinants of SSI: The investigators will investigate determinants of SSI in the
      following three areas:

      A) The surveillance system itself and how the thoroughness of the surveillance process
      correlates with reported SSI rates; B) The operating room ventilation system and how its
      parameters correlate with SSI rates; and C) A healthcare institution's perceived culture of
      safety and how it correlates with infection rates.

      To do so, the investigators will enhance and complement the Swissnoso data with new
      information at the institution level.

      Aim 3: A mathematical model of surgical site infection: the investigators will construct a
      mathematical model that simulates SSI pathogenesis based on data from Swissnoso and other
      sources, and assesses the impact of different preventive measures. Interventions will be
      ranked according to the simulated reduction of SSI rates in Switzerland.
