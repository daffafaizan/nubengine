      model, also known as the Caregiver Education Model (CMM):focuses on joint
      attention/engagement intervention using an established evidence based treatment (Kasari et
      al., 2006). It involves individual interventionist meetings with the parents and their
      children in their homes for one hour, twice a week for 12 weeks. In this intervention, the
      parent-child pair meet with the interventionist (as opposed to the group training in the CEM
      condition). Parents will be specifically taught techniques for altering the home environment
      and ways to enhance children's language, social, and play development. Parents will given
      guided practice (input and coaching from the interventionist) as they implement these
      techniques with their child. (2)Parent-education intervention, also known as the Caregiver
      Education Model (CEM): focuses on teaching parents information about autism, behavior
      modification, and community services using a manualized approach (Brereton & Tonge, 2005).
      Parents will receive information on child development each week, and will be able to ask
      questions and discuss the information vis-Ã -vis their own child. This intervention is
      manualized (Brereton & Tonge 2005). In the CEM condition, parents meet in a group, without
      their children, in a community-based setting to receive the intervention. Intervention in
      both conditions occurs for 2 hours for 12 weeks.
