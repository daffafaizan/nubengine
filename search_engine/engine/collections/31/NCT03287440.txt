      disproportionately affects low socioeconomic communities. While few interventions effectively
      modify the course of COPD and improve outcomes, pulmonary rehabilitation is the one notable
      exception. However, implementation of this resource-intensive program in real-life settings,
      and in particular, for underserved communities, has proven to be challenging. Safety-net
      centers that serve primarily under-insured populations lack financial resources to provide
      pulmonary rehabilitation.

      COPD Wellness, a 10-week low-intensity pulmonary rehabilitation program consisting of group
      and home exercise, education, and social support, was developed to address this gap. This
      intervention is targeted at patients with moderate to severe COPD (GOLD Class B-D) who
      receive care through a safety-net health system. To be impactful, risk factors for low
      adherence include both disease severity and socio-environmental factors, must be addressed.
      As merely having a pulmonary rehabilitation program will not automatically lead to improved
      outcomes.

      As part of this study, an adherence strategy targeted at addressing unmet social needs to
      improve health will also be implemented. A Health Advocates program that links social needs
      screening with a tiered referral and linkage process to appropriate resources will be tested
      to see if adherence to COPD Wellness (exercise intervention) improves by addressing competing
      non-medical stressors.
