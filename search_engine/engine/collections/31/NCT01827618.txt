      inhibition and safety in patients with bladder cancer. In this presurgical setting, paired
      PMBCs and tumor tissue is evaluated before and after exposure to rapamycin to address target
      specificity, drug delivery, physiologic effects on tumor growth and apoptosis, and
      correlation of biomarkers with clinical activity.
