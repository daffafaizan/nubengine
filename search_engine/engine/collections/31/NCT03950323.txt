      procedure requires a trunk search and a facial nerve dissection along its intraparotid
      length. This intervention entails a risk of facial paralysis.

      MRI tractography is a new imaging technique that can characterize nerve fibers and their
      path.

      The interest would be to allow the surgeon to best prepare the parotidectomy by locating the
      tumor in relation to the trunk and all the branches of the facial nerve.
