      peptides, specifically B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) on adipocyte biology, energy
      expenditure and body weight could be of great significance. This study will provide insight
      into the mechanisms of dysregulation of the natriuretic peptides system in obesity and will
      contribute to delineate the roles and the clinical importance of BNP in the treatment of
      obesity.
