      weeks, followed by the maximally tolerated dose for four weeks. To maximize enrollment, the
      trial will enroll both symptomatic and asymptomatic GRN mutation carriers. The trial will
      include a four week, dose-escalation phase followed by 1-month maintenance phase, and a
      1-week taper. Assessments at the study site will take place prior to starting nimodipine,
      each week the dose is increased (weeks 1-5), after 4 weeks of maintenance dose, and 2 weeks
      after completion of the study. These will include blood chemistry tests, ECGs, and blood
      pressure. Both dose escalation and maintenance will focus on safety and tolerability of
      nimodipine treatment in this population as well as plasma progranulin levels as a biomarker
      outcome. The trial will incorporate a variety of other fluid biomarker (blood and CSF) and
      imaging assessments to determine which will be most sensitive to nimodipine pharmacodynamic
      effects in this population.
