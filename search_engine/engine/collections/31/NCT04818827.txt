      agitation/sedation, delirium, immobility, and sleep disruption in adult patients in the
      intensive care unit (ICU), nonbenzodiazepine sedatives (such as propofol and dexmedetomidine)
      are preferable to benzodiazepine sedatives (such as midazolam and lorazepam) in critically
      ill, mechanically ventilated patients. Moreover, continuous use of benzodiazepine (more than
      48 hours) has been associated with a risk of prolonged sedation and delirium. On the other
      hand, though propofol has a remarkable safety profile, it carries unfavorable side effects
      such as dose-dependent hypotension, hypertriglyceridemia, pancreatitis, and propofol syndrome
      (which is a rare but potentially fatal complication, associated with high-dose propofol
      infusions, and characterized by severe metabolic acidosis and circulatory collapse).

      During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, an enormous number of patients
      required mechanical ventilation, which led to the shortage of traditional sedatives such as
      propofol, dexmedetomidine, midazolam, and lorazepam in the hospitals. In this challenging
      time, ketamine was used as an alternative sedative infusion. This study is to evaluate
      whether ketamine is safer compared to other sedatives in severe COVID related ARDS patients.
