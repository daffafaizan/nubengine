      continues to have a dismal prognosis. Even though it has been established that Barrett's
      esophagus (BE) is the precursor lesion to EAC, more than 90% of EAC patients are never
      diagnosed with BE beforehand. Thus, the opportunity is missed to identify most patients at
      high risk for EAC who could benefit from surveillance and early endoscopic therapy, which in
      turn may lower EAC mortality. Upper endoscopy is the only means to diagnose BE, yet
      widespread endoscopic screening is impractical and expensive. There is an urgent need to
      develop minimally-invasive methods of BE screening that can be easily performed in the
      primary care setting to allow for efficient and cost-effective interventions to decrease EAC
      mortality.
