      previously had received Argon laser photocoagulation will be enrolled. These patients will
      receive corneal esthesiometry and will be divided in those with esthesiometry < 45 mm [6]
      (clinically detectable corneal neuropathy, CDCN) and not (NCDCN).

      Patients will be randomized to the two treatment arms: 20 patients will be treated with
      active treatment (OMK2) and 10 patients will be treated with placebo (lubricant eye drops)
      given three times daily (8 am, 2 pm, 8 pm) for 18 months. Stratification for (1) CDCN, (2)
      duration of the disease, and (3) insulin-dependent diabetes will be adopted.

      The randomization will be operator-masked.
