      period of applying these modifications, children will be assigned in a random fashion to take
      either fish oil supplements or a placebo (soybean/corn oil) for 8 weeks. After this 8-week
      treatment period, children will not take a supplement for 4 weeks and then will be assigned
      the alternate product (fish oil or placebo) for another 8 weeks. Our main interest is to see
      whether there is a larger decrease in triglyceride levels after taking the fish oil
      supplement compared to the placebo.

      The primary objective of this study is to determine whether omega-3 fatty acid supplements,
      given at therapeutic dosages over an 8-week period, significantly decrease elevated serum TG
      in children with CKD;

      The secondary objectives of this study are:

      i. To evaluate the effect of n-3 fatty acid supplements on total-, LDL-, and HDL-cholesterol;

      ii. To determine whether n-3 fatty acid supplements are well tolerated by our study
      participants; and

      iii. To test whether TG-lowering effects are sustained up to 4 weeks after stopping
      supplements.
