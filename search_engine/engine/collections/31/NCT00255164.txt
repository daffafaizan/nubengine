    
      This is a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, multi-center, placebo-controlled, 6 month
      maintenance study. The study is designed to compare the efficacy and safety of daily
      Dexlansoprazole MR (60 mg and 90 mg) with that of placebo, in maintaining healing of erosive
      esophagitis.

      Because the development plan for Dexlansoprazole MR formulation was revised, the results of 2
      identical studies, T-EE04-086 (this study, NCT00255164) and T-EE04-087 (NCT00255151), were
      combined and analyzed as a single larger study referred to as study T-EE04-086. A total of
      451 subjects were included in the combined analysis: 237 subjects were enrolled into Study
      T-EE04-086, and 214 subjects were enrolled into Study T-EE04-087.
