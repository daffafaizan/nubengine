    
      Infants (1 to 24 months old) are recruited in two emergency departments (Robert Debré;
      Antoine Béclère hospitals of Assistance publique - Hôpitaux de Paris) based on a respiratory
      complaint. Six characteristics are recorded (age, sex, SpO2, presence or absence of wheezing,
      other respiratory sound, initial diagnosis). Two recordings of respiratory sounds are
      obtained almost simultaneously: one with a Smartphone at the mouth (5 cm) and one with an
      electronic stetoscope (Littmann). Two expert pediatricians listen the recordings giving thee
      groups: with wheezing (agreement), without wheezing (agreement) and non agreement diagnosis.
      The recordings made with the Smartphone are subjected to the wheezing recognition algorithm
      as previously described. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPP are then evaluated. The
      algorithm will further be improved if necessary using the true negative and true positive
      recordings (those with expert agreement).
