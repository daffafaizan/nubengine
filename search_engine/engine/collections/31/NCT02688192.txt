      I. Evaluate the feasibility of the technology-enhanced (electronic accelerometer + app + 8
      weekly group sessions) fitness program in a pilot randomized clinical trial.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the effectiveness of the technology-enhanced fitness program on participants'
      cardiorespiratory fitness and muscular fitness.

      II. Examine the effects of the program on secondary outcomes of health related quality of
      life (HRQOL) and fatigue.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I (Intervention): Participants attend 8 group meetings weekly, wear an electronic
      accelerometer, engage in private social support messaging within the app and Facebook private
      groups, and then use the mobile app for 4 weeks without in-person groups.

      ARM II (WAITLIST CONTROL [WLC]): After the 6 month assessment, participants receive the
      FitSurvivor intervention as in arm I.
