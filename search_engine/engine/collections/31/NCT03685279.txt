      therapy and/or medication to treat ADHD. A systematic review by Coates and colleagues found
      behavioral interventions decreased ADHD behaviors in children. The NHA is an intervention
      designed to teach parents a set of skills and attitudes to decrease ADHD in children. It has
      been applied in a number of settings from homes, schools, and foster care agencies both in
      several states in the U.S. and in over 16 countries. While widely accepted, the Approach has
      not been evaluated using scientifically rigorous methods.
