      is eliminated. Advice is given to women with frequency/urgency symptoms to avoid coffee or
      tea, sodas or pop, or any other drinks that contain alcohol, caffeine, artificial sweeteners
      or high acidic content. Although the investigators do not know the direct cause and effect of
      consuming beverages with these ingredients, there might be reduction in "irritating"
      sensation to toilet often because of urgency if the beverages with these ingredients are
      replaced by "non-irritating" beverages.
