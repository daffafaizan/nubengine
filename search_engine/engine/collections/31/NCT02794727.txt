      Fitbit during work hours. The baseline work activity is collected at this time. This phase is
      followed by a randomization to one of 3 groups: the blinded Fitbit group, the unblinded
      Fitbit group, and the group which will not wear any activity monitors. During these 12 weeks
      we will collect data on activity levels during work hours. Everyone will have a final contact
      at week 17 to close out the study.
