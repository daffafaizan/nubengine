    
      This is a single-site, singe-arm, open-label pilot study to evaluate safety and efficacy of a
      sequential drug treatment (12 months of romosozumab injections followed by 12 months with
      alendronate tablets) to treat bone loss in women with chronic SCI and OP.

      During the first year, participants will receive monthly subcutaneous injections of
      romosozumab 210 mg. This drug works by increasing bone formation and is FDA-approved for
      treating OP in post-menopausal women at high risk of fracture or those who did not benefit
      from using other available OP treatments. During the second year, participants will take
      weekly oral alendronate 70 mg. Alendronate is FDA-approved for the treatment of osteopenia
      and the treatment of OP in post-menopausal women and men as well as for the prevention and
      treatment of glucocorticoid-induced OP. In this study, it will be used to help maintain any
      increases in bone mass gained from the year of treatment with romosozumab.

      Twelve participants will receive the study drug treatment, take daily supplements (calcium
      and vitamin D), and return to the research site for study visits over the course of two
      years. Computerized tomography (CT) imaging, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) imaging,
      and serum bone markers will be collected at baseline, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, and 24
      months.
