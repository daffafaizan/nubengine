      (CDT). This CDT is usually composed of 2 different treatment phases. The first phase is an
      acute phase which aim is to reduce affected limb volume. The second phase is a maintenance
      phase which aim is to maintain as long as possible the volume reduction acheived during the
      first phase.

      These 2 phases required multi modal parameters such as bandages, lymphatic drainages,
      physical exercises...and can be managed very differently from one site to another.
