      the nose structure. It is divided into a posterior part by the vomer and perpendicular plate
      of the ethmoid bone and an anterior part by the quadrangular cartilage .

      In the growth period, the nasal septum acts as a growth plate that affects surrounding bones
      and facial skeletal tissues .Thus, nasal septum deviation affects facial morphologic
      parameters such as interalveolar distance and maxillary rotation distance, causing
      compensatory changes in the lateral nasal wall and septal deviation,which are associated with
      nasal floor and palatal region asymmetries .

      Nasal septum deviation is the most common anatomic variation in up to 80% of healthy adults .

      From the initial growth stages, the maxillary bone and nasal structure have significant
      anatomic connections because of their close embryologic development.

      The severity of septal deviation also affects the ipsilateral lateral lamina of the
      cribriform plate width and ipsilateral middle turbinate length . Nasal septal deviation may
      affect nasal bone growth and facial morphology .Knowledge of nasal morphologic parameters
      plays an important role in planning successful rhinoplasty and septoplasty operations.

      Some morphological characteristics of the nose such as bone length and thickness may present
      different forms according to factors correlated with age, gender, climate and race.
