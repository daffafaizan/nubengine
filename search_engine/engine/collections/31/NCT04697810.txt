    
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in subjects with a
      diagnosis of NASH and F1-3 fibrosis. Subjects will undergo Screening procedures during the 6
      weeks preceding Baseline. Subjects (n = ~114) will be randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to
      oral doses of namodenoson 25 mg every 12 hours or matching placebo every 12 hours for 24
      weeks. Subjects will be evaluated regularly for safety, and efficacy biomarkers will be
      measured at Baseline and Weeks 6, 12, and 24. At Week 24, all subjects will undergo
      post-treatment liver biopsy, which will be interpreted by a blinded expert hepatopathologist.
      Subjects will return for a follow-up visit 6 weeks after completion of the last dose of study
      drug.
