      on intentions to engage in proactive behavior following a message about a health threat.
      Specifically, we propose to examine whether self-affirmation a process by which individuals
      reflect on cherished personal values differentially affects the persuasiveness of a message
      about the link between alcohol and breast cancer depending on whether individuals are in a
      particular emotional state. Previous evidence suggests that self affirmation may reduce
      defensiveness to threatening health information, increasing openness to the message and
      resulting in increased disease risk perceptions, disease-related worry, and intentions to
      engage in preventive behavior. However, self-affirmation may be differentially effective
      depending on the prior emotional state of the individual. Human subjects (women who report
      having consumed one or more alcoholic beverages in the past month) will be randomly assigned
      to write about an emotional event (something that made them happy, sad, angry, or hopeful) or
      to a neutral emotion condition (writing about a room in their house). Then, they will be
      randomly assigned to self-affirm (write about why a particular value is important to them) or
      to be in a control condition (write about why a particular value might be important to
      someone else). Following the autobiographical emotion task and self-affirmation, subjects
      will read about the link between alcohol and breast cancer. Finally, they will be asked a
      series of questions about their intentions to reduce drinking, their perceived risk of breast
      cancer, and their worry about breast cancer. Drawing on previous research, we hypothesize
      that self-affirmation will be most effective for those asked to recall a happy or angry
      experience, and least effective for those asked to recall a sad or hopeful experience
