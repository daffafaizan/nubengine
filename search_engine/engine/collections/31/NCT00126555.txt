    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Early progression rate (progression during ZD1839 induction).

      II. Feasibility of induction ZD1839 (for all patients) and concomitant ZD1839 with
      radiotherapy (for unresectable patients).

      III. Toxicities of induction ZD1839 (for all patients) and concomitant ZD1839 with
      radiotherapy (for unresectable patients).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Response: clinical responses to induction therapy.

      II. Failures: frequency and timing of local and distant failures.

      III. Biomarkers: biomarker levels in tumor and normal tissue.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. For progressive disease responders, patients will be followed for locoregional and distant
      metastases data.

      II. Feasibility of maintenance ZD1839.

      III. Toxicities of maintenance ZD1839.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 groups.

      STRATUM I (initially resectable tumor): Patients undergo radiotherapy once daily (QD) 5 days
      a week for approximately 6-7 weeks. Patients also receive gefitinib orally (PO) QD for up to
      12 months

      STRATUM II (initially unresectable tumor): Patients undergo radiotherapy QD 5 days a week for
      approximately 6-7 weeks. Patients also receive concurrent gefitinib PO QD for 6-7 weeks.
      Patients then undergo surgery. After surgery, patients receive gefitinib PO QD for up to 12
      months.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for up to 5 years.
