        -  Assess common genetic mutations in tumor and germline DNA samples from patients with
           head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).

        -  Search for viral DNAs and relate this information to demographics, tumor
           characteristics, and patient prognosis.

        -  Search for novel viral sequences and cancer-associated gene mutations in young
           nonsmoking HNSCC patients and in other distinct head and neck cancers.

        -  Determine tumor suppressor gene mutations in HNSCC patients and relate this information
           to gene expression data.

        -  Validate gene expression information using independent techniques such as real-time PCR
           on expressed sequences and immunohistochemistry.

      OUTLINE: Genetic mutation analysis and gene expression studies are performed on tissue
      samples from patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Techniques used include
      real time-PCR and immunohistochemistry.
