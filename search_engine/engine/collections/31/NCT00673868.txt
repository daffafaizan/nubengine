    
      Human cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a benign infectious agent in the normal host, but in
      immunocompromised individuals, such as recipients of stem cell or organ transplants, this
      virus is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. While pharmacologic agents exist to treat
      CMV disease, these medications have numerous side effects, the most serious of which is
      myelosuppression. Considering the risk associated with persistent infection and the potential
      for CMV specific CTL to restore immunity, we propose to study the immunologic and virologic
      effects of CMV pp65 specific CTL given to SCT recipients prophylactically, levels of CMV pp65
      specific CTL and CMV DNA will be measured from CTL recipients and a control group randomized
      to not receive CTL.

      All treatments will be given at Duke University Medical Center (DUMC).

        1. Patients will have a complete set of vital signs and physical examination prior to each
           infusion. Pulse oximetry will be monitored prior to, during, and for 30 minutes after
           the T-cell infusion. Thirty minutes prior to the CTL infusion, patients will be
           pre-medicated with 15 mg/kg (maximum 1 g) of acetaminophen p.o. and 1.0 mg/kg
           diphenhydramine I.V. (maximum 50 mg). Cells will be thawed in the Cell Therapy lab at
           DUMC, an aliquot sent for gram stain and culture, and viability will be determined.
           Cells with > 70 % viability will be transferred to the clinical unit and infused over
           5-10 minutes.

        2. CMV CTL will be infused when available between days 30 and 40 post-transplant at a dose
           ranging from 2- 5 x 105 cells/kg. This dose range was established since there may be
           variability in the numbers of CTL expanded from these donors.

      This trial intended to be a Phase 1/2 trial, but it never progressed to Phase 2 before
      completion.
