      the most common form among Caucasian patients. The glaucoma patients will be divided into
      four groups: (1) high tension glaucoma, (2) normal tension glaucoma, (3) pseudoexfoliation
      glaucoma, and (4) juvenile glaucoma. Healthy subjects are separated into two age groups.
      Vasospastic propensity will be assessed with a questionnaire: patients and subjects answering
      yes to the questions: "do you have always cold hands, even during summer time?" and "do other
      people tell you that you have cold hands?" will be classified as vasospastic, and as normals
      if they deny a history of cold hands. Blood will be drawn from an arm vein, lymphocytes will
      be isolated and mRNA of following genes will be assessed in these lymphocytes:

      Nuclear proteins: NF-kappa B, XPGC, P53, XIAP; Multi-drug resistance proteins: ABC 1, ABC 8,
      MDR 3; Adhesion protein: ICAM 1; Blood brain barrier breakdown protein: P2Y; Energy
      metabolism proteins: Adrenodoxin, Adrenodoxin-reductase, Cytochrome p450,
      Cytochrome-reductase, Alcohol-dehydrogenase; Tissue remodeling proteins: MMP 9, MMP 8, MMP
      14, TIMP 1, TIMP 2, TIMP 3, TIMP 4.
