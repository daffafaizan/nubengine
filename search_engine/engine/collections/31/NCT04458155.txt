      POC device on three sample types are compared. Interim analysis of the sample comparison was
      performed by regression analysis using Passing and Bablock, and calculating the Pearson
      correlation coefficient.

      The Li-hep Plasma vs Li-hep venous blood show a very good correlation of 1.00-1.03 with an R
      of >0.99, so the results between these sample types can be used interchangeably. For the
      capillary sample vs the Li-hep sample (both blood and plasma) the slope is 8-12% higher. With
      a 8-12% higher response, the capillary test results may not be interchangeably used with the
      other 2 sample types.

      It is remarkable that capillary samples give a higher response, since it was anticipated that
      the result may be slightly lower due to the possible dilution by interstitial fluid. The
      investigators hypothesize that the presence of the Li-heparin anti-coagulant in the venous
      draw lead to a slight reduction of the apparent cTnI concentration. By using a heparin coated
      transfer device for the capillary samples instead of an uncoated transfer device, this
      hypothesis will be tested.
