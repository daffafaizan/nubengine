      combination with lapatinib. This is done by starting at doses of both drugs lower than the
      usual doses of each when given on their own. Patients are given foretinib and lapatinib and
      are watched very closely to see what side effects they have and to make sure the side effects
      are not severe. If the side effects are not severe, then more patients are asked to join the
      study and are given higher does of foretinib and lapatinib. Patients joining the study later
      on will get higher doses of foretinib and lapatinib than patients who join earlier. This will
      continue until a dose is found that causes severe but temporary side effects. Doses higher
      than that will not be given.
