      sessions, which will more closely resemble how these interventions may be used in the context
      of smoking cessation. Second, the investigators will recruit smokers who are motivated to
      quit smoking, further increasing the clinical relevance of the research. Finally, the
      investigators will examine the effects of the interventions on actual smoking behavior within
      and outside of the laboratory setting. This may appropriately be considered a "proof of
      concept" study, as the investigators will not be powered to detect treatment outcome (smoking
      cessation) differences, nor are the interventions designed to maximize clinical smoking
      cessation outcomes.

      Participants will be randomized to receive 3-sessions of yoga instruction, 3-sessions of
      cardiovascular exercise, or to a no activity control group. Sessions will be scheduled to
      occur approximately 7 days apart, with a minimum of 4 between sessions. Mood and craving will
      be assessed before and after each session, and smoking behavior will be assessed following
      each session. Finally, a detailed cue reactivity assessment will be conducted prior to the
      first session and following the last session. Analyses will examine intervention effects on
      craving, mood, cue reactivity, and smoking behavior. In addition, the investigators will
      examine several potential mediators and moderators of intervention effects on smoking
      behavior. Finally, the investigators will continue to examine the feasibility and potential
      acceptability of each active intervention, to assist in developing future clinical
      applications of these techniques in the context of smoking cessation.
