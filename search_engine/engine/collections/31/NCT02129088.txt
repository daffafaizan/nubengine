    
      This is a Phase 1, open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention),
      single-center, and single-dose study of esketamine, in healthy elderly (Cohort 1) and adult
      (Cohort 2) participants. Cohort 1 will comprise of 14 healthy elderly participants (greater
      than or equal to [>=] 65 years) with at least 3 participants above >=75 years of age and
      Cohort 2 will comprise of 20 healthy adult participants (18 to 55 years of age, inclusive).
      The study comprises of 3 phases: a Screening phase, an open-label Treatment phase (consisting
      of 1 treatment period for Cohort 1 and 2 treatment periods for Cohort 2), and a Safety
      follow-up phase. The duration of Screening phase is of 3 weeks; duration of treatment period
      for cohort 1 is of 3 days and for cohort 2 is 3 - 5 days (In Treatment period 1: 5 days for
      the first 7 participants who will complete the additional urine and fecal collection up to 72
      hours post dose and 3 days for the last 13 participants who will be discharged after 24
      hours; in Treatment period 2: 3 days for all participants). A washout period of 5 to 10 days
      will separate each intranasal esketamine treatment regimen for Cohort 2. All participants in
      Cohort 1 will receive Treatment A (that is, esketamine 14 milligram [mg] will be
      self-administered as intranasal spray into each nostril under the direct supervision of the
      investigator or designee), whereas, all participants in Cohort 2 will receive Treatment A
      followed by Treatment B (that is, esketamine 14 mg will be self-administered as intranasal
      spray followed by self-administration of placebo solution after 5 and 10 minutes of
      esketamine administration into each nostril, under the direct supervision of the investigator
      or designee) in a fixed sequence. The total esketamine dose will be 28 mg for each regimen.
      Blood samples will be collected for evaluation of pharmacokinetic parameters pre-dose and
      until 24 hours post-dose for evaluation of pharmacokinetic parameters. Participants' safety
      will be monitored throughout the study.
