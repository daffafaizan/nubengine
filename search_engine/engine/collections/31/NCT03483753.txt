      surgery, impacting negatively on patient outcome and with high incidence rates. Vasoplegic
      syndrome is the most serious complication of SIRS and can happen after any type of surgery.
      The etiology of the vasoplegic syndrome has not yet been fully elucidated, but is known to
      occur more frequently in patients at high surgical risk, submitted to major surgeries, or in
      the presence of perioperative complications and patients with comorbidities. In this
      circumstance, the depletion of vasopressin stocks is described, which may contribute to the
      refractoriness of the shock and the lack of response to the catecholaminergic drugs. The
      standard treatment of perioperative vasoplegia has been adequate volume replacement and
      administration of vasopressors, with norepinephrine being the most commonly used. However, it
      is known that norepinephrine may have deleterious effects on the body and in 20% of patients
      with vasospastic shock it is ineffective. Previous studies have suggested benefits of adding
      vasopressin in refractory situations, especially in septic shock. Recently the VANCS study
      (Vasopressin or norepinephrine in the vasopregic shock after cardiac surgery: double-blind,
      controlled and randomized study) demonstrated superiority of vasopressin in the reversion of
      vasoplegic shock after cardiac surgery, as well as a lower incidence of renal insufficiency,
      atrial fibrillation and shorter hospitalization time. (Anesthesiology. 2017
