    
      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe), a natural
      substance available as a nutritional supplement, can influence blood levels of homocysteine
      (Hcy). More specifically, we will determine if chronic oral SAMe administration effects
      homocysteine metabolism in patients with vascular disease who have mild to moderate
      hyperhomocysteinemia through the following specific aims:

      Specific Aim 1 - To determine the effect of oral SAMe (1200 mg/day) on plasma total
      homocysteine levels in subjects with mild to moderate hyperhomocysteinemia.

      Specific Aim 2 - To determine the effect of oral SAMe (1200 mg/day) with and without
      supplementation of folate, vitamin B12 and B6, on plasma homocysteine levels in patients with
      mild to moderate hyperhomocysteinemia.

      Specific Aim 3 - To determine the effect of oral SAMe (1200 mg/day) on plasma levels pf
      asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) in subjects with mild to moderate hyperhomocysteinemia.
