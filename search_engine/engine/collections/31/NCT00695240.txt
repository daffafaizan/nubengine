      providing local anesthetic into a dissected area. To date, no studies have been conducted to
      evaluate pain control or infection with vaginal placement of catheters for pelvic organ
      prolapse surgery. To help pelvic surgeons assess the relative benefit of continuous local
      infusion of topical anesthetic following sacrospinous ligament fixation versus PCA pump, we
      compared pain scores, narcotic, anti-pruritic and anti-emetic drug usage, and wound
      complications.
