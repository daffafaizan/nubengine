      Subjects in Part 1 (Dose Escalation) will receive escalating doses of CB-03-10 based on a
      modified Fibonacci schema using a standard oncology 3+3 study design to define an MTD and a
      RP2D. Plasma PK samples will be collected at predetermined timepoints for all subjects.

      Subjects in Part 2 (Dose Expansion) of the study will receive CB-03-10 at the RP2D determined
      in the Part 1 of the study. The indications included in each group will be determined at the
      completion of Part 1 of the study by Safety Review Committee (SRC).

      Subjects will be evaluated weekly initially (for 2 cycles in Part 1 and for 1 cycle in Part
      2) and every 2 weeks thereafter. Reassessment of disease will be conducted at Week 8 and
      every 8 weeks thereafter. Subjects with evidence of response (partial or complete) will be
      re-evaluated at least 4 weeks later for confirmation.
