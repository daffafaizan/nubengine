      of the accumulation of the abnormally folded protein within the endoplasmic reticulum of the
      hepatocyte. In some individuals, the intrinsic cellular mechanisms of the hepatocyte are
      sufficient to clear adequate amounts of the abnormally folded protein such that liver disease
      does not occur. In AAT deficient individuals who develop liver disease, environmental and
      other genetic factors stress the hepatocyte, and the normal cellular mechanisms that maintain
      homeostasis are disrupted, leading to liver disease.

      For this proposal, our hypothesis is that the prevalence of liver disease in adults with AAT
      is higher than previously reported because liver injury and fibrosis is not accurately
      detected by available routine liver testing. Testing this hypothesis will require an initial
      evaluation for liver disease with liver function testing and imaging, and then histologic
      confirmation by liver biopsy.
