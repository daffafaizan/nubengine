      management of mild-moderate childhood asthma.

      The primary aim of the study is to investigate the efficacy of using herbal TCM as adjuvant
      therapy in the management of symptoms and quality of life in asthmatic patients.

      The secondary aim of the study is to investigate the improvement in pulmonary function test
      (PFT) and fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) test in asthmatic patients taking herbal TCM
      adjuvant therapy, and to monitor the safety profile of herbal TCM with regards to renal and
      liver functions.
