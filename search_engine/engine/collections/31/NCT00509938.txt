      Human lactoferrin (hLF) is a glycoprotein containing 692 amino acids and found in the saliva,
      milk, tears, and other body fluids. Peptide representing the first cationic domain, i.e. a
      peptide comprising the first eleven residues of hLF (further referred to as hLF1-11) was
      significantly more effective than the full length hLF or the peptide representing the second
      cationic domain in killing a variety of bacteria in vivo. The mechanism of action comprises a
      number of independent factors. The classical way to explain the efficacy is the direct
      killing effect, which typically is observed in vitro at relatively high concentrations. The
      results of in vitro and in vivo experiments suggest that the mechanism of action is
      predominantly through the intermediary of cells and/or components of the host as opposed to a
      direct interaction with the pathogen.

      The objective is to develop hLF1-11 as an effective and safe antibacterial and antifungal for
      the treatment of fungal and bacterial infections that develop during the neutropenia that
      results from myeloablative therapy to prepare for a haematopoietic stem cell transplant
      (HSCT) formerly referred to as bone marrow transplant. Rates of infection and related
      morbidity are high in this population making it an attractive target for testing clinically
      the proof-of-principle that hLF1-11 can provided effective treatment. Subsequently, hLF1-11
      will be developed further as a systemic antifungal agent.
