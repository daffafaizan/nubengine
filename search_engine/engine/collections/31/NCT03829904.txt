    
      Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is an enlargement of the prostate gland due to progressive
      hyperplasia of the stromal and glandular cells.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of traditional Chinese medicine (VGH-BPH1)
      in treating patients with BPH, by using the experimental BPH-1 powder, including Ji Sheng
      Shen Qi Wan and Sangpiaoxiao powder as the main prescription, and adding Wuyao, Yizhiren,
      Danshen, Yinyanghuo, Fupenzi, Huangbo and Zhimu as auxiliary ingredients, to form a 5gm per
      pack. This study is designed as a double-blinded randomized placebo-controlled cross-over
      trial to provide experimental evidence and feasibility of traditional Chinese medicine
      VGH-BPH1 in the treatment of BPH, and to analyze the syndrome pattern of Chinese medicinal
      prescriptions for subgroups of BPH.
