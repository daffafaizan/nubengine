    
      This is an open-label, cross-over, randomized pharmacokinetic study conducted in
      approximately 12 obese and 12 non obese adult subjects at one study center in Thailand.

      Subjects will receive 2 regimens in a random sequence for 2 visits.

        1. Regimen A; 75 mg single dose.

        2. Regimen B; 150 mg single dose. All dosing will be supervised and documented. Subjects
           will have 2 hospitalizations to complete visit 2 and visit 3 in their assigned sequence
           within each. Each visit will require hospitalization for about 40 hours (2 nights and 2
           days). The subject will be randomized to receive either regimen A or B on first
           admission (visit 2). Treatment allocation will be performed using computer-generated
           list of random permutations of AB sequence.

      Subjects who received regimen A will receive regimen B on second admission and vice versa,
      with more than 3 days wash out period in between. Subjects will return to the study centre
      for a follow-up visit 7-10 days after completing the last dosing assessments or withdrawing
      from the study. The total duration of study participation will be approximately 4 weeks from
      screening through follow-up.

      Assessment of the safety profile will be done after each admission by the investigating team
      before proceeding to the other regimen.
