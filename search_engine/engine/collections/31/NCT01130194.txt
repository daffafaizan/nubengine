      subcutaneous PORT. This combination chemotherapy will last six months. After the last dose of
      chemotherapy, patients will have a 2 month treatment holiday prior to undergoing stem cell
      mobilization from peripheral blood with subcutaneous injections of neupogen and mozobil.
      Patients then receive Zevalin radioimmunotherapy, and this is followed after recovery of
      blood counts, typically 3 months later, by an autologous stem cell transplant.
