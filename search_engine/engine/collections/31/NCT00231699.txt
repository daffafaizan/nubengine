    
      A randomized controlled trial was conducted in 42 pediatric patients (age 1 month-3 years,
      ASA physical status 1-2) who were scheduled for elective maxillofacial or genitourinary
      surgery. The patients were randomly allocated into 2 groups. The patient's arms, legs and
      bodies were wrapped with either plastic (study group) or cotton (control group). All patients
      received standard general anesthesia with endotracheal tube and control ventilation with a
      fresh gas flow at 1 l/min. The core temperature (rectal temperature) was recorded every 10
      minutes for 60 minutes.
