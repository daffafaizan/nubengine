      associated with primary gonadal failure in adolescence and a high morbidity and mortality
      from cardiovascular-related diseases (CVD) in adulthood. Recent studies in children and
      adolescent boys with KS have found a high prevalence of CVD risk markers, however the
      underlying mechanisms have not been explored. Our central hypothesis is that pubertal boys
      with KS have relative testosterone deficiency resulting in abnormal energy metabolism that
      predisposes them to later CVD, and that exogenous testosterone will modify these
      abnormalities.

      In this study, investigators will measure markers of cardiometabolic risk in pubertal boys
      with KS.
