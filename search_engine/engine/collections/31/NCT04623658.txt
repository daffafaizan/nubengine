      benign, SCT can lead to perinatal mortality and long-term sequelae.

      Three main risks occur throughout the evolution of SCT:

        1. A perinatal life-threatening risk related to the importance of vascularization since SCT
           can lead to a true arteriovenous fistula with the risk of cardiac failure

        2. A risk of benign or malignant tumor recurrence

        3. A risk of medium and long-term sequelae, mostly urinary and/or digestive disorders but
           also aesthetic and psychologic.

      In most cases, a prenatal diagnosis is made for which physicians are expected to give a
      prognosis and counsel parents about medium and long-term complications. However, there is no
      robust data to date correlating prenatal and postnatal features to prenatal and postnatal
      evolution of the tumor. The situation is all the more delicate as the information given by
      the physician can lead to the parent's will to terminate the pregnancy. This retrospective
      multicentric study aims at identifying prenatal and postnatal prognostic factors of SCT
      evolution during pregnancy, the occurrence of postnatal relapse after surgical excision, and
      medium- and long-term sequelae. The primary goal of this study is to improve prenatal
      parental counseling when the diagnosis of SCT is made.
