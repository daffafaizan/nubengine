        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of irinotecan administered in combination with
           temozolomide in patients with recurrent primary malignant glioma.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this combination therapy in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of irinotecan. Patients are stratified according to
      concurrent anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Tegretol, or phenobarbital vs other anticonvulsants or
      none).

      Patients receive irinotecan IV over 90 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 and oral temozolomide
      on days 1-5. Treatment continues every 43 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of irinotecan until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6
      patients experience dose limiting toxicities.
