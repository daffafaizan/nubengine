    
      This is a phase 1, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multiple-ascending dose study
      to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of UV-4B oral solution when administered to
      healthy subjects TID for 7 days. Three cohorts of 8 subjects each (6 active, 2 placebo) are
      planned and up to 2 additional cohorts may be added pending safety review of the initial
      cohorts. Safety review will occur after each cohort. Safety is evaluated through Day 15 on
      the basis of adverse event (AE) monitoring, clinical laboratory testing (hematology, serum
      chemistry, coagulation, urinalysis), vital signs, physical examinations (PE),
      electrocardiograms (ECG), and fecal occult blood testing. Blood samples are collected at
      specified intervals up to Day 10 for pharmacokinetic assessment.
