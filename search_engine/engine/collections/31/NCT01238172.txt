      diet-based intervention for prostate cancer in a broader clinical setting. Patients on AS
      will be randomized either to an intervention of centralized, telephone-based dietary
      counseling and structured dietary education or to a comparison control condition in which
      they receive the Prostate Cancer Foundation booklet. Study endpoints will include disease
      progression, incidence of treatment, and health-related quality of life.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine if a telephone-based dietary intervention compared to no intervention will
           decrease clinical progression in AS patients.

      Secondary

        -  To compare the incidence of active treatment (surgery, irradiation, local ablation, or
           androgen deprivation) in AS patients receiving dietary intervention compared to no
           intervention.

        -  To compare prostate cancer-related anxiety in AS patients receiving dietary intervention
           compared to no intervention.

        -  To compare health-related quality of life in AS patients receiving dietary intervention
           compared to no intervention.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to age (â‰¤ 70 years vs
      > 70 years), race (black or african american vs other), and baseline prostate biopsy (0-12
      months before registration vs > 12-24 months before registration). Patients are randomized to
      1 of 2 treatment arms. Please see the arms section for more information.
