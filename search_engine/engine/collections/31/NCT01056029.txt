      means to achieve higher concentrations of cytotoxic or biologically active agents at a tumor
      location while avoiding systemic toxicity. With pro-drug chemotherapy, a relatively non-toxic
      form of a cytotoxin, the pro-drug, is converted into the active cytotoxic agent at the tumor
      site or other specific location. G-202 (mipsagargin) is a thapsigargin pro-drug; it consists
      of a cytotoxic analog of thapsigargin coupled to a masking peptide which inhibits its
      biologic activity until proteolytic cleavage at the tumor site. Thapsigargin is a natural
      product with profound effects on cell viability. Thapsigargin is a non-cell-type specific
      toxin with documented ability to kill a broad spectrum of cancer cell lines as well as normal
      endothelial cells, fibroblasts and osteoblasts. It induces a rapid and pronounced increase in
      the concentration of cytosolic calcium, due to blockade of the Sarcoplasmic/Endoplasmic
      Reticulum Calcium ATPase (SERCA) pump to which it binds with high affinity. The increase in
      cytosolic calcium leads to induction of apoptosis and ensuing cell death.

      The anti-tumor effect of G-202 in humans with advanced solid tumors is not yet known.
