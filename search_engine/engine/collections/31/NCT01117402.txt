        1. To evaluate the efficacy of combination of intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) and
           brachytherapy in delivering dose escalated radiotherapy in postoperative residual /
           recurrent cases of carcinoma cervix, in terms of local control proportion and
           progression free survival (PFS)

        2. To study the late and acute toxicities associated with this treatment.

        3. Dosimetric comparison of Tomotherapy and conventional IMRT

      DESIGN: Prospective, phase II study.

      STUDY POPULATION: All patients of age < 65 years diagnosed with postsurgery recurrent
      squamous cell carcinoma cervix without previous history of radiotherapy.

      STUDY SIZE: 90 patients

      METHODOLOGY: Ninety cases of cervical cancer with postsurgery recurrence limited to the
      pelvis will be screened and taken for study if eligible after taking the informed consent.

      Patients will receive external radiation therapy using IMRT to pelvis with additional dose of
      localized radiotherapy boost with brachytherapy to the vault with weekly concurrent
      chemotherapy.

      The local recurrence rate and 5 year disease free survival rate of all the patients will be
      studied.
