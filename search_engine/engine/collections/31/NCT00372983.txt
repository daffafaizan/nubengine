      comparison to placebo, identify early signs of antiviral activity (with a quantitative
      reduction of >0.5 log10 in serum HCV RNA level (Elbeik, 2004)) and establish a safety profile
      of NOV-205 as monotherapy in subjects with chronic HCV who are non-responders to treatment
      with pegylated interferon plus ribavirin. This trial will also explore the effect of NOV-205
      on serum biochemical markers of liver damage (e.g. alanine aminotransferase, ALT) as
      indications of biologic activity. Results of this trial will guide the design of future Phase
      2 studies of NOV-205 in chronic hepatitis C subjects.
