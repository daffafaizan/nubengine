      approximately 126 subjects with a confirmed diagnosis of CD for at least three months and
      have CD involving the ileum and/or colon. Following a screening period of up to 28 days,
      subjects will be randomly allocated into one of two treatment arms: either V565 or placebo
      using a 2:1 active:placebo ratio for a treatment period of 6 weeks.

      Subjects will be treated with study drug as an add-on to any permitted stable medications
