      inclusion criteria were allowed to choose between two arms: invasive or non-invasive
      procedures.

      Volunteers who chose to enroll in the non-invasive arm were given the study product directly
      after completing the GERD Q questionnaire. A follow-up by phone was done on day 0, 3 , 6 and
      11. GERD Q questionnaire was repeated on days 11 and 28 along with a satisfaction rating.
      Adverse events were reported on a log sheet.

      Concerning the invasive arm, volunteers were given an appointment at Lebanese American
      University Medical Center Rizk Hospital to place the 24h pH-metry, after study product was
      administered. After 7-10 days, the 24h pH monitoring was done again.
