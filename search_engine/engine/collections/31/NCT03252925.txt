      curative option in the treatment of various hematological malignancies. However, it may end
      up with serious complications in various systems, including the hemostatic system. HSCT
      associated thrombotic microangiopathy(TA-TMA) is a heterogeneous, fatal disorder seen within
      100 days post-transplant and presents with thrombocytopenia, hemolysis, acute renal failure,
      mental status changes and involvement of other organs. Since the pathophysiology has not been
      clarified, there are no established treatments for TA-TMA several agents seem to have
      successful results. N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) is a small, simple molecule that began as a
      generic drug almost 40 years ago. It has since been approved by the FDA for many indications.
      Studies showed NAC reduce plasma VWF multimers and VWF multimeric size without an effect on
      the bleeding time in vitro and in vivo, thus proposed as a possible supplementary treatment
      for TTP. The investigators conducted an prospective clinical trial to evaluate the safety and
      efficiency of NAC in patients with TA-TMA.
