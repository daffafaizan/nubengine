      A blind assesor does a complete evaluation of the patients to determine if they take part of
      the study. An assesment of pain (by visual analogue scale), Pain pressure theshold (kg/cm2 by
      algometry, Range of motion (CROM goniometer in degrees) and strength (digital dinamometry in
      Newtons) are performed. In this evaluation inclusion criteria is checked too.

      INTERVENTION:

      -TREATMENT GROUP(Deep dry needling group (DDN)):

      An experienced physical therapist performed this treatment. The intervention included DDN of
      every active MTrP found in the trapezius muscle using a 4 cm x 0.32 mm acupuncture needle
      with guided tube. ). In the case of upper trapezius active MTrPs, DDN was performed in the
      prone position. For medium and lower trapezius muscle MTrPs, DDN was performed in a
      side-lying position as described by Simons et al. (Simons et al., 1999). Once the needle was
      inserted into the MTrP previously marked by the blinded assessor, local twitch responses
      (LTRs) were obtained by using Hong's fast-in and fast-out technique, which involves rapid
      movements of the needle in and out of the MTrP.

      After that, the stretch is performed

      - Passive stretch of the trapezius muscle (both groups)

      Another experienced physical therapist, after taking part of training-sesions to do the same
      stretch as in DDN group, performed the stretch.Participants in this group received the same
      stretch as patients in treatment group.
