      samples collected from the Sikkimese women aged 18 to 22 years at baseline (i.e. when the
      study participants are expected to have no benefit of vaccination) and seven years after the
      launch of the HPV vaccination programme, by which time the initial vaccinated cohorts will be
      aged 18 to 22 years and many of them will be sexually active. If the vaccination programme
      continues with the current high coverage rate, the cohort of women in the second age group
      are expected to be protected due to herd immunity, irrespective of whether any individual
      woman receives the vaccine or not. Overall effectiveness to protect women aged 18-22 years
      against targeted and non-targeted HPV infections will be monitored through repeated cervical
      sample -based surveys.
