      children in part due to misperceptions that they are healthful, which may be driven by
      front-of-package (FOP) marketing. The FDA is considering changes to FOP marketing regulations
      but lacks data on how label elements influence consumer behavior. Our study will test the
      independent and combined effects of FOP claims, imagery, nutrition disclosures, and added
      sugar warning labels on parents' purchases and perceptions of beverages for their children.

      We will conduct an online randomized controlled trial with 5,000 racially/ethnically diverse
      primary caregivers of children aged 0-5 years. Participants will choose a beverage for their
      child in an online store and rate health perceptions of different fruit drinks. Participants
      will be randomized to see high-added-sugar beverages (>20% DV added sugar/serving) with 1 of
      7 FOP label conditions: 1) vitamin C claim and fruit imagery (control); 2) imagery only; 3)
      claim only; 4) no claim or imagery; 5) claim, imagery, and % juice disclosure; 6) claim,
      imagery, and added sugar warning; or 7) claim, imagery, and added sugar warning w/teaspoons
      of added sugar.

      Primary outcomes will include total calories and added sugar (grams) from chosen online store
      beverages. Secondary outcomes will include health perceptions and knowledge of added sugar
      and % juice content in low- and high-added-sugar fruit drinks.

      This research will inform federal regulation to correct health misperceptions of sugary
      drinks.
