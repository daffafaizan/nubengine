      rarely provide complete relief. Although prevention by means of glycemic control is the first
      priority, up to 20% of patients will develop Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy (DPN) and require
      active drug therapy. Select anti-depressants, anti-epileptics, and opioids have generally
      been the first-line pharmacologic treatments for neuropathic pain. Topical creams have been
      used to achieve local control. Nonconventional therapies have included acupuncture and magnet
      therapy. However, all of these treatments have limited utility because of marginal efficacy.
      Various forms of electric stimulation have been shown to improve the symptoms of DPN.
      Advances in spinal cord stimulation technology have encouraged broader use of this treatment
      modality in the management of chronic painful DPN.
