      clinic: a screening visit, a randomization visit, 3 follow up visits, and 1 end of study
      visit.

      Patient randomization will be stratified based upon the baseline weekly complete spontaneous
      bowel movement rate (CSBM) established during the screening period. Patients will be allowed
      to adjust their dosing, based upon protocol specifications. Rescue medications will be
      provided to all patients to ensure they move their bowels on a regular basis.

      Patients will also be asked to participate in up to 2 sub-studies: a pk study and/or a stool
      microbiome study. The first 20 patients to consent to the pk study will have additional blood
      samples taken at randomization and at 2 follow up visits. The first 20 patients to consent to
      the stool microbiome study will provide stool samples at randomization and at 2 follow up
      visits.
