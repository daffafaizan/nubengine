      anti-aging effects using experimental animals. Mice, under chronic psychosocial stress,
      showed shortened longevity and brain dysfunction. However, when the mice ingested theanine,
      they showed normal longevity and brain function even though the mice were under psychosocial
      stress. These data showed that theanine has a significant anti-stress effect on mice. In
      addition, theanine has been reported to have an anti-stress effect on humans against
      short-term stress by measuring salivary amylase activity. However, the efficacy of theanine
      against chronic stress has not been examined. Long-term pharmacy practices might induce
      chronic stress in students. Based on this background, the investigators designed a randomized
      study to evaluate the clinical efficacy of theanine ingestion in suppressing chronic stress
      in students during long-term pharmacy practices.
