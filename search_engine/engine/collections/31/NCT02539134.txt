      pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of TAK-935 in healthy participants. The study will
      enroll approximately 56 participants. Participants will be randomly assigned (by chance, like
      flipping a coin) to 1 of the 5 cohorts in Part 1, which will remain undisclosed to the
      participant and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent medical need):

        -  Part 1, Cohort 1: TAK-935 100 mg QD

        -  Part 1, Cohort 2: TAK-935 300 mg QD

        -  Part 1, Cohort 3: TAK-935 300 mg BID

        -  Part 1, Cohort 4: TAK-935 600 mg QD

        -  Part 1, Cohort 5: TAK-935 400 mg QD Participants will be asked to take the oral solution
           once or twice a day at the same time for 14 days. An optional Part 2 may be conducted
           for collecting data to assess the engagement by TAK-935 of the central molecular target
           cholesterol 24S-hydroxylase (CH24H) by measuring the changes of levels of the metabolite
           24S-hydroxycholesterol (24HC). In Part 2, participants will be assigned to up to 2
           treatment groups at doses based on the data from other ongoing TAK-935 trials, combined
           with the safety and tolerability data from Cohorts 1-4 of Part 1.

      This single center trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall time to
      participate in this study will be approximately 30 days. Participants will be admitted in the
      clinic for the first 14 days, and will be contacted by telephone on Day 28 for a follow-up
      assessment.
