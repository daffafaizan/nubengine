      is inexpensive, easy to use and more importantly shows great promise to modify cortical
      excitability. Application of a weak direct current through the scalp has been shown to induce
      polarity specific changes in the excitability of cortical neurons23. This effect of
      transcranial direct current stimulation was first demonstrated in the human motor cortex.
      Since then it has also shown to be effective for other brain regions such as visual,
      somatosensory or frontal regions.

      The advantage of tDCS in managing concussion is that this technique can be used to focally
      suppress or enhance neuronal firing depending on the size and location of the applied
      electrodes. Thus, at different points during the trajectory of concussion, the technique can
      be matched to the underlying pathophysiology. For example, work by Demitras et al suggests
      that cathodal tDCS may be used to suppress the acute glutamatergic hyperexcitability in the
      acute stages of brain injury; in the subacute stage, when GABAergic activity is excessive,
      anodal tDCS may increase excitability to counter these aberrant GABAergic effects. In the
      chronic stage, brain stimulation coupled to rehabilitation may enhance behavioral recovery,
      learning of new skills and cortical plasticity. Thus far, one pilot study has shown that a
      single session of anodal tDCS over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was associated with
      improvements in attention in adults with chronic TBI.
