      Cushing's syndrome have raised interest in the pathogenic role of glucocorticoid excess in
      this clinical setting. Cortisol is a well known counter-regulator of insulin action and
      increased levels of serum cortisol have been linked to insulin resistance in many studies.
      Moreover, treatment with the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone reduced central nervous
      system insulin uptake by 49% in dogs. We have previously identified in metabolic syndrome
      subjects, an inverse relationship between morning fasting cortisol levels and sympathetic
      neural responsiveness to oral glucose ingestion. This concurs with other evidence that
      cortisol and synthetic glucocorticoids have sympathoinhibitory effects.

      This project will test the hypothesis that short-term lowering of plasma cortisol levels by
      overnight metyrapone treatment, will improve nutritional sympathetic nervous system responses
      to carbohydrate ingestion in obese insulin resistant subjects with metabolic syndrome.
