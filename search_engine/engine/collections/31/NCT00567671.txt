      crossed over to the treatment group at the 3 month visit. Corneal collagen cross-linking is
      performed as a single treatment. Subjects are followed for at least 12 months to evaluate the
      long term effects of corneal collagen cross-linking.

      Subjects may be referred from other physicians but must return to Emory Vision for completion
      of all study visits.
