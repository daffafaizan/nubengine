      the absence of an evaluation tool leads to a great disparity in their implementation
      (particularly marked by at regular times by the care teams), which can eventually lead to
      oral disorders. The possibility of an assessment of the newborn's skills could allow a
      homogenization of therapeutic proposals and thus a potentially faster progression of dietary
      independence of the newborn. This method could also encourage parental involvement in feeding
      care. The objective of the study is to evaluate the impact of a tool to help food progression
      on food autonomy.
