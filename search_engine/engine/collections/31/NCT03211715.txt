      Juul is translated to Korean language by 3 different professional translators. Patients who
      received sphincter saving surgery to treat rectal cancer will be asked to fill up the
      questionnaire. Compiling the results, the quality of life after sphincter preserving surgery
      will be investigated in the association with the low anterior resection syndrome.
