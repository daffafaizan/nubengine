      Second group (B) is the men with poor semen quality, who are treated with aromatase
      inhibitor, antiestrogen or human choriogonadotropic hormone (HCG) to improve semen quality.
      Third group (C) consists of men submitting semen analysis. The intended number of
      participants is 60, 60 and 100 men, respectively.

      Seminal plasma and serum samples are collected and miRNA and piRNA are analyzed. Steroid
      hormones are analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The participants are
      given a physical examination and testicular ultrasound. The primary aim of this study is to
      develop a tool to better estimate the sperm recovery rate (SRR) of azoospermic men scheduled
      for MD-TESE. Since no data have been published presenting miRNA and piRNA levels in men with
      normal semen, a secondary aim is to describe the levels of miRNA and piRNA in unselected men.
      Third part of this study aims to find if medical treatment improving semen parameters affects
      miRNA ja piRNA findings.
