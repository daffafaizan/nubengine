      therapy may be required, and it is difficult for CHB patients to achieve HBsAg clearance by
      using nucleot(s)ides. Therefore, it is need take long-term therapy if chronic hepatitis B
      (CHB) choose to use nucleot(s)ides, and in another way, nucleot(s)ides resistance is an
      important clinical risk. More and more young patients want to stop treating, and
      discontinuation of nucleot(s)ides is a feasible strategy to reduce resistance. However, it is
      really easy to relapse if patients did not arrive HBsAg clearance. PegIFN alfa-2a can clear
      HBV by direct anti-viral and immune regulation mechanisms including enhancing natural killer
      cell response, increased cluster of differentiation 8(CD8 +) T lymphocytes and other
      mechanisms to restore and enhance the immune response in patients with CHB; and what's more,
      patients are safety after discontinuing.
