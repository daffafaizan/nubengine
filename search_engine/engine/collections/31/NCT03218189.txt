      differences and country features)

      Plots will be generated to show the relationships between variables. Correlation coefficients
      will be calculated where appropriate. Two separate multivariate models will be fit to the
      data for outcomes 2a and 2b [continuous, between 1 and 500]. A similar model will be fit the
      total number of differences. The analytical method will be determined by the data and may be
      liner regression.
