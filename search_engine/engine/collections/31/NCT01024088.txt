      medical origin in industrial nations. A third of these patients going to require mechanical
      invasive ventilation during their stay in ICU. This population of ventilated presents the
      strongest risk of infectious respiratory patient complications and death. The respiratory
      impairment is a progressive weakness of inspiratory and expiratory muscles. The monitoring of
      the respiratory muscular infringement is usually made by the repeated measure of vital
      capacity and the maximal respiratory pressures. The occurrence of bulbar impairment is an
      aggravating element entailing dysfunction of the upper airways muscles detected often late in
      front of aspiration. Besides the arisen of sleep apneas was never sought in this context.
      This dysfunction of the upper airways muscles could be more detected prematurely by
      objectivizes measures of them performances.

      Method: longitudinal observational and in a one center study. The respiratory impairment will
      be estimated by the measure of the vital capacity, maximal respiratory pressures and of the
      debit of cough. The existence of a bulbar infringement will be sought by the measure of the
      force of the tongue, an objective measure of gulp performances and a polysomnographic
      recording.

      Criterion of selection: patient admitted in ICU with GBS and respiratory risk. Number of
      patients, centre: 40 patients admitted in the intensive care unit of the hospital RAYMOND
      POINCARE and 20 controls.

      Duration of the study: 24 months Perspectives: better anticipate acute respiratory failure
      and the indication of an invasive ventilation.
