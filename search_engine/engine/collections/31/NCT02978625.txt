      I. To determine the frequency of patients responding (response rate) to talimogene
      laherparepvec monotherapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the local response rate to talimogene laherparepvec in injected tumors.

      II. To determine the response rate to talimogene laherparepvec + nivolumab (NIVO).

      III. To identify potential pre-treatment and on-treatment correlative biomarkers of local and
      systemic immune response.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive talimogene laherparepvec intratumorally (IT) and nivolumab intravenously
      (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Cycles repeat every 21 days for cycle 1 then every 14 days for
      up to 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 12 weeks for 3 years.
