      one year and will be 50% faster than a traditional treatment. The ratio benefit / risk of
      performing the piezocision will be acceptable for the patient and the orthodontist. We expect
      the following results: low pain, and absence of dental and periodontal deleterious effect (no
      root resorption, no tooth vitality loss and no bone loss). The same cohort can be used in
      future studies to assess the long term stability of the treatment.
