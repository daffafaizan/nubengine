    
      Specific Aim 1: To develop a technique for the quantitative analysis of fetal heart-rate
      (FHR) data recorded during labor using advanced mathematical techniques, including
      pattern-recognition analysis.

        -  Specific Aim 2: To develop the capacity to measure fetal cardiac data using EKG sensors
           applied to the maternal abdomen during labor.

        -  Specific Aim 3: To validate prenatal non-invasive measurement of the fetal QTc interval.

        -  Specific Aim 4: To develop and validate the capacity to measure uterine contractions
           using the uterine EMG signal recorded from maternal skin-surface electrodes.

        -  Specific Aim 5: Collect clinical data related to medication usage and hypoxia.
