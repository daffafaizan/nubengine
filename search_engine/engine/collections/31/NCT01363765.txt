      design. The GeneXpert machines will be installed in laboratories of the basic health units in
      Rio de Janeiro and Manaus, two cities with a high burden of the disease in Brazil. Doctors
      will prescribe routine tests in the clinics. When sputum specimens arrive in the laboratory,
      instead of performing smears, the Xpert MTB/Rif will be performed during the intervention
      period. If positive, a sputum smear will also be performed. The intervention period will be
      preceded by an observation period during which routine will be kept unchanged, i.e., only
      smears will be performed. The observation period will serve as a comparator (control). The
      investigators will then see how many more cases were detected during the intervention period,
      and in particular, how many smear-negative cases were detected, compared to the observation
      period.

      A total of 35,000 specimens are expected to be tested with the new technology in 14
      laboratories. Laboratories, not individuals, will be randomized.
