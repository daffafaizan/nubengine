      phase II clinical trial of PHA-848125AC administered to patients with recurrent or
      metastatic, unresectable thymic carcinoma previously treated with chemotherapy (only one
      prior systemic therapy allowed). The intent of the study is to assess the antitumor activity
      of PHA-848125AC and ultimately to improve the outcome of patients with thymic carcinoma who
      have already exploited one chemotherapy option. The primary end point for this study is a
      progression free survival rate of 3 months.
