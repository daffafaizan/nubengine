    
      This is a prospective pilot study evaluating the clinical use of FLT PET in paediatric
      patients with Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). The overall objective
      of this trial is to assess the feasibility of using FLT PET as an adjunct imaging modality to
      follow-up paediatric lymphoma patients whose interim or post-therapy FDG PET scan is
      interpreted as being equivocal. The primary outcome measure is to obtain a preliminary
      estimate of the diagnostic performance (including the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy)
      of adjunct FLT PET. This pilot study will yield sufficient preliminary data to help justify
      and design a subsequent larger study of FLT PET in paediatric lymphoma patients.

      This study is open only to HL and NHL patients whose interim or post-therapy FDG PET scan is
      interpreted as being equivocal and in whom it is not possible resolve the exam results using
      other conventional imaging techniques such as CT or MRI. All FLT PET image findings will be
      presented to the treating physician(s) responsible for managing the care of any patient
      enrolled in this trial. Treating physicians will continue to use routine practices to resolve
      equivocal FDG PET findings.
