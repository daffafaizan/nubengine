    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the safety of prophylactic chest radiotherapy, bevacizumab, paclitaxel, and
      carboplatin in patients with unresectable stage IIIB or IV non-small cell lung cancer at high
      risk for bevacizumab-associated hemoptysis.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess progression-free survival of patients treated with this regimen. II. Assess the
      rate of objective response, overall survival, time to response, and response duration in
      irradiated lesions and non-irradiated lesions in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, pilot, multicenter study. Patients are assigned sequentially
      to 1 of 2 treatment strata.

      Stratum I: Patients undergo prophylactic radiotherapy on days 1-5 and 8-12. Patients receive
      paclitaxel IV over 3 hours and carboplatin IV over 30-60 minutes on day 15. Patients also
      receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours or carboplatin IV over 30-60 minutes and bevacizumab IV
      over 30-90 minutes on day 36 (course 2).

      Stratum II: Patients undergo prophylactic radiotherapy and receive paclitaxel and carboplatin
      as in stratum I. Patients also receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 15 (course
      1). In both strata, treatment with paclitaxel, carboplatin, and bevacizumab repeats every 21
      days for 5-6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients
      with complete or partial response or stable disease may continue to receive single-agent
      bevacizumab every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 12 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 72 patients will be accrued for this study.
