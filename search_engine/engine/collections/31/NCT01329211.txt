    
      This project will involve: a) distributing questionnaires to up to 200 participants (100
      patients and 100 caregivers) at the Shands Gastrointestinal clinic and b) focus groups
      including patients, medical provider, and the clinic case manager. The questionnaires will
      provide information on the relative effect of gastroparesis on the quality of life of the
      patients and their caregivers. Assessment of this needs assessment will then help identify
      areas of potential resource improvement and mobilization to provide support for the patients
      and their family members.
