      Adverse drug events (ADE) present a unique focus for error reduction. Computerized provider
      order entry, with embedded clinical decision support, has great promise in reducing
      medication errors but preventable adverse drug events may still occur despite such systems.

      Objectives:

      The purpose of the study was to evaluate whether adding medication profiling (by using a
      retrospective drug utilization review program) to computerized provider order entry with
      embedded order checks (drug alerts) reduces the incidence of adverse drug events.

      Methods:

      Medication profiles mainly focused on possible drug-drug and drug-disease interactions, with
      some drug duplications. To do the medication profiles we licensed a proprietary computerized
      retrospective drug utilization review system. We randomly assigned over 900 patients to Usual
      Care or Provider Feedback. For patients in the latter group, selected providers were
      contacted by letter with pertinent information; electronic mail was used for follow-up
      contact. Clinical and other relevant data was retrospectively abstracted from the medical
      records for up to one year from the last medication profile for all patients. This was done
      by a pharmacist reviewer, using a study-derived instrument, and blinded to patient
      assignment. ADE incidence is the primary outcome of interest, with other outcomes such as ADE
      severity and preventability also assessed. We also developed and implemented provider surveys
      in pre- and post-profiling periods.

      Status:

      Pre and post survey results published. Adjunct study on clinical actions as a result of drug
      alerts published. Main study (profiling): manuscript in proces.
