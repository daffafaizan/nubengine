      and by the increased susceptibility to disease and death. Most ageing-associated diseases
      develop silently for many years before symptoms appear, leading to irreversible pathological
      conditions. Examples of these diseases are Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, osteoporosis, diabetes,
      cardiovascular disease and also cancer. Typically, patients are treated when most of the
      damage has already occurred, and existing drugs can rarely cure these diseases, but merely
      slow down further progression of the disease. Therefore, preventive measures that may delay
      the onset of these diseases can hold the best promise for healthy ageing. of the most
      plausible and acceptable explanations for the mechanistic basis of aging is the "free radical
      theory of aging". This theory postulates that aging and its related diseases are the
      consequence of free radical-induced damage to cellular macromolecules and the inability to
      counterbalance these changes by endogenous anti-oxidant defences. ProManna is a novel and
      safe food supplement that aims to decrease free radical-induced damage, thereby contributing
      to healthy ageing.
