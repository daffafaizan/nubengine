      of a trauma-sensitive, gender-transformative youth violence prevention program that
      integrates racism and discrimination prevention.

      Set in 24 neighborhoods in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania with concentrated social and economic
      disadvantage, this study addresses gender and racial injustice through a series of group
      discussions, bringing together adolescents ages 14-19 with law enforcement officers in a
      process of social restoration.
