      suspected ICP elevation, regardless to etiology. Each enrolled patient will be monitored with
      the HS-1000 device and data will be collected throughout the entire procedure. Once the data
      collection is done, results of the non-invasive measurements will be analyzed accordingly.
      The end-point of the study is to collect at least half an hour of measurements for each
      participant.
