      decades, we suppose that adding Cytokine GM-CSF as an endometrial modifier to already proven
      successful medium hyaluronan enriched medium to test the efficacy ipon pregnancy and
      implantation rate in vitro so we decide to design a trial to compare the clinical outcome by
      sibling embryo to be transferred into 2 groups and the same culture condition but with one
      arm with Cytokine and the other is traditional one and closely monitor the outcome within the
      2 arms and record the results.
