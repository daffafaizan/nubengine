      structural characteristics in patients with existing cardiac implantable electronic devices
      and heart failure who may benefit from an upgrade to a cardiac resynchronization therapy
      (CRT) device can be assessed very effectively using cardiac MRI using sequences designed for
      post-device imaging. Furthermore, a comparative analysis of the differences in LV/RV
      structural characteristics in patients with existing devices referred for CRT upgrades versus
      those with de novo CRT implants is expected to be very useful for developing effective
      strategies for optimal patient selection for CRT upgrades and implementation of CRT upgrades
      in appropriate patients. Patient selection for CRT upgrades is very important considering
      that complication rates are higher than in de novo CRT procedures and nonresponse rates are
      still high. With this in mind, we are performing a study of 100 patients, including 50
      prospectively enrolled patients with LVEF less than or equal to 0.35 and New York Heart
      Association class II-III heart failure, who will be compared with an existing cohort of 50
      patients with recent de novo CRT implants, pre-CRT MRIs, and response data. The 50
      prospectively enrolled patients having CRT upgrades will undergo a pre-CRT cardiac MRI,
      pre-CRT/post-CRT echocardiography, and pre-CRT/post-CRT cardiopulmonary exercise testing. In
      the first aim, we will assess differences in cardiac MRI findings between CRT upgrade
      patients and de novo CRT patients. In the second aim, we will assess the impact of cardiac
      MRI findings on LV reverse remodeling and cardiopulmonary capacity in the two groups. In
      summary, we propose a comprehensive prospective CRT/MRI study in CRT upgrade patients with
      comparison to a complete MRI dataset of patients with de novo CRT implants in order to
      identify key differences in MRI findings in these cohorts and the impact of these MRI-based
      scar and activation findings on clinical outcomes. We expect that our results will have a
      significant public health impact for patients with heart failure referred for CRT upgrades.
