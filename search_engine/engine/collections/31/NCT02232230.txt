      these are ineffective in causing tumor regression. Boosting these responses with
      immunotherapy is therefore an attractive, relatively benign adjunctive cancer treatment.
      Little is known in regards to how standard anti-cancer therapies like radiation therapy might
      interact with immunotherapy in a clinical setting. We are interested in knowing if the tumor
      cell death occasioned by radiation therapy might augment anti-tumor responses from the immune
      therapy, Provenge.

      The tentative assumption is that cell death following radiation therapy will stimulate
      anti-tumor immunity, which could provide a more permanent solution to curing cancer and
      discouraging tumors from spreading throughout the body. In order to find out if this
      assumption is correct, for patients undergoing radiation 28 days prior to Provenge, highly
      developed, laboratory analyses for tumor-specific immunity and imaging will be performed.
