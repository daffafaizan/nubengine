      conflict, reducing the tendency to view justice only on one's side. Such increase in PT would
      initiate a chain leading to greater behavioral empathy.

      Second, we hypothesize that change in oxytocin (OT) levels and empathic behavior (less
      withdrawal and tension and more synchrony) would be impacted by the intervention and the
      degree to which it altered youth PT on the conflict.

      Finally, we suggest a 3-path model charting the multi-dimensional pathways leading to
      behavioral empathy toward outgroup member. First, individual differences in OT functionality
      will shape empathy so that youth with higher OT levels at pre-intervention and greater PT
      will show more empathic dialogue at post-intervention. Second, dispositional cognitive
      empathy, as tested by the Interpersonal Reactivity Index questioner (IRI), at
      pre-intervention will predict higher behavioral empathy at T2, both directly and as mediated
      by reduction in ethnocentric attitudes following the intervention. Finally, we hypothesize
      that the intervention will influence empathy by initiating a chain that begins with
      increasing PT, which, in turn, will lead to reduction in tension during interaction with
      outgroup, and culminating in greater empathy during face-to-face encounters
