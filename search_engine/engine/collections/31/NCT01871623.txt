        1. Skeletal Surgical movement from T2 to T1

             -  positional change of landmarks in vertical from constructed Frankfurt plane

             -  positional change of landmarks in horizontal plane in relative to constructed
                coronal plane through Sella point

        2. Post-Surgical skeletal movement (Stability) from T3 to T2

             -  positional change of landmarks in vertical from constructed Frankfurt plane

             -  positional change of landmarks in horizontal plane in relative to constructed
                coronal plane through Sella point

        3. Skeletal angular measurement change on mid-sagittal plane from (T2 to T1) and (T3 to T2)

        4. Dental change measured from digital maxillary cast in transverse direction from (T2 to
           T1) and (T3 to T2)

        5. Facial Height / Facial Proportion changes from (T2 to T1) and (T3 to T2)

        6. Alveolar cleft width changes from (T2 to T1) and (T3 to T2)
