      orthopedic surgeons, which encourage the development of new biological therapies. Among many
      approaches, the possibility of activating resident stem cells in situ, without the need of
      isolating them from biopsies and successive in vitro culturing, could represent a very
      promising therapeutic strategy. Along this line, it has been recently demonstrated that a
      lipoaspirate product, such as the LipogemsÂ® product, contains and produces growth factors
      that may activate resident stem cells. Recently, it has been discovered that also the human
      rotator cuff contains a reservoir of progenitor cells, which can be isolated and expanded in
      vitro.

      The primary goal of this study is to evaluate efficacy of infiltration of autologous
      micro-fragmented adipose tissue in arthroscopic rotator cuff repair, in terms of gain in
      post-operative Constant score.

      Secondary goals are to evaluate efficacy of infiltration of autologous micro-fragmented
      adipose tissue in arthroscopic rotator cuff repairs, in terms of post-operative pain
      reduction, gain in post-operative strength in abduction and external rotation; estimate
      incidence of re-ruptures at 1 and 2 years post-operatively, quantify the amount of fatty
      degeneration of the supraspinatus at 1 and 2 years post-operatively.
