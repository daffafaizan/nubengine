      disease. A surveillance test for early diagnosis of HCC in Korea is to perform alfa
      fetoprotein (AFP) and abdominal sonography every 6-months in high-risk groups. However, the
      detection rate of HCC using AFP and abdominal sonography is very low. There are several
      reports that the combination of the multiple biomarker tests including AFP, AFP L3, and
      PIVKA-II increased the early HCC detection only one test. Therefore, in the surveillance test
      for HCC, the combination of three tests with sonography would be helpful in the early
      diagnosis of HCC. However, there was few prospective large-scale studies about this issue.

      Compared with abdominal sonography, contrast-enhanced CT or MRI is more useful in finding
      intrahepatic lesions of liver cirrhosis. However, there is no evidence data on combining
      sono/CT and biomarkers could improve the diagnosis for early HCC. Thus, it is essential to
      verify this prospectively in the real clinical practices to make recommendations based on a
      high level of evidence in the future. The investigators are conducting a prospective study
      which examines three biomarker tests and sonography every six months and contrast-enhanced CT
      annually for HCC surveillance in patients with cirrhosis.
