      albuminuria screening compliance and detection of albuminuria. The investigators will
      randomize 1,000 non-diabetic MyGeisinger portal users with hypertension and last clinic blood
      pressure >= 130/80 mmHg who have not received albuminuria screening to either: 1) control -
      usual care or 2) intervention - mailed urinalysis smartphone kit. All patients will first
      receive a reminder letter to have albuminuria screening completed at their clinic in
      coordination with the Geisinger Care Gap Team. Patients randomized to the intervention arm
      who do not complete this initial screening test will then be offered a mailed, smartphone
      urinalysis testing kit. Patients with 1+ or greater detected urine protein will be
      recommended to have urine albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR) testing to confirm albuminuria.
      Patients with ACR >= 30 mg/g will be referred to pharmacists for optimal treatment of
      albuminuria (ACE or ARB, statin, BP goal <130/90 mmHg).
