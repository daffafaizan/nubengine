      stability,and reducing pain, it also by intention leads to spinal stiffness which can impair
      function of daily activities.The commonly used scales (ODI+JOA-29+VAS) lack the assessment of
      lumbar stiffness.Lumbar Stiffness Disability Index (LSDI) has not been used widely, and there
      is no scale for evaluating lumbar stiffness in China.In addition, even if LSDI is modified,
      there is still an evaluation dilemma: after lumbar long-segment fixation, the pain and
      neurological function-related scale scores show that the quality of life is improved, while
      the lumbar stiffness-related scale scores show that the quality of life is reduced . So
      overall, is the patient's quality of life improved or decreased? Simply combining these two
      types of scales cannot explain clearly.

      This study can be roughly divided into the following 5 main steps:

      Step 1:Collect and sort out the dimensions and exhaustive items that affect the patients'
      quality of life by systematically reviewing the related literature and a qualitative
      interview study.

      Step 2: Through a cross-sectional survey and experts' meetings, the items is initially
      optimized, and 35-45 items will be retained.

      Step 3: Screen 20-25 excellent items by 2-3 rounds of Delphi method, then use the analytic
      hierarchy process to determine the weight of each item, so as to establish a initial PRO
      instrument.

      Step 4: Verify the reliability and validity of the initial PRO instrument, and further
      optimize the initial PRO instrument in order to be used in clinical practice and research.

      Step 5: Verify the responsiveness of the initial PRO instrument, calculate the ES, SRM, AUC
      and MICD values of the initial PRO instrument.

      Finally, a novel, concise, practical, and effective PRO instrument for use in degenerative
      lumbar disease patients will be established.
