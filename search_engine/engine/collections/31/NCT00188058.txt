      mechanical ventilation. In this setting, positive end-expiratory pressure is used to improve
      arterial oxygenation. While the beneficial effect on clinical outcome of using low tidal
      volume is clearly proven, the best way to titrate PEEP is not known. Higher PEEP levels may
      better improve oxygenation and reduce ventilator-induced lung injury by reducing
      end-expiratory alveolar collapse but may also cause circulatory depression and aggravate lung
      injury from end-inspiratory overdistension. This trial compares the impact on outcome of two
      strategies for setting PEEP. In the "minimal alveolar distension" arm, PEEP is set for a
      total PEEP (PEEP + intrinsic PEEP) between 5 and 9 cm H20). In the "maximal alveolar
      recruitment" arm, PEEP is set for a plateau pressure between 28 and 30 cm H20. A tidal volume
      of 6 ml/kg predicted body weight is used in the two arms. The goals for arterial oxygenation
      and PaCO2 are the same in the two arms.
