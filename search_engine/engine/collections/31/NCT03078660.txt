      list of foods and beverages to help individuals make smart and healthy choices when
      purchasing foods at grocery stores based on the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. A pilot
      randomized clinical trial was done to test the effectiveness of this App on food selection
      and purchase, dietary patterns, and weight loss during two months of intervention. We also
      assessed feasibility, usability, satisfaction and acceptability of the App. A total of 138
      overweight and obese adults aged 21-45 years old who own a Smartphone were invited to
      participate in this study. Participants were randomized into two groups; (1) the intervention
      group used the App, which generated a healthy grocery list to use when purchasing foods in in
      the supermarket; (2) the control group had a traditional intervention with a nutritionist. To
      assess the impact of the intervention on dietary patterns, participants completed three
      24-hour dietary recalls, a short food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) and provided grocery
      receipts at baseline and at the end of the study (8 weeks later). Weight and height were also
      performed before and after the intervention. Feasibility, usability, satisfaction, and
      acceptability of the nutrition App were assessed at the end of the study using a
      questionnaire.
