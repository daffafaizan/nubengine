      Helicobacter pylori in the healing of lesions in patients with low grade gastric lymphoma.
      II. Assess the efficacy of chlorambucil in the prevention of relapse in patients after
      complete eradication of low grade gastric lymphoma. III. Determine the natural history of
      unresected or partially resected low grade gastric lymphoma treated medically.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are randomized to receive chlorambucil or
      placebo. Patients receive omeprazole daily for 1 week. Clarithromycin and tinidazole are
      administered twice daily for 1 week for the eradication of H. pylori infection. Patients are
      assessed every 2-3 months by endoscopy. Patients may receive a maximum of 3 courses of
      treatment every 2-3 months. Other regimens may be used if full eradication of H. pylori is
      not achieved. Patients who achieve complete response (eradication of H. pylori) are
      randomized to receive oral chlorambucil or placebo daily for 14 days. Treatment is repeated
      every 28 days for 6 courses. Patients are followed every 6 months for 2 years, then yearly
      thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 200 patients will be accrued for this study.
