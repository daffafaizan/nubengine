        -  Determine the feasibility of conducting a live viral vaccine trial using adjuvant
           recombinant modified vaccinia Ankara-5T4 vaccine (TroVax®) in patients with stage
           IIIB-IV breast cancer in remission.

        -  Determine the progression-free survival of patients treated with this vaccine.

        -  Determine the 5T4-specific T-cell immune response in patients treated with this vaccine.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this vaccine in these patients.

        -  Determine the level of 5T4-specific antibody response in patients treated with this
           vaccine.

        -  Correlate, preliminarily, immune response with 3- and 12-month progression-free survival
           of patients treated with this vaccine.

        -  Correlate tumor 5T4 expression with overall survival and progression-free survival of
           patients treated with this vaccine.

        -  Correlate tumor infiltrating lymphocyte and CD1a-positive dendritic cell density with
           development of 5T4-specific T-cell immunity in patients treated with this vaccine.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive recombinant modified vaccinia Ankara-5T4 vaccine (TroVax®) intramuscularly
      once a month in months 1-3. Patients then receive booster vaccinations once in months 6, 9,
      and 12. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 6 months for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 120 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
