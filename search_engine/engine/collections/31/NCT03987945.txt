      to prevent the occurrence of ischemic stroke events among patients with non-valvular atrial
      fibrillation (NVAF), the clinical benefits and prognostic implications of which have not been
      well characterized in patients from China. As a result, we aim to conduct an observational
      study to explore the prognostic impact of LAAO in patient with NVAF who are hospitalized in
      Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital.
