      I. To evaluate if PET/CT and PET/MRI scanners provide equivalent results for evaluation of
      cancer patients.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive standard of care 18F-fludeoxyglucose (FDG) or Ga68-DOTA-TATE intravenously
      (IV). Within 45-60 minutes, patients then undergo PET/CT imaging immediately followed by
      PET/MRI. Each participant is to receive 18-FDG or 68Ga-DOTA-TATE only, no participant was to
      receive both radiotracers.
