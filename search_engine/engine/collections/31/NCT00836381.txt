             1. Primary objective: To explore the "Patient-reported Goal Attainment (PGA)" after 12
                weeks of treatment with tolterodine extended-release (ER) 4mg in female overactive
                bladder (OAB) patients.

             2. Secondary objective: To explore the patient-reported treatment goals and the
                efficacy of tolterodine on the patient-reported outcomes (PROs), micturition diary
                parameters, and safety parameters from baseline to 12 weeks of treatment in female
                OAB patients.

        2. Specific aim

           : To compare the efficacy of tolterodine ER 4mg with that of placebo, on PROs in terms
           of PGA after 12 weeks of treatment in female OAB patients.

        3. Experimental/research design

             1. 12-week randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group, prospective
                study in Korean women with symptoms of OAB

             2. Treatment: Each patient will receive tolterodine ER (4 mg, qd) or placebo
                (randomized in the ratio of 1:1) for 12 weeks.
