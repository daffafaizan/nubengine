    
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to determine the safety and
      effectiveness of 650 mg and 1300 mg acetaminophen extended release given three times a day as
      compared with placebo, for the relief of signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis of the hip or
      knee for a period of 12 weeks. Propoxyphene Hydrochloride capsules 65 mg are used as rescue
      medication if subjects experience inadequate pain relief. The primary efficacy assessments
      are the average change from baseline to the final on-therapy visit for the WOMAN pain
      subscale score and the WOMAC physical function subscale scare, and the subject's average
      global assessment of their response to therapy through the final on-therapy visit. Safety
      assessments at study visits consist of monitoring adverse events, vital signs, study joint
      assessments and clinical laboratory determinations. The hypothesis is that 1950 mg per day
      and/or 3900 mg per day acetaminophen extended release are superior to placebo for the relief
      of the signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis of the hip or knee with respect to all three
      primary efficacy endpoints. Treatment consisted of either one 650 mg acetaminophen extended
      release caplet plus one placebo caplet (acetaminophen 1950 mg group); two 650 mg
      acetaminophen extended release caplets (acetaminophen 3900 mg group); or two placebo caplets
      administered orally every eight hours for 12 weeks.
