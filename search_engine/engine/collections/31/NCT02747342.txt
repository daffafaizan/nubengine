    
      This study consists of 2 Part. In the Part 1 (dose escalation phase), up to 4 dose levels of
      SHR3680 will be investigated with a sequential "3+3" design (3 or 6 participants in each dose
      level). There will be a single-dose pharmacokinetic (PK) run-in period (7 days). Following
      the first dose, participants will enter a 1 week treatment-free period to evaluate safety and
      single-dose PK. If not dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) are observed during the 1-week period,
      SHR3680 administration will resume at the same dose level.

      In the Part 2a (expansion phase), up to 9 additional participants will be enrolled at the MTD
      or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). The purpose of the expansion part of the study is to
      explore the clinical benefits of SHR3680 and to further identify its PK features.

      In Part 2b (combination phase), two dose cohorts of SHR3162 combine with SHR3680 at fixed
      dose will be investigated.
