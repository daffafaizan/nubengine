      influences the risk of urinary tract infection. This prospective case-control study will
      compare the gut microbiota between the infants with febrile urinary tract infection and
      healthy infants. The investigators will sequence the V3-V4 of the bacterial 16SrRNA genes
      from the feces and analyze the sequencing data by QIIME2.
