      in addition to receiving either placebo (no active medicine) or belimumab. Induction therapy
      starts before the first dose of study drug (belimumab or placebo). Maintenance therapy begins
      after completion of induction therapy and continues for the remainder of the study.
      Participants receive study drug throughout the entire study, during both induction and
      maintenance periods. The controlled period of the study is 104 weeks. The random assignment
      in this study is "1 to 1" which means you have an equal chance of receiving treatment with
      belimumab or placebo. Participants who successfully complete the 104-week study may enter
      into a 6-month open-label extension. All participants in the open-label extension receive
      belimumab.
