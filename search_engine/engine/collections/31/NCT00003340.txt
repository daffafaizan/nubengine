      with relapsed or refractory acute myelogenous leukemia. II. Confirm safety and tolerability
      of this combination on this schedule in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive cyclophosphamide intravenously over 1 hour on day 1 followed by
      topotecan as a continuous 120 hour infusion starting 12 hours after completion of
      cyclophosphamide. Treatment may be repeated every 3-6 weeks for at least 2 courses.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 26 patients will be accrued for this study.
