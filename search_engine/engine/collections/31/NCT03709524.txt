      technique they divided into three groups; Standard Airtraq and Nasotracheal Airtraq +
      styletted endotracheal tube and Standard Airtraq + fiberoptic combination. Demographic
      characteristics and airway management variables such; age, gender, height, weight, ASA
      status, tooth morphology, tiro mental and sternomental distance were recorded. Insertion
      times, intubation times and total intubation times with these devices will be recorded.
      Hemodynamic parameters recorded such as; heart rate will be recorded baseline , after
      anesthesia, after insertion, just after and then every 2 minutes intervals after intubation.
      sore throat, hoarseness, dysphasia, bronchospasm were also recorded postoperatively.
