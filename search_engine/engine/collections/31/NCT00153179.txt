      mellitus, such that nearly 17 million people are now afflicted. The vast majority of these
      have type 2 diabetes. Over the next 40 years, the type 2 diabetic population in the United
      States is expected to increase to nearly 30 million.

      Diabetes substantially increases the risk of atherosclerosis, and thereby, cardiovascular
      morbidity and mortality. Indeed, cardiovascular disease causes more than 50% of the mortality
      in patients with diabetes. People with type 2 diabetes manifest two cardinal signs of
      dysmetabolism: hyperglycemia and insulin resistance. Insulin resistance is a progressive
      phenomenon that occurs well before the onset of frank diabetes, and results in alterations in
      insulin signaling. Experimental studies suggest that insulin signaling is required for
      vascular homeostasis, and its impairment is associated with endothelial dysfunction. In the
      clinical setting, insulin resistance is associated with atherosclerosis and predicts
      cardiovascular events independent of hyperglycemia. Therefore, we will study the importance
      of insulin signaling in endothelial biology in humans and the effects of free fatty acids on
      endothelial function in people with type 2 diabetes.
