      tissue samples taken from six GO patients who underwent orbital decompressive surgery. Normal
      orbital tissue samples will be collected from six patients undergoing eye surgery for
      unrelated reasons.

      Cell proliferation and HA will be measured using commercial assays DNA and RNA will be
      extracted. HAS-1, HAS-2 and HAS-3 will be measured were assessed by Real Time-PCR Next
      Generation Sequencing, Gene expression analysis and DNA methylation assays will be performed
