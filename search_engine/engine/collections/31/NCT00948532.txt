      (MSCs) which is intended to mimic the biologic performance of autograft without the morbidity
      associated with the autograft harvest. Mesenchymal stem cells, like those found in Osteocel
      Plus, are naturally occurring in the body and can differentiate into a variety of tissue
      types, depending on the local environment. Once implanted, MSCs can differentiate into
      osteoblasts, which produce new bone matrix. MSCs also naturally secrete bone-inducing growth
      factors that signal the patient's endogenous cells to migrate and participate in the bone
      formation process. Osteocel Plus is different from other orthobiologic products such as DBM
      and allograft cancellous bone because it contains living stem cells, which provide osteogenic
      potential. The cells include mesenchymal stem cells from an adult human donor; they are not
      from an embryonic source.

      This study is being conducted to determine the percentage of patients with solid spinal
      fusions after being treated with Osteocel in an XLIF procedure. Due to the unique processing
      conditions, Osteocel Plus retains a high concentration of stem cells in conjunction with the
      allograft bone matrix, so it is hypothesized that the fusion rate with Osteocel Plus will be
      comparable to published data for autograft. The Osteocel product family has already been used
      in approximately 15,000 cases worldwide.
