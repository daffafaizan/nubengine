      Sensor Technologies, Dublin, Ireland). This device uses very low power radio waves (~1/100th
      of the strength of a mobile phone signal) to detect respiratory movements of a person while
      asleep- without physical contact with the individual. The device is designed to measure up to
      5 feet, so that only the person on the side of the bed nearest the device is monitored.
      Algorithms have been developed to analyze the respiratory movement signals and extract
      information about respiration rate, bodily movements, sleep/wake patterns and sleep
      disordered respiration.
