      B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia treated with theophylline. II. Determine the toxicity of
      this treatment in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral theophylline daily. Daily treatment continues for a maximum of
      6 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are
      followed every 4 months for 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 35 patients will be accrued for this study over approximately
      10 months.
