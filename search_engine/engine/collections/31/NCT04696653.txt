      adapted Comprehensive Unit Safety Program (CUSP) implementation strategy to improve mental
      health providers' delivery of evidence-based cardiovascular risk factor care for
      hypertension, dyslipidemia and diabetes for individuals with serious mental illness. The
      project will also characterize implementation processes, organizational and provider-level
      factors, and cardiovascular disease risk factor care and control.
