      proprioception; however, only a single study has investigated the effect of chiropractic
      treatment of the extremities on balance and posture. In a previous study, it was noted that
      lower extremity manipulation led to more ordered behavior on a dynamic, lower extremity
      balance task. It was also found that upper extremity manipulation led to less ordered
      behavior with same lower extremity balance task. Further studies are needed not only to
      validate this theory, but to further clarify the mechanism regarding specificity of
      manipulation to task.
