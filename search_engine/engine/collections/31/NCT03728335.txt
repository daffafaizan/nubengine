      I. Evaluate the safety and tolerability of enasidenib mesylate as maintenance therapy in post
      hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess overall and leukemia free survival in patients post allogeneic HCT. II. Estimate
      relapse incidence, non-relapse mortality, graft versus host disease (GVHD) and relapse free
      survival (GRFS) in patients receiving enasidenib mesylate maintenance therapy.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Monitor disease status among subset of patients with minimal residual disease (MRD)
      positive disease when starting to receive enasidenib mesylate by multiparameter flow
      cytometry post allogeneic HCT on patients bone marrow (BM) on days +100 and +365.

      II. Investigate clearance of IDH2 mutation post HCT by next generation sequencing-polymerase
      chain reaction (NGS-PCR) testing on the bone marrow specimens on days +100 and +365 and in
      peripheral blood every 3 months till 2 year follow up.

      III. Investigate mIDH2 variant allele fraction (VAF) by droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) BEAMing
      technology on bone marrow specimens on days +100 and +365.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive enasidenib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every
      28 days for up to 24 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and periodically
      thereafter up to 2 years.
