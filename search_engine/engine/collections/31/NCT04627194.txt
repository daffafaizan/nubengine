      coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Kazakhstan. While a global effort in search for
      effective treatments and vaccines against COVID-19 is in effect, it is important that high
      quality and up-to-date information be available from a broad variety of populations on the
      dynamics of infection. This is especially important in regions where, due to resource
      shortage, epidemiologic surveillance may have gaps. To address the current gaps, medical
      records will be obtained for patients with confirmed COVID-19 during the first months of the
      pandemic (February-April 2020). The epidemiologic and clinical features including the
      demographics, clinical manifestation, laboratory parameters, radiologic assessments and
      clinical outcomes will be analyzed. The results of this study will facilitate the clinical
      management of COVID-19 patients in Kazakhstan and ultimately inform the ongoing efforts to
      curb the spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the
      region.
