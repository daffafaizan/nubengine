      recruitment for study, A2171105 was placed on hold. Nektar, the company from which Pfizer
      licensed CP-464,005, announced on April 9, 2008 that it had stopped its search for a new
      marketing partner. As a result, study A2171105 was terminated on April 10, 2008. Neither
      safety nor efficacy reasons were the cause of the study termination.
