      strategy), the first study period of 5 months will commence, also comprising a chloride-rich
      perioperative IV fluid therapy strategy (0.9% saline or 4% albumin). This will include
      intraoperative fluid and postoperative fluid for the duration of stay in the intensive care
      unit. This will then be followed by a 1-month transition period before a second period of 5
      months will commence where perioperative intravenous fluid therapy will consist of
      chloride-poor fluids (Lactated Ringer's solution or concentrated 20% albumin). A subsequent
      1-month transition period will then be followed by a third period of 5 months characterized
      by perioperative IV fluid therapy with an alternative combination of chloride-poor solutions
      (PlasmaLyteÂ® 148 or concentrated 20% albumin). A final 1-month transition period will be
      followed by a fourth and final period of 5 months characterized by a return to perioperative
      IV fluid therapy with chloride-rich fluids (0.9% saline or 4% albumin). A final 1-month
      run-off period using a chloride-rich perioperative fluid strategy will follow prior to study
      completion.
