      saline (NS). Several studies have highlighted the complications associated with large
      infusion of normal saline. Few studies have compared the effects of an alternative
      crystalloid, Ringer's Lactate (RL), on perinatal pH and postoperative morbidity in caesarean
      section surgery.

      This trial will be performed in Mulago Hospital Labour Ward theatre on parturients who
      consent and are scheduled for either elective or emergency caesarean section under spinal
      anaesthesia from September 2011 to May 2012. Study fluid will be administered
      intraoperatively only. Preoperative and postoperative venous blood samples will be drawn for
      venous blood gases, serum urea and creatinine. Placental umbilical arterial cord blood will
      also be drawn for neonatal arterial blood gases. Mothers will be followed up for 24 hours for
      incidence of postoperative morbidity.
