      scheduled for surgery under general anesthesia between May 2020 and September 2020 at Selcuk
      University Department of Anesthesiology and Reanimation. The data were obtained through
      face-to-face interviews before the child was taken to surgery after the necessary
      explanations were made to the parents of the children by the researchers. To enable the
      parents to answer the questions easily, a separate room in the relevant clinic was used for
      the interviews. The characteristics of the children and parents, supplementary data of the
      parents regarding the child's illness, and contact information were obtained. Participants
      were asked to complete a sociodemographic data form, the Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (CAS), and
      the COVID-19 Phobia Scale (C19P-S).
