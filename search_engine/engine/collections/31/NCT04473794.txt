      of cross-sectional imaging techniques such as CT and MRI. Twenty percent of all pancreatic
      cysts are non-inflammatory cystic neoplasms, many of which are mucinous, and therefore have a
      significant potential for malignant transformation. The primary challenge facing clinicians
      is the inability of current standard diagnostic tests, including imaging and standard
      laboratory data, to accurately and reliably discriminate neoplastic from non-neoplastic, and
      benign from malignant cysts, particularly in patients without symptoms. Therefore, some
      patients with benign cysts undergo unnecessary costly surveillance and possible avoidable
      surgical resections, which is associated with high cost, significant morbidity and mortality,
      while some may not be as aggressively followed. The International Association of
      Pancreatology (IAP) has published guidelines on the management of the two main types of
      mucinous cystic lesions: intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) and mucinous cystic
      neoplasms (MCNs). (1) Although these guidelines emphasize the frequency of surveillance and
      outline the indications for resection, these guidelines have not yet been validated, and
      these guidelines presume the diagnosis of a mucinous neoplastic cyst has been confirmed prior
      to surgery. It is unlikely that guidelines that only use clinical and imaging will be able to
      accurately differentiate benign cysts from those that are pre-malignant or currently harbor
      malignancy. Hence, there is a critical need for a diagnostic model that more accurately
      diagnoses neoplastic mucinous and malignant pancreatic cysts as this will improve the
      management of many patients with pancreatic cysts.
