      multiple organ damage and death. Excessive salt intake plays an important role in the
      development of hypertension.

      The experimental design is a randomized, double-blind, interventional study to investigate
      the neuroimaging changes of salty gustatory cortices under different concentration of NaCl
      solution with or without capsaicin intervention through brain PET/CT scan.
