      in which people on Wellbutrin had significant improvement clinically in their Crohn's
      disease. In this trial, the hypothesis that Wellbutrin can induce clinical remission in
      Crohn's disease will be tested. The investigators will also be looking to see if Wellbutrin
      can lower levels of the inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF).
