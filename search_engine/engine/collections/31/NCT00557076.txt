      thereby increasing demands for rehabilitation. Medical rehabilitation management during coma
      recovery, however, has been hampered by a paucity of rigorous clinical trials examining
      rehabilitation effectiveness. This randomized clinical trial addresses this knowledge gap.
      The purpose of the study is to determine whether a high dose of familiar vocal stimulation
      (FVs) improves outcomes for persons who are unconscious after severe TBI. The research
      objectives are to:

        1. Determine whether neural responses elicited with FVs improve neurobehavioral outcomes
           and/or elicit activations in expected regions.

        2. Examine the relationship between neurobehavioral and neurophysiological responses to
           high doses of FVs during coma recovery.

      There are two study cohorts and each group receives standard rehabilitation. The experimental
      group will be exposed daily to 40 minutes of FVs for 6 weeks. The Sham Group (Control Group
      2) will receive 40 minutes of sham treatment, or silence, daily for 6 weeks.

      The 40 minutes of FVs treatment will be provided in four 10 minute sessions. Each FV session
      will start with the subject hearing a familiar voice call the 'Subject's Own Name' aloud and
      then that same voice re-telling a memory or an event familiar to the subject. The person
      re-telling the event will be a person who experienced the event with the subject and who
      interacted with the subject on a daily basis for at least 1 year prior to injury.
