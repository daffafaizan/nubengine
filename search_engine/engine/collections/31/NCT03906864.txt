      multidisciplinary stepdown care, from 8 September 2004 to 14 June 2006 for the purpose of
      rehabilitation after a new hip fracture were included. Patients were excluded if any of the
      following criteria were present: (i) Pre-morbid non-ambulatory status, (ii) nursing home
      residents, (iii) palliative care patients, and (iv) patients previously enlisted for the
      trial. Administrative staff allocated patients to either ICP or usual care according to the
      last digit of their National Registration Identity Card (NRIC) numbers, odd numbers to the
      intervention group and even numbers to the control group. Patients were then admitted to 1 of
      2 intervention wards or 1 of 3 control wards. Patients were enrolled by the principal
      investigators only after moving into their respective wards because of work flow limitations.
      Those who refused consent or were excluded remained in their assigned wards and received
      usual care. Both intervention and control groups were under the care of multidisciplinary
      teams but the intervention group had structured assessments and checklists in addition to
      usual care while the control group had usual care alone.
