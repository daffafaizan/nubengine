      on tobacco withdrawal symptoms. Cotinine has been shown to have psychoactive effects that are
      similar as well as different from those of nicotine, however, little research has been
      conducted examining the role cotinine plays in nicotine addiction. This study compared the
      effects of cotinine with the nicotine patch, and a combination thereof on tobacco withdrawal
      symptoms. The results showed that cotinine antagonizes the beneficial effects of the nicotine
      patch in reducing withdrawal symptoms.
