        -  To determine the tumor control in patients with prostate cancer treated with
           radiotherapy or cryoablation

        -  To determine the quality of life of these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter
           study. Patients are stratified according to Gleason score (≥ 8 vs 7 vs ≤ 6), persistent
           prostatic specific antigen (PSA) at allocation (> 0.5 ng/mL vs ≤ 0.5 ng/mL),
           participating center. Patient are allocated to two treatment arms.
