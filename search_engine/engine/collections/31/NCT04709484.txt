      fasciitis, between the ages of 18-75, who have failed conservative treatment (stretching
      exercises, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and heel pads) for at least 3 months, and
      those with a Visual Anolog Scale value of 5 and above will be included in the study. Any
      local injection therapy and physical therapy for heel pain in the last 4 months, any surgery
      history for heel pain, history of tarsal tunnel syndrome, ankle effusion showing
      intra-articular disease, healed calcaneal fracture, Achilles tendinopathy, foot including pes
      and any deformity of the ankle, planus or pes cavus deformity; Patients with systemic
      disorders such as diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, hematological disease or gout,
      pregnancy, history of aspirin or aspirin-like medication, and mental insufficiency will be
      excluded from the study.

      In the study, the patients will be filled in Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and Foot Function
      Indez (FFI) questionnaires. Patients will be randomized into 2 groups according to the Random
      Number Generation. The first group will be the USG-guided steroid injection group, and the
      second group will be the palpation-guided steroid injection group. In the USG-guided group,
      steroid injection will be made to the area where the fascia is thickened under the guidance
      of USG. In the palpation-guided group, the most painful point will be found by palpation on
      the calcaneus bone and steroid injection will be made to that part. The content of the
      steroid solution will be 1 ml of 1% Lidocaine + 1 ml (40 mg) methylprednisolone. There will
      be pre-injection, 1st month and 3rd month controls after injection.
