    
      Prospective observational study of non-invasive measurements of VÌ‡O2 and DO2 pre-operatively
      and at 8 time points in the 48 hours postoperatively in a cohort of 40 patients undergoing
      elective major abdominal surgery (both open and laparoscopic) with a pre-operative
      cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET).

      As pilot work examining the relationship between post-operative oxygen consumption and
      complications in patients having contemporary major abdominal surgery , the investigators
      need to define and grade the severity of complications. The Post-Operative Morbidity Survey
      (POMS) is a simple outcome scale designed to record the incidence of clinically important
      complications - specifically complications likely to keep a patient in hospital. A POMS score
      performed on Day 5 is likely to be discriminative between patients who are recovering well,
      and those who are developing complications. POMS is easily performed, has good internal
      validity and is predictive of a prolonged length of stay. POMS is not a simple additive
      scale; however patients with POMS score of 1 or greater are highly likely to remain in
      hospital, whereas those with a score of 0 are likely to be able to go home.
