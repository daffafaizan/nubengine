    
      A non-randomized, interventional (nontherapeutic), feasibility trial to detect metabolic
      changes in participants with musculoskeletal sarcoma using hyperpolarized [1-13C]pyruvate
      Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy Imaging (MRSI). All measured quantities will be tabulated and
      the analysis will be descriptive and obervational in nature.

      Participants in this study will receive the study drug, hyperpolarized [1-13C]pyruvate, as a
      bolus injection during an MRSI of either a soft tissue sarcoma or healthy tissue. After the
      study drug injection and MRSI, participants will then receive contrast material, Gadavist,
      via injection during continuation the MRI.
