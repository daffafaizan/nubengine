    
      This is a single center randomized control trial of two arms. Singleton, cephalic, high risk
      pregnancies will be randomized to either oxytocin with mechanical dilation versus misoprostol
      with mechanical dilation.

      In group A, receiving misoprostol with mechanical dilation, will serve as the control group.
      Group B, oxytocin with mechanical dilation, will serve as the experimental group. The
      expected duration of participation begins at induction of labor and concludes at time of
      delivery.
