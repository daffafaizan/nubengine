      deficiencies due to social structures, and the physical demands of pregnancy and lactation
      particularly in South Asia. Periconceptional vitamin B12 and folate status are implicated in
      the development of birth defects and other pregnancy complications. Preliminary findings from
      clinical populations suggest that vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies early in pregnancy are
      the leading nutritional causes for neural tube defects. However, there is little
      representative population-level data from Southern India. Surveillance programs are urgently
      needed to establish the burden of anemia and key micronutrient deficiencies in high-burden
      settings such as Southern India, and to inform the development of interventions for anemia
      and birth defects prevention.

      The objective of this study is to conduct a biomarker survey to determine the burden of
      anemia and vitamin B12 and folate status in women of reproductive age, as part of an ongoing
      periconceptional surveillance program in Southern India. The goals of this surveillance
      program are to establish the World Health Organization (WHO)-recommended microbiological
      assay for folate in Southern India, to determine the burden of anemia and B-vitamin
      deficiencies in women of reproductive age, and to inform the development of a randomized
      trial of quadruple-fortified salt for anemia and birth defects prevention in Southern India.
      This laboratory will also serve as the foundation for future intervention trials and public
      health programs to improve the health of women and young children in this population.
