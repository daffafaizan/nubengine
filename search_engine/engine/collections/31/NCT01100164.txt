    
      The primary objective of the study is to determine whether eszopiclone (Eurofarma) is
      non-inferior to the reference drug zopiclone (Imovane®, Sanofi-Aventis) in the treatment of
      insomnia. To that end, the latency to persistent sleep (LPS) will be used as a primary
      endpoint at the end of the treatment, measured by polysomnography.

      The secondary objectives and endpoints of this study are as follows:

        -  To evaluate the efficiency of eszopiclone compared to zopiclone by means of the
           patient's clinical history, using as secondary endpoints:

        -  Variables of the sleep diary of the Associação Fundo de Incentivo à Psicofarmacologia
           (see Appendix A), namely:

        -  Latency time to the beginning of the sleep;

        -  Frequency of night wake-ups;

        -  Time awake during bedtime;

        -  Early morning awakening;

        -  Total time in bed;

        -  Sleep efficiency;

        -  Sleep variables measured by actigraph;

        -  Insomnia Severity Index (see Appendix B);45

        -  Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (see Appendix C);46

        -  To evaluate the safety of eszopiclone compared to zopiclone by means of adverse events
           in each study arm.
