        1. Feasibility of study design; can we evaluate the prevalence of AAA by inviting and
           detecting risk groups in national registries ?

        2. Point prevalence of AAA in a riskgroup of adult offspring to AAA patients as compared to
           a matched control group

        3. Quality of Life in risk groups: measuring HADS, EQ-5D and questionnaire on heredity,
           including their awareness on their risk for AAA

        4. Cost-effectiveness of such a national program based on prevalence and EQ-5D

      This program will evaluate the risk for AAA in adult offspring and also evaluate a highly
      probable effective registry-based detection route. This could be more cost-efficient than any
      other AAA screening program, since the prevalence presumably is very high, and the
      registry-based route could be cheaper than nurse-based detection or incidental screening. The
      ultimate benefit of this program will be a crude reduction of sudden deaths from AAA for
      adult offspring to AAA patients, and this will be specifically impressive for the female
      relatives that are never subjected to any AAA-screening in our country.
