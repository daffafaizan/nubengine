      reported diagnostic performance of short-term heart rate variability (HRV) for diabetic
      cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (DCAN) in the Chinese population. This study aimed to
      estimate sensitivities and specificities of DCAN diagnostic tests using the Bayesian
      approach, in the absence of a gold standard in another independence dataset.The reference the
      values for the short-term HRV were calculated in the investigators' previous study (including
      371 healthy subjects). This study dataset contained 200 subjects who completed both the
      short-term HRV test and Ewing's test. Simultaneous inferences about the population prevalence
      and the performance of each diagnostic test were possible using the Bayesian approach without
      a gold standard.
