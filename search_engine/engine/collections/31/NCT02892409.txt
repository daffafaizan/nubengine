      pylori (HP positive) who are, additionally, cytochrome P-450 (CYP)2C19 extensive metabolizers
      (EM) to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) of a quadruple therapy
      with bismuth, clarithromycin, amoxicillin, and TAK-438 versus quadruple therapy with bismuth,
      clarithromycin, amoxicillin, and lansoprazole. The study will enroll 30 participants.

      The treatment phase consists of quadruple therapy twice daily (BID) with tripotassium bismuth
      dicitrate (600 mg), clarithromycin (500 mg), amoxicillin (1000 mg), and TAK-438 (20 mg)
      (Group B) or quadruple therapy BID with tripotassium bismuth dicitrate (600 mg),
      clarithromycin (500 mg), amoxicillin (1000 mg),and lansoprazole (30 mg) (Group A) from Days 1
      to 14. Participants will be discharged on Day 15 after final PK blood samples are collected
      and all procedures performed.

      This single-center will be conducted in Korea. Participants will remain confined to the study
      site from check-in (Day -1) through Day 15 and will followed up through call on Day 17 and
