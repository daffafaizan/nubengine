    
      Mothers of preterm infants born at a gestational age <= 32 wg are asked to participate in
      this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled interventional trial, where they will
      receive a preparation of the herbal galactogogue Silitidil or placebo over an intervention
      period of 3 weeks. The influence of the galactagogue will be investigated by monitoring daily
      milk production before, during and 1 week after cessation of the intervention. As secondary
      outcome parameters weight gain, the progress of enteral feeding, and the percentage of human
      milk feeding on total enteral feeding volumes will be monitored in the newborn infants. Also
      the breast milk composition (in terms of fatty acids, protein and carbohydrates content) will
      be investigated and compared between study groups. Saliva and urine probes will be collected
      at specific time points to survey hormonal reactions during the various phases of lactation
      and the relation of maternal hormone levels on milk production.
