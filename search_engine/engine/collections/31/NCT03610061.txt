      Hodgkin lymphomas. Standard first line treatment achieves cure in approximately half of
      patients. However 30% die from relapsed lymphoma.

      Durvalumab (an antibody which blocks programmed cell death ligand 1) and other
      immunotherapies fight cancer by blocking barriers to immune system activity. Immune control
      of lymphoma provides the prospect of cure, even when chemotherapy has failed. Radiotherapy
      has striking effects on the immune system and can boost responses to these immunotherapies.
      The effect of concurrent radiotherapy and durvalumab in DLBCL and FL is unproven.

      This study will evaluate the safety and effect of simultaneous radiotherapy plus durvalumab
      (a PD-L1 inhibitor) in relapsed DLBCL and FL patients.
