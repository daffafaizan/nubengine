        4. Variables Predictor

             1. group 1 (same day PEG) received 4 L of PEG at 6 hours before procedure on the day
                of the colonoscopy

             2. group 2 (split PEG) received 2 L of PEG at 6:00 p.m the evening before colonoscopy
                and 2 L of PEG at 4-6 hours before procedure

             3. group 3 (SPMC 2) received one sachet of SPMC at 6 p.m the evening before
