      as a usual approach, the investigators have decided to transfer this technology to an
      original treatment of uterine fibroids. The access to each individual fibroid was determined
      considering passage of the needle towards its centre through only compromised tissue and by
      the shortest possible route by combining trans-vaginal ultrasound, hysteroscopy and
      laparoscopy. To optimize radiofrequency myolysis, in fact, the investigators decided to
      improve the procedure by inserting three innovative elements: application of a virtual needle
      tracking system to follow the RF electrode during the ablation session, real-time monitoring
      of RF ablation by contrast-enhanced ultrasound and systematic biopsy of the lesions before
      electro-coagulation.
