      following sub-studies:

      GENEFRAIL: this sub-study aims to determine the polymorphisms of several genes associated to
      frailty, in order to establish its predictive value for developing disability and response to
      treatment as well METABOFRAIL: this sub-study aims to investigate the metabolomic profile of
      frail and pre-frail patients. SARTRAIN: the combination of the assessment tools used in
      SARTRAIN (ARFI US, MRI, posturographic measurements) will provide a comprehensive study of
      the structural and functional characteristics of muscle and adjacent tissues and their change
      with time and the intervention. MID- POW: this sub-study aims to investigate changes in
      muscle power.

      The project also include an randomized controlled ancillary study: SENSOLE for which the aim
      is to investigate the potential effects of vibrating insoles device on gait and posture.
