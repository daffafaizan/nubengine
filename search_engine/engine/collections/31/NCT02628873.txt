      hysterosalpingography (HSG). HSG is a radiologic procedure that is performed to verify that
      placement of the Essure tubal ligation inserts have successfully blocked the fallopian tubes.
      However, this procedure involved exposure to radiation. The saline infused sonography (SIS)
      with directed air bubbles for hysterosalpingo-contrast sonography (HyCoSy) does not involve
      radiation and can be done in a physician's office. The HyCoSy air bubble device may be a
      lower cost, safer alternative procedure if it can be shown to provide similar results for
      tubal patency.

      This study will compare the HyCoSy procedure results with the HSG procedure results in women
      who require the HSG procedure after receiving Essure tubal ligation inserts for their Essure
      confirmation test.

      Women will be randomized to receive the HycoSy procedure first, followed by the HSG procedure
      or to the reverse order. Two independent readers will review the video results for both
      procedures to determine the degree of agreement on tubal patency.
