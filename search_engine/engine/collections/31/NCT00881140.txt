    
      Uterine fibroids are benign tumors of the uterus made up of smooth muscle and the
      extracellular matrix proteins Collagen and Elastin. They are exceptionally common; the
      cumulative incidence of a diagnosis of fibroids in women aged 25 to 45 is approximately 30
      percent.

      Uterine fibroids can cause abnormal uterine bleeding, dysmenorrhea, lower back pain and
      non-cyclic pelvic pain. They also can contribute to symptoms related to an enlarging pelvic
      mass (e.g., urinary frequency or constipation).

      Uterine fibroids are also associated with an increased risk of complications of pregnancy,
      and with infertility, although it is unclear whether this association is causative. Symptoms
      associated with uterine fibroids can have a significant impact on quality of life, with
      scores on standard measures that are comparable to those for other major chronic diseases
