      deleterious for the heart and needs urgent intervention to lower the blood pressure to the
      required values, however there is no clear recommendations concerning the treatment intensity
      in this situation.

      The investigators know that high arterial pressure increases the oxygen myocardial
      consumption and it is deleterious in acute coronary syndrome, so , it is logical to reduce
      intensively this pressure.
