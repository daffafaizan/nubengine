      several ischemic episodes. Immediately after aSAH, an increase of ICP causes an increase of
      CBF. It is followed by an acute vasoconstriction over the next hours and days. Typically
      between day 4 and 10 after aSAH, delayed arterial narrowing and a decrease of CBF occurs in
      approximately 50 % of aSAH patients and may result in cerebral ischemia and infarction. After
      the failure of the CONSCIOUS-trial to improve outcome after aSAH, there is no specific
      treatment in sight to effectively prevent cerebral ischemic events after aSAH. Under
      physiological conditions, the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) is one of
      the main determinants of cerebral blood flow (CBF). An elevation of PaCO2 may also be a
      useful treatment on aSAH patients. This trial is designed as a phase 1 study to test the
      feasibility of controlled hypercapnia in mechanically ventilated aSAH patients with
      poor-grade SAH. Monitoring is performed by an external ventricular drainage (ICP), near
      infrared spectroscopy (tissue oxygenation) and a thermodilution probe (CBF). The latter
      monitoring tools represent the primary end points of this study. In case of affirmed
      feasibility, a dose finding study will be launched as a next step.
