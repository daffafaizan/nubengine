      increasing prevalence rates of diet-related diseases indicate that, in practice, people's
      diet does not follow the recommendations. The intake of whole flour foods is consistently
      associated with reduced risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases in
      epidemiological studies, although the mechanisms of this association are unclear. Here the
      aim is to compare the metabolic effects and mineral status of consumption of diet containing
      wholemeal barley bread versus whole meal wheat bread in healthy subjects.

      The intervention was designed as a randomized, cross over trial of 3-weeks duration. A total
      of 14 participants was included in the study. In one period subjects received WBB bread; in
      the second period, subjects received WWB bread. This bread is based on the recipe of Egyptian
      Baladi bread but formed in Danish buns form. Participants incorporated this bread into their
      normal habitual diet with regard to the study restrictions about other cereal food products.
      At the beginning and end of each intervention period blood was drawn and urine collected and
      stored for later analysis.

      The primary outcomes of this study are evaluation of LDL-c, insulin and glucose levels
      evaluated by analysis of fasting blood samples. Furthermore, selected measures to evaluate
      SCFA level in blood is to be evaluated. Secondary outcomes include mineral status.
