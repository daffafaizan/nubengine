      of high dose immunosuppressive therapy, cancer chemotherapy and bone marrow or stem cell
      transplantation. It is usually subclinical but at times can manifest as an acute hepatitis,
      hepatic decompensation and death. Often times this leads to interruption of cancer
      chemotherapy.

      Recently, several case reports and case series have revealed evidence of hepatitis B virus
      (HBV) reactivation in previously recovered persons being treated for chronic hepatitis C
      (CHC) with direct-acting antiviral (DAA) agents. Given the severity of some cases, the U.S.
      Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued a Black Box warning regarding the risk of HBV
      reactivation to HCV DAA labeling to screen all hepatitis C patients for HBV before initiation
      of therapy and to monitor those with previous HBV infection for signs of reactivation while
      on treatment. However, since the FDA warning, retrospective experiences on clinical trials
      have failed to reveal evidence of viral reactivation. Further, the frequency of HBV
      reactivation and its risk factors and monitoring frequency in HCV patients receiving
      Interferon-free DAA therapy are yet unknown. Hence, we aim to conduct a multicenter
      retrospective analysis to investigate these issues.
