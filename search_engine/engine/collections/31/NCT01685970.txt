      better preparation quality and tolerability than single dose 4L PEG regimens. However,
      although patients drink each 2L separately, the total volume of 4 L PEG is still quite
      burdensome volume to ingest. In addition, in split dose method, night dose of day before the
      procedure make patient to suffer from sleep disturbance because of frequent diarrhea and
      abdominal discomfort.

      The investigators aimed to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of bowel preparation
      protocols with same-day 2 sachets picosulfate compared to conventional high volume (4L)
      split-dose for afternoon colonoscopy.
