      with a history of myocardial infarction (MI) are at particular risk. Concurrent alterations
      in myocardial structure & autonomic tone appear important for the development of the
      arrhythmias leading to SCD.

      Given the grave consequences of SCD, an ideal testing procedure should identify most of those
      at risk (sensitive) & correctly classify risk (accurate). Since >90% of patients who suffer
      serious arrhythmias post-MI have at least mild left ventricular (LV) dysfunction (ejection
      fraction [EF] <0.50) this is an optimal group to study.

      While noninvasive tests have been developed to estimate SCD risk, prior approaches have
      failed to: 1) identify the majority of patients at risk for serious arrhythmias
      (insensitive), 2) evaluate temporal changes in parameters, 3) identify the optimal timing for
      risk assessment post-MI, & 4) develop a widely-applicable screening tool. This has resulted
      in a failure to delivery effective therapies (e.g., defibrillator) in a cost-effective
      manner.

      Hypotheses. Primary: Concurrent evaluation of electrical structure & autonomic tone will
      accurately identify most post-MI patients at risk of serious arrhythmic events. Secondary: 1)
      assessment later (16 weeks) provides more prognostic information than assessment early
      post-MI (4 weeks), 2) a single multi-parameter test procedure can be developed, and 3)
      individually, repolarization alternans provides the most prognostic information.

      Methods. 350 persons with a recent MI (<31 days) & EF <0.50 will undergo testing early (4
      weeks), intermediate (8 weeks) & late (16 weeks) post-MI.

      Four techniques assess cardiac structure (spectral T-wave alternans [TWA], modified moving
      average TWA; signal-averaged [SA] ECG) & nuclear ejection fraction. Three others evaluate
      autonomic tone (baroreceptor sensitivity [BRS], heart rate variability [HRV], and Heart Rate
      Turbulence [HRT]).

      Data Collection & Outcomes. Patients will be recruited over 24 months & followed biannually
      for four years. Committee (blinded) endpoint classification & central laboratory data
      analysis will be utilized. A composite of resuscitated cardiac arrest and cardiac mortality
      is the primary outcome. The components (resuscitated / non-resuscitated cardiac arrest and
      cardiac death) are secondary outcomes.

      Statistical Aspects & Sample Size. Standard methods of description & analysis will be used.
      The capacity to accurately identify most patients at risk for serious arrhythmias will be
      evaluated using Cox multivariate models. The primary model will include age, sex, EF at 8 wks
      & important baseline medication use.

      Since multivariate modeling requires lower (more sensitive) dichotomy limits the following
      will be used: spectral TWA positivity will be defined as a non-negative test. SA-ECG QRS
      width >104 msec will be labeled as abnormal. For HRV, SDNN values <105 msec will be
      considered abnormal. For BRS, values <6.1 msec per mmHg will indicate impairment. For HRT
      abnormalities in T-onset & / or T-slope will be considered abnormal. Receiver operating
      characteristic curves will be used to identify a cut-point for modified moving average TWA.

      Assuming a 5 year 20% rate of the composite arrhythmias in patients with positive test
      results, we have 85% power to detect a 2.5-fold higher risk in patients with abnormalities
      than those without these abnormalities.

      Relevance. This is the first large prospective study to evaluate the utility of concurrent
      structural & autonomic tone assessment in predicting the development of serious arrhythmias
      after an MI.
