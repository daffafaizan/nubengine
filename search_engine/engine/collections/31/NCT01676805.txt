    
      Background:

      An estimated 79,190 people living in the United States will be diagnosed with lymphoma in
      2012, including 9,060 cases of HL, 70,130 cases of non-Hodgkin s lymphoma (NHL) and multiple
      cases of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma. Laboratory investigations conducted in the Lymphoid
      Malignancies Branch, including analysis of cellular, molecular, genetic and genomic biology
      are attempting to develop new prognostic and diagnostic models, therapeutic agents and novel
      treatment approaches for lymphoid malignancies and pre-malignant conditions.

      Objectives:

      This biology protocol is designed to allow sample acquisition for use in the study of
      lymphoid malignancies and malignancy precursors, including but not limited to B and T cell
      malignancies, such as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), Hodgkin s lymphoma (HL),
      multiple myeloma (MM), lymphomatoid granulomatosis (LYG) and adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma
      (ATL)as well as comparison to tissues from patients without lymphoid disease. A variety of
      laboratory investigations will be conducted on blood, tumor, bone marrow, urine, abnormal
      fluid and normal tissue, including analysis of cellular, molecular, genetic and genomic
      biology in the support of NIH translational trials to develop new therapeutic agents and
      novel treatment approaches as well as new prognostic and diagnostic models.

      Eligibility:

      Adult patients who meet the following:

        -  Confirmed pathological diagnosis of lymphoid malignancy or lymphoid precursor, including
           B-cell and T-cell lymphomas: including but not limited to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma
           (DLBCL), Hodgkin s lymphoma (HL), multiple myeloma (MM), lymphomatoid granulomatosis
           (LYG) and adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL).

        -  No known lymphoid malignancy or lymphoid precursor diagnosis and planning a surgical
           procedure during which blood or normal lymph node(s)/tissue (i.e., those not with
           pre-determined likelihood of abnormality/malignancy) may be obtained for research
           studies as part of this protocol.

      Design:

      The purpose of this study is to examine, in an exploratory fashion, a variety of biologic
      assays relevant to the investigation of lymphoid malignancies.

      It is anticipated that up to 60 consented subjects will be studied each year. To account for
      these anticipated 60 consented subjects in addition to up to potentially 5 screen fails each
      year, an accrual ceiling of 650 consented subjects is planned over 10 years.
