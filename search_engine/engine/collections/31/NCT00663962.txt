      effects on patients' daily activities. The severity of postoperative pain and the central
      sensitization associated with it are thought to play a role in the chronification of acute
      pain. Gabapentin has been shown to be effective in reducing acute post-surgical pain and
      treating CPTPS. There is conflicting data regarding its effects on the development of chronic
      post-surgical pain. Although pregabalin is similar to gabapentin there are only a few studies
      examining its use in the modification of post-surgical pain but evidence suggests that it
      might be effective. There are no studies examining the effect of pregabalin on the
      development of chronic post-surgical pain. Our hypothesis is that perioperative use of
      pregabalin will decrease the incidence of CPTPS. Our ultimate goal is to conduct a
      multi-center study assessing the effect of perioperative oral pregabalin on the development
      of CPTPS. Prior to this, we will carry out a prospective, randomized, placebo controlled,
      double-blinded pilot study to assess the feasibility, safety, and compliance associated with
      perioperative use of oral pregabalin in patients undergoing video assisted thoracotomy
      surgery (VATS) or open thoracotomy procedures.
