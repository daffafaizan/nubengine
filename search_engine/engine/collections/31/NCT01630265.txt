      diarrhea, and wheezing or asthma were randomized into written or video discharge instruction
      groups. In the ED, caregivers read standard written discharge instructions or watched a
      3-minute video based on their child's diagnosis. They were then asked questions regarding
      information covered in these instructions. After completing the 20-point questionnaire,
      standard discharge procedure was followed. Caregivers were contacted by phone 2-5 days after
      discharge for a follow-up questionnaire. Usefulness of the discharge instructions was also
      assessed.
