      destabilization of atherosclerotic plaque. However, currently, no non-invasive method is
      available for detecting plaque inflammation in clinical practice. FDG-PET can visualize
      activated metabolic levels of not only tumor cells but also inflammatory cells. Thus, it is
      possible that FDG-PET can detect atherosclerotic plaque inflammation and that, if so, FDG-PET
      can monitor the direct effect of statins on plaque inflammation. Additionally, monitoring the
      plaque inflammation by FDG-PET may be useful for determining the risk stratification of
      atherosclerotic patients.

      Originally, we sought to compare patients with FDG-positive plaque with patients with plaque
      but not with FDG uptake, patients with FDG-positive plaque receiving statin therapy, and
      patients with FDG-positive plaque receiving diet management therapy. However, because patient
      number enrolled in the study was too small, the comparison was performed between FDG-positive
      patients with and without any statin therapy.
