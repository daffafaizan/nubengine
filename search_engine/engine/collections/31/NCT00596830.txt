      Safety Monitoring Committee indicating that the addition of CP-751,871 [figitumumab] to
      paclitaxel plus carboplatin would be unlikely to meet the primary endpoint of improving
      overall survival compared to paclitaxel plus carboplatin alone. The DSMC recommendation to
      terminate the trial was based on futility, not on specific safety concerns; however, the DSMC
      recommended to investigate hyperglycemia as a potential contributor to the morbidity of the
      patients.
