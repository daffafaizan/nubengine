    
      The primary objective of this study is to determine if Atazanavir and Ritonavir together will
      be as effective as the child's previous regimen in keeping the level of virus in the blood
      stream at such a low level it can't be found and whether that combination will be as
      effective as the previous regimen in keeping the infection fighting cells in the blood at the
      same level.

      Secondary objectives will be:

        -  To determine if cholesterol and triglyceride levels drop in children switching to
           Atazanavir and Ritonavir from other medication regimens.

        -  To evaluate if Atazanavir and Ritonavir result in an increase in patient satisfaction
           and patient reported adherence and a decrease in symptoms related to medication side
           effects.

      Inclusion Criteria are:

        -  On the same medication regimen at least 3 months

        -  Weight equal to or greater than 25kg
