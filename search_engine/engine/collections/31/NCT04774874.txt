    
      This exploratory phase IIa, double blind, randomized, vehicle controlled, multicenter
      dose-finding trial will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of FOL-005 topical
      formulation (at 0.1%, 0.5% and 1.5% strength) administered once daily (in the evening) for 16
      weeks in healthy male subjects with androgenetic alopecia.

      The trial will be performed at three centers in Germany. The aim of the trial is to determine
      the most efficacious dose of FOL-005 topical formulation based on efficacy dose trends. It is
      planned to randomize 220 subjects (with a ratio 1:1:1:1 FOL-005 0.1%; FOL-005 0.5%; FOL-005
      1.5%; vehicle).

      The trial consists of a screening period of up to three weeks and a treatment period of 16
      weeks.

      Eligible subjects will be randomized at Baseline (Day 1) and will apply the investigational
      products themselves at home once daily for 16 weeks. Subjects will return to the sites bi-
      weekly for check of compliance and assessment of local tolerability. At Day1, Day 84 and Day
      112 subjects will be evaluated for hair growth parameters by TrichoLAB imaging. The end of
      the clinical trial for each individual subject is defined as the Final Visit at Day 112. In
      case of premature termination of a randomized subject an Early Termination (ET) visit should
      be performed.
