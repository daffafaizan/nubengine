      cervical cancer and its therapeutic approach is surgical removal of the organ with cancer.

      The last decade has developed various postoperative recovery protocols aimed at safe and
      rapid recovery of the patient after a surgery and early discharge from the hospital. These
      protocols are known as ERAS (Enhanced Recovery After Surgery) protocols or Fast-Track (FT)
      and combine various evidence-based perioperative care techniques.

      The ERAS protocols include specific approaches preoperative, intraoperative and
      postoperative, by the multidisciplinary team (surgeon, anesthetist and nurse), and aim at
      reducing the postoperative stress and pain, fasten the feeding and the mobilization of the
      patient after the surgery and rapid the hospital discharge.

      This trial is designed to evaluate the superiority of the ERAS pathway to conventional
      non-ERAS clinical practice in reducing the LOS. The results may provide new insight into the
      clinical applications of the ERAS pathway for MGOS.

      This doctoral thesis aims to compare the effectiveness of the Protocol ERAS against the
      classical model of recovery, in the postoperative recovery of patients with Gynecological
      Cancer undergoing MGOS, in a Public Oncology Hospital in Greece.

      The importance of ERAS programs is expected to emerge in the length of hospital stay, in pain
      control, in perioperative stress, in the early feeding and mobilization of patients who have
      undergone MGOS.
