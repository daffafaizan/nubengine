      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of High Intensity Non-invasive
      ventilation (HINPPV) in stable Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary patients with chronically
      elevated carbon dioxide levels. Participants will undergo various testing ( arterial blood
      gas (ABG), Pulmonary Function Test (PFTs), Polysomnography (PSGs), 6 minute walk tests)over a
      3 month period to determine if this type of therapy will improve daytime carbon dioxide
      levels. The participants will also complete quality of life questionnaires to help ascertain
      improvements in their daily living activities.
