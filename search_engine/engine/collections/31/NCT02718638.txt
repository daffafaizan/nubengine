      45.7 ± 15.2 years and time on dialysis, 71.2 ± 45.5 months) composed the exercise group and
      19 patients (61.5% women, age 42.5 ± 13.5 years and time on dialysis, 70.1 ± 49.9 months) the
      control group. The exercise program was performed during HD sessions, 3 times a week (36
      exercises sessions). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated and processed
      for expression of Nrf2, NF-kB and NADPH quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) by quantitative
      real-time polymerase chain reaction. Antioxidant enzymes activity (catalase-CAT and
      glutathione peroxidase-GPx), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and nitric oxide
      (NO) products were assessed using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
