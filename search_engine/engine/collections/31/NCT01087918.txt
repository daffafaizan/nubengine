      recent studies showed that after an incomplete spinal cord injury, strength, but not complex
      movement coordination, is affected. In this randomized cross-over trial we investigate the
      effectiveness of a task-specific 4 week Lokomat training with a 4 week (unspecific) lower
      extremity muscle strength training on walking-related and other outcomes.
