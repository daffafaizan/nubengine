    
      SB-480848 (darapladib) is a novel selective and orally active inhibitor of
      lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2) being developed by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK)
      for the treatment of atherosclerosis.

      This will be an open label study where each Subject will participate in 2 study sessions, a
      single dose session and a repeat dose session. All Subjects will receive 160 mg of enteric
      coated micronised free-base darapladib as a single dose and as repeated daily doses for 28
      days.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD)
      and safety of single and repeat oral dose of darapladib in healthy Chinese Subjects. The
      primary endpoints for safety are: clinical safety data from spontaneous adverse event
      reporting, 12-lead electrocardiogram recording, vital sign measurement, nursing/physician
      observation and clinical laboratory tests. The primary PK parameters of interest are area
      under plasma concentration time curve (AUC) and maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of
      darapladib, while the secondary PK parameters of interest are: time of occurrence of Cmax
      (Tmax) and apparent terminal phase half-life (t1/2) of darapladib as well as AUC, Cmax, Tmax
      and t1/2 of the metabolite, SB-553253. Finally, the PD endpoint of interest is plasma Lp PLA2
      activity, as expressed in terms of percent inhibition relative to baseline.
