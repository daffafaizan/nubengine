    
      There were two parts in the study, Part A and Part B.

      Part A was an assessment of 4 weeks of dosing with patiromer in the treatment of
      hyperkalemia; Part B was a randomized, placebo-controlled, 8-week assessment of the
      withdrawal of patiromer in participants with a baseline serum potassium at the beginning of
      Part A â‰¥ 5.5 mEq/L who responded to the 4 weeks of treatment with patiromer during Part A.

      All participants received patiromer during Part A; Part B participants were randomized to
      continue patiromer or switch to placebo. Total study participation was up to 14 weeks
      (including up to 2 weeks of follow up).

      The dose of patiromer could be titrated based on participant's serum potassium response.
