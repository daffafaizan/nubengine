    
      This study is open-label which means that all subjects will receive the study medication. The
      study medicine - reslizumab - will be given to the participants in addition to the medicines
      they are already taking to treat their EGPA such as oral steroids (e.g. prednisone) and
      medicines that reduce the activity of their immune system (the study doctor will tell the
      participants which medications these are) - this is what is meant by 'standard of care' and
      can vary in different countries. Drugs that are sometimes used (i.e., 'standard of care') to
      reduce the activity of the immune system in EGPA (in addition to oral steroids) include
      azathioprine, methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil and cyclophosphamide. Information about how
      the study drug affects the human body and health will be collected through a number of tests,
      procedures and questions.

      The study medicine, reslizumab, will be given to the participants at a dose of 3mg/kg
      intravenously (within a vein) every four weeks for 28 weeks for a total of 7 treatments.
      During the treatment phase of this study, a study staff member will call the participants
      every two weeks to see how they are doing, what medications they are taking, and if they are
      able to decrease their steroid use. The study is a total of 11 study visits in a 44 week time
      period. Everyone who takes part in the study will continue to receive his/her existing
      treatments for EGPA (although the dose of oral steroids may be reduced during the study).
