      methodologically poor and insufficient data supporting their use and the widely held belief
      that antidepressants can induce new episodes of abnormal mood elevation or accelerate the
      rate of cycling. The present study aimed at identifying clinical risk factors for switch into
      (hypo)mania or mixed states, within 8 weeks after introduction of an antidepressant or after
      increasing its dosage, in a prospective, longitudinal design.
