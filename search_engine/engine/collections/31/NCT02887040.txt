    
      This is a randomized Phase 3 protocol study of Antineoplaston therapy + radiation therapy vs.
      radiation therapy alone in subjects ≥ 3 years of age with newly-diagnosed, diffuse, intrinsic
      pontine glioma. In those subjects randomized to Antineoplaston therapy + radiation therapy,
      Antineoplaston therapy is administered for 104 weeks while radiation therapy commences on day
      one of Antineoplaston therapy and continues for 6 weeks. Subjects continue on Antineoplaston
      therapy if an objective response or stable disease is achieved during therapy and are
      maintained on Antineoplaston therapy to the end of the protocol study unless they develop
      progressive disease. Subjects randomized to radiation therapy alone receive 6 weeks of
      radiation therapy.

      Exploratory objectives are to compare the following in the two treatment arms: 1) overall
      survival for study subjects ≥ 21 years of age; 2) progression-free survival for subjects ≥ 21
      years of age; 3) objective response, complete response, partial response, and progressive
      disease rates, based on the enhancing portion of the tumor, for all subjects, using
      bidimentional measurement of tumor; 4) objective response, complete response, partial
      response, and progressive disease rates, for all subjects with non-enhancing tumors, using
      unidimentional measurement of tumor; and 5) objective response, complete response, partial
      response, and progressive disease rates, based on the enhancing + non-enhancing portions of
      the tumor, for all subjects, using unidimentional measurement of tumor.
