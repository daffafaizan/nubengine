      paroxysmal and persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) get incrementally less benefit with
      redo-PVI. This implies non-pulmonary vein (PV) triggers, which are more challenging to
      locate. The autonomic nervous system is implicated in the multifactorial pathogenesis of AF
      but few studies have attempted neural targeting as a therapeutic intervention. We have
      demonstrated that stimulation of specific left atrial ganglionated plexi (GPs) triggers both
      AF and atrial ectopy and importantly stimulation of these sites may not induce AV block, the
      'conventional' marker used to locate GPs. Having shown that these ectopy-triggering GP
      (ET-GP) sites are anatomically stable and can be rendered inactive by either ablation at the
      site or by ablation between the site and the adjacent PV, a single centre study suggests that
      ET-GP ablation can prevent recurrent AF in some patients.
