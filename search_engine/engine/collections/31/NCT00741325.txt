    
      This is a long-term observational study of patients who received at least one dose of study
      treatment (plerixafor or placebo) in a multicenter, randomized, double blind,
      placebo-controlled investigational study to evaluate granulocyte colony stimulating factor
      (G-CSF) plus AMD3100 versus G-CSF plus placebo to mobilize and transplant Non-Hodgkin's
      Lymphoma (NHL) patients (protocol AMD3100-3101 [NCT00103610]). The objective of this study is
      to assess progression-free survival and overall survival of patients treated with at least 1
      dose of study treatment (placebo or plerixafor) for a period of 5 years following the first
      dose of study treatment (placebo or plerixafor) in protocol AMD3100-3101 (NCT00103610).
