      sustainability of person-level physical activity (PA) interventions by leveraging the
      capacity of residents themselves as local data gatherers and solution generators for
      neighborhood environmental change. The primary aim of the group-randomized trial is to
      systematically compare the sustained (two-year) multi-level impacts of a lay
      advisor-delivered, person-level PA intervention that has demonstrated efficacy and
      translatability (Active Living Every Day) [ALED Alone arm], versus the ALED program in
      combination with a novel neighborhood-level intervention, called Our Voice [ALED+Our Voice
      arm]. The Our Voice program teaches residents to use a simple mobile application to
      individually and collectively identify neighborhood barriers to daily PA. They then convey
      this information to local stakeholders and decision-makers in ways that can facilitate
      potentially sustainable neighborhood-level improvements in support of regular PA. Up to
      sixteen affordable housing sites serving low-income, ethnically diverse midlife and older
      adults will be randomized to one of the two interventions.
