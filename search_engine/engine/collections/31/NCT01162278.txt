      will be given in a particular position to help guide the beams of radiation toward the cancer
      area. Although it is not mandatory, it is recommended that patients receive corticosteroid
      premedication (e.g. Decadron 4-10 m.g. p.o. in a single dose or equivalent) 15-60 minutes
      prior to each treatment for the intended purpose of modulating immediate acute inflammatory
      effects and providing anti-emetic support.
