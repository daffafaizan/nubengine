    
      The study is a blinded, cross-over design with subjects completing three, two-week treatment
      periods, separated by two, two-week washouts. Volunteers will consume a dietary fiber for two
      of the treatment periods at two dose levels. The fiber will be added to foods and dispensed
      to subjects to be consumed twice a day during each treatment period. During the control
      period, subjects will receive the same study foods, but with no added fiber. Major outcomes
      will include fecal weight, and responses to questionnaires that assess fecal characteristics,
      bowel habits and gastrointestinal tolerability.
