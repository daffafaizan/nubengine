      pneumonia of unknown cause that were epidemiologically linked to a seafood and wet animal
      wholesale market in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. It is now confirmed that the etiology of
      this outbreak is a novel coronavirus, namely, 2019-nCoV. Of critical importance is rapid and
      simple diagnostic method to be used in clinical settings to timely inform and refine
      strategies that can prevent, control, and stop the spread of 2019-nCoV. Recombinase aided
      amplification (RAA) assay is a novel isothermal nucleic acid amplification technique in
      recent years, which has a variety of the advantages including high specificity and
      sensitivity, rapid detection (30 min), low cost, low equipment requirements and simple
      operation. The investigators has successfully detected a variety of pathogens using this
      technique. To develop a RAA assay for 2019-nCoV with the advantages of high speed, simple
      operation and low cost, and overcomes the shortcomings of the existing molecular detection
      methods. The investigators established a real time reverse-transcription RAA (RT-RAA) assay
      for detection of 2019-nCoV. This assay was performed at 42Â°C within 30min using a portable
      real-time fluorescence detector, Recombinant plasmids containing conserved ORF1ab genes was
      used to analyze the specificity and sensitivity. Clinical specimens from patients who were
      suspected of being infected with 2019-nCoV were used to evaluate the performance of the
      assay. In parallel, The investigators also used the commercial RT-qPCR assay kit for
      2019-nCoV as a reference. Patients who were suspected of being infected with 2019-nCoV in the
      hospital.
