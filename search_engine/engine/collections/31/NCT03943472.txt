      eligibility criteria are met. Tests required to determine eligibility include disease
      assessments, a physical exam, Electrocardiograph, CT/MRI/PET, and blood draws. Participants
      receive chemotherapy prior to the infusion of BCMA CAR+ T cells. After the infusion,
      participants will be followed for side effects and effect of BCMA CAR+ T cells. Study
      procedures may be performed while hospitalized.
