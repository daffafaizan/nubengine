      including: obesity, diabetes, hypertension, or sleep apnea. Treating modifiable risk factors
      has been shown to improve morbidity and mortality in patients with AF. Treatment of AF with
      antiarrhythmic drugs or catheter ablation has not been shown to improve survival. Recently,
      small cohort studies combining exercise, diet, and antiarrhythmic medications and/or ablation
      have shown improvements in cardiovascular risk factors and reduction in AF symptoms and
      frequency.

      The aim of this study is to demonstrate a reduction in frequency and symptoms of AF and
      improvements in cardiovascular risk factors following a lifestyle intervention in patients
      with paroxysmal AF. This study uses a reproducible intensive supervised cardiac
      rehabilitation that includes exercise, diet, and risk factor modification for patients with
      paroxysmal, non-valvular AF. The investigators expect that a lifestyle intervention will show
      significant improvement in fitness and weight loss and improvements in AF symptoms and
      frequency, and cardiovascular risk factors when compared to a control group with paroxysmal
      AF and similar baseline characteristics who do not receive a diet and exercise program.
