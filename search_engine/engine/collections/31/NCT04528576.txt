      high or prohibitive surgical risk will be evaluated by the study sites, and study eligibility
      confirmed by the echocardiographic core laboratory and eligibility committee. Those
      qualifying will then be treated with Dragonfly transcatheter mitral valve repair system after
      signing the informed consent. The follow-up will be conducted at discharge, 30 days, 6 months
      and 12 months after the operation. The primary endpoints are the incidence of major adverse
      events (MAE) at 30 days, and acute procedural success. Acute procedural success is defined as
      placement of one or more Dragonfly devices on the mitral valve with reduction of MR to 2+ or
      less. The secondary endpoints include all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality,
      incidence of serious adverse event, cardiovascular rehospitalization, NYHA functional class,
      mitral valve hemodynamics, acute technical success rate and device success rate at 6 months.
      Acute technical success is defined as no procedural mortality, successful in access,
      delivery, and retrieval of the device delivery system, and no emergency surgery or
      reintervention related to the device or access procedure in the catheterization laboratory.
      Device success is defined as no procedural mortality, proper delivery and deployment of the
      device, no unplanned surgical or interventional procedures related to the device, no specific
      device-related technical failure and or complications, function improvement of MR without
      significant stenosis (MR â‰¤ 2+) and without associated hemolysis or thrombogenesis.
