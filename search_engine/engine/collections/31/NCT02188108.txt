      specifically for patients with kidney stones. Its development has been published. Internal
      and other validity tests on the instrument have been conducted and reported. Further validity
      testing of the instrument is needed to confirm its broader utility in the context of surgical
      and medical management of patients with kidney stones.

      Upon enrollment at each site, patients will be asked to complete a medical history form and
      the Wisconsin Stone-QOL. To supplement the information provided in the medical history forms,
      patients' medical records will be reviewed in order to collect and enter approved data into a
      spreadsheet. Further patient interventions include completion of the Wisconsin Stone-QOL at 3
      months, 12 months, 24 months, and 36 months post-enrollment. These post-enrollment surveys
      will usually be mailed to patients to the addresses they provide. Alternatively, patients may
      be provided the surveys at a urology encounter if it falls on or near the intervention time
      points. At each time point, patients' medical records will also be searched to document any
      changes in the data entered at enrollment.
