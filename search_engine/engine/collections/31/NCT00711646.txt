      randomised, placebo controlled parallel group study to evaluate the efficacy, safety and
      tolerability of SativexÂ® in subjects diagnosed with MS and spasticity. Subjects were screened
      to determine eligibility and completed a two week baseline period. Subjects then returned to
      the site for assessment, randomisation and dose introduction. Visits occurred at the end of
      treatment week two and at the end of the study (treatment week six) or withdrawal.
