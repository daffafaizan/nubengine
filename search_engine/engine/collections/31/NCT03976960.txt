      public health problem. Each year, 37 000 cases are newly diagnosed in France and 17 000
      patients die of the disease.

      Colorectal cancer is due to molecular and genetic damages involved in all tumorigenesis
      steps, transition from healthy tissue to adenoma and finally to invasive carcinoma stage. The
      investigators hope that a to better understand tumor invasion and metastatic scattering
      processes will allow therapeutic innovation and the emergence of new biomarkers.

      However, the study of early tumorigenesis phases as well as advanced stages of the disease is
      currently limited due to a lack of tissue samples.

      In this context, the Montpellier Cancer Institute (ICM) decided to initiate a biological
      collection dedicated to the tissular and blood samples of patients with colorectal cancer.
