      targeting the liver during initial metastases. The Comprehensive Genomic Profiling of
      Colorectal Cancer Patients with Isolated Liver Metastases to Understand Response and
      Resistance to Cancer Therapy (COMPARISON) study aims to assess the disease course of CRC by
      collecting primary tumor and metastatic liver specimens following pre-operative chemotherapy.
      If relapse occurs following surgical resection of the liver, biopsies will also be done for
      molecular analysis. As a result, these samples can be analyzed for chemotherapy resistance
      mechanisms and therapeutic targets to determine potential clinical outcomes for this
      particular subset of CRC patients.
