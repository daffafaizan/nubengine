      carried out in outpatients department of Obstetrics and gynecology, at the Dow university of
      Hospital and mamji hospital Karachi.

      The study period will be of 6 months. Polycystic ovarian syndrome PCOS constitute most common
      endocrinopathy present in 4-7% women of reproductive age. Rotterdam criteria, diagnosis of
      PCOS require two of the three features: oligo and/or anovulation, clinical and/or biochemical
      signs of hyperandrogenism and polycystic ovaries by u/s and the absence of other endocrine
      conditions such as hypothyroidism, cushing syndrome, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, or
      hyperprolactinemia.

      Insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia may play a key role in pathogenesis of this syndrome
      by deregulating LH secretion at central level and increased stimulation of cytochrome p450 in
      ovary, hyperinsulinemia also decreases the circulating concentration of SHBG and contribute
      to greater concentration of free androgens in blood, cut off of insulin level for insulin
      resistance in Pakistani population is 9.25U/ml. On basis of evidence, Insulin sensitizing
      agents has been recently proposed as a useful treatment option in women with pcos, which by
      reducing insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia, reduce the insulin driven ovarian and
      adrenal hyperandrogenism usually restoring normal LH and FSH secretion and ovulatory cycles.
