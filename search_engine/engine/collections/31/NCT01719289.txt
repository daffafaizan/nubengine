    
      Despite the high prevalence of depressive disorders in pregnancy and puerperium and the
      possible negative consequences of these frames for women, children and family, there are
      still very scarce evidence on the effectiveness of interventions of low cost and viable, that
      can be made available on the net of Primary Health Care in Brazil and other middle or low
      income countries.

      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a depression management
      program, simple and low cost, delivered by nurse assistants, in reducing symptoms of
      depression in pregnant women treated in primary care clinics that adopt the Family Health
      Strategy (FHS) in São Paulo, compared to routine care. We will also assess the
      cost-effectiveness of this intervention.

      We are conducting a community cluster randomized trial with pregnant women with symptoms of
      depression, attending antenatal care in primary care clinics that adopt the FHS in São Paulo.
      Participating clinics (12) were randomly allocated to have their nurse assistants receiving
      training and supervision to perform a program for management of depression among pregnant
      women (experimental group) or to offer routine care (control group).
