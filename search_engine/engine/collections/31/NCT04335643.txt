      acceptable and beneficial to teens and young adults coping with cSLE. This study uses a
      cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) intervention called the Treatment and Education Approach
      for Childhood-onset Lupus (TEACH) to address symptoms of fatigue, depression, and pain that
      commonly occur in individuals with cSLE. The TEACH program includes six-weekly, one hour
      sessions, conducted over HIPAA-compliant video conferencing.

      Participation in this study will take approximately 8-15 weeks. After qualifying for the
      study, participants will be randomly selected, like flipping a coin, to the TEACH program
      plus medical treatment as usual (TAU) OR medical TAU alone for six weeks. After this six-week
      time period, a post-assessment will be completed. Participants that only continued medical
      TAU will then be eligible to receive TEACH after completing the post-assessment. If these
      participants choose to undergo the TEACH treatment, they will be asked to complete a short
      interview about the program and answer questions about how their mood, pain, and fatigue.
