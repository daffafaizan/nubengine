      EMR data was collected as well as PK sampling around their dosing to include the following
      samples immediately pre-dose, then at the following times thereafter: 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8
      hours. Blood samples were collected in lithium-heparin tubes from a central venous catheter
      that is not being used for the continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration. The tubes were
      centrifuged at 2500 rpm for 10 minutes within 1 hour from collection and the samples will be
      frozen at 80Â°C. The total concentrations of ceftazidime and avibactam were determined
      simultaneously from plasma by using a validated HPLC-tandem MS assay. Noncompartmental
      pharmacokinetics were calculated using the linear-up and logarithmic-down trapezoidal method,
      based on the assumption of first-order elimination.
