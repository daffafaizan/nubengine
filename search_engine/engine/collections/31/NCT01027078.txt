      Apnea (OSA). Nitric Oxide (NO) related endothelial dysfunction occurs in OSA as the earliest
      vascular abnormality prior to the manifestation of vascular disease and it results in
      impaired vasodilatory response to hypoxia. These abnormalities have already been described in
      OSA patients. The role of oxidative stress in endothelial dysfunction is present in vascular
      disorders. The presence of oxidative stress in OSA patients is also well established. The
      effect of increased superoxide on endothelial function has also been described in the
      literature. The mechanism of this effect is unknown and is the focus of this research.

      We hypothesized that patients with Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) who are free of any
      cardiovascular disease will have early microcirculatory changes that are unique to OSA, and
      therefore would resolve with treatment of OSA.
