      mortality. Traditional pharmacological therapies are used in clinical practice without
      breakthrough for long time. Previous studies confirmed that partly blocking sympathetic
      nerves activity contributed to improve cardiac function in patients with heart failure. Renal
      ablation with sympathetic modification is a new method which is proved to be effective in
      decreasing sympathetic nerves activity. The investigators hypothesis that renal sympathetic
      nerves modification is effective and safe in improving cardiac function. This trial is going
      to recruit 200 patients (Ablation group VS Control group = 1:1) with a follow-up duration of
      3 years. Patients in ablation group will receive additional necessary anti-heart failure
      drugs besides expectant intervention, and patients in control group will receive appropriate
      anti-heart failure drugs only. The investigators aim to observe the incident of composite
      cardiovascular events after renal sympathetic modification using THERMOCOOLÂ® catheter in
      patients with heart failure, and evaluate safety and efficacy of the intervention.
