      intolerant of this therapy initially. After continued use, tolerance is achieved. However,
      this initial discomfort or intolerance frequently leads to a patient-initiated
      discontinuation of therapy. It has been shown that CPAP use at 1 month predicts use at 6
      months and 1 year. Patients who initially struggle with or are intolerant of CPAP frequently
      abandon therapy and are unlikely to use it long term. To prevent this, sleep physicians often
      prescribe short courses of sedatives to help improve initial tolerance and promote better
      compliance with therapy. However, the effectiveness of this practice has not been validated
      in a clinical trial. Compliance, in reference to this study is the willingness of the
      patients to follow the prescribed course of treatment.
