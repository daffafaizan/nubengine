    
      This is a randomized parallel 2-cohort phase 2 study of elotuzumab given at 10 mg/kg weekly
      during induction in combination with lenalidomide (either 25 mg or 10 mg) in patients with
      multiple myeloma who progress or relapse serologically while on single agent lenalidomide
      maintenance.

      The combination therapy with elotuzumab and lenalidomide will be continued until further
      progression of myeloma (based on response criteria) or intolerability.
