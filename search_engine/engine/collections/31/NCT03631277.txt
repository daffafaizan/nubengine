      carious dentin bordering the pulp and sealing the pulp with a biocompatible material. .
      Calcium hydroxide is the gold standard for pulp capping, it permits reparative dentin bridge
      formation, maintains pulp vitality, protects the pulp against harmful stimuli and has
      antimicrobial effect. However, several disadvantages were reported with its use over time
      including poor seal, lack of chemical and mechanical adhesion, poor strength, long-term
      solubility, enhanced degradation after acid etching and tunnel defects in the dentin bridge .
      The operative tradition is to remove softened dentin to eliminate infected tissue; however,
      it is impossible to eradicate all the micro-organisms because few will persist although all
      soft dentin was excavated.

      Evidence suggest that for arresting caries lesions, it is not crucial to completely remove
      the infected dentin and that selective caries removal and composite restoration can yield
      better clinical results . For more conservative and effective treatment, disinfection instead
      of complete caries removal has been encouraged. . PAD is an advanced technology utilizing two
      non-toxic components, a photo-activating liquid and a LED light source that selectively
      target and abolish cariogenic bacteria and periodontal pathogens . The usage of PAD in caries
      management can eradicate residual bacteria in soft dentin, reassures rapid healing and
      improve the prognosis of treatment .
