    
      PHASE 1b:

      Patients will be enrolled in cohorts of 3-6 patients. Escalation of the alvocidib dose will
      follow a standard 3+3 design with sequential cohorts of 3 patients treated with incrementally
      higher doses of alvocidib administered in sequence after decitabine (during dose escalation)
      or azacitidine until a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) is observed and the MTD is established.

      Once the MTD or preliminary RP2D of alvocidib administered via hybrid dosing is identified, 2
      cohorts of at least 3 patients each will receive azacitadine followed by alvocidib
      administered as a 30-60 minute IV infusion.

      Expansion at MTD Once the MTD or preliminary RP2D of alvocidib administered as a 30-to-60
      minute IV infusion is determined, up to 25 patients will be enrolled in an Expansion cohort
      to receive alvocidib following azacitadine to confirm safety, explore potential biomarkers,
      and evaluate potential signals of alvocidib activity. Once this Expansion cohort is
      completed, the study will progress to Phase 2

      PHASE 2:

      Phase 2 design is based on the Simon 2-stage minimax design (Simon 1989).

        -  Stage 1: Up to 15 evaluable patients will be enrolled and treated at the RP2D identified
           in the Phase 1b study.

        -  Stage 2: Ten patients will be enrolled to bring the total enrollment in Phase 2
           (including Stage-1 patients) to 25 evaluable patients. Stage-2 patients will also
           receive the RP2D dose of alvocidib administered by 30-to-60 minute IV infusion
           identified in the Phase 1b study. If 6 or more responses are observed in 25 patients,
           the conclusion will be that the combination regimen is worthy of further investigation.
