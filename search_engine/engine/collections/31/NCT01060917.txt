      target of glucose sensor development. The aim of this study is to evaluate the performance of
      a non-invasive glucose sensor (wristwatch) under controlled conditions (glucose clamp) at
      hyperglycemia (study day 1) and at hypoglycemia (study day 2). Measurements of the
      non-invasive glucose monitoring device are compared to those obtained from a minimally
      invasive glucose monitoring device (GlucoDay, microdialysis principle). In addition, changes
      in blood electrolyte concentrations as well as their impact on the measurements of the
      non-invasive glucose sensor are evaluated.
