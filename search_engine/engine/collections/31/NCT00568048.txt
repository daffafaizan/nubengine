      Primary

        -  To evaluate the efficacy of temozolomide in combination with bevacizumab in patients
           with unresectable stage IV melanoma.

      Secondary

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of this regimen.

      Tertiary

        -  To evaluate the prognostic and predictive significance of circulating endothelial cells
           and endothelial progenitor cells in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  To predict tumor response and outcome in patients treated with this regimen by measuring
           hypermethylation of the tumor.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral temozolomide once daily on days 1-7 and bevacizumab IV over 30-90
      minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 14 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Blood is collected at baseline and on day 1 of course 2. Samples are analyzed for circulating
      endothelial cells and endothelial progenitor cells by flow cytometry and pro- and
      anti-angiogenic serum factors by ELISA. Paraffin-embedded tumor tissue is analyzed for MGMT
      promoter methylation status by methylation-specific PCR; MGMT protein expression by IHC; and
      MSH2, MSH6, and MLH-1 expression (DNA repair enzymes).

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then
      every 6 months for 1 year.
