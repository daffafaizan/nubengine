      progresses, and they affect up to 24% of pregnant women in the third trimester. Complications
      of untreated hemorrhoids include bleeding, prolapse, soiling, discharge with perianal
      irritation and itching, and in severe cases, severe pain and venous engorgement which could
      even lead to thrombosis and infarction. Hemorrhoids are treated with a variety of
      suppositories and gels, based on analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects. The safety of these
      antihemorrhoidal products has not yet been documented in pregnant women.

      Proctofoam-HC® has been on the Canadian market for 25 years. It combines the
      anti-inflammatory action of hydrocortisone with the surface anesthetic effect of pramoxine
      HCl. It is approved for temporary relief of anorectal inflammation, pruritus, pain and
      swelling associated with haemorrhoids, fissures, pruritus ani, cryptitis, proctitis and
      postoperative pain.

      We hypothesize that local application of Proctofoam-HC® in the third trimester of pregnancy
      is safe for the mother and fetus.
