      and/or obesity can have a condition called metabolic syndrome. These patients are at high
      risk for diabetes and Cardiac Autonomic Neuropathy (CAN). Subjects with diagnosed metabolic
      syndrome will be expected to participate in the Metabolic Fitness Program which is a
      University of Michigan diet exercise program located in the Cardiology department at Domino
      Farms in Ann Arbor. Time required for this program and the study is 6 months. Clinic visits
      will involve Cardiac autonomic testing (CAN) procedures, PET scans and labs which will
      measure pre and post program intervention.
