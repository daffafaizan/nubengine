      genetically confirmed FPLD at Reunion University Hospital (La Réunion, France) from 2006
      (beginning of the screening for lipodystrophy) to 2020. Due to the high prevalence of
      lipodystrophy in our island and to follow the recommendations in follow up, a specific
      check-up is organized in our centre since 2016. For this study the investigators collected
      the data from patients who carried the same LMNA 'Reunionese' mutation: p.T655fsX49 and who
      benefited a complete check-up in our centre since 2016. Between 2006 and 2020, 97 patients
      were diagnosed with FPLD at Reunion University Hospital. Three different mutations were
      diagnosed: 85 subjects carried the 'Reunionese' mutation LMNA p.T655fsX49 (70 heterozygous
      and 15 homozygous), 8 carried the mutation LMNA p.R582H and 3 subjects carried a mutation of
      PPARγ. Among the carrier of the mutation LMNA p.T655fsX49, 70 subjects benefit a recent
      follow up with complete examination (61 heterozygous (HTZ) and 9 homozygous (HMZ)) and 4
      deceased (all carrier of the homozygous form).
