    
      PD patients with PIGD subtype will be included.

        1. Assessment:

             -  Overall features of PD are assessed by Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale
                (UPDRS). Non-motor features including cognition will be assessed by standard
                scales. Gait and balance will be assessed by gait analysis system, which measures
                physiological parameters of gait such as velocity, variability and center of
                pressure. Positron emission tomography using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG PET) will
                be done to brain activities related to gait and balance.

             -  Clinical evaluation will be done at the baseline, 4th, 8th and 12th week

             -  Gait analysis and FDG PET will be done at the baseline and 12th week

        2. Drug dosage

             -  For the first 4 weeks, 5 mg/day

             -  Then, 10 mg/day for 8 weeks
