      with a selective class I histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor (entinostat).

      The study will enroll 20 subjects with a confirmed diagnosis of MIBC (cT2-T4aN0M0) who are
      ineligible for (based on consensus criteria)[1] or refuse neoadjuvant cisplatin-based
      chemotherapy. Subjects must consent to having tissue collected for research purposes during
      the scheduled surgery prior to study entry. After screening and enrollment, blood and
      archived transurethral resection of the bladder tumor (TURBT) tumor tissue will be collected
      from each subject for baseline analyses. Subjects will then start on clinical trial treatment
      followed by radical cystectomy. Subjects will be administered pembrolizumab alone 200 mg IV
      on day 1 and day 22 (Arm 1) or pembrolizumab on day 1 and day 22 and entinostat 5 mg given
      orally on day 1, day 8 and day 15 (Arm 2).

      Blood and tumor will then be collected from each subject at the time of cystectomy (within 10
      weeks after initiation of protocol therapy). The investigators do not anticipate delays in
      surgery due to the planned schedule of the preoperative treatment administration for the
      purposes of this study and based on the phase II ENCORE 601 trial (pembrolizumab and
      entinostat in melanoma) which reported an acceptable safety profile. Phase I data identified
      grade 1/2 fatigue as the most common entinostat-related toxicity, with neutropenia and anemia
      only occurring at doses exceeding those proposed for this study. Safety stopping rules for
      drug-related toxicity will dictate whether the trial should be halted if subjects are
      experiencing drug-related toxicity that delays or interferes with standard of care
      procedures.
