      University Hospital and Stavanger University Hospital with symptoms indicative of acute
      coronary syndrome. 1500 patients will be included at Haukeland University Hospital and 750 at
      Stavanger University Hospital. The two locations use different high sensitive troponin assays
      (i.e. hs-cTnT and hs-cTnI (Abbott Diagnostics) for routine diagnostic of coronary syndrome.

      2250 patients will be sampled and hs-cTnT or hs-cTnI (as applicable) will be measured at
      admission, after one (2/3 of the cohort), three hours and after 8-12 hours. Clinicians will
      be blinded to the results of the hs-cTn assay that is not used as routine assay locally.
      Final diagnosis will be made by two independent cardiologists based on all available clinical
      information and results of the routine tests. The ability to diagnose or exclude MI ACS, and
      MACE at different sampling points in different patient populations will be compared for
      different biomarkers. 1500 patients will have a sample 1 hour after admission. The clinicians
      will be blinded to the results of this sample (both hs-cTn assays). The ability of the
      one-hour sample to diagnose or exclude myocardial infraction (MI), ACS and MACE will be
      compared between biomarkers.

      All patients will be invited to take a follow-up sample 3 months after discharge.

      The patients will further be followed for 1-5 years through national registers and the
      prognostic value of hs-cTn concentrations and dynamics as well as other biomarkers, will be
      measured.
