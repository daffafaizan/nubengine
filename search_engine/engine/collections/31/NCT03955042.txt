    
      This is a prospective, open-label, single-arm pilot feasibility study of pemetrexed for the
      treatment of adult patients with chordoma. All patients providing informed consent will be
      screened for eligibility. Eligible patients will receive pemetrexed by intravenous infusion
      on Day 1 of each 21-day treatment cycle, pre-medications (folic acid, vitamin B12, and
      dexamethasone), and ibuprofen if needed. Patients will continue dosing of pemetrexed until
      disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or treating physician
      determines it is in their best interest to stop. All patients will have regular evaluations
      for assessment of safety parameters and anti-tumor activity as detailed in the study flow
      chart.
