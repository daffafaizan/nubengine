    
      Pilot, phase III prospective, randomized, open-label, multicentric controlled study, which
      will offer a novel dual-therapy regimen including RPV 25mg + DRV 800mg/rtv 100mg QD to HIV+
      subjects with suppressed viremia.

      132 HIV+ subjects will be randomized, 1:1, to switch to RPV+DRV/r versus continue triple-drug
      therapy. Subjects will be switched from any PI/r-containing regimen.

      The duration of the study is 96 weeks and patients will be stratified according to their HCV
      serostatus (Ab positive or negative), age (> or < 50 years), and immunological status
      (CD4<200/µL; CD4=200-500/µL; CD4>500/µL). It is planned to enroll at least 30% of female
      subjects.

      Follow-up visits will be performed at 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, and 96 weeks (laboratory
      and physical examination).

      Effectiveness will be measured by determination of HIV-RNA, safety will be evaluated by
      determination of AST, ALT, creatinine, plasmatic and urinary phosphate, albuminuria, total
      cholesterol, HDL and LDL cholesterol, triglycerides at the follow-up visits.
