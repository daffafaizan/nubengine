      or three AEDs are unlikely to become seizure-free with further attempts at pharmacotherapy.
      Such patients may experience poor quality of life and functional outcomes from continuing
      seizures and the adverse effects associated with further attempts at pharmacotherapy. VNS is
      a non-pharmacologic treatment for epilepsy with well-established effectiveness as an
      adjunctive treatment (to AEDs) for partial seizures refractory to AEDs, but there are no
      randomized clinical trials comparing the effectiveness of adjunctive VNS therapy with further
      pharmacotherapy alone in such patients.
