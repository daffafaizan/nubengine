      operative morbidity including pain and occasionally bleeding. This morbidity is partly caused
      by post surgical inflammation. This inflammatory process can be quantified using various
      proinflammatory cytokines.

      the goal of this study is to objectively compare the inflammatory process after treatment of
      obstructive sleep apnea with different surgical approaches to the enlarged tonsils.

      In the study three approaches are prospectively compared:

        1. Tonsillectomy - using electrocautery resecting all tonsillar tissue.

        2. Debrider Tonsillotomy - reducing the tonsillar tissue with a debrider.

        3. laser Tonsillotomy - reducing tonsillar tissue using a CO2 laser.

      All patients will be randomized to one of three arms. Each arm will include 25 children.

      All children will have a preoperative and postoperative sleep study. Questioners assessing
      pain, amount of medication used to control pain and sleep disturbance during the first 7 days
      after surgery will be filled by the child caretaker.

      Blood will be drawn immediately before surgery and 18-24 hours after surgery. The following
      blood products will be assessed: White blood cells, clotting factors, C reactive protein, IL1
      beta,TNF alpha, IL6, IL2.

      If the study will show objectively and subjectively that partial resection of the tonsil
      compared to complete tonsillectomy is less painful and has less postoperative inflammation.
