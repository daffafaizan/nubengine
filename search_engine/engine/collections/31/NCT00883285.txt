      techniques include the conventional technique, the transfemoral and the transapical approach.
      Before the intervention CT of the chest is performed preoperatively to assess the degree of
      aortic and aortic valve calcification. Patients undergo MRI of the brain, including diffusion
      weighted imaging (DWI) and neurological assessment (NIHSS score) within 48 h before and after
      the procedure to assess occurrence of cerebral embolism.
