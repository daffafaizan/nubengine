      intraoral cameras to take photographs of oral lesions and place them in the Dentrix
      electronic health record (EHR), along with descriptions of the lesions. Using a mixed-methods
      approach, the study will evaluate and enhance the feasibility and acceptability of
      integrating a tele-mentoring component into the identification of oral lesions at the 6 FHC
      dental clinics.
