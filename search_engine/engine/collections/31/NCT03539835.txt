      metabolism may be increasingly important in Breast Cancer Survivors (BCS) to prevent
      susceptibility to cancer associated fatigue, depression, and declines in muscle mass and
      function.

      There is emerging evidence that supports exercise as a non-pharmacological therapy to prevent
      cancer recurrence, sedentary behaviors, and obesity during cancer survivorship . It seems
      that interventions that include resistance training (RT) are most efficacious at reducing
      fatigue in BCS This study will begin to fill a knowledge gap by determine whether changes in
      kynurenine metabolism occur following RT and relate to reductions in inflammation and
      improved behavioral and physical function as this may identify potential targets for
      interventions to promote cancer recovery.
