      expected by the French National Authority for Health (HAS). Therefore, in its opinion report
      from July 13, 2010, HAS makes the maintenance of reimbursement approval of each stent graft
      dependent on the presentation of results of a specific follow-up study carried out in a
      cohort of patients representative of the French population treated under real-life conditions
      of use. This prospective cohort study must involve at least 150 patients implanted after
      registration on the LPPR (List of Products and Services qualifying for Reimbursement). The
      results of the follow-up study must be forwarded to the National Committee for Evaluation of
      Medical Devices and Health Technologies (CNEDiMTS) for examination once a year. The
      assessment of this follow-up could lead to the recommendation by CNEDiMTS to continue or stop
      the reimbursement of the concerned stent graft.

      In France, The Endurantâ„¢ Stent Graft System is registered on the LPPR for a period of 3 years
      since September 13, 2011. In order to comply with HAS expectations, Medtronic Bakken Research
      Center is setting up this long term non-interventional study on the Endurant stent graft.
