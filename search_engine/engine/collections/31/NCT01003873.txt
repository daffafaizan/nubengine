    
      Dysregulation of the endocannabinoid system has been associated with the development of
      obesity, metabolic and cardiovascular disorders in both animals and humans.

      Obese patients, especially those with abdominal obesity, have significantly higher levels of
      endocannabinoids. No influence of moderate (5%) body weight loss (induced either by diet
      intervention or sibutramine) on the peripheral activity of the endocannabinoid system gastric
      bypass (GB) surgery is the most efficient treatment of obesity Hormonal pathways may
      participate to the weight reducing effect of the procedure.The endocannabinoid system is
      present in the gastrointestinal tract.

      In animals, sustained weight loss after GB is characterized by reduction of endocannabinoids
      levels.

      The endocannabinoid levels will be studied (baseline and after stimulation) in:

        -  Normal-weight subjects

        -  Obese subjects before and after gastric bypass surgery

        -  Obese subjects before and after a lifestyle intervention
