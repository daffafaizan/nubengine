      depending on tumor location. Patients will receive weekly magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
      scans during the course of proton therapy to monitor changes in solid tumor or cystic volume.
      Such changes may prompt adaptive therapy to improve coverage or minimize the RT dose to
      healthy structures. Neurocognitive outcomes, sensitive to measures of memory and learning,
      will be collected at baseline and continue to 5 years post therapy. Disease evaluation will
      be monitored with brain MRI.
