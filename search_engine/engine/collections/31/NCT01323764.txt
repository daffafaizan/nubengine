      whether a VP shunt is patent or obstructed is statistically no different than the accuracy of
      the accepted standard test, radionuclide shunt patency study, when performed simultaneously.

      A secondary objective is to determine SC and SC+MP results in the presence of possible
      partial obstruction, which defined as subjects with radionuclide clearance measured by T1/2
      of 8 to 10 minutes.

      A secondary objective is to compare ShuntCheck flow rate results to simultaneous radionuclide
      clearance as measured by T1/2. A secondary objective is to demonstrate that ShuntCheck flow
      rate results are statistically equivalent to simultaneous radionuclide clearance measured by
      T1/2
