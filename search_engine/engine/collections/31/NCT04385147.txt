      retrograde cholangiopancreatography and endoscopic ultrasound on a global level) in different
      endoscopy units all over the world, to report the characteristics of patients presented to
      these units and their procedure details.

      evaluate the validity of different GI societies recommendations applied in different GI
      endoscopy units on the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 nosocomial transmission and the overall
      impact of this recommendations on the service provided by each GI unit.

      Target audience:

      - Physicians performing advanced gastrointestinal endoscopies in different countries.

      Objectives:

        -  Primary objective:

           1- To explore the status of advanced endoscopy (endoscopic retrograde
           cholangiopancreatography and endoscopic ultrasound on a global level) in different
           endoscopy units all over the world, to report the characteristics of patients presented
           to these units and their procedure details.

        -  Secondary objectives:
