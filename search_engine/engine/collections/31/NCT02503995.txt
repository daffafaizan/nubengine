      appreciated but its influence during pregnancy has not been clearly demonstrated. The focus
      of this proposal is to obtain for the first time a comprehensive understanding of the
      influence of regular physical exercise during pregnancy on cardiovascular, haemodynamic and
      autonomic nervous system (CHANS) parameters during pregnancy and following childbirth. This
      will involve assessing heart rate variability and cardiac stroke volume. This study will
      allow the investigators to compare CHANS parameters in pregnant women who are randomly
      assigned into three groups: a 'standard care' group and two groups who engage in a supervised
      programme of physical exercise (either land-based or water-based). The investigators will
      assess CHANS parameters at three stages during pregnancy and on one occasion following
      childbirth. This will allow the influence of regular (weekly) physical exercise on CHANS
      physiology to be assessed during advancing gestation. The investigators will thus use this
      study to provide initial evidence of the health benefits of regular and specific forms of
      antenatal physical exercise.
