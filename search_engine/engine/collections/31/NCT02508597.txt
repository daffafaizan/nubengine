      in the brief smoking counselling intervention project and participate in a half-day mini TTT
      training program. The training will cover the following topics:

        -  Goal and the details of the brief smoking counselling intervention;

        -  Objective of the mini TTT training program;

        -  Tobacco epidemic and control measures in China and the world;

        -  Physicians' role in tobacco control;

        -  Health risks of smoking, secondhand smoke exposure;

        -  WHO FCTC (Framework Convention on Tobacco Control) and the MPOWER measures;

        -  Brief smoking cessation counselling (AWARD model), and counselling skill with practice;

        -  Placebo counselling and counselling skill with practice.

      On the training day, the investigators will explain at the beginning of the workshop the
      purpose of the training, and the details of the brief smoking cessation intervention to all
      physicians who attend the training workshop. The investigators will explain that the
      participation is totally voluntary, and the participants will be invited to complete a
      paper-and-pencil survey before and right after the training workshop, perform smoking
      cessation counselling or placebo counselling among patients at their clinics, and complete
      online survey at 6- and 12-month follow-up. Agreement to participate in the training program
      will be considered as consent and participants are required to sign a written consent form.

      At the end of the workshop, participants should be confident to perform brief smoking
      cessation counselling and placebo counselling for patients.

      We hypothesize that the training program will increase the participants' knowledge level of
      smoking and secondhand smoke exposure and the important role of physicians in tobacco
      control, increase their skill and confidence of performing smoking cessation counselling, and
      generate stronger support for tobacco control policies.
