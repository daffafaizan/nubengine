      mortality. Treatment for AF consists of medical therapy and ablation therapy. Medical
      therapies can help approximately 50% of patients, the rest must resort to ablation
      procedures.

      Ablation procedures aim to isolate the pulmonary vein from the atrial tissue electrically and
      can be performed either endocardially through catheters inserted through the femoral veins or
      epicardially through a minimal lateral thoracotomy. Both procedures are accepted as standard
      of care.

      Recurrent AF after ablation therapy can be common and occurs in 50% of patients and could be
      in a form of short periods of AF or persistent AF with less or minimal symptoms. This is of
      significant clinical relevance as most of these AF episodes are not recognized and can lead
      to thromboembolic events such as stroke. However, techniques of surveillance of AF post
      ablation have been suboptimal. Physicians could use holter monitoring but this is limited to
      a short period of 24 - 48 hours. Event recorders which are external can be used but patients
      need to experience symptoms associated with the AF episodes in order to record the episodes.

      Better AF monitoring techniques especially after AF ablation are necessary so that
      recognition of AF recurrence in these patient could be possible and timely anticoagulation
      therapy initiated may prevent strokes.

      This pilot study involves implanting a loop recorder just under the skin to record cardiac
      rhythms 24 hours per day without any interaction by the patient. These devices are currently
      approved by the FDA for monitoring of syncope and will be implanted during the patients AF
      ablation surgery.
