      screening period running up to 10 weeks before randomization will be used to assess
      participant eligibility followed by 52 weeks of treatment. At baseline, approximately 40
      Chinese patients will be randomized.

      A follow-up visit will be done 12 weeks after last study treatment administration for all
      participants, regardless of whether they complete the entire study as planned or discontinue
      prematurely.

      The total combined duration of treatment for this Phase III study is 52 weeks. The primary
      objective is to demonstrate the treatment effect of secukinumab in Chinese subjects with
      active PsA by assessing ACR20 response rates at Week 16
