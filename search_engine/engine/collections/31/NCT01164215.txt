      Primary

        -  To determine whether 4 courses of pharmacokinetic (PK)-guided 5-fluorouracil
           chemotherapy improves the ability to achieve a targeted area under the curve (20 to 25
           mg*hr/L) in patients with colorectal cancer receiving mFOLFOX6 chemotherapy as compared
           to historical non-PK-guided therapy in patients treated with a similar FOLFOX regimen.

      Secondary

        -  To determine and compare the incidence of neutropenia and diarrhea in patients treated
           with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

        -  Standard mFOLFOX6 (course 1): Patients receive fluorouracil IV bolus over 1-5 minutes
           followed by fluorouracil IV continuously over 46 hours, oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours, and
           leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours on day 1.

      Patients undergo plasma sample collection periodically during study for pharmacokinetic
      (PK)-guided fluorouracil dose determination for courses 2-4.

        -  PK-guided mFOLFOX6 (courses 2-4): Patients receive fluorouracil bolus, oxaliplatin, and
           leucovorin calcium as in course 1. Patients also receive fluorouracil* IV continuously
           as determined by the PK-guided analysis.

      NOTE: *The continuous infusion fluorouracil dose adjustment is calculated based on the
      results of PK plasma concentrations and the corresponding AUC from the preceding course.
