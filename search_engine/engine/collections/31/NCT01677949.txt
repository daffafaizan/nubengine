      Based on this two-stage optimal design, a maximum of 49 patients with ALL and a maximum of 49
      patients with AML will be needed. For each disease cohort, 21 patients will be enrolled in
      stage 1. If at the end of stage 1, the criteria is met for activating stage 2 (based on
      success of clearing MRD, proceeding to transplant within 42 days and without excessive
      toxicity) for one or both groups, stage 2 will be activated with an additional 28 patients
      enrolled.
