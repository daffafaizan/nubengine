      a well debrided, complex diabetic foot ulcer managed with appropriate antibiotic therapy will
      result in a higher probability of complete healing than would be expected from management
      with standard care alone. In this open label Phase 2 pilot trial, all subjects will receive
      the intervention over a maximum period of 16 weeks. Eligible consenting subjects will undergo
      a baseline aggressive debridement in the operating room to remove infected and devitalized
      bone and soft tissue. TTAX01 will be applied to the debrided wound bed at baseline, and if
      healing is not evident, it will be applied again at 4 week intervals. At each weekly visit
      the wound will be further debrided as necessary.

      Consenting subjects who qualify for enrollment will undergo an aggressive surgical
      debridement at the baseline visit, including biopsies of bone for histology and microbiologic
      testing at the start and completion of debridement. Systemic antibiotics will be given
      empirically, with adjustments made on the basis of culture and sensitivity results. New or
      recurrent infections will be managed with additional debridement and adjustment or addition
      of appropriate systemic antibiotics. The test article, TTAX01, will be sutured to the
      debrided wound bed at baseline and again at 4 week intervals over the 16 week treatment
      period for wounds that do not show evidence of healing. For wounds that do show evidence of
      healing, additional applications of TTAX01 will be withheld, based on observations from
      retrospective case series.

      Subjects whose wounds close prior to 16 weeks will move directly to a 2 week confirmation of
      closure period. Subjects whose wounds have not closed by the end of 16 weeks will exit the
      trial.
