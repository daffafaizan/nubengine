      months of age receive influenza vaccine annually. Recommendations for influenza immunization
      of children vary somewhat among countries in the European Union, but immunization of children
      at high risk for complications of influenza infection is recommended by WHO and according to
      criteria in most countries. Currently, the immunization practices are progressing to
      quadrivalent formulations of inactivated influenza vaccines (IIV4) which are approved in the
      US for most of the indicated population. Additionally, live attenuated vaccine (LAIV4) is
      approved in the U.S. for individuals aged 2-49 years and Flublok®(RIV3), a purified trivalent
      recombinant hemagglutinin protein vaccine is approved in the U.S. for adults 18-49 years of
      age. Children are at particular risk of complications of influenza, including the B lineages,
      so expansion of the Flublok indication into the pediatric age group with a quadrivalent
      formulation is warranted.
