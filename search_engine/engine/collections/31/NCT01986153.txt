      cannot be met by oral food intake, have as their final option total parenteral nutrition,
      which contains all necessary macro- and micronutrients. Lipid emulsions are essential for
      these patients as they are a source of non glucose fuel calories, and they contain
      (essential) fatty acids which are important as structural component for many cells in the
      human body. Home parenteral nutrition patients are at risk for essential fatty acid
      deficiency. Data are lacking that indicate the optimal amount of essential fatty acids
      required for these patients. The latter seems especially relevant for patients receiving
      lipid prescriptions which are low in essential fatty acids, like ClinOleic®. Long-term
      parenteral nutrition dependent patients successfully use ClinOleic®. It is however unknown
      whether these patient remain to have an adequate essential fatty acid status in the long run.
