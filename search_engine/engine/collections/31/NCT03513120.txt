      long after surgery they are performing at pre-surgical levels. The investigators will enroll
      adolescent athletes that meet the inclusion criteria below, and follow their postoperative
      activity level with standardized activity questionnaires on a monthly basis until the subject
      reaches their baseline pre-surgical performance level. The investigators primary aim is to
      determine at what time patients return to sports without any restrictions to contact level or
      type of play. The investigators secondary aim is to quantitatively assess when patients are
      able to compete at their prior level of play as determined by self-assessment surveys, as
      well as identify any post-operative complications in these patients after return to sports.
