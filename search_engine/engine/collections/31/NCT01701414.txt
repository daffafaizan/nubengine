      setting, safe and effective pain control is of the utmost importance. At present, this is
      typically achieved with the use of parenteral opioids. However in older individuals, who
      often have other medical comorbidities, the use of narcotics for pain control must be
      balanced with their potentially deleterious consequences: namely respiratory depression,
      hypotension, and mental confusion. Both poor pain control and the use of opioid medications
      have been associated with acute confusional states in the elderly. 1,2 Regional anesthesia
      can possibly provide adjunctive or even alternative pain control that is both safe and
      effective.Femoral nerve blocks, using local anesthetics, have been described as a method to
      reduce pain and the requirement for systemic analgesia, specifically opioids. Prior research
      has demonstrated feasibility and effective pain control of the femoral nerve block in the ED
      setting. Bedside ultrasound (US) can be used to precisely visualize the femoral neurovascular
      anatomy when performing a femoral nerve block and has distinct advantages when performing
      this procedure in the ED setting.

      Study Objectives The primary aim of this study is to determine the relative effectiveness of
      ultrasound guided femoral nerve blocks in older adult patients with hip fractures in the
      emergency department as compared with parenteral narcotics alone. A secondary aim of this
      study is to determine if femoral nerve blocks reduce both the use of parenteral narcotics and
      the incidence adverse effects associated with parenteral analgesia (delirium, hypotension,
      respiratory depression) in hip fracture patients both in the emergency department and during
      their hospital stay.
