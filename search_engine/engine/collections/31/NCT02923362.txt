      surgical laparoscopic antireflux procedure and/or hiatal hernia repair, including
      laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication and Magnetic Sphincter Augmentation with the LINX device.
      Patients meeting registry inclusion and exclusion will be followed for 5 years with
      standardized quality of life surveys and appropriate standard of care testing. Up to 40 sites
      will participate with total enrollment of 1000 patients.

      The main objectives are to collect data from everyday clinical practices and track patients
      from preoperative assessments to 5 years post surgical intervention to evaluate symptoms,
      medication use and side effects.
