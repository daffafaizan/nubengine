      untreated. It has not disappeared, with an increasing incidence. Patients with the disease,
      mainly young (35 to 55 years of age), have an unfavorable cardiovascular prognosis (14% of
      cardiovascular and renal events at 4 years). Despite these facts, scientific research on the
      subject remains limited. The definitions and diagnostic criteria have not changed since 1929,
      and the therapeutic recommendations remain empirical.

      This first prospective and multicentric registry will increase and modernize the knowledge of
      the disease. From these data, diagnostic and therapeutic recommendations based on solid
      scientific evidence could be developed.

      The investigators want to first recruit 500 patients and define their prognosis at 5 years.
      The impact of the patient's phenotype, type and number of target organs affected will be
      studied.

      A modern definition, adapted to these results, could be proposed. The epidemiology of the
      disease, the care pathways, the target organ disorders and the management carried out in the
      centers will be described in detail.
