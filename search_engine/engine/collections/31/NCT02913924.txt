    
      Patients seeking treatment for Cannabis Use Disorder (CUD) will be enrolled into an inpatient
      laboratory for 5 nights, where they will be initiated on medication and be assessed for the
      influence of clonazepam (or placebo) on (1) cannabis withdrawal (mood, sleep, cannabis
      craving, food intake), ratings associated with medication abuse liability, cognitive
      performance, and (2) relapse to cannabis use after patients (now abstinent from cannabis)
      leave the inpatient setting maintained on clonazepam (or placebo) for 8 weeks (with a 4-week,
      medication-free follow up). This combined design will provide a comprehensive understanding
      of clonazepam's effects on individuals with cannabis use disorder across a range of outcome
      measures (safety, abuse liability, withdrawal symptoms) while also testing the medication's
      ability to prevent relapse in cannabis-abstinent patients. Patient's who are unable to
      complete the inpatient approach will complete the 12 week trial as an outpatient only.
