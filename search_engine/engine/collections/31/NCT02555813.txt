      the routine use of Abraxane in its labeled indication in metastatic pancreatic cancer.
      Additionally data on real life dosing in daily clinical routine will be analyzed.

      A detailed record of the medical history including co-morbidities and pre-treatment regimens
      will allow analysis of the impact thereof on tolerability, dosage and efficacy.

      Hands-on experience with nab-paclitaxel is very limited in Austria and an non-interventional
      study could enhance knowledge on optimal drug handling and Adverse Event management.
