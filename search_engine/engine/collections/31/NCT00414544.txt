      in one nasolabial fold and Control in the nasolabial fold on the opposite side of the face
      (split face design). Each subject will serve as his or her own control, allowing for
      comparison of the outcome between the contralateral sides. Patients will be followed at 2
      weeks and 3, 6, 9 and 12 months post treatment for assessment of safety and effectiveness.
