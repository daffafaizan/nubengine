      surgeries. The number of surgical procedures in the elderly will increase dramatically as a
      result of the increased elderly population in the future. It has been suggested that
      preexisting cognitive impairment is associated with increased incidence of postoperative
      complications, decreased quality of life, and increased mortality. Preoperative risk
      assessment is becoming increasingly important because preoperative risk stratification allows
      the clinical team to forecast postoperative outcomes. Currently, the most common strategy to
      identify high-risk patients before surgery is assessment of single end-organ function. This
      tactic is most widely recognized by the American Heart Association's guideline for cardiac
      evaluation, but is also well described for pulmonary, hepatic, and renal organ systems.
      Little is known about the effects of pre-existing cognitive (or brain) function (perhaps the
      most vital human organ) on postoperative outcomes. Therefore, the present study evaluated
      whether patients with pre-operative cognitive impairment would have a more precipitous drop
      in cognitive function and worse outcome in geriatric surgical patients.
