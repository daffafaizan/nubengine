    
      PC14586 is a first-in-class, oral, small molecule p53 reactivator that is selective for the
      p53 Y220C mutation. The trial will be conducted in 2 parts: dose escalation (Phase 1) and
      dose expansion (Phase 2).

      The primary objective of Phase 1 is to establish the maximum tolerated dose / recommended
      dose of PC14586 to treat participants with advanced solid tumors harboring a p53 Y220C
      mutation. Secondary objectives of Phase 1 are to characterize the pharmacokinetic properties
      of the investigational drug, its safety and tolerability, and to assess the overall response
      rate (ORR).

      The primary objective of Phase 2 is to assess the ORR in participants with advanced solid
      tumors harboring a p53 Y220C mutation as determined by an independent radiology committee.
      Secondary objectives of Phase 2 include the safety, pharmacokinetic properties, and efficacy
      of PC14586 at the recommended dose.
