      deviation (strabismus) that is potentially subject to surgical correction.

      The eye alignment will be measured. The eye muscles may be measured by MRI. The eye will be
      anesthetized by eye drops. One or more eye muscles will be injected with bupivacaine. BotoxÂ®
      will be injected into the antagonist muscle in some cases to increase the effect of the
      bupivacaine.

      Data on the strabismus deviation, any side effects of the drug injection, and the eye muscles
      as measured by MRI, will be recorded at intervals after injection. These data will be
      compared with the like measurements taken before injection.

      The primary outcome will be the eye alignment change at 180 days. A secondary outcome will be
      the change in muscle size, strength, or stiffness.

      For large strabismus deviations not fully corrected by a first injection, a second injection
      can be made. Follow-up alignment and muscle measurements will be as for the initial
      injection.
