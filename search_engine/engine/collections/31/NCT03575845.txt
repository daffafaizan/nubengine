      higher death rate and an 11% lower 5-year survival rate when compared to Caucasian women.
      Reasons for these disparities include biological and structural barriers to higher survival
      rates.

      Regular physical activity and resistance training are recommended to support improved
      survivorship. To date, few efforts have targeted African American survivors who may
      experience greater survivorship challenges than Caucasians.

      Yoga is a safe and effective means for breast cancer survivors to exercise and gain positive
      physical and psychosocial outcomes. Only two studies, 10 years apart, have provided evidence
      about the efficacy of yoga for African American breast cancer survivors.
