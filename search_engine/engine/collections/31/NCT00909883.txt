      After an inclusion visit, patients are randomized in one of the 3 following groups :

        -  First group (PL : placebo) :

             -  J0 : Patient will receive 1 injection of placebo in the Flexor digitorum longus and
                1 injection of placebo in the Flexor digitorum brevis or in the quadratus plantae

             -  J+1month : First evaluation

             -  J+3 months : Patient will receive again 1 injection of placebo in the Flexor
                digitorum longus and 1 injection of placebo in the Flexor digitorum brevis or in
                the quadratus plantae

             -  J+4 months : Last evaluation

        -  Second group (ME : Extrinsic muscle)

             -  J0 : Patient will receive 1 injection of Botulinum toxin (100U) in the Flexor
                digitorum longus and 1 injection of placebo in the Flexor digitorum brevis or in
                the quadratus plantae

             -  J+1 month : First evaluation

             -  J+3 months : Patient will receive again 1 injection of Botulinum toxin (100U) in
                the Flexor digitorum longus and 1 injection of placebo in the Flexor digitorum
                brevis or in the quadratus plantae

             -  J+4 months : Last evaluation

        -  Third group (MI : Intrinsic muscle)

             -  J0 : Patient will receive 1 injection of placebo in the Flexor digitorum longus and
                1 injection of Botulinum toxin (100U) in the Flexor digitorum brevis or in the
                quadratus plantae

             -  J+1 month : First evaluations

             -  J+3 months : Patient will receive again 1 injection of placebo in the Flexor
                digitorum longus and 1 injection of Botulinum toxin (100U) in the Flexor digitorum
                brevis or in the quadratus plantae

             -  J+4 months : Last evaluations

      During injections (J0 and J+3M), we will measure the pain induced by injections (EVA) For
      each evaluation (J+1M and J+4M), following evaluations will be made: clinical improvement
      (CGI), dystonia evaluation (duration and severity, Burke scale), pain (EVA) and quality of
      life (PDQ39).
