    
      Low back pain is the most common cause of disability in people under age 45 and accounts for
      20% of all physician visits. Osteopathic manual treatment (OMT) has been used to manage
      patients with acute and chronic back pain. These treatments are often reported as beneficial
      by patients.

      This study will examine the effect on functional status, range of motion, quality of life,
      and pain with Osteopathic Manipulative Treatment (OMT). Baseline will be defined as someone
      who has never had OMT, chiropractic, or massage, or has not received such treatments in the
      last 90 days. Back pain will be specific to pain presenting in the lumbar or thoracic regions
      of the spine.
