      study was designed to investigate safety and diagnostic performance of 18F-S16 in patients
      with neurodegenerative dementia. A single dose of nearly 370 MBq 18F-S16 will be
      intravenously injected into healthy volunteers and patients with neurodegenerative dementia.
      Visual and semiquantitative method will be used to assess the PET/CT images. Changes of blood
      pressure, pulse, respiration, temperature, routine blood and urine tests, serum alanine
      aminotransferase, albumin, and creatinine, and any adverse events will be collected from the
      subjects. Adverse events will also be observed in the subjects.
