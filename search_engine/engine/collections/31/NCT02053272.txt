    
      This 14 week (one week baseline, 12 week treatment period and one week follow-up),
      multicentre, randomised, double blind, placebo controlled, parallel group study will evaluate
      the efficacy, safety and tolerability of 2, 5 and 15 mg of GWP42004 as add on to metformin
      compared with placebo in participants with Type 2 diabetes.

      Eligible participants will enter the study at a screening visit (Visit 1, Day -7) where the
      following information will be obtained for each participant:

        1. Informed consent

        2. Demographics

        3. Medical history

        4. Concomitant medications

        5. Electrocardiogram (ECG)

        6. Physical examination

        7. Vital signs

        8. Body weight

        9. Height

       11. Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II)

       12. Safety blood test (biochemistry and haematology)

       13. Efficacy blood test (HbA1c)

       14. Urinalysis (including drugs of abuse screen)

       15. Pregnancy test (if appropriate)

      Once all inclusion and exclusion criteria have been reviewed, participants will be commence a
      seven day baseline period. The day before Visit 2, participants will perform blood glucose
      tests and record the results, along with the associated time of assessment, in the study
      diary. Participants will then fast overnight.

      Participants will return to the clinic at Visit 2 (Day 1) and following review of all
      inclusion and exclusion criteria, the following information will be obtained for each
      participant:

        1. Body weight

        2. BMI

        3. Physical examination

        4. Vital signs

        5. Safety blood test (biochemistry and haematology)

        6. GWP42004 exposure blood test (plasma levels)

        7. Efficacy blood test (HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose, serum fructosamine, fasting plasma
           insulin, HOMA2-IR, pro-insulin, C-peptide, HOMA2-%B, total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol,
           serum triglycerides, C-reactive protein)

        8. Urinalysis

        9. Concomitant medications

       10. Adverse events (AEs)

       11. BDI-II

       12. Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS)

       13. Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (DTSQs)

       14. Overall health Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)

       15. Cannabis withdrawal scale assessment (UK only).

      Participants will then be randomised to receive either GWP42004 (2, 5 or 15 mg bid) or
      placebo to be taken adjunctive to their currently prescribed medication. The first dose will
      be administered and a Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) performed.

      A third (Visit 3, Day 29) and fourth (Visit 4, Day 57) visit will take place mid-treatment.
      The day before these visits, participants will perform blood glucose tests and record the
      results, along with the associated time of assessment, in the study diary. Participants will
      then fast overnight. The following information will be obtained for each participant at
      Visits 3 and 4:

        1. Body weight

        2. BMI

        3. Physical examination

        4. Vital signs

        5. Safety blood test (biochemistry and haematology)

        6. Efficacy blood test (HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose, fasting plasma insulin, HOMA2-IR,
           HOMA2-%B)

        7. Urinalysis

       12. DTSQs

       13. Overall health VAS

      A cannabis withdrawal scale assessment will be made by telephone (UK only) between Visits 4
      and 5.

      A further visit will take place at the end of treatment (Visit 5, Day 85). Two days before
      this visit, a cannabis withdrawal scale assessment will be made by telephone (UK only). The
      day before Visit 5, participants will perform blood glucose tests and record the results,
      along with the associated time of assessment, in the study diary. Participants will then fast
      overnight. The following information will be obtained for each participant at Visit 5:

      One, three and seven days following Visit 5 (Days 86, 89 and 92, respectively), further
      cannabis withdrawal scale assessments will be made by telephone (UK only). A final review of
      AEs and concomitant medications will be made by telephone to all participants on Day 92.
