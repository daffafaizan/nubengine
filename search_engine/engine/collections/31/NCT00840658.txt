        -  Aim 1: To evaluate the efficacy of a behavioral intervention to decrease sharing of
           syringes and injection paraphernalia among FSW-IDUs. We hypothesize that FSW-IDUs in the
           active experimental injection risk reduction condition will report: (a) less receptive
           and distributive needle sharing; (b) less sharing of injection paraphernalia; (c)
           obtaining syringes and injection paraphernalia from safer sources.

        -  Aim 2: To evaluate the efficacy of a behavioral intervention to increase condom use
           among FSW-IDUs in the context of ongoing drug use. We hypothesize that FSW-IDUs in the
           active experimental sexual risk reduction condition will: (a) report less unprotected
           vaginal and anal sex; and (b) have fewer incident cases of specific STIs.

        -  Aim 3: To evaluate the joint effects of these two behavioral interventions to increase
           condom use and reduce sharing of needles and syringes/injection paraphernalia among
           FSW-IDUs. We hypothesize that the joint effect of these interventions will generate
           greater risk reductions compared to either intervention alone.

        -  Aim 4: To determine the extent to which theoretically-important components of our
           interventions (i.e., self-efficacy, outcome expectancies, attitudes, intentions)
           represent underlying mechanisms of change in primary outcomes (i.e., sexual- and
           injection-related risk reductions).

        -  Aim 5: To explore subgroup differences in the efficacy of: a) the sexual risk reduction,
           and b) the injection risk reduction intervention based on background characteristics,
           contextual factors, social factors and intrapersonal factors.
