      is likely due to variable degrees of disordered fatty-acid metabolism and insulin resistance
      (IR). Liver steatosis, especially polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in the liver, increases
      lipid peroxidation and is associated with a reduction in the antioxidant defense system. This
      oxidative stress can lead to increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α,
      transforming growth factor-beta) contributing to the development of steatohepatitis and
      fibrosis.TNF-α - may further contribute to IR. In addition, changes in fatty acid composition
      within the liver may influence lipid metabolism and inflammation. In particular, n-3 PUFA
      have an effect on the insulin sensitivity, transcription of antioxidant genes, inflammatory
      response and production of reactive oxygen species. Differences might be seen on the gene
      expression level (mRNA) and also in epigenetic regulation (miRNA).

      Microbiota composition might influence energy metabolism, and inflammatory tone and IR
      through increased endotoxemia and therefore could also play a role in the development of
      NAFLD.
