      cancer usually takes about 10 to 15 years to develop and has distinct precursor stages.
      Persistent infection by Human Papillomavirus is necessary for the development of these
      lesions.

      Currently, when a colposcopy biopsy reveals low grade lesion, it is recommanded to make a new
      cervical cytology or HPV testing, 12 months later. No treatment is recommended over this
      period. However 11% of these lesions evolve from low to high grade.

      Papilocare® is a vaginal gel that would improve the re-epithelialization of the uterine
      cervix. Creating a protective film on the cervix, it could induce a favorable environment for
      regression of the cervical intraepithelial lesions 1 and for clearance of Human
      Papillomavirus.

      The goal of our study is to include 150 women with a histologically confirmed cervical
      intraepithelial lesions 1. Half of them will be using the vaginal gel Papilocare® for 6 month
      while the other half will not receive any treatment (as suggested by current
      recommendations). Each patient will have a cervical cytology and a HPV testing after 6 months
      and after 12 months. Therefore we will be able to compare the percentage of normalization of
      cervical cytology and HPV clearance for each group after 6 months and after 12 months.

      Patients will visit the Orleans hospital once for the inclusion and twice for follow-ups
      after 6 months and 12 months.

      If the use of Papilocare® really induces a significant regression of low grade lesions, this
      vaginal gel could be offered as soon as these lesions are histologically identified in order
      to stop its progress to high grade.
