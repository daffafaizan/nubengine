      themselves as reliable options for increased survival among this subset of bladder cancer
      patients. For these patients, removal of the bladder with all the associated perioperative
      risks and the subsequent reduction of quality of life, remains the only option. Prior
      attempts at second line treatments have included intravesical (within the bladder)
      monotherapy with a range of drugs including Gemcitabine and Paclitaxel (a taxane, similar to
      Cabazitaxel). These drugs have shown some potential improvement for a small number of
      patients Given the synergy of systemic chemotherapy, it is believed that a multidrug regimen
      would allow for further improvement in survival among these patients.
