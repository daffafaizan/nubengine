      I. Assess the feasibility of integrating tumor genomic profiling in the adult oncology clinic
      at the Stanford Cancer Institute.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the percentage of tumors that harbor "actionable" genomic changes. II. Explore
      effects of individual molecular profiling including the percent of time that profiling
      changes the treatment.

      III. Determine the number of cases in which a genomically identified targeted therapy is
      available.

      IV. Determine the clinical benefit of genomic based therapy, as defined by: response rate
      (according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] 1.1 response criteria);
      the percent of patients with non-progression at 4 months, and overall survival, in patients
      whose therapy is selected based on profiling.

      V. Determine if circulating free tumor DNA (ctDNA) in the blood stream (liquid biopsy) yields
      similar genomic results as the metastatic tumor analysis.

      VI. Determine if ctDNA analysis during treatment correlates with RECIST 1.1 criteria in
      predicting response.

      OUTLINE:

      Tissue samples are collected at baseline and blood for liquid biopsy is collected at baseline
      and every 6-8 weeks during active treatment. Tissue samples are analyzed via sequencing for
      tumor genomic profiling.

      After completion of active treatment, participants are followed up at 4, 8, 12, 18, and 24
      months.
