      double-blinded placebo controlled trial. Patients took either Vitamin E 400 IU bid or
      placebo. An initial evaluation of access patency was performed and baseline blood drawn
      before starting Vitamin E. Every 3 months there was a followup evaluation with blood drawn
      for oxidative stress markers, and with a test of vascular access patency. The study was
      closed to new participants, vitamin E or placebo stopped, and data analysis performed in
      2003.
