      efficacy of a single intramuscular administration of AMT-011 (at multiple sites). The study
      will be performed in the Community Genomic medicineCenter (CGMC) Chicoutimi, Canada, under
      the supervision of their medical ethical committee and according to the local biosafety
      procedures. The study participants will be treated under the responsibility of a Principal
      Investigator specialised in the treatment of lipid disorders. A total number of 14 subjects
      will be administered. Participants will be screened 3 weeks prior to administration of
      AMT-011 and will be evaluated for 12 weeks post administration in this study. After the
      study, subjects will be followed up long term with particular emphasis on the safety and
      efficacy aspects of LPL gene therapy using AMT-011. Subjects will be evaluated at the
      clinical site at 19 weeks, 26 weeks, 39 weeks, 1 year, 1.5 years, 2 years, 3 years, 4 years
      and 5 years after administration of AMT-011. The TG values that are obtained at week 26 will
      be used for secondary efficacy analysis.
