      as well as inpatients with elevated transaminases were tested for HCV-infection and
      considered for our trial to avoid a positive or negative selection. Medical inclusion
      criteria were a detectable serum HCV-RNA level in a PCR-based assay (AMPLICORÂ®, Roche
      Diagnostics, Branchburg, NJ) for more than 6 months and an elevated alanine aminotransferase
      (ALT > 30 U/L, normal <24 U/L). General exclusion criteria were the presence of other liver
      disease, Child B or C cirrhosis, severe cardiac or neurological disease, co-infection with
      hepatitis B or HIV, hepatocellular carcinoma evaluated by ultrasound and alpha-fetoprotein,
      autoimmune disorders, a neutrophil count below 1500 per cubic millimetre, and a platelet
      count below 75000 per cubic millimetre.
