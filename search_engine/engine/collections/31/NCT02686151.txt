           Infertility patients who frozen all embryos due to the risk of OHSS were randomized
           allocated to letrozole or polygeline injection group. Inclusion criteria meet one of the
           following conditions: (1) oocyte is more than or equal to 20; (2) human chorionic
           gonadotropin (hCG) injection on serum estradiol levels greater than or equal to 5000
           pmol/L; (3) on the day of oocyte unilateral or bilateral ovarian diameter greater than
           or equal to 10 cm (4) follicle puncture is larger than or equal to number 20. After the
           informed consent was signed, letrozole or polygeline injection was randomized allocated
           after oocyte retrieval. OHSS was determined according to Golan diagnosis standards.

        2. Clinical data:

           Including age, infertility duration, body mass index (BMI), basic follicle-stimulating
           hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), antral follicle number (AFC), Gn dosage,
           estradiol level on hCG injection day, the number of oocytes, the number of embryos,
           early onset OHSS incidence, and the existence of ascites.

        3. Reproductive hormone levels:

      1, 4, 7, days after taken letrozole, and the supernatant was collected for serum reproductive
      hormone test.
