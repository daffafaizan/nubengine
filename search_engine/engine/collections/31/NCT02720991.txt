      submitted to routine screening as per current practice at La Rabta Hospital. The eligible
      women will receive a dose of 200 mg of mifepristone and 400 ug of misoprostol to take at home
      sublingually .

      The first 5 women enrolled in each gestational age group will be asked to return to the
      clinic 24-48 hours after the initial visit to take misoprostol at the clinic and wait during
      a 3 hour observational period before returning to their homes. After this initial phase, the
      women will be asked to self-administer the misoprostol at home 24-48 hours after the
      administration of mifepristone and to return to the clinic 7-10 days later. At follow-up, a
      healthcare provider will assure her that her medical abortion is complete and after will ask
      women to respond to a series of questions in an exit interview.
