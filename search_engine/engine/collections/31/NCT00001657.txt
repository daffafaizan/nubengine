      regionally selective alterations in brain metabolism and processing of information. For
      example, neuroimaging studies reveal increased blood flow and glucose utilization in right
      frontal, limbic and paralimibic brain structures in patients with PTSD, particularly when
      they are recalling the traumatic event associated with their symptoms. These alterations in
      regional brain activity are thought to be related, in part, to the distressing emotional
      symptoms associated with traumatic memories. Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) dysregulation is
      common in PTSD, with sympathetic hyper-reactivity and relative lack of parasympathetic
      modulation. In addition, abnormalities in hormone levels such as thyroid hormones and the
      hypothalmic-pituitary-adrenal axis have been demonstrated. Repetitive transcranial magnetic
      stimulation may provide a non-invasive technique for normalizing the alterations in regional
      brain metabolism, possibly leading to improvements in PTSD symptoms and concomitant
      improvement in ANS and hormonal balance. In particular, preliminary clinical data indicate
      that low frequency (i.e., approximately 0.9-1 Hz) rTMS stimulation leads to a decrease in
      regional cerebral blood flow. The purpose of the present study is to determine, using a
      placebo-controlled, parallel design, whether right frontal rTMS stimulation in patients with
      posttraumatic stress disorder leads to symptomatic improvement, reductions in hemispheric
      regional blood flow, and improvements in ANS regulation. The study hypothesis is that 1 Hz
      right frontal rTMS stimulation will be superior to sham stimulation in reducing PTSD symptoms
      and physiology including improving abnormalities in regional cerebral blood flow, vagal tone,
      and circulating hormone levels.
