      advances in treatment is still incurable for most patients.

      In this trial the investigators assess a new immunotherapeutic strategy targeting the immune
      checkpoint molecule PD-L1 to investigate the potential of vaccination against PD-L1 as a
      possible anticancer target.

      PD-L1 has been recognized as an important factor in immune regulation and development of
      immune tolerance in the microenvironment of cancer cells. Cells that express PD-L1 on their
      surface are known to inhibit the immune system. As seen with the recent advances in
      immunotherapy against cancer with antibodies against PD-L1, the the immunosuppressive role of
      the molecule PD-L1 can be antagonized to the benefit of patients with cancer. PD-L1 is
      expressed on both cancer cells, antigen presenting cells and immunosuppressive cells in the
      tumor micro-environment. Vaccination against PD-L1 is therefore two sided. The investigators
      aim to stimulate PD-L1 specific T-cells, hence eliminating both PD-L1 positive tumor cells as
      well as PD-L1 positive immunosuppressive and antigen presenting cells in the tumor
      microenvironment. The primary endpoints are safety and toxicity evaluation. Secondary
      endpoint is immunological response. Clinical response will be described.
