      themselves to be suffering from problems caused by wheat and/or gluten ingestion, even though
      they do not have CD or wheat allergy. This clinical condition has been named Non-Celiac
      Gluten Sensitivity' (NCGS). In a previous paper the investigators suggested the term
      'Non-Celiac Wheat Sensitivity' (NCWS), since it is not known what component of wheat causes
      the symptoms in NCGS patients, and the investigators also showed that these patients had a
      high frequency of coexistent multiple food hypersensitivity. The clinical picture of NCWS is
      characterized by combined gastrointestinal (bloating, abdominal pain, diarrhea and/or
      constipation, nausea, epigastric pain, gastroesophageal reflux, aphthous stomatitis) and
      extra-intestinal and/or systemic manifestations (headache, depression, anxiety, 'foggy mind,'
      tiredness, dermatitis or skin rash, fibromyalgia-like joint/muscle pain, leg or arm numbness,
      and anemia). Nowadays only few data are available on the histological characteristic of
      duodenal and rectal biopsies of NCWS patients. The researchers have just demonstrated a
      significant eosinophils infiltration of the duodenal and colon mucosa, and a significant
      infiltration of CD45+/CD3-CD14- cells in the rectal mucosa of NCWS patients upon wheat
      challenge, thus configuring a diffuse gastrointestinal "inflammatory/immunologic" pattern. As
      regard to rectal lymphocytes, analysis of cytokine production demonstrated dominant
      spontaneous interferon (IFN)-γ production by these cells, which were further identified as
      innate lymphoid cells belonging to the group 1 (ILC1) population, expressing T-bet and
      producing IFN-γ, compatible to an innate immunity involvement in NCWS pathogenesis.
      Therefore, the aims of the present study are: 1) to investigate the histological
      characteristics and differences in duodenal and rectal biopsies between NCWS and IBS
      patients, and 2) to search for "inflammatory/allergic" features (i.e. eosinophils and/or
      lymphocytes infiltration) useful for NCWS histological diagnosis.
