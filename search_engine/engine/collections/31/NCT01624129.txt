    
      The eosinophilic esophagitis (EE) is chronic inflammatory and immunological disease. The
      diagnosis of EE is based upon large numbers of eosinophils in the esophagus on
      histopathologic examination (> 20 eosinophils per high powered field in at least one
      specimen) despite acid suppression with a Proton-Pump-Inhibitor (PPI) for at least two weeks.

      There are no diagnostic serological markers for EE so far, so that the purpose of the study
      is to investigate serological markers which are established in other allergic diseases.
