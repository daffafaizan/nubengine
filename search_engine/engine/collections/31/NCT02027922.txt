      fluoride varnishes in children at high caries risk.

      It was hypothesized, the use of Fluor Protector S (I) fluoride varnish in children with
      deciduous teeth at high risk of caries (P) reduces caries and the activity/remineralisation
      of carious enamel spots (transformation of White Spot Lesion into D (decay)) (O), similarly
      to what occurs after the use of Duraphat varnish (C).

      The question set bases on a Caries Assessment by Risk Management system basing on the
      occurrence of major caries causative agents (biological and medical), and also of the
      protective/preventive ones. Questions related to the social and economical status will be
      left out because of the difficulty of getting them answered honestly. Teeth will be scored
      according to International Caries Detection System II classification, and oral hygiene
      according to the Greene and Vermillion simplified Oral Hygiene Index (OHI-S) (1964). Children
      and their parents/guardians will receive hygienic, dietary and prophylactic guidelines.
