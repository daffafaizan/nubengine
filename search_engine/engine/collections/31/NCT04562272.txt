    
      1. Eligible patients with be screened before PCI

        2. The patients with undergo coronary angiography and PCI according to common medical
           practice

        3. At the end of the PCI procedure, after a successful revascularization, a pigtail
           catheter will be used to measure LV filling pressure and to perform femoral angiography
           (to evaluate femoral access).

        4. Patients fulfilling angiographic and hemodynamic criteria will be randomized 1:1 to
           standard care vs. mechanical unloading by Impella-CP.

        5. The patients will be treated on a CCU with experience with use of Impella-CP.

        6. On the CCU, all patients will be monitored by a Swan-Ganz catheter for 48 hours.

        7. The pump speed will be adjusted to maintain the lowest tolerated PCWP while avoiding
           suction events.

        8. Mechanical unloading will last 36-48h. Afterwards, the Impella-CP will be explanted.

        9. All patients will receive standard pharmacotherapy of AMI, according to the guidelines.

       10. Revascularization of significant non-infarct lesions will be performed during the index
           hospitalization.

       11. 3D-echocardiography and Tc-SPECT (D-SPECT) will be performed on the day 5-7 of the index
           hospitalization. LV phasic volumes and extent of nonperfused myocardium (scar) will be
           evaluated automatically, using software provided by the vendor.

       12. 3D-echocardiography and Tc-SPECT will be repeated at 3 months after the AMI.

       13. The patients will be followed by out-patient check-ups every 12 months.
