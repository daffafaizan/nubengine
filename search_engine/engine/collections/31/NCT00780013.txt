      single-dose crossover bioavailability study performed on 36 healthy adult male and female
      non-smoking or light smoking volunteers and 2 alternates. A total of 36 subjects completed
      the clinical phase of the study. In each period, subjects were housed from the evening before
      dosing until after the 24-hour blood draw. Single oral 1000 mg doses were separated by a
      washout period of 7 days Of the 36 healthy adult non-smoking or light-smoking (10
      cigarettes/day) volunteers and 2 alternates (19 males, 19 non-pregnant females) enrolled in
      the study, two did not complete the clinical phase of the study. Subject No. 11 was withdrawn
      from the study by the on-duty Physician after a positive pregnancy test prior to dosing in
      Period 2 and Subject No. 20 was withdrawn from the study by the Clinical Study Manager after
      she failed to complete her breakfast prior to dosing in Period 2. Thus a total of 36 subjects
      completed the clinical phase of the study
