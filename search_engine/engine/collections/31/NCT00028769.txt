    
      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the progression-free and overall survival in patients with high-risk
           metastatic adenocarcinoma of the prostate treated with early estramustine, etoposide,
           and paclitaxel with combined androgen-blockade therapy.

        -  Determine the type, frequency, and severity of toxicity of this regimen in this patient
           population.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

        -  Androgen-blockade therapy: Patients receive a standard regimen of luteinizing
           hormone-releasing hormone agonist therapy comprising either goserelin subcutaneously
           once monthly or once every 3 months or leuprolide intramuscularly once monthly, once
           every 3 months, or once every 4 months. Patients also receive a standard regimen of
           antiandrogen therapy comprising oral bicalutamide, oral flutamide, or oral nilutamide
           once daily. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
           toxicity.

        -  Chemotherapy: Beginning 14-30 days after initiation of androgen-blockade therapy,
           patients receive oral estramustine three times daily and oral etoposide once daily on
           days 1-14 and paclitaxel IV over 1 hour on day 2. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4
           courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months until disease progression, every 6 months for 2 years,
      and then annually for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 80 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
