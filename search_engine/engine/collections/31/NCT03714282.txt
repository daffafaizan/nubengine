        -  To determine whether transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation combined with ambulation
           training modulates corticospinal locomotor networks in individuals with chronic
           hemiplegic stroke

        -  To determine whether transcutaneous spinal stimulation combined with ambulation training
           improves locomotor function in individuals with chronic hemiplegic stroke

        -  To determine whether transcutaneous spinal stimulation combined with ambulation training
           improves symmetry of gait in individuals with chronic hemiplegic stroke

        -  To determine whether transcutaneous spinal stimulation combined with ambulation training
           improves standing posture and balance in individuals with chronic hemiplegic stroke

        -  To determine whether ambulation efficiency (improved cardiovascular conditioning)
           improves with transcutaneousnon-invasive spinal stimulation and locomotor training in
           individuals with chronic hemiplegic stroke
