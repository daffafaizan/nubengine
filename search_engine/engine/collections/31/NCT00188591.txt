      being most crucial for establishing an individual's future breast cancer risk.
      Epidemiological studies further suggest exposures, such as foods and toxins, during
      adolescence to have a significant impact on the likelihood of transformation in the
      developing breast resulting in cancer later in life. Adolescent diet affects mammary
      development directly and indirectly by influencing the micronutrients and the hormonal status
      of the adolescent. The goal of this study is to investigate the feasibility of Optical
      Spectroscopy (OS), a method based on differential light scattering and absorption in tissue,
      to quantify bulk breast tissue properties in adolescent females.
