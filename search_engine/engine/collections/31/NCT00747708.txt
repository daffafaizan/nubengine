      administration in patients with chronic heart failure. Each arm has a comparative group that
      contains either saline injection (peripheral arm that injects GCSF alone) or serum (the two
      interventional arms-intracoronary and intramyocardial injection).

      The protocol (on the advice of the ethics committee) is divided into a 58 patients pilot
      study followed by recruitment into the intramyocardial arm (30 patients randomised 1:1 cells
      in serum vs serum alone) and then recruitment into the intracoronary and peripheral arms (30
      patients randomised 1:1 cells in serum vs serum alone in each arm).

      The study has been powered around the use of advanced imaging to measure within group changes
      in ejection fraction at 12 months as the primary end point.
