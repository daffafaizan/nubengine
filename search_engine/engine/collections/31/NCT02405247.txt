      approximately 400 patients from an estimated 17 countries.

      Patients will be recruited from the patient pool that is being screened for the AZD9291 AURA3
      randomized clinical trial (RCT). Biopsy tissues and consents have already been obtained from
      patients to use samples for future research as part of the AURA3 trial screening processes.
      During the RCT screening process, the patients sign a full consent to participate in the
      AURA3 trial, and have their tumour tested as part of the main screening.

      Data are collected, notably on medical history, co-medications, and adverse events. Biopsy
      tissue is collected to assess T790M mutation status. All patients will be able to enter the
      TAURAS study regardless of whether or not they have any remaining tissue. Biomarker analyses
      resulting from the historical tumour samples obtained as part of the AURA3 screening process,
      and in accordance with the consent obtained within the AURA3 trial protocol, can be linked to
      the data collected in TAURAS and used as part of the exploratory objectives of this NIS.

      The primary objectives of the NIS study in NSCLC patients who have progressed on a previous
      EGFR-TKI (with no intervening chemotherapy) and who do not harbour the T790M mutation
      (according to central analysis using the Roche cobasÂ® EGFR Mutation Test), are:

        -  To estimate overall survival

        -  To estimate disease progression (as assessed and defined by physician)

        -  To estimate partial, complete, and overall response rates by line of therapy (as
           assessed and defined by physician)

        -  To describe treatment patterns for 2nd line and beyond, including time on treatment by
           line of therapy and time to subsequent therapies (or death)

        -  To describe health resource utilization patterns (e.g., hospitalizations, emergency room
           visits)

        -  To capture patient reported symptoms, functioning and health-related quality of life
           (HRQoL) data using European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of
           Life Questionnaire - Core 30 items (EORTC QLQ-C30), and European Organisation for
           Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire - Lung Cancer 13 items
           (EORTC QLQ-LC13)

        -  To capture health state utilities using the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire
