      will be more effective than TAU to improve patient mobility by reducing the patient's
      perceived dyspnea and exertion via maintaining oxygenation (reduced desaturation) and
      supporting ventilation (reduced work of breathing [WOB]). The primary endpoint is exercise
      performance, defined as the distance and duration of patient ambulation.

      To provide a sample data set, The investigators will enroll up to 32 subjects to complete
      this feasibility assessment, with a calculated sample size of N=26 plus a 20% failure rate.
      This will provide sufficient initial data to inform the appropriate sample size of a
      follow-on randomized study.

      This will be a feasibility study, performed as a prospective, crossover controlled trial to
      evaluate the potential patient improvement during ambulation while on HVNI relative to TAU.
      Patients who fit the criteria for inclusion will perform ambulation for each study arm: the
      control arm (TAU) followed by the test arm (HVNI). Control group will receive the site TAU
      (not HVNI), and the test group will receive HVNI therapy. In both cases the clinical
      management will otherwise remain unchanged based on the site SOC practices. The patient FiO2
      and flow values will be recorded while on any supplemental oxygen. Subjects will wear
      appropriate gear and, when applicable, have mobile carts to provide supplemental oxygen
      therapy (e.g. HVNI VTU) during ambulation. If they meet criteria for intubation or are deemed
      to need intubation by the critical care team, they will undergo prompt intubation and be
      managed according to standard practice. After each of the study arms, the clinicians will
      complete perception score assessments.
