    
      This study (FORTIS) will evaluate the safety and efficacy of an investigational gene
      replacement therapy, AT845, in adult subjects with LOPD. Subjects will receive a single dose
      of AT845 delivered via intravenous (IV) infusion.

      Up to 2 nominal dose levels of AT845 are planned to be evaluated in FORTIS. A single AT845
      administration via IV infusion is planned for each subject. The initial dosing cohort will
      receive a single dose at 3x10^13 vg/kg of AT845. The second dose cohort will receive a single
      dose at 6x10^13 vg/kg of AT845.

      The core observation period will be completed by Week 48 for each subject. Subjects will be
      followed for a total of 5 years after administration of AT845.
