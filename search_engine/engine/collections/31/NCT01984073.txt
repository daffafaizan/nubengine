      only recruiting for Phase 2. The purpose of this particular phase is to measure the effects
      of niacin after drinking a glass of heavy cream as a source of fat. We hope that studying the
      way the body responds will help us better understand how niacin works.

      In this study, we are interested in niacin's ability to lower triglycerides, or fat in the
      blood. We are studying two different forms of niacin and comparing them to each other. The
      two forms differ in how long they take to release niacin into the bloodstream. The first form
      is called Nialor, and is sometimes called immediate-release niacin because it is absorbed
      into the bloodstream quickly. The second form is called Niaspan, and is sometimes called
      extended-release niacin because it is a time-released spansule that takes longer to get into
      the bloodstream. We are comparing the two forms because we think that the time that it takes
      to absorb niacin may affect how it works. We also want to understand one of the common
      effects of niacin: skin flushing. Most people who take niacin experience flushing, which is a
      hot flash. In this study, we are studying whether the two forms of niacin cause different
      degrees of flushing. Niaspan is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to
      treat unfavorable cholesterol levels and prevent heart attacks in those who have already
      suffered heart attacks. Nialor is available over the counter as a supplement and contains
      Silymarin (milk thistle) and Policosanol (an extract from sugar cane) in addition to niacin.
