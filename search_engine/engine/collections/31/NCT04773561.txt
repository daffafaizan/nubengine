      Alim et al evaluated the choroidal and retinal thickness in singleton versus twin
      pregnancies. They included 20 single and 20 twin pregnant women in their 3rd trimester with
      20-age-matched healthy non-pregnant women as a control group. They found that there was an
      increase in choroidal thickness in the 3rd trimester of pregnancies and it was prominent in
      twin pregnancies. There was a statistically significant difference in choroidal thickness
      between pregnant and non-pregnant women, but not significant difference between singleton and
      twin pregnancies. The mean retinal nerve fiber layer thickness was significantly higher in
      the twin pregnancy group than in the singleton pregnancy group. However, no study of retinal
      vascular density in twin pregnancies has been published before.
