      unique pathology to increase metabolic disease including fatty liver and insulin resistance,
      which may be mediated by altered glucagon like peptide-1 activity. The investigators will
      treat girls with obesity and polycystic ovarian syndrome for 4 months with a glucagon like
      peptide-1 receptor agonist compared to dietary intervention to primarily lower hepatic fat
      and secondarily improve whole body and adipose insulin sensitivity. Mechanisms of hepatic
      metabolism, including rates of de novo lipogenesis and relative mitochondrial flux will also
      be assessed.
