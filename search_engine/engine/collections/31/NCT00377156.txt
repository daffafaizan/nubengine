      Primary

        -  Compare the overall survival of patients with 1 to 3 cerebral metastases treated with
           stereotactic radiosurgery with vs without whole-brain radiotherapy.

      Secondary

        -  Compare time to CNS (brain) failure in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare quality of life, duration of functional independence, and long-term
           neurocognitive status of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare post-treatment toxicity in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to age
      (18 to 59 vs 60 and over), extracranial disease (controlled for â‰¤ 3 months vs controlled for
      > 3 months), and number of brain metastases (1 vs 2 vs 3). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2
      treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS).

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo SRS as in arm I. Within 14 days, patients then undergo
           whole-brain radiotherapy 5 days a week for 2.5 weeks.

      Quality of life, functional independence, and neurocognitive status are assessed at baseline,
      at the beginning of each treatment, at weeks 6 and 12, and then at 6, 9, 12, 16, 24 , 36, 48,
      and 60 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 238 patients will be accrued for this protocol.
