    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Overall response rate (ORR) to single agent AT13387 (onalespib) as measured by the
      proportion of partial and complete responses (PR + CR) in patients with relapsed/refractory
      ALK positive (+) anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), and BCL6+
      diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), as well as duration of response
      (DOR) of single agent AT13387 (onalespib) in patients with ALK+ ALCL, MCL, and BCL6+ DLBCL.

      II. Safety and tolerability of single agent AT13387 (onalespib) in patients with ALK+ ALCL,
      MCL, and BCL6+ DLBCL.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Measurement of on-target activity of AT13387 (onalespib) in ALK+ ALCL, MCL, and BCL6+
      DLBCL through immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry of pre-treatment, on-treatment, and
      time of progression tumor biopsies for HSP90 clients.

      II. Determination of genetic and transcriptional markers for response and resistance to
      AT13387 (onalespib) in patients with ALK+ ALCL, MCL, and BCL6+ DLBCL.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive onalespib intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16.
      Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for up to 1
      year.
