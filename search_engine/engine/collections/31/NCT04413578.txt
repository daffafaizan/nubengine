    
      This is a parallel randomized controlled trial. Eligible patients who consent will be
      randomized to one of two groups: (1) the intervention group who will be given a Dexcom G6 for
      CGM, or (2) the control group who will follow their current standard finger-prick protocol
      via a provided Contour Next ONE glucometer. The CGM group must download the Dexcom G6 and
      Clarity mobile apps for data capture, whereas the standard of care group will use the Contour
      Next mobile app for their respective readings.

      The Dexcom G6 captures real-time, dynamic glucose data every five minutes. Devices used in
      this study are FDA approved and commercially available.
