      carbapenems. Unfortunately, the increasing and unreasonable use of carbapenems invariably
      leads to the spread of even more resistant strains, BHRe (Emerging Highly Resistant Bacteria)
      including enterobacteriaceae producing carbapenemases. Thus, it is strongly recommended by
      health authorities to limit the use of carbapenems ("carbapenem savings") by promoting the
      use of therapeutic alternatives. Ceftolozane/tazobactam is one of those therapeutic
      alternatives for which an evaluation must be carried out. Currently, in addition to
      complicated intra-abdominal infections and complicated urinary tract infections,
      ceftolozane/tazobactam combination is used in clinical practice in gram-negative infections
      such as upper and lower respiratory infections and bacteremia. In any case, the choice of
      probabilistic antibiotic therapy must take into account local and regional epidemiological
      data. However, published data on the in vitro activity of ceftolozane/tazobactam remain
      limited, particularly in France (only one French epidemiological study on Gram-negative
      non-fermenting bacillus strains isolated in patients with cystic fibrosis). This study does
      not take into account in particular multi-resistant enterobacteriaceae producing BLSE for
      which ceftolozane/tazobactam remains effective (particularly in E. coli and K. pneumoniae).
