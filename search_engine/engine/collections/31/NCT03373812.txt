      the visual axis (MRD1).Patients usually complains of visual field disturbance, deterioration
      in quality of life and a poor cosmetic appearance.

      In clinical practice, two main surgical approaches are performed to the repair of
      involutional ptosis:

        1. anterior approach - skin incision and levator muscle insertion advancement.

        2. posterior approach - eyelid reversion and tarsectomy Both approaches has its pro's and
           con's, but to this date, no solid evidence exists to prove which of these techniques is
           superior in manner of anatomical and functional results.

      in this prospective study, patients with involutional ptosis will be randomized to each of
      surgical approaches groups, parameters concerning surgical and post surgical periods will be
      evaluated.
