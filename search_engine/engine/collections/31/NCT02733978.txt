      microtrauma with high impact on quality of life, management of DUs is a great challenge for
      clinicians. Medical use of ozone (triatomic oxygen) was initiated in the 19th century. Ozone
      has multiple therapeutic effects in wound healing due to the property of releasing nascent
      oxygen, which has been shown to stimulate antioxidant enzymes, we aim to assess the effects
      of ozone therapy on the healing in Scleroderma DUs and the expressions of vascular
      endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and endothelin-1 type A receptor (ETAR) and angiotensin II
      type 1 receptor (AT1R) autoantibodies level in the wounds after treatment.
