    
      This is a multicenter, open-label study in up to 140 participants, who will be randomized to
      receive subcutaneous (SC) injections of either AKCEA-TTR-LRx once every 4 weeks or inotersen
      once a week. Participants will also receive daily supplemental doses of the recommended daily
      allowance of vitamin A. Participants included in the inotersen reference arm will be crossed
      over to AKCEA-TTR-LRx at Week 37 after completing the Week 35 assessments.
