      position in the treatment of below the knee arterial occlusive disease with intermittent
      claudication and/or critical limb ischemia. However, the efficacy of percutaneous
      transluminal angioplasty (PTA) with conventional balloons, is limited by the high 12-month
      restenosis and target lesion revascularization (TLR) rates. Local delivery of newer
      anti-proliferative drug via drug-eluting balloons (DEBs) has recently shown promising results
      in the treatment of femoropopliteal disease, and in the BTK area, a reduction in 3-month
      binary restenosis has been observed compared with historical controls treated with PTA. Drug
      eluting balloon has three potential advantages: (1) homogenous drug transfer to the vessel
      wall; (2) highest drug concentrations at the vessel wall at the time of injury; and (3)
      absence of a stent or delivery polymer.

      This study sought to investigate the long-term efficacy and safety of new drug
      (Paclitaxel)-eluting balloons (DEB) for the treatment of below the knee peripheral arterial
      disease.
