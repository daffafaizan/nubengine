      document the feasibility and acceptability of an intervention to engage fathers in supporting
      dietary diversity in Kaduna State, Nigeria. This study was conducted as part of the Alive &
      Thrive Nigeria program, implemented by FHI 360 and partners. RTI led the design and
      implementation of the study, with Datametrics Associates Ltd. serving as the data collection
      partner in Nigeria. The study was carried out in 6 wards (2 urban, 4 rural) of Igabi local
      government area in Kaduna State. We collected survey data cross-sectionally from 495
      cohabiting mothers and fathers of children 6-23 months at baseline and endline. Participants
      were randomly sampled within 99 clusters selected proportional to population size. The
      purpose of the surveys was to obtain data on children's complementary feeding, changes in
      fathers' and mothers' knowledge and attitudes related to complementary feeding, and fathers'
      support for complementary feeding, and to measure participants' exposure to the intervention
      components. To measure feasibility and acceptability of the intervention, we conducted 24
      in-depth interviews at the end of the intervention with community and religious leaders and
      Community Health Extension Workers who were involved in implementing the intervention. In
      addition, we conducted separate focus group discussions with mothers and fathers (8 groups
      each) at the end of the intervention to learn about changes in social norms related to
      fathers' engagement in complementary feeding and their experiences with participating in the
      intervention.
