    
      A total of 41 patients awaiting transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) will be
      divided into two groups (1:1); twenty patients will receive no medication and 21 will receive
      0.5 mg dutasteride daily for 2 to 4 weeks until TURP. In both groups, the extent, intensity
      and intracellular location of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha and vascular endothelial
      growth factor (VEGF)will be evaluated. Microvessel density will be also compared in the two
      groups.
