      a prospective trial from MSKCC demonstrated that a PET-CT obtained in the second week of
      neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy was able to discriminate sub-optimal responders with a
      sensitivity of 94% and an accuracy of 78%, though the most useful metric was a novel "visual
      response score" based on interpreting radiologists scoring rather than more established
      objective data available from PET, like SUV. A study from China in non-small cell lung cancer
      found that decreases in SUV and MTV on intra-treatment PET-CTs after 40Gy of chemoradiation
      therapy were significantly greater in patients responding to treatment by post-treatment
      RECIST criteria. For head and neck cancers, a Belgian study found that intra-treatment SUVmax
      at 47Gy was associated with significant differences in overall survival. Therefore, there is
      emerging evidence that an intra-treatment PET may also be of significant prognostic utility,
      at an early enough time point to potentially alter treatment accordingly.

      All participants will be required to complete two research PET scans in addition to standard
      of care planning CT's for radiation therapy. For all subjects with cancer of the cervix and
      vulva an intra-treatment PET-CT will be obtained and used to develop a volume adaptive
      treatment plan for the remainder of the course. Subjects with esophageal and anal canal
      cancer will have an adapted plan if the treating radiation oncologist determines an adapted
      plan is clinically relevant.
