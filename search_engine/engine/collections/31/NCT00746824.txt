      consequences including Type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia and cardiovascular diseases. The
      prevalence of obesity is increasing both in developed and developing countries. There is a
      great need for further medicinal treatments that effectively will support life style changes
      or surgical procedures in reducing or maintaining bodyweight.

      7TM Pharma has identified TM30339 as a clinical development candidate molecule with potential
      to assist in the control and amelioration of obesity in humans.
