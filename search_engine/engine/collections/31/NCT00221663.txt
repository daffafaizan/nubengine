      Minimally invasive techniques for cardiac surgery should be formally evaluated.

      Design:

      Randomized, single-blind, monocentric trial.

      Interventions Compared:

      Median sternotomy versus minimally invasive technique.

      Eligibility Criteria:

      Indication of isolated aortic valvular replacement, preoperative American Society of
      Anesthesiologists (ASA) class < = 3, left ventricular ejection fraction > = 40%.

      Primary Outcome:

      Forced expiratory volume and peak expiratory volume/second at 48 hours.
