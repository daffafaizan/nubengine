      of motivational intervention. In Phase I, participants will receive 6 months of intensive
      weekly group-based or telephone-based motivational, behavior modifying intervention aimed at
      improving physical activity levels and dietary habits. Phase II will be an additional 6
      months of monthly individualized motivational intervention in order to attain and maintain at
      least 7% body weight loss. All participants will attend an orientation, 2 run-in sessions,
      and a baseline assessment prior to the intervention. Participants will then be assigned to
      either the group based intervention or telephone intervention. The first 30 participants will
      enter into the group-based intervention and the second 30 will enter into the telephone-based
      intervention. Follow-up visits will be completed at the end of Phase I (week 25) and Phase II
      (week 50). Up to 60 women with a previous history of breast cancer will participate in this
      study.
