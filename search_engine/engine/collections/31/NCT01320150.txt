    
      Overall Strategy: The primary aim of this application is to investigate relationships of risk
      factors to the development of persistent postoperative pain (PPP) at 6 mo following TKR,
      through independently predictive and mediated models.

      These risk factors are preoperative thermal pain sensitivity, pain anxiety and
      catastrophizing; postoperative area of secondary mechanical hyperalgesia or hypoalgesia
      (numbness) and pain intensity. PPP for this study will be defined as "pain in the operated
      knee at six months after TKR, with other causes of pain excluded and reported intensity on
      0-10 Numerical Response Scale (NRS) scale of â‰¥4". The study will also evaluate the
      relationship of PPP incidence with the severity of functional impairment. This is a
      single-site prospective clinical investigation of 300 consented OA patients undergoing
      primary, unilateral TKR.
