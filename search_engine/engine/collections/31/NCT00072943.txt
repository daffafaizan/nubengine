      consisting of: four groups differing in the amount of study drug given and one placebo group.
      The initial dose of study drug will be given intravenously, injected into a vein in the arm.
      Four weeks later, three subsequent doses of study drug will be given subcutaneously, through
      the skin, every four weeks for three doses. Patients will be followed for approximately six
      months after receiving their final dose.
