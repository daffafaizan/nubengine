    
      Ten individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) and tremor who use Cannabis were observed for
      two weeks. Individuals were asked to keep a journal of Cannabis use (form, delivery method,
      amount) and wear an accelerometer on the wrist with the dominant tremor. Analyses will be
      performed to describe whether Cannabis use affects PD tremor following use.
