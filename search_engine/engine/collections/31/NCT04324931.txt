      causing the functional disability and pain specifically in older adults.

      Objective: Purpose of the study is to see that the biomechanical correction on the tibia and
      varus deformity is effective in the conventional treatment of participants with the KOA.

      Study Design: A Randomized single group Pretest-Post test Clinical Trial. Methodology: Total
      '5' subjects were included in the study with the age of 40 to 60 years based on exclusion and
      inclusion criteria. For the pain, the NPRS will be taken, goniometer taken for the
      measurement of range of motion, WOMAC will be taken for the physical activity measurement and
      CAD Software will be taken to see the alignment of the affected limb. Conventional treatment
      will also be given.

      Conclusion: Biomechanical correction shows the significant improvement and improves the
      subject's physical activity and reduces the pain and stiffness.
