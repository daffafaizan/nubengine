    
      The study is a single dose study in up to 3 sequences in subjects with complete Traumatic
      Spinal Cord Injury. In each sequence, 6 subjects will be randomized to a surgical procedure
      where SC0806 will be implanted into the spinal cord and receive specific walking training,
      and 3 subjects will be randomized to specific walking training only. Interim analyses of
      safety parameters will be performed. If a positive effect and no major safety concerns have
      been demonstrated after completion of all sequences, the control subjects will be given the
      opportunity to receive treatment with SC0806 after completion of their rehabilitation
      periods.
