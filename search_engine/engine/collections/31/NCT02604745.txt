      valve surgical repair has proven to be an effective and durable option in the treatment of
      symptomatic degenerative mitral regurgitation (MR).

      Echocardiography remains a cornerstone in the evaluation of patients with degenerative (Type
      II) mitral regurgitation allowing for assessment of mitral anatomy, quantification of
      regurgitant severity, assessment of biventricular function, non-invasive measurement of
      pulmonary artery systolic pressures and identifying the presence of other valvular disease.
      The AHA/ACC Valvular Heart Disease Guidelines recommend the use of exercise echocardiography
      in the setting of mitral regurgitation to determine the degree of mitral regurgitation and
      pulmonary artery systolic pressures pre and post exercise in addition to an objective
      determination of the symptoms and exercise capacity.

      Echocardiography (both resting and exercise modalities) is helpful in the post-mitral valve
      repair period in the assessment of the mitral valve gradient and recurrent mitral
      regurgitation. Symptomatic MR patients can have poor health-related quality of life (HRQOL)
      which improves and / or returns to comparable age-adjusted norms for reference populations
      after mitral valve repair or replacement.

      To date, there is limited assessment of the degree of mitral regurgitation, mitral stenosis,
      and exercise capacity following both surgical and percutaneous mitral valve intervention as
      measured by exercise echocardiography. We propose that this modality with the addition of
      novel imaging technologies will provide a robust avenue for the assessment of these patients
      longitudinally. Additionally, assessment of HRQOL, including both the physical and mental
      health domains, will provide important information with which to guide patient care after
      mitral valve surgery.
