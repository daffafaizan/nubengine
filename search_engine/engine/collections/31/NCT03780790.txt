      effective postoperative analgesia. Neuroaxial blocks such as epidural and caudal blocks is
      considered the gold standart regional technique for pain management after lower abdominal
      surgery, blocking both somatic and visceral pain. Nowadays,US is increasingly used to perform
      caudal block, demostrating cannule placement and precise deposition of local anesthetic in
      the epidural space. On the other side truncal blocks as US-guided TAP block covers T10-L1
      dermatomes and provides postoperative pain relief after lower abdominal surgery with lower
      complication rate rather than caudal block but it may not prevent traction on the peritoneal
      sac. QLB is rather a new regional technique blocking nerve roots close to paravertebral area
      affecting somatic and visceral nerve fibers. In our study we aim to compare postoperative
      analgesic effects of these three techniques in paediatrics. Our primary outcomes are pain
      scores(FLACC/VAS) and first additional analgesic requirement time. Secondary outcomes are
      total analgesic consumption, side effects (nausea, vomiting, itching, urinary retention,
      bradycardia, hypotension, respiratory depression), length of hospitalization and chronic pain
      due to incision after 2 months.
