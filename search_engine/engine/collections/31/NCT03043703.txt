      and a Hypopnea-Index HI to define how frequent breathing or breathing efforts stop during the
      night. The severity of sleep apnea (SA) is determined by the number of occurring apneas and
      hypopneas. The respiratory disturbance index (RDI) captures these events and is calculated
      comprising an AHI but also RERAs via the flow signal. Polysomnography (PSG) is being used in
      the sleep laboratory as the Gold standard method to document a patient's sleep behavior by
      tracking air flow, respiratory effort, blood oxygen and electrocardiac as well as
      electromyographic signals. This way a comprehensive sleep pattern analysis can be created and
      different forms of SA can be detected. However, the method is laborious and cost-intensive,
      so it could save time and costs to have events accurately scored by the device itself. Device
      data become important when tracking a patient's sleep night by night and not only once.
      Reliable sleep data can be a valuable tool for tailoring sleep therapy to specific patient's
      needs. Accurate device data also build the foundation for analysis of large amounts of data,
      which can help us understanding how sleep disorders develop.
