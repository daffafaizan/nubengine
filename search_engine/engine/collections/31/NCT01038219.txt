    
      1000 estimates and measurements of children's body temperatures will be carried out by
      parents and nurses in the pediatric emergency unit and pediatric department as part of the
      routine work. The estimates and the measurements will be carried out on both boys and girls
      of all ages. A patient might be measured several times.

      The measurements will be gathered in the course of one year. Before the routine taking of
      temperature, the accompanying parent will be asked to estimate the patient's temperature by
      feeling his forehead (with the back of the hand, the palm, lips). The parent will record his
      evaluation (without telling the nurse). Afterwards the nurse will perform a similar
      evaluation (excluding the lip test), record it, and then the routine temperature measurement
      will be taken and recorded.

      Medical Equipment The temperature will be taken with the existing equipment in the emergency
      ward and in the children's ward. A rectal measurement will be taken in the case of children
      under two years old. Children over two will be measured orally. The temperature of children
      suffering from diarrhea and vomiting will be taken with an ordinary mercury thermometer. All
      other measurements will be made using an electronic, mobile thermometer manufactured by the
      Filac Company, (FasTemp electronic thermometer) routinely used in the emergency ward and
      pediatric departments.
