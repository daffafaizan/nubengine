      weeks and are monitored during study 3 visits. Parameters assessed are overall health
      assessment of the patient, pain relief, constipation, use of laxatives, use of analgesic
      rescue medication, use of concomitant medication, quality of life and safety of Targinact®
      treatment. These parameters, except for safety assessment, are compared between Targinact®
