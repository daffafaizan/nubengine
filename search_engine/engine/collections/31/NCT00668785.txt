      found to be elevated temporarily following the photocoagulation of human Retinal Pigment
      Epithelial (RPE) cells. Ranibizumab (Lucentis TM, Genentech) is an anti-VEGF antibody shown
      to have properties to prevent macular edema. We hypothesize that VEGF inhibition can
      effectively treat PRP-induced macular edema, thereby minimizing post-PRP vision loss.

      Subjects who meet eligibility criteria will receive 0.5mg ranibizumab administered 7-14 days
      post-PRP. Additional intravitreal injections of 0.5 mg of ranibizumab at Day 30 and/or Day 60
      may be also be administered. All subjects will be followed for 90 days for safety and
      efficacy assessments. There is no placebo or sham arm of this trial.
