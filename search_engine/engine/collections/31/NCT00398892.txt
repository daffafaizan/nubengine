    
      This is a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled crossover trial of lipoic acid for
      glycaemic control in type 2 diabetes.

      The trial has 3 phases, each lasting 12 weeks. During phases 1 and 3, subjects take lipoic
      acid or placebo tablets, the order to be determined by randomization. Phase 2 is a 12-week
      washout period. The intervention is lipoic acid 200mg daily for 1 week, 400mg daily for the
      second week, and 600mg daily for weeks 3-12. Equivalent numbers of placebo tablets will be
      taken during the placebo phase.

      The principal outcome measure is change in HbA1c between the start and end of lipoic acid
      supplementation, by comparison with the same change with placebo.

      The secondary outcome measure is change in urine albumin:creatinine ratio over the same
      periods.

      Assessments for safety will include standard adverse events reporting, repeated laboratory
      measurements throughout the study (blood count, renal and liver function) and hypoglycaemia
      frequency.
