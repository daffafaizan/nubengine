      for pregnancy relapse psychiatrically. However, relapse is also quite common in women who
      continue taking mood stabilizing medication with studies demonstrating approximately a 30-37%
      relapse rate-most with depressive episodes. One likely explanation for the high relapse rate
      of Bipolar Disorder during pregnancy despite continued mood stabilizing medication is
      decreasing blood levels of mood stabilizing medications during the course of pregnancy.
      Pregnancy induces both pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic changes, which can result in
      decreased serum blood levels and decreased treatment efficacy. Therapeutic drug monitoring is
      considered standard of care for a number of psychiatric medications. Therapeutic drug
      monitoring can be an especially crucial guide to clinical treatment during pregnancy, but
      remarkably, there are no established protocols for the monitoring of levels and dosing of
      psychiatric medications in pregnancy. Most pregnant psychiatric patients are therefore
      managed based on symptom recurrence. In contrast, there are established protocols for
      monitoring blood levels and prophylactic management of antiepileptic medications for
      epilepsy, including lamotrigine which is also a mood stabilizing medication. The
      investigators will collect pilot data on the psychiatric outcomes, adverse events, and
      obstetrical and infant outcomes of pregnant women with Bipolar Disorder who undergo
      prophylactic therapeutic drug monitoring for a commonly used mood stabilizing medication
      during pregnancy- lamotrigine. In the epilepsy literature, there is a published protocol for
      lamotrigine management before, during, and after pregnancy for seizure control; the
      investigators will use this protocol as a guide.
