      malignancies, including a subset of myeloid leukemia (M4/M5 AML and blast crisis CML). eIF4E
      overexpression leads to oncogenic transformation. Ribavirin impedes eIF4E mediated
      transformation in vitro, in primary human specimens and in animal models.

      While ribavirin has been used extensively for the treatment of viral hepatitis C and its
      safety profile has been well defined, it has never been used in patients with AML. This study
      will establish the efficacy and safety of ribavirin in M4/M5 AML patients. In addition, this
      study will also include correlative studies to determine the effect of ribavirin on eIF4E
      activity and eIF4E related pathways in M4/M5 AML patients.
