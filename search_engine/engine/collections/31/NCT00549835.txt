      practice originated in China more than 2,000 years ago, and is widely used by doctors in
      Korea, China, Japan, and other countries to ease pain or various symptoms. In the past two
      decades, acupuncture has grown in popularity in the United States, and by 2002, an estimated
      8.2 million adults in the US report having used acupuncture.

      The term acupuncture describes a family of procedures involving stimulation of anatomical
      points on the body by a variety of techniques. The acupuncture technique that has been most
      studied scientifically involves penetrating the skin with thin, solid, metallic needles that
      are manipulated by the hands or by electrical stimulation. Acupuncture needles are metallic,
      solid, and hair-thin. People experience acupuncture differently, but most feel no or minimal
      pain as the needles are inserted. Some people are energized by treatment, while others feel
      relaxed.
