    
      Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) is thought to be the most common disseminated bacterial
      opportunistic infection in AIDS, with clinical prevalence estimates ranging from 15 to 50
      percent of all AIDS patients. Clarithromycin, a new macrolide antimicrobial agent, has
      demonstrated activity against MAC both in the laboratory and in animals. Clinical experience
      treating AIDS patients with clarithromycin for disseminated MAC is limited. However, early
      studies have indicated few adverse effects and some improvement in clinical symptoms scores
      and Karnofsky performance scores over placebo treated patients.

      Treatment is randomly assigned so that twice as many patients receive clarithromycin at the
      lower dose as at an intermediate dose for 12 weeks. Once data becomes available to support
      dosing patients with clarithromycin at the highest dose, then treatment will be randomly
      assigned so that twice as many patients receive clarithromycin at the highest dose as at the
      intermediate dose. Sixteen patients per group (48 patients in all) will be enrolled. Patients
      exhibiting clinical improvement or clinical cure while on this trial will be allowed to
      continue on therapy for an additional 6 months. Patients will have clinical evaluations
      (including the Karnofsky Performance Scale), laboratory evaluations (hematology and
      chemistry), and blood cultures for MAC performed monthly.
