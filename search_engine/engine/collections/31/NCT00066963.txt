      children from about six months old (when primary teeth erupt) up to age three at two public
      health facilities in San Francisco, one serving a primarily Latino and one a primarily Asian
      population. The RCT 1) Compared the efficacy of once or twice/year fluoride varnish (FV)
      application and counseling to counseling alone in preventing early childhood caries (ECC); 2)
      Assessed pre-intervention salivary markers (biologic and chemical), behavioral and
      demographic factors as predictors of ECC; 3) Compared the efficacy of these interventions
      between sites serving different ethnic populations with a high prevalence of ECC; and 4)
      Determined the salivary fluoride release profile following exposure to fluoride varnish.
