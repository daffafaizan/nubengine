    
      The present study has the following objectives:

      to evaluate the relationship between BHR and mid-expiratory flow, to assess the diagnostic
      accuracy of fractional exhaled nitric oxideï¼Œimpulse oscillometry and mid-expiratory flow in
      CVA with special regard to its discriminating value between CVA and other causes of a chronic
      cough, to estimate prognostic value of BHR and fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) count
      in predicting response to asthma treatment.
