      completely understood. In the acute period after hypoxia ischaemia, erythropoietin signaling
      in the brain induces several neuroprotective mechanisms. In addition to its anti-apoptotic
      and anti-inflammatory properties, erythropoietin also increases antioxidant activities and
      reduces excitotoxic cell injury.

      In addition to its acute effects, erythropoietin stimulates growth factor release, enhances
      neurogenesis and angiogenesis, and promotes long-term repair and plasticity. Thus,
      erythropoietin provides neuroprotective and trophic effects that last well beyond the acute
      period of injury erythropoietin .enhances neurogenesis and directs multipotent neural stem
      cells to differentiate toward a neuronal cell fate.

      In a clinical trial performed in China, Zhu et al. studied 167 neonates with of hypoxic
      ischemic encephalopathy that were randomized to receive erythropoietin (300-500U/kg) or
      placebo every second day for 2 weeks. The first dose of erythropoietin was given within 48
      hours of delivery. Compared with placebo-treated infants, infants that received
      erythropoietin were less likely to die or have moderate to severe disability at 18 months of
      age (44% vs 25%, p=0.02).

      Similarly, Elmahdy et al. studied 30 infants with hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy who were
      randomized to receive five daily doses of 2500 units/kg erythropoietin, or placebo, with the
      first dose given within 24 hours of delivery. The erythropoietin-treated infants demonstrated
      improved electroencephalography backgrounds, reduced biomarkers of oxidative stress after 2
      weeks, and improved neurodevelopment at 6 months of age compared with placebo treated
      infants.
