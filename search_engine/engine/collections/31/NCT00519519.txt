      Peptic ulcer bleeding (PUB) is a common and life threatening condition. Intravenous infusion
      of high dose omeprazole (80mg as bolus followed by 8 mg/hr for 72 hours ie 652 mg/72 hrs)
      after endoscopic therapy resulted in greater reductions of re-bleeding than did placebo. Thus
      the above regime became our departmental protocol. However, there is some evidence that both
      high dose and a regular dose of omeprazole (40mg once a day followed by a saline infusion ie
      120mg/72 hrs) would be equally effective. We calculated that high dose regimen is about S$
      500 more expensive. The aim of our study is to determine the equivalence of both regimes in
      preventing re-bleeding rate (primary end-point), surgery and mortality in PUB patients.

      Study design This is a single institution prospective randomized double-blind study. All
      patient with PUB (Forrest classification I, IIa and IIb: spurting or oozing bleeding, visible
      vessels and clot) had endoscopic treatments (adrenaline injection and/or heater probe). After
      successful endoscopic hemostasis, patients are randomized to receive a high or regular dose
      of omeprazole infusion. After 72 hours, both groups of patients are given oral omeprazole
      40mg daily for 4 weeks. All patients are evaluated at the clinic at the end of 4 weeks. The
      primary end-point is rebleeding. Other secondary endpoints measured are surgery, duration of
      hospital stay and death.
