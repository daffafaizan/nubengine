      18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) to scan the
      whole body at Huashan Hospital from 2009 to 2013. BAT activity will be measured by PET/CT.
      Not only demographic data on sex, age, medication and medical history,but also data on body
      composition and physical examination will be collected for all subjects. Imaging date,outdoor
      temperature and fasting blood samples will be collected as well. In addition, the
      investigators will analyse the metabolic profiles in healthy adults with active BAT and their
      negative controls,such as lipid profiles,fasting glucose and insulin sensitivity, adipokines
      and other biochemical markers.
