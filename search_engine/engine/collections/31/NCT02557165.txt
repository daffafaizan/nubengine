      cells isolated from the VL of patients with COPD could be altered. The investigators propose
      to compare the regenerative potential of the VL and the diaphragm in 15 patients with COPD
      and 15 individuals with normal lung function undergoing a thoracic surgery. From muscle
      biopsies, satellite cells will be isolated and cultured to assess their proliferation and
      differentiation rates, and the expression level of myogenic effectors (MyoD, Myf5, myogenin,
      and MRF4). Alterations in these measurements will confirm the hypotheses that the
      regenerative potential is lower in both muscle groups in patients with COPD compared to
      controls and that in COPD, the regenerative potential is lower in VL compared to the
      diaphragm.
