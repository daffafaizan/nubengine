      The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 20 mg of memantine
      administered once daily as an augmentation agent for subjects who have been taking
      antidepressants for at least 1 month but who have experienced an incomplete or absent
      therapeutic response.

      - Background

      Memantine is a moderate affinity, uncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor
      antagonist that is approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe dementia of the
      Alzheimer's type. It has been commercially available in 23 countries worldwide since 1982.

      There are reports in the published literature that suggest NMDA receptors may be involved in
      the etiology of depressive disorders. The NMDA antagonist ketamine has been shown to have
      antidepressant effects in a placebo-controlled clinical trial (Berman et al., 2000).
      Uncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonists, including memantine, have been shown to exhibit
      antidepressant-like activity in animal models of depression (Moryl et al., 1993, Papp and
      Moryl 1994). Animal studies also support the possibility that uncompetitive NMDA receptor
      antagonists may work synergistically in combination with antidepressants in animal models of
      depression (Rogoz et al., 2001). Some authors have hypothesized a role for NMDA receptors in
      the therapeutic effects of numerous antidepressants (Skolnick et al., 1996).

      - Study Design and Duration

      This is a randomized, single site, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study in
      outpatients. The study consists of an 8-week double-blind treatment period. Approximately 25
      patients will be randomized to each treatment group (memantine or placebo) for a total of
      approximately 50 patients.
