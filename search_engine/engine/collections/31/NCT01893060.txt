      than other central lines such as peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) and
      surgically placed central venous lines (CVL) in the NICU. (www.CDC.gov - NSHN 2010 Report).
      Routine care of the skin entry site (e.g. central line dressing care) is standard for other
      central lines, but there is no standard for care of the umbilical stump while umbilical lines
      are in place.

      In a pilot study to evaluate the relationship of umbilical stump colonization with
      gestational age, the number of days the catheter was in place, and the type of organisms,
      colonization was detected in 78% of patients. There was a direct correlation with
      colonization and line days as well as an inverse relationship with lower gestational age.

      This pilot data supported the need for the study of interventions to reduce umbilical stump
      colonization, which may help decrease blood stream infections (BSIs) associated with
      umbilical lines in the NICU. The proposed study will evaluate feasibility of twice daily
      product application.
