      However, it is associated with several side effects, in particular, a high incidence of
      phrenic nerve blockade.

      The suprascapular nerve block (SSB) has been proposed as an alternative to the ISB as it has
      a lower likelihood of causing phrenic nerve blockade. There are 2 commonly used approaches
      for the suprascapular nerve block, anterior and posterior. The anterior approach may still
      result in some degree of impairment of lung function.

      The primary aim is to assess the pulmonary function after performance of ISB, aSSB and pSSB.
      Secondary outcomes are analgesic effects and incidence of adverse effects of these blocks.
