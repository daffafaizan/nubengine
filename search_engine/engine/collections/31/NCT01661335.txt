      chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) when added to standard antiemetic drug
      regimens for children receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy. The working hypothesis will
      be that standard therapy + aprepitant is superior at preventing CINV than standard therapy +
      placebo.

      1.2 Secondary Aim To evaluate the safety and toxicity of aprepitant (Emend®) in children
      receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy when compared to standard antiemetic therapy +
      placebo.
