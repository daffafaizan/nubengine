      be randomly assigned to receive either Empagliflozin 10mg/daily or Placebo and will later
      receive the alternate treatment.

      Comprehensive testing will occur after each 4 week treatment phase and will include
      assessment of muscle sympathetic nerve activity, cardiac and renal noradrenaline spillover to
      assess organ specific SNS activity.
