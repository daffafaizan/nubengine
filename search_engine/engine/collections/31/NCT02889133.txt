      blood cell (RBC) units from iron-deficient donors has not been rigorously examined. Evidence
      from both animal and human studies indicate that when the iron supply for erythropoiesis is
      inadequate, the RBCs produced have multiple metabolic defects that impair their ability to
      tolerate refrigerated storage. Studies in a mouse model demonstrated decreased
      post-transfusion recovery of refrigerator-stored RBCs obtained from iron-deficient donors.
      The planned studies will identify human donors at greatest risk of providing RBCs with poor
      post-transfusion recovery by using a combination of a decreased serum ferritin concentration
      and increased RBC zinc protoporphyrin, as described below. To evaluate unequivocally the role
      of iron deficiency in poor posttransfusion RBC recovery, intravenous iron will be used for
      iron repletion.
