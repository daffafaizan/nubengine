      intensive care units has shifted from intermittent or bolus feeding to continuous feeds.
      Clinical studies suggest that each of these strategies of providing nutrition is safe for
      patients with no significant difference in glycemic control or adverse effects. There is also
      data to suggest that approximating a more physiologic nutrition schedule with periods of
      feeding and periods of fasting may optimize gastrointestinal and metabolic hormonal feedback
      loops thereby effecting outcomes such as gastrointestinal motility, protein synthesis, and
      glycemic control, among others. Circadian rhythm research supports a temporally restricted
      period of feeding as well. Furthermore, periods of scheduled fasting will allow for provision
      of care that is incompatible with enteral feeds, without interrupting administration of
      nutrition (for example, procedures or testing, incompatible medications, etc).

      Aims 1 and 2 will clarify whether an intermittent enteral nutrition schedule is acceptable to
      ICU staff and patients. Aims 3 and 4 will test whether this enteral feeding schedule is
      effective in providing patients with required nutrition and acceptable glycemic control.

      This pilot will set the stage for a randomized controlled trial further investigating
      superiority of intermittent feeding as compared with the current standard of continuous
      feeding.
