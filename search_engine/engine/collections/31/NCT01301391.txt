      stopping rules. PHA-848125AC will be administered to patients with recurrent metastatic
      unresectable B3 thymoma or thymic carcinoma who have received more than one line of prior
      systemic therapy for advanced / metastatic disease. The intent of the study is to assess the
      antitumor activity of PHA-848125AC and ultimately to improve the outcome of the patients. The
      primary end point for this study is a progression free survival rate of 3 months.
