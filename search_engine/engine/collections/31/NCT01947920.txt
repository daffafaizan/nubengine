      double-blind (neither the participant or the study doctor will know the name of the assigned
      treatment), parallel-group, placebo-controlled, 3-arm (participants will be assigned to 1 of
      3 treatment groups), single-center, Phase 1 study of multiple ascending doses of tramadol HCl
      in healthy adult volunteers. Thirty participants (15 men and 15 women) will be sequentially
      assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups of 10 subjects each (5 men and 5 women). Participants in
      each treatment group will receive a total of 9 oral doses (one every 6 hours) of tramadol HCl
      or placebo, in the ratio of 4:1. The study includes a screening phase and a double-blind
      treatment phase. The treatment phase will consist of 3 treatment periods separated by a 5-day
      safety review period before the next ascending dose of study drug is administered to the next
      group. Participants in each group will be confined to the study center for a total of 5 days,
      the total duration of each subject's participation will be up to 33 days, including the
      screening phase. The total duration of the study (completion of all 3 treatment cohorts) will
      be up-to-approximately 2 months.
