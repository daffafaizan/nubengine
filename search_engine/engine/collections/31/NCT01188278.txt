    
      Historic cohort prolonged by a 12-month follow-up period.

      Prospective: look forward using periodic observations collected predominantly following
      subject enrollment: one year of follow up of patients with CP-CML alive at the time of the
      study.

      Retrospective: look back using observations collected predominantly prior to subject
      selection and enrollment : historical data of patients with CP-CML initiated with a 2G TKIs
      post-imatinib failure (resistance or intolerance) between 1-Jan-2005 and 30-June-2009.

      The inclusion of a historical cohort will allow a rapid enrollment of a large number of
      patients of this rare pathology, while the prospective follow up of this cohort would allow
      long term data to be obtained, including the assessment of the impact on survival and
      appreciate the patient's quality of life (QoL), compliance and satisfaction.
