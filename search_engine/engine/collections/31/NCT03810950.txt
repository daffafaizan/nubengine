      mobile infrastructure that allows the prediction of stress related alcohol intake in an
      ambulatory setting.

      In patients with Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) stress exposure is known to affect craving,
      cue-reactivity and relapse risk. Here, the investigators aim to identify stress- and alcohol
      cue-related physiological markers in a lab experiment to assess interactions between acute
      psychological stress exposure and alcohol cue-exposure regarding their effects on alcohol
      craving and related markers (attentional bias to alcohol-cues, implicit association task,
      neural cue-reactivity). In addition to applying established stress-related markers (cortisol
      in saliva, heart-rate variability, systolic blood pressure and electrodermal activity), the
      investigators will integrate innovative measures currently under investigation (e.g. voice
      stress analysis) to identify whether these additional parameters increase the predictive
      significance.
