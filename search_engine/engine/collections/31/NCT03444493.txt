      affects an estimated 4% to 8% of those low back pain patients without neurological deficits
      or radiographic evidence of lumbar spine disease. The levels of physical performance and
      functional disability of the patients with lumbar FJS are affected because of the chronicity
      of the pain.

      Radiofrequency denervation (RFD) is one of the therapautic procedures are used most commonly
      in treatment of facet joint syndrome. Numerous placebo-controlled trials have examined lumbar
      facet pain and demonstrated that RFD yields positive results in lumbar pain in properly
      selected patients. The lumbar stabilization exercise is based on the control of the local
      muscle system (multifidus, transversus abdominis, diaphragm and pelvic floor muscles)
      responsible for ensuring segmental stability of the vertebral colon in recent years.

      In the clinical trials, stabilization exercises have been shown to reduce pain, improves
      physical performance and prevent the recurrent low back pain by strengthing of muscles
      supporting the vertebral colon.

      Therefore, the main objective of this study is to show the effects of stabilization exercises
      when started in acute period and also reduce the frequency of recurrence low back pain of
      patients with FJS after radiofrequency denervation.
