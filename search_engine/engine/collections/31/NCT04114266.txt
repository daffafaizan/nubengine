      urinary sphincter (AUS) implantation surgery (Robot-assisted, Laparoscopic, Open or other) in
      female patients. The data collection will be undertaken from multiple centres in Europe. The
      participation will be by open invitation from the Urologists from the European Society of
      Female & Functional Urology Section of the European Association of Urology (ESFFU) to all its
      members along with other surgeons undertaking these procedures. The aim is to recruit a total
      of 150 patients in 2 years whereafter patients will be followed until the end of Registry
      which is 5 years after inclusion of the first patient. There will be no restriction on the
      number of patients enrolled as long as they are consecutive. The aim is to have a long-term
      collection of the dataset from as many centres as possible.

      An initial assessment for the robustness of the data collection and first clinical evaluation
      of the data collected will be performed after 1 year by a nominated steering committee.
      Thereafter, the evaluations will be performed after every year until end of Registry.
