      will collect data on how patients with peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) are treated in
      academic and community practices. The registry will enroll newly-diagnosed patients with PTCL
      treated with a variety of regimens. The COMPLETE registry is designed to better understand
      PTCL patient characteristics, treatments, and outcomes to help design and understand future
      clinical trials.
