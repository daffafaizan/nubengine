      sinusitis enrolled by primary care and/or otolaryngology clinics in the United States and
      Australia. Health care professionals not having endoscopy certification will collect
      specimens using the Entvantage sample collection device. Health care professionals with nasal
      endoscopy certification or specialty training will collect comparator specimens using an
      endoscope. Untrained operators with a range of education and training (primary care
      physician, otolaryngologist, physician assistant, nurse practitioner, registered nurse or
      other healthcare professional), will perform the Sinu-Testâ„¢ lateral flow assay in an
      outpatient setting. Mucous samples will be tested for the presence of 3 bacterial pathogens
      responsible for sinusitis using the Sinu-Test in the clinic and by the comparator method,
      standard quantitative bacterial culture with identification (matrix-assisted laser
      desorption/ionization-Time of Flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry instrument) by the central
      laboratory. Qualitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (real-time PCR) of the residual
      assay specimen will also be performed by the central laboratory.

      An additional cohort of individuals not displaying symptoms of acute bacterial sinusitis or
      illness will be included in the study to establish performance of the device with respect to
      colonizing bacteria.
