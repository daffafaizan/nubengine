    
      This is a phase II clinical trial in which study subjects will be treated with multiple doses
      of Ad-ISF35 given via intranodal injection using a fixed dose of 3.3 x 10^10 ISF35 viral
      particles. Intranodal injections will be administered every 2-4 weeks up to six total
      injections.

      Because this is the first time that repeat administration of Ad-ISF35 will be performed via
      intranodal injection, and in order to allow sufficient time to evaluate the safety and
      toxicity of this procedure, we will treat subjects 1 thru 3 at one month intervals and with
      inpatient admission for 24 hours observation. After subject three receives their second ISF35
      injection we will proceed with enrollment of cohorts of four patients per month at one week
      intervals until study enrollment has been completed. These subjects will be treated as
      outpatients and will be observed for 3 hours prior to discharge.

      ISF35 has already been used in Phase I clinical trials. The trials demonstrated that ISF35
      treatment is well-tolerated and patients did not experience any significant or unexpected
      adverse events. Patients reported flu-like symptoms from ISF35, which disappeared within one
      to three days.

      ISF35 is an abbreviation for Immune Stimulatory Factor 35, an offspring of technology
      discovered by Dr. Thomas J. Kipps, MD, PhD, Professor, Department of Medicine and Deputy
      Director for Research,UCSD Moores Cancer Center.
