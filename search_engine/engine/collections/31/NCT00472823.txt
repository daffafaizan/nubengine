      over the age of 50 already having the disease and another 34 million at risk for developing
      it. Development of low-cost and effective strategies is important for preventing osteoporosis
      and reducing osteoporotic fractures. A simple inexpensive strategy to prevent osteoporosis is
      adequate nutrition with calcium and vitamin D. Serum 25OHD (25-hydroxyvitamin D) is now
      accepted as the objective measure of vitamin D nutrition. There is a growing understanding
      that serum 25OHD concentrations of at least 30-32 ng/ml are needed for optimal bone health at
      which serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) concentrations reach a minimum.

      There are no systematic prospective dose response studies aimed at determining the optimum
      amount of vitamin D intake required to maintain optimum serum 25OHD levels in the population
      which will help in determining the estimated average requirement (EAR) and recommended
      dietary requirement (RDA) for vitamin D. More work to determine the RDA for vitamin D has
      been recommended by the Panel on Calcium and Related Nutrients of the Food and Nutrition
      Board. This study is aimed at filling the information gap by concentrating on the high risk
      group of postmenopausal women. We are testing the theory that increasing serum 25OHD to a
      level greater than 30 ng/ml will reduce serum PTH in the high risk group of vitamin D
      insufficient postmenopausal women with an adequate intake of calcium. We also believe that
      the dose of vitamin D that will achieve this level is approximately 4400IU per day, which is
      well above the suggested adequate intake of 400-600 ID recommended for the elderly.

      In a one year double blind, randomized prospective clinical trial, we will examine the dose
      response effect of supplementation with different doses of vitamin D3 (400, 800, 1600, 2400,
      3200, 4000, 4800IU/day) on the primary outcomes of serum 25OHD and PTH in 160 postmenopausal
      Caucasian and 160 African American women who have inadequate vitamin D levels in winter. We
      expect that the results from this study will add useful and important information about the
      RDA for vitamin D for postmenopausal women who are more susceptible to osteoporosis. The
      results from this study will also help in designing future clinical trials to study the
      effect of vitamin D, for example in preventing fractures, falls, cancer.

      The main objective of the current proposal is to study the effect of increasing doses of
      vitamin D3 in the high risk group of postmenopausal Caucasian and African American women with
      hypovitaminosis D (serum 25OHD <20 ng/ml) in winter in presence of sufficient calcium intake,
      in order to determine the Estimated Average Requirement (EAR) that covers 50% and the
      Recommended Daily allowance (RDA) covers 97.5% of population for vitamin D. We will use a
      serum 25OHD concentration equal >30 ng/ml and normalization of serum PTH as indicators of
      adequacy. We expect that the results from this proposal will add important information
      helpful in designing future larger clinical trials to determine the recommended dietary
      allowance (RDA) for vitamin D in other ethnic groups and designing clinical trials on the
      effect of vitamin D on falls and fractures.

      We hypothesize that increasing serum 25OHD to a level greater than 30 ng/ml with vitamin D
      supplements in 97 percent of the study subjects will reduce serum PTH and bone markers to
      premenopausal range. We postulate that the RDA of vitamin D that will achieve a serum 25OHD
      of â‰¥ 30 ng/ml in 97.5% of women during winter is approximately 4400 IU/d and the EAR dose of
      vitamin D is between 800-1000 IU.

      The specific aims of the proposal are,

        1. To examine the dose response effect of vitamin D3, 400, 800, 1600, 2400, 3200, 4000, and
           4800 IU /d in postmenopausal Caucasian and African American women with hypovitaminosis D
           (serum 25OHD equal <20 ng/ml) in winter plus an adequate calcium intake compared to a
           calcium control group, on serum 25OHD and PTH levels, which constitute our primary
           outcome measures.

        2. To determine the EAR and RDA for postmenopausal women by establishing the dose of
           vitamin D3 that will increase serum 25OHD above 30 ng/ml in 97.5% of study subjects in
           winter and reduce serum PTH to the normal premenopausal range.

        3. To study the dose response effect of vitamin D3 on calcium absorption,
           1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3) serum calcium, serum bone markers, bone mineral
           density (BMD) and falls (only in elderly) (the secondary outcome measures)

        4. To establish the long term safety of these doses relating to hypercalcemia and
           hypercalciuria
