    
      Rationale Although fertility success rates are rising due to improved techniques and patients
      are usually highly motivated at their first visit of the clinic, dropout rates are high.
      Research has shown that fertility treatment is a cause for physical, psychological and
      economic burden.

      Objective The aim of this study is to examine the rate of patient drop out during any type of
      subfertility work up or treatment. Furthermore, the investigators want to determine what the
      reasons for discontinuation are and to identify the demographic characteristics of these
      couples and the prognostic factors for drop out during assessment or treatment at a fertility
      clinic.

      Study design Prospective cohort study at the fertility centres of Isala (Zwolle - The
      Netherlands), Erasmus University Centre (Rotterdam- The Netherlands), Elisabeth Twee Steden
      Hospital (Tilburg - The Netherlands), Reinier de Graaf Group (Voorburg - The Netherlands), St
      Antonius Hospital (Nieuwegein - The Netherlands), Maxima Medical Centre (Veldhoven - The
      Netherlands) and Noordwest Hospital Group (Den Helder/Alkmaar - The Netherlands).

      Study population Every couple that undergoes any type of work up or treatment for
      subfertility problems and that has not visited any other clinic yet.

      Methods Patient records of included couples will be studied and included patients will be
      asked to fill in a validated questionnaire after evaluations during work up or treatment. The
      data from both will be put in a database and analysed.
