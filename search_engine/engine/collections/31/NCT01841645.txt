      orientation, by a registered dietitian, to the study subjects (n=29) to exclude from their
      diets any type of dairy fat for the following 8 weeks. Blood samples were taken at the end of
      CLA-depletion, and CLA-repletion phase was initiated by dietitians' instructions: volunteers
      returned to their regular diets, and additionally consumed a CLA-enriched butter for another
      8-week period. Blood samples were taken at the end of the CLA-repletion phase. The effects of
      CLA on the following parameters were evaluated: inflammatory mediators; fatty acid
      composition of erythrocytes, plasma phospholipids and cholesterol esters; body composition;
      clinical factors associated with the metabolic syndrome and indicators of cell membranes'
      stability.
