      VT despite the use of other therapies. Electroanatomic mapping of the left ventricular
      myocardium is performed as part of these procedures to define the arrhythmogenic substrate
      for subsequent ablation. We hypothesize that delayed enhancement multi-detector computed
      tomography (MDCT) will identify areas of myocardial scarring or fibrosis that correlate with
      findings of voltage mapping in patients with a prior myocardial infarction who are undergoing
      VT ablation. We will perform a pilot study involving 10 patients with coronary artery disease
      scheduled for VT ablation to determine the ability of delayed enhancement MDCT to identify
      arrhythmogenic substrates in these patients, when compared with electroanatomic mapping. All
      patients will undergo a standard of care 64-slice MDCT study, followed 5 minutes later by the
      research delayed enhancement acquisition. We will evaluate the relationship between
      hyperenhanced myocardium, as detected by delayed enhancement MDCT, and abnormal myocardium
      detected on voltage mapping, defined as areas of myocardium with < 0.5 mV signal amplitude.
      Studies will be performed on the new Siemens 64-slice dual source CT scanner, which reduces
      radiation exposure from the scan by 33-50%. This study will generate preliminary data which
      will be used for subsequent NIH/AHA grant applications or industry sponsored trials.
