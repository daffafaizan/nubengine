      include 1) ghrelin, an endogenous ligand secreted by the stomach that also has
      appetite-stimulation properties distinct from its hGH-stimulating effects, and 2)
      somatostatin, a family of 14 and 28 amino acid peptides that act as a potent noncompetitive
      inhibitor of the release of hGH. the investigators recently reported that oral administration
      of a 2.9g/dose of SeroVital, a blend of l-lysine HCl, l-arginine HCL, oxo-proline,
      N-acetyl-l-cysteine, l-glutamine, and schizonepeta (aerial parts) powder, leads to a
      significant 682% mean increase in endogenous hGH levels in male and female subjects in a
      period of 120 minutes following acute consumption. In the work presented here, the
      investigators seek to characterize the mechanistic target associated with this measured
      increase in endogenous hGH by SeroVital, which the investigators hypothesize to be
      somatostatin. The investigators test this hypothesis by assaying thyroid function, a
      secondary inhibition target of somatostatin. The investigators further compare our findings
      to ghrelin-based hGH secretagogues.
