      using the double mesh modification of Chevrel's technique, all the procedures were performed
      by the same group of surgeons.

      The exclusion criteria were American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) 3, and 4,
      inflammatory bowel disease, urgent setting, recurrences and previous abdominal neoplasms with
      high risk of local recurrence (rectal cancer). All patients were informed and consented
      before recruitment in the study All patients received an intravenous antibiotic prophylaxis
      with subcutaneous administration of fractionated heparin before surgery when indicated.

      Surgical technique All patients were operated on with the double mesh modification of
      Chevrel's technique. The previous scar was excised then, dissection of the subcutaneous space
      was performed deep to the neck of the hernia, not wider than 1cm from the edges of the
      defect, then the sac was opened and resected, the defect size was measured, the skin and
      subcutaneous tissue was dissected off the anterior rectus sheath only allowing dissection of
      an anterior rectus sheath flap just sufficient to close the defect without tension After that
      a bilateral longitudinal incisions was done on the anterior surface of the anterior rectus
      sheath and a medial anterior rectus sheath flap was dissected off the rectus abdominis
      muscle, both recti muscles was dissected off the posterior rectus sheath opening the
      retrorectus space, each of the medial anterior rectus sheath flaps was sutured to that of the
      other side with slowly absorbed sutures closing the defect without any tension and reforming
      the posterior rectus sheath

      A sizable prolene mesh was fixed with prolene sutures in the retrorectus space spreading
      between lateral ends of the space and tunneled up 4 cm in the retrorectus space far from
      vertical edges of the defect,Then the anterior rectus sheath was closed using a prolene mesh
      tailored to the size of the space between the lateral flaps of both sides and sutured to the
      edges of the lateral flaps with interrupted non absorbable sutures.

      suction drain is left in site, subcutaneous tissue was closed with Vicryl (3\0) , skin was
      closed with prolene (3\0), drain was removed when the amount of drainage is below 30 ml \ day
      .

      Data of the patients as demographic data, preoperative investigations, operative findings as
      defect size, operative time, early postoperative data as viability of skin flaps, wound
      infection, seroma and early hernia recurrence, late postoperative data as hernia recurrence.
      All data were collected, properly presented and analyzed using the SPSS package 22.
