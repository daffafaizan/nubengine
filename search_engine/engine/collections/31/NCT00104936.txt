      Primary

        -  Compare progression-free survival of patients with newly diagnosed, incompletely
           resected, benign intracranial grade I meningioma treated with adjuvant conventional
           fractionated radiotherapy or radiosurgery vs observation only.

      Secondary

        -  Compare the quality of life of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare overall survival of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the incidence of a second surgery in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the incidence of acute and long-term neurotoxicity in patients treated with
           these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      post-surgery MRI staging (3 vs 4 vs 5), skull base location (yes vs no), age (< 60 vs â‰¥ 60),
      and participating center. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo observation only.

        -  Arm II: Within 4-7 months after surgery, patients undergo conventional fractionated
           radiotherapy once daily, 5 days a week for 6 weeks OR a single treatment of high-dose
           radiosurgery in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, at 6 months after randomization, and then annually
      thereafter.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 3 and 6 months after
      randomization and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 478 patients (239 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 3-4 years.
