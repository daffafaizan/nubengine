      I. To assess the feasibility of single-fraction radiotherapy to provide a short-interval
      treatment response in patients with metastatic epidural spinal cord compression (MESCC), such
      that additional stereotactic radiotherapy to full therapeutic doses can be delivered while
      respecting spinal cord constraints, based on the following metrics: shortest distance between
      gross disease and the spinal cord before and after treatment; epidural tumor volume before
      and after treatment; and extent of epidural compression before and after treatment.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate pain control using the Numerical Rating Pain Scale (NRPS) before and after
      treatment.

      II. To evaluate patient quality of life using the Functional Assessment of Cancer
      Therapy-General (FACT-G) before and after treatment.

      III. To evaluate functional outcomes using ambulation score and standardized neurologic exams
      before and after treatment.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo adaptive staged SBRT. Within 14-21 days, patients may undergo a second
      treatment of adaptive staged SBRT at the discretion of the treating physician based on
      clinical parameters, diagnostic interval imaging, and achievement of spinal cord dose
      constraints.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.
