      intervention. Twelve primary and secondary level health care facilities in Niger State will
      be randomized to the control (standard-of-care) or intervention arms. The investigators will
      match clinics on patient volume and level of facility and randomize to intervention and
      standard-of-care/control arms - 6 clinics per arm.

      The investigators will make the proposed intervention available to all eligible women
      attending clinics that are randomized to the intervention arm. The drug regimens and general
      HIV care services provided as part of the package are standard of care, based on Nigerian
      national guidelines.

      Inclusion Criteria: (1) HIV-infected women (and their infants) who present to ANC or delivery
      with unknown HIV status; (2) HIV-infected women (and their infants) with previous history of
      ARV prophylaxis or treatment, but who are not on prophylaxis or treatment at the time of
      presentation for antenatal care or delivery.

      Exclusion Criteria: HIV-infected women with known status who are on ARV prophylaxis or
      treatment at the time of presentation to ANC.

      Home-based care (HBC) workers will track clients who miss appointments at control and
      intervention sites. The HBC workers will document clients as terminated care if they: (1)
      discontinued services due to death or personal decision; (2) transferred their care to
      another clinic; or (3) are lost to follow-up (defined as being 90 days late for a clinic
      appointment plus 5 failed attempts at tracking the client). Clients will not receive any
      remuneration for participating in the study. Clients will be allowed to discontinue
      participation and decide that their medical data cannot be used in the analysis.
