      have been diagnosed with mild cognitive impairments or dementia (including Alzheimer's
      disease). It is important to find out if these improvements can be obtained with the computer
      game-based integrative (motor-cognitive) bimanual rehabilitation developed by Bright Cloud
      International Corp, and if these gains transfer to daily activities. The study also aims at
      determining benefit of continuum care training on the BAC in addition to conventional
      rehabilitation for participants who are inpatients and then outpatients at a rehabilitation
      hospital and clinic.

      Specific aims are:

      BAC technology acceptance (all groups); improved motor function for upper extremity;
      strengthening shoulder and fingers increased range of motion for arms and fingers; improved
      independence in activities of daily living; improved cognition; improved emotive state;
      reduction in perceived upper body pain.

      Another component of the research project is a small pilot targeting individuals with
      Parkinson's disease. For them the project is going to:

      determine technology acceptance when using the BrightBrainer system; benefit to arms motor
      function and strengthening when playing BCI therapeutic games; benefit to reduction or tremor
      when playing games; cognitive benefits improvement in their well-being.
