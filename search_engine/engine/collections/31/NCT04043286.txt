      in the maxilla and the mandible for this study. Definitive prefabricated abutments will be
      connected at implant placement. The abutment (control group) on one of the two implants will
      be randomly selected to go through one complete cycle of complete disconnection and
      reconnection by hand at 16- (DR1), 19- (DR2), 22- (DR3), and 24- (DR4) weeks after implant
      surgery. The abutment (test group) on the other implant will be left undisturbed throughout
      the duration of the study. All implants will remain unrestored within the study period (12
      months). Peri-implant bone level changes will be assessed using standardized periapical
      radiographs immediately after implant placement (T0), at 3-(T3), 6-(T6) and 12-(T12) month
      follow-up examinations and during each disconnection of the abutments.
