      3 will receive monotherapy with pembrolizumab. Chemotherapy-na√Øve subjects with mCRPC either
      having failed or showing signs of failure with enzalutamide in Cohorts 4 and 5 will receive
      pembrolizumab monotherapy in addition to their current regimen of enzalutamide. In all
      cohorts, pembrolizumab administration will occur on Day 1 of each 3-week dosing cycle and
      will continue for a maximum of 35 cycles (approximately 2 years) unless specific
      withdrawal/discontinuation criteria are met. Participants who discontinue after 35 infusions
      of pembrolizumab for reasons other than disease progression or intolerability, or who
      discontinue after attaining a complete response may be eligible for up to 17 additional
      infusions (approximately 1 year) after they have experienced disease progression.
