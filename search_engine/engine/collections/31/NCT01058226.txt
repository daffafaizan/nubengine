    
      This study is designed to demonstrate the ability to inoculate malaria naive human volunteers
      with the Plasmodium falciparum strain of malaria sporozoites by the bite of infected
      mosquitoes under controlled conditions. Subjects are monitored closely for development of
      malaria and treated with standard doses of anti-malarial medications which the Plasmodium
      falciparum strain of malaria is known to be sensitive.

      Study participants will undergo malaria sporozoite challenge with wild-type NF54 strain of
      Plasmodium falciparum sporozoites administered via the bite of five infected Anopheles
      stephensi mosquitoes under controlled containment conditions.

      Participants will be closely monitored for acute reactogenicity and signs and/or symptoms of
      malaria infection, and from day five post-challenge, will have daily blood films examined for
      the presence of malaria parasites. Participants who develop malaria infection will be treated
      with a standard oral regimen of chloroquine, or other FDA-approved anti-malarial drugs, under
      direct observation. Participants will be treated upon first evidence of microscopic
      parasitemia or at day 18 if they remain negative. Participants will be housed with study
      staff in a local hotel for close observation from day 9 post-challenge, until three
      consecutive blood smears are negative and all symptoms have resolved, then followed weekly
      for a total of 8 weeks.

      Follow-up for safety will be conducted at 4- and 6- months post-challenge.
