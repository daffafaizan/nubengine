      assess the migraine status and classification, colect blood exam, perform a cardiopulmonary
      exercise test to determine the maximal oxygen uptake, and fill psychometric questionnaires.
      The remaining 12 weeks will be the "intervention" period, where participants after
      randomization will be allocated to perform an aerobic exercise training (on treadmill)
      performed on a 3 times per week-based program of 40-min duration each session, or will wait
      for the equal period to repeat all the assessments, then begin the same exercise protocol.
