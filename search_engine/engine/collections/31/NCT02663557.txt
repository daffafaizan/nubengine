      stroke,and the anti-hypertension therapy is regarded as the cornerstone for stroke secondary
      prevention. However, even though some proper measures have been taken,there is still surplus
      risk for recurrent stroke. Recently the variation of system blood pressure has been focused
      as the candidate of another risk factor.Up to date,this hypothesis remains an intense debate
      and few studies has been done to clarify it.Besides, the definition of BPV and measurement of
      BPV parameters are still beyond conformity.In the current study, the long-term and short-term
      BPV will be taken respectively for patients with prior stroke. Bsed on these parameters, the
      cohort will be followed up for average 2 years. The predefined outcome include composite
      cardiovascular events, neuropsychiatric wording, and mortality during followup.
