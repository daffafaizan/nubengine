      May 2005 to June 2009 from our department. The diagnoses of chronic hepatitis B and liver
      failure were based on previously described criteria. All patients received the same medical
      treatments (reducibility glutathione, glycyrrhizin, ademetionine, polyene
      phosphatidylcholine, alprostadil, and human serum albumin). Informed consent was obtained
      before study. Among these patients, 53 received transplantation with autologous MMSCs. The
      day of surgery served as the first day of observation. And 105 patients with matched age,
      gender and some biochemical indexes (ALT, ALB, TBIL, PT and MELD ) were served as controls.
