    
      Eighty-four overweight pediatric subjects will be enrolled sequentially and randomized 2:1 in
      experimental and control groups for six months of weight management programming. The
      experimental group and their parents/guardians will participate in ten weekly 2-hour
      sessions, comprised of 1 hour of exergaming or exergaming combined with traditional exercise
      and 1 hour of didactic classes focusing on nutrition and psychosocial behaviors related to
      weight management. Following these 10 weeks, they will attend monthly 1-hour maintenance
      didactic classes. The control group and their parents/guardians will participate only in the
      didactic portion of the curricula for the same duration of time, 10 weeks, followed by
      monthly maintenance classes for the remainder of the 6 month period. The control group will
      then be offered participation in the Exergaming for Health program upon study completion.

      Comparisons between the two groups will be obtained through changes in the measurements of
      weight, height, BMI z-scores, shuttle run times, and responses to questionnaires about screen
      time, self-perception, and nutrition. Measurements of both groups will be obtained at
      baseline and 6 months and another set of measurements will be obtained on the experimental
      group at 12 months.
