           intensive care unit settings.

        -  A small catheter connects the inner cannel of FB and links to a pressure monitor.

        -  During course of FB, records the intra-lumen pressures (PEEP, PIP) and takes associated
           images at assigned 6 airway locations, if possible.

        -  These 6 locations are: Oropharynx, Supra-glottis, Mid-trachea, Supra-carina Right main
           bronchus, and Left main bronchus.

        -  Thus, a complete FB would involve 6 pairs of measurements in each child.

        -  Both results of PIP levels and images were then stored in a computer for later analysis.

        -  Total record (study) time in each enrolled case about 5 minutes. This study will not
           prolong the FB time. Finally, analysis these associated data.

        -  For objective evaluation of the lumen changes, three captured images were grouped by 6
           locations in each child. These lumen dimensions were independently judged on a
           five-point Likert scale (1 to 5: very collapse, collapse, average, expansion, very
           expansion) within one week by four qualified pediatric bronchoscopists who were blinded
           to the source of these images. The final scores were averaged and analyzed.

        -  Statistical Analysis: The categorical variables were described as percentages and
           compared with the Chi-square or Fisher's exact test as appropriate. A two-tailed p <0.05
           was considered to be statistically significant.
