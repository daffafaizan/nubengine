      constitute an effective stress reliever and has been associated with improved physical and
      mental well-being, functional capacity and overall life satisfaction, as well as decreased
      risk of lifestyle diseases in various populations. Physical activity can also revert symptoms
      of psychiatric disorders such as depression, anxiety, social isolation and dissociation,
      which is common among trauma afflicted refugees. Many refugees also suffer from PTSD, and so
      the investigator's aim is to evaluate what effect a 10-session physical activity intervention
      will have on the mental and physical health of trauma afflicted refugees in a northern
      European country. The sessions will include physical exercise as well as psychoeducational
      components, and will be held by a physiotherapist over a period of ten weeks. The physical
      activity intervention group will be compared to a control-group, who receives two brief
      lectures on psycho-education in connection to baseline-assessment and follow-up.
