      Small Jaw®-assisted and conventional neck dissection in head and neck cancer patients.

      Patients who were scheduled to undergo neck dissection due to head and neck cancer were
      eligible for this study. After receiving a detailed explanation, all patients signed an
      informed consent form before randomization. The study group were treated using the LigaSure
      vessel sealing system (Small Jaw®; Covidien, Colorado, USA) for dissection and hemostasis
      throughout the whole procedures during neck dissection. Relevant data included tumor-related
      variables, perioperative parameters, postoperative drainage status, postoperative subjective
      pain, and analgesic consumption amount were recorded and analyzed.
