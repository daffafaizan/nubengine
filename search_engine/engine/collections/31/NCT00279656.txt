      includes inappropriate prescribing (overuse, underuse, misuse) that can lead to adverse drug
      events and drug-related admissions to hospital. In addition, when a patient is transferred
      from acute care settings to ambulatory care settings, discrepancies in medicines used often
      occur and can be hazardous.

      Despite this, only limited data exist on the effectiveness of optimization strategies
      targeted at frail elderly inpatients.
