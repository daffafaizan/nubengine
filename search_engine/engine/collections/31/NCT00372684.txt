      approximately 2 million deaths each year, especially in tropical African countries.

      In non-endemic industrialized areas, imported malaria is generally diagnosed in travelers, as
      well as immigrants from endemic countries. Such imported cases have increased worldwide, with
      approximately 7000 cases each year in France. Among these cases, 300 are severe requiring
      hospitalization in ICU with an overall mortality rate of 10%, despite available effective
      care.

      Many studies have been performed to evaluate clinical and physiopathological aspects of
      severe malaria in endemic areas but few data are available for imported malaria. Therefore,
      determinants of severe imported malaria are not well known. The majority of patients
      hospitalized in ICU for severe imported malaria are white caucasians, as well as those
      patients who die.

      The present two-year prospective multicentric nationwide study has two main objectives:

        1. To describe the clinical spectrum of severe imported malaria in France and to assess
           outcome (especially mortality, very severe cases, and neurological sequelae).

        2. To analyse the biological interactions between host and the parasite, by evaluating: the
           role of gene polymorphisms of the host including haemoglobin analysis, the intensity of
           inflammatory response, endothelial activation, and finally several plasmodial factors.

      We hope to include 150 to 200 patients with severe malaria hospitalized in ICU and 150 to 200
      patients with uncomplicated malaria. These two groups will be included in a case control
      study comparing severe and non-severe malaria with matching according to ethnic patterns.
