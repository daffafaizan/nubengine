      including substantial daytime fatigue exertional intolerance and ventilatory impairment,
      which hits a nadir in the morning. Nocturnal disturbances in sleep and breathing are common
      in COPD, although the impact of these disturbances on COPD morbidity remains largely unknown.
      The hypothesis is that COPD induces specific sleep and breathing disturbances that remain a
      substantial source of morbidity in this disorder.

      Current therapy for treating nocturnal disturbances in sleep and breathing in COPD including
      nocturnal oxygen has failed to improve morning fatigue and pulmonary function. This study
      promises to significantly alter our approach to the diagnosis and management of sleep
      disordered breathing in COPD.
