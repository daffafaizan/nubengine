      Pediatric Hematology/Oncology clinic to confirm they are eligible for the study. This will be
      done at the time intravenous (iv) access is started, either through an iv placed in the arm
      or through a port/central line.

      All females who are capable of becoming pregnant will then undergo urine pregnancy testing.
      If it is found that they are pregnant they will not be allowed to be in the study.
      Participant blood sugar will be checked. When possible, the research blood sample will be
      collected at a time when routine non-research labs will be collected.

      Study eligible participants will then be given a single 20 mg tablet of propranolol to take
      by mouth and will be escorted by a member of the medical team to the PET scan trailer, where
      they will be checked in and assessed. Blood sugar level will again be checked by finger stick
      according to the standard procedure for PET scans.

      Vital signs will be assessed by a clinical research nurse at least three times while the
      participants are at the PET scan trailer, including twice before the scan and once
      immediately after the scan. The nurse will also assess for any symptoms related to the
      propranolol. If no problems are noted, participants will be discharged from the PET scan
      trailer and their tudy participation will end. If any side effects arise from the medication,
      the pediatric oncologist will be called immediately and appropriate treatment started. The
      PET scan will be assessed by the radiologist to see whether there is uptake in brown fat, as
      well as to see if any areas of tumor are seen.
