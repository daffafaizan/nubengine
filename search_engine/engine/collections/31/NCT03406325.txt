      exhibit high levels of mast cell activation as determined by the mast cell activation
      diagnostic test the investigators have developed. They anticipate that patients with history
      of severe allergic reactions will show up as high responders in the blood-based mast cell
      activation diagnostic test. Moreover, using microarray analysis as the approach for gene
      expression studies, they anticipate further that genomics biomarkers that are correlated with
      the high functional activation of the in-vitro mast cells derived from these patients can be
      readily identified.

      About 100 ml of peripheral venous blood from individual patients will be drawn into
      heparinized syringes and collected in a blood-collecting bag/tube containing silica. The
      bag/tube will be promptly processed for the generation of primary human mast cell cultures
      using the protocol that has previously been developed [Inflammation Research 66: 25 (2017).
      After culturing for 9 weeks, the resulting human mast cells will be analyzed for both their
      functional activity in terms of histamine release in response to the activation of
      high-affinity Immunoglobulin E (IgE) receptors in these cells and their gene expression
      profiles using microarray analysis. The in-vitro functional and genomics data will be
      correlated with specific diagnoses and measurements of blood prostaglandin D2 (PGD2), PGD2
      metabolites, tryptase and histamine levels in blood. For mediator assays, plasma from each
      subject will be collected after the cluster of differentiation 34 positive (CD34+) isolation
      step and the samples will be aliquoted and frozen at -80 degrees centigrade for subsequent
      analysis.
