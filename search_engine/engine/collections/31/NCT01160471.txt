      of heart failure, where above the age of 80 years these figures increase to 13.8% and 12.2%,
      respectively. Projection into the middle part of this century suggests that, as the
      population ages, the prevalence and cost of heart failure will continue to rise. The primary
      aim of this proposal is to investigate noninvasive imaging methods for quantifying diffuse
      myocardial fibrosis with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) in heart failure patients.
      The secondary aims are to investigate the association between diffuse fibrosis detected by
      CMR with left ventricular function, and examine the utility of multi-detector CT (MDCT) in
      detecting diffusion myocardial fibrosis.
