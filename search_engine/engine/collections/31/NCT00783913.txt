      interventions that can improve motor recovery after a stroke.

      Objective:

      The objective of this protocol is to test the hypothesis that active training on a complex
      upper extremity visuomotor task combined with anodal transcranial direct current stimulation
      (tDCS) used to activate the affected hemisphere improves functionality during reaching of the
      affected upper-extremity in comparison to training combined with sham tDCS in stroke
      patients.

      The Study population:

      The study population will include chronic (more than 3 months) stroke patients.

      Design:

      The study will follow a factorial design in which all subjects will undergo several sessions
      of complex visuomotor task training of the upper extremity. One half of the patients will
      undergo anodal transcranial direct current stimulation during the first 20 minutes of each
      training session, while the control subjects will have sham stimulation applied.

      Outcome Measures:

      The primary outcome measure for the study is accuracy during completion of a reaching task.
      The primary endpoint for the study will be the end of 3 weeks of training (15 days).
      Secondary endpoint measures include timing of reach, kinematic, and functional measures.
      These measures will be taken at the end of training and at a 3 month follow-up.
