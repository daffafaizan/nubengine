      reproductive age (n=700) urinary iodine will be determined in order to assess iodine
      nutrition in Switzerland. In addition, in both groups of women a blood sample will be taken
      for the determination of thyroid hormones, iron- and folate status. Questionnaires will be
      used for the determination of dietary iodine and salt intake as well as sociodemographic
      parameters.
