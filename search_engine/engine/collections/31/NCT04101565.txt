      income fathers' knowledge, self-efficacy, and behavioral engagement on infant care and
      parenting. Text4Father consists of 48-weeks of twice weekly texts written at a 5th grade
      reading level. Texts include resource links and instructions to support behavior change
      (e.g., videos, infographics), starting mid-pregnancy and continuing through 2 months of
      postnatal age. Text content was developed using formative research and feedback from the
      target population, consensus building with experts, and an evidence-based review.

      Usual maternity care does not involve expectant fathers in education. Further, while father
      engagement is widely advocated, few public health and clinical approaches aim to engage
      expectant fathers during the prenatal period and first months after birth - a critical window
      of opportunity that has been insufficiently leveraged to promote father engagement when
      fathers describe being unsure of father role.
