      for a period of 8 weeks. At baseline, after 4 weeks and after 8 weeks, 25(OH)D2, 25(OH)D3 and
      total 25(OH)D will be measured in serum as the main outcome variables. Additional outcome
      variables are the Ca concentration in serum, PTH concentration in serum, ambulatory blood
      pressure and heart rate, and renin expression in peripheral mononuclear cells.
