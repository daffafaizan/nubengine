      devices under test, the observers measured the weight and height of each volunteer prior to
      measure the body fat. This was done to configure a preliminary idea about the body
      composition of the subject.

      Both devices are designed by the same technology to emit a low current through the body, and
      finally make a measurement of the impedance found between the body contact points. We
      expected the results to be very similar.
