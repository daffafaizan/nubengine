      with an average of 335,000 deaths per year. This year an estimated 700,000 Americans will
      suffer an acute myocardial infarction. The standard of care treatment for acute myocardial
      infarction (MI) usually includes immediate perfusion, optimal pain relief, oxygen, aspirin or
      other anti-coagulants, Beta-Blockers, nitrates and Ace-inhibitors. Management of cardiac risk
      factors such as tobacco use, hypertension, lipid levels, diabetes, weight control and
      exercise all work to reduce further atherosclerotic events. Yet, many patients go on to
      develop Congestive Heart Failure (CHF). Medical management for CHF may improve symptoms and
      slow the progression to failure but does not restore a functioning myocardium. A therapy that
      could improve the myocardial remodeling process and reduce the incidence or severity of CHF
      following acute MI would provide a significant benefit in an area of unmet medical need.

      Patients will receive standard of care in addition to stem cells or placebo.
