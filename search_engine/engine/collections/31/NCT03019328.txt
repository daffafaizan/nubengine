      observational study. All subjects will have a baseline research clinic visit, where they will
      be given a peanut skin prick test, peanut food challenge and have blood drawn for measurement
      of peanut immunoglobulin E (IgE). Based on the baseline oral food challenge, the participants
      will be advised to begin introducing peanut following the current practice guidelines.
      Participants will then be followed until 30 months of age with two clinic visits and regular
      monitoring of peanut consumption.
