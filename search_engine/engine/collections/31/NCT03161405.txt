      participants in order to evaluate the effect of the potent CYP3A4 inhibitor itraconazole on
      the single-dose PK of TAK-906 maleate.

      The study enrolled 12 participants. Participants received the following treatment sequence:

      â€¢ TAK-906 maleate 25 mg; Itraconazole 200 mg + TAK-906 maleate 25 mg

      Participants were given an oral dose of TAK-906 in the First Intervention Period which was
      followed by a washout period, after which participants were given Itraconazole solution along
      with TAK-906 orally in the Second Intervention Period.

      This single center trial was conducted in the United States. The overall duration to
      participate in this study was 7 weeks. Participants remained confined in the clinic from Day
