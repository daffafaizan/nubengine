      for laparoscopic myomectomy. All women will get the same preoperative and postoperative care.
      Women will be assigned by chance to one of two groups: one group will receive single-port
      laparoscopic myomectomy using V-Loc™ suture material (study group). The other group will
      receive conventional multi-port laparoscopic myomectomy using V-Loc™ suture material (control
      group). The investigators will collect information on suturing time and complications related
      to surgery.
