    
      Patients aged ≥18 years, fulfilling the 2010 ACR EULAR criteria for RA (symptom duration less
      than one year) & having moderate to severe disease activity (DAS28≥3.2) will be invited to
      participate. After providing written informed consent, eligible patients will be stratified
      into two groups. Block randomization will be done to generate random allocation sequence.

      Treatment Group I will be treated with Methotrexate (MTX) monotherapy and Treatment Group II
      will be treated with Methotrexate + Leflunomide (LEF) + Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) combination
      therapy. Concurrent treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in adequate dose and
      oral low dose Glucocorticoids (GC) (max: 15 mg/d) will be allowed during the study.

      DMARD dosages used are: MTX 25 mg/week orally (dosage after 6 weeks), LEF 20 mg/day (dosage
      after 2 weeks) and HCQ 400 mg/day. GCs will be given in an oral tapering scheme. All patients
      will be prescribed folic acid (10 mg/week) during MTX prescription.
