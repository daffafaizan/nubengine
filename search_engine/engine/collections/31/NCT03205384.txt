      patients undergoing urgent abdominal surgery. To provide a new tool that could be used in
      conjunction with clinical judgment to aid in decision-making.

      The second objective of our study was to assess the quality of life, frailty, functional
      status and nutritional status in elderly patients that survive six months after an urgent
      abdominal surgery.
