      The study will last 12 months. It's an observational cross-sectional study; patients are
      include during a scheduled review at the Cystic Fibrosis Resource and Competence Centre (CRCM
      de Lyon) and their participation lasts only one day. The inclusion period will last 12
      months.

      Expected results

      The expected results are:

        -  Identify the inter-relationships between nutritional profile and glucose tolerance in
           adult patients with cystic fibrosis

        -  Describe the body composition and consumption on resting energy of adults with cystic
           fibrosis

      The perspectives are:

        -  Propose nutritional and dietetic measures to limit the deterioration of the glucose
           tolerance in adult patients with cystic fibrosis

        -  Develop equations for evaluating consumption on resting energy specific to adult
           patients with cystic fibrosis in order to more specifically adapt the nutritional
           recommendations to each patient

      The research perspectives are to compare adult patients with cystic fibrosis followed in
      France and Quebec in terms of:

        -  nutritional profiles, nutritional quality index of food and eating behaviours, resting
           energy expenditure, body composition

        -  nutritional medical practices (dietary monitoring, recommendations given to patients,
           intake of pancreatic enzyme).
