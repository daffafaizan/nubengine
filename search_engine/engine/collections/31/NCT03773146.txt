      of three airtime incentive structures contingent on them completing the noncommunicable
      disease risk factor survey. This mobile phone survey was sent as an interactive voice
      response (IVR). In IVR surveys, participants use their touch tone key pad to answer
      pre-recorded questions. (i.e. if you are male, press 1; if you are female, press 2). This
      study is being conducted in both Bangladesh and Uganda.
