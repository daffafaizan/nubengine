      prehospital environment for suspected stroke. This will provide an estimate of how frequently
      stroke occurs in stroke and also the exposure risk to providers in this setting.

      Additionally, patients will have a headset placed to record their headpulse during the
      encounter. These measurements will be used to further develop an analytic model used to
      predict the presence of large vessel occlusion (LVO) stroke. This may help create a device
      that can be used in the prehospital environment to aid in the trade decision of destination
      hospital.
