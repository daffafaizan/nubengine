      be conducted in approximately 120 patients with hyperlipidemia in approximately 10 sites in
      US and China. Patients who satisfy the entry criteria at screening visit will have a 4-week
      Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes (TLC) diet control period during which all lipid-lowering
      medications will be discontinued. After the 4-week diet control period, eligible patients
      will be randomized to one of three treatment groups. The treatment period will last for
      12-weeks. Patients will have blood samples collected at 5 time points (screening, baseline,
      Week 4, Week 8, and Week 12).
