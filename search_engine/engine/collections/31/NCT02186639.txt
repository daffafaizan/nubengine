    
      This is an observational study comparing the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in exhaled
      breath between COPD patients and matched control subjects (age, gender, smoking-state). 40
      COPD patients (20 non-frequent, 20 frequent exacerbators) and 40 matched controls will be
      examined by SESI-MS on the composition of exhaled breath for identification of COPD specific
      markers.
