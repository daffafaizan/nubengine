      breathing neonates with RDS. Neonates will be evaluated according to the selection criteria
      and then randomized to surfactant treatment via LISA or standard administration procedure.
      The enrollment will be staggered: the gestational age will be restricted to 27+0 weeks up to
      28+6 weeks for the first 15 neonates. Provided no safety concerns are raised, the enrollment
      will then be extended to the whole population (i.e. 25+0 weeks up to 28+6 weeks). Enrolled
      neonates will be evaluated in a main phase of the trial until discharge or 40 wks
      post-menstrual age (PMA), whichever comes first. Their clinical status and neurodevelopment
      will be assessed at 24-month corrected age as a separate stand-alone visit.
