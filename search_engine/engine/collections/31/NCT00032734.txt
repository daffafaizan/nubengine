    
      This is a multicenter worldwide study with 32 participating men and women aimed to figure out
      whether SR121463B is safe and effective in correcting low levels of sodium in blood in
      subjects with SIADH. The participation in the study lasts up to 34 days. After screening,
      during the first part of the study (maximum 5 days), the subjects receive either capsules of
      SR121463B or a matching placebo. During the second part of the study (23 days), subjects
      receive either capsules of SR121463B or no treatment. The subjects will be assessed by
      physical examinations, electrocardiograms, blood samplings, and urine collections. Women of
      childbearing potential must have an approved method of contraception.
