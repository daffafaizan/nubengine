    
      This trial is a randomized, six-month study of medical marijuana (MM) on opioid use that
      will: (1) evaluate whether adults with CNCP on COT assigned to MM+POTS, compared with those
      assigned to WL+POTS, have greater reduction in opioid dose and/or pain severity, (2) assess
      whether participants assigned to MM+POTS, compared with those assigned to WL+POTS, have
      improved quality of life, improved pain interference, depression, and anxiety; and
      improvement in cognitive functioning, (3) evaluate whether those assigned to MM+POTS develop
      symptoms of CUD over the 24-week intervention, as well as at the 12-month time point.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to either an active MM arm (n = 125), or to a waitlist
      control arm (WLC) (n = 125). Participants will be assessed at baseline, every 4 weeks for 6
      months, and at a 12-month follow-up for opioid use, development of CUD, development of OUD,
      and neurocognitive performance. Urine collected at each visit will be assessed with
      quantitative assays.
