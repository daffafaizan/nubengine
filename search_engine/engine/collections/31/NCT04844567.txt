      treatment of the underlying pathophysiology, and results in physical, psychosocial disability
      for the patient. As observed for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV patients, a significant portion of
      COVID-19 patients present with persistent respiratory physiological impairment and refractory
      breathlessness that may not be addressed with conventional respiratory treatment such as
      oxygen, bronchodilators, diuretics or non-invasive ventilation.

      Previous research on respiration-related feedback in Virtual Reality (VR) has demonstrated
      strong and replicable effects of VR feedback over one's perceived sense of agency and control
      over one's virtually embodied respiration. Based on these studies, the VR intervention
      evaluated here aims to alleviate symptoms of perceived breathlessness.

      This within-subject study will compare breathing (dis-) comfort prior, during, and after a VR
      intervention that provides embodied visual feedback of participants' on-going respiration.
      Primary outcomes include subjective reports from participants (perceived efficacy,
      acceptability, and demand) and the intervention's clinical feasibility. Secondary outcomes
      include changes in respiration rate and variability as well as subjective ratings on
      perceived embodiment and sense of agency.
