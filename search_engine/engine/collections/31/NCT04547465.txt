      poor long-term prognosis. In addition to the cumulative dose of anthracycline and
      trastuzumab, cardiovascular risks have been proven to be the "second hit" when dealing with
      chemotherapy related cardiomyopathy in breast cancer patients. Speckle-tracking
      echocardiography have had robust evidence in diagnosis the early stage of left ventricular
      dysfunction in various types of cancer treated by cardiotoxicity drugs. However, data is
      still lacking regarding the role of speckle-tracking echocardiography in breast cancer
      patients with cardiovascular risk
