    
      This is an open label phase II study conducted in patients who have androgen-independent and
      castration-resistant prostate cancer but who have not received systemic chemotherapy.
      Investigational therapy such as vaccines, immunotherapy, and some oral targeted agents are
      NOT considered chemotherapy. Prior use of steroids is not an exclusion criterion.

      Patients who meet the inclusion criteria will be allowed to participate. Enrolled patients
      will receive single agent Torisel® at 25 mg weekly. Every 4 weeks of therapy will constitute
      one cycle of treatment. Patients will continue on therapy until voluntary withdrawal,
      toxicity, progression, or the investigator's discretion. Patients will be followed for 3
      years after discontinuation of Torisel®.

      Patients are allowed to receive intravenous or oral bisphosphonates for their bone metastases
      and are advised to continue androgen blockade while on study.
