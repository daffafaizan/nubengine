      aggressive analgesic therapy in the early postoperative period. The use of thoracic
      paravertebral block is an effective analgesic approach for post-thoracotomy pain. Several
      local anesthetic adjuvants have been reported to extend the duration of paravertebral block.

      Alpha-2 agonists including dexmedetomidine appear to be the most effective in this context.
      The study will include an intervention group which will receive a combination of 20 ml
      bupivacaine 0.5% and dexmedetomidine 0.5 ml (50 microgram). The control group will receive 20
      ml bupivacaine 0.5% plus 0.5 ml normal saline perineurally. Thoracic paravertebral catheter
      will be inserted preoperatively. Visual analogue pain score will be assessed at different
      intervals.
