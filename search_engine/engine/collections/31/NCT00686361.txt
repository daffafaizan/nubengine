    
      This is a prospective study involving 34 children attending an outpatient clinic for children
      with CF. After enrollment, subjects will be followed for 9 months with each child serving as
      their own control in a repeated measures design.

      Chart data, height, weight, pulmonary function, dietary intake and a venous blood and urine
      sample will be collected at enrollment then every 3 months for 9 months. Choline
      supplementation will be from enrollment for 6 months, with follow up at 3 months post
      supplementation. To avoid additional hospital visits and blood draws, and to co-ordinate with
      pulmonary function, hematology, clinical chemistry tests as part of clinical care, each
      subject will be seen at routine scheduled clinic appointments, which are every 3 months.

      The objectives are to

        1. determine if supplementation with choline for 6 months corrects biochemical markers of
           choline deficiency and improves indices of reduced methylation capacity (including
           methionine, SAM, SAM/SAH) and redox status (GSH/GSSG) based on measures of blood and
           urine

        2. determine whether or not choline supplementation decreases plasma pro-inflammatory
           mediators

        3. determine if choline supplementation improves the low n-6 and n-3 fatty acids levels in
           children with CF,

        4. explore if choline supplementation has the potential to have clinical relevance in
           reducing recurrent inflammation, and improve pulmonary function and/or reduce liver
           disease.
