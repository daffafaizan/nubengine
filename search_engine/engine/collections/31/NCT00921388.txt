      quit smoking substantially reduce the risk of premature death. A multi-modal approach to
      smoking cessation with combined behavioral and pharmacological interventions generally yields
      the highest success rates. The majority of subjects who are able to achieve abstinence return
      to smoking. Smoking relapse rates are 50-80% within one year with the majority of smokers
      relapsing within the first 3 months. Interventions are needed to both enhance smoking
      cessation rates and prevent relapse rates in order to substantially impact long-term quit
      rates.We intend to compare the effectiveness of a smoking cessation program combined with a
      moderate exercise program to an identical smoking cessation program combined with a
      relaxation-meditation control condition.

      In a substudy, we will also evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention in premenopausal
      women (N=40)
