      diarrhea after returning home. In many cases repeated stool samples are negative for
      bacteria, parasites and helminthes and the cause of the diarrhea is not found.

      The main debate is whether this condition is a persistent parasitic infection (unidentified)
      or post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome.However, clinical experience suggests that some
      of these travelers respond to antiparasitic therapy.

      This study aims to answer the question whether antiparasitic treatment in these cases is
      beneficial.
