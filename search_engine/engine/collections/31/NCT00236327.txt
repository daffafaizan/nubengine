      open-label study of the efficacy and safety of self-administered fentanyl skin patches for
      cancer pain control in patients in the home-care setting not previously using morphine. The
      first 15 days of the study are for dose stabilization and the rest of the study assesses pain
      control and quality of life at stable doses of medication. The dose is determined by the
      patient with oversight by the investigator, and rescue oral morphine medication can be used
      when necessary. The patient records all medication use in a diary and fills out
      questionnaires concerning pain control, intestinal function (constipation) and overall
      quality of life. The hypothesis is that patients will be able to control their cancer pain by
      self-administering transdermal fentanyl at home and that they will well tolerate the
      medication.

      Individualized doses, with a target dose of 25 to 100 micrograms per hour of fentanyl for 56
      days via skin patches applied every 3 days to deliver 25 to 100 micrograms of fentanyl per
      hour per patch; oral morphine as rescue medication for pain.
