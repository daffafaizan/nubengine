      presents more frequently both low cardiac output syndrome and systemic inflammatory response,
      what results in prolonged stay in intensive care unit (ICU), and higher mortality rates when
      compared to patients with normal ventricular function.

      The early prediction of prolonged ICU stay through the detection of tissue hypoperfusion may
      improve the management of care and decrease morbidity of this particular group of patients.
      However, classic markers of tissue hypoxia as central venous saturation, base excess, lactate
      may not be predictors of outcome in cardiac surgery patients with left ventricular
      dysfunction.

      The question addressed in this study is if less employed markers of tissue hypoperfusion as
      as venoarterial carbon dioxide partial pressure difference (Î”PCO2) and estimated respiratory
      quotient (eRQ) have predictive value of prolonged ICU stay in patients with left ventricular
      dysfunction submitted to coronary artery bypass surgery.
