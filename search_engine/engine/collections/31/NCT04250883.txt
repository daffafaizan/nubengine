      surgery affects the surrounding organs with ischemia-reperfusion injury and a systemic immune
      response. This effect is related to postoperative recovery, pain scores, opioid consumption,
      bowel function recovery, morbidity and possibly mortality. Therefore, low impact laparoscopy,
      meaning low pressure PNP facilitated by deep NMB, could be a valuable addition to Enhanced
      Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) Protocols.

      The use of low pressure PNP may also reduce hypoxic injury and the release of DAMPs and
      thereby contributing to a better preservation of innate immune function which may help to
      reduce the risk of infectious complications.

      The participants will be randomly assigned to the experimental group 1: low impact
      laparoscopy (low pressure (8 mmHg) and deep NMB (PTC 1-2)); 8 mmHg IAP after trocar
      introduction for perfusion measurement or the experimental group 2: low impact laparoscopy
      (low pressure (8 mmHg) and deep NMB (PTC 1-2)); 12 mmHg IAP after trocar introduction for
      perfusion measurement, or control group 1: standard laparoscopy (standard pressure (12 mmHg)
      and moderate NMB (TOF 1-2)); 8 mmHg IAP after trocar introduction for perfusion measurement,
      or control group 2: standard laparoscopy (standard pressure (12 mmHg) and moderate NMB (TOF
      1-2)); 12 mmHg IAP after trocar introduction for perfusion measurement.

      ICG injection will take place with starting pressure to quantify parietal peritoneum
      perfusion, and a parietal peritoneal biopsy will be taken. At the end of surgery, a second
      parietal peritoneum biopsy will be taken.

      NB: After introduction of the camera trocar, insufflation of carbon dioxide is titrated to an
      IAP of 8mmHg in group A and C, and 14 mmHg in group B and D. After placement of the last
      trocar the injection of ICG and video registration of peritoneum will take place, and a
      peritoneal biopsy will be taken. There after surgery will take place with an IAP of 14mmHg in
      the control groups (C and D), and an IAP of 8mmHg in the experimental groups (A and B). In
      the control groups (C and D)

      Pre- and postoperative a few questionnaires will be taken and blood withdrawals to evaluate
      the quality of recovery, and the immune response.
