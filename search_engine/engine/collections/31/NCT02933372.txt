      (PD), it is necessary to study key pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic features of α4β2* nAChR in
      the context of the PD brain with loss of nerve cells that produce the neurotransmitter
      acetylcholine, a pathologic environment in which they may exhibit unique features. This
      personalized medicine approach focuses our studies on the subgroup of PD subjects with loss
      of nerve cells that produce the neurotransmitter acetylcholine identified by Project II and
      the Clinical Resource Core. The investigators will assess α4β2* nAChR features using PET
      imaging with the α4β2* nAChR ligand [18 - Fluorine] flubatine, subacute administration of the
      α4β2* nAChR partial agonist Varenicline (VCN), and laboratory measures of gait, balance, and
      attention. The investigators will use [18 - Fluorine] flubatine PET to assess VCN occupancy
      of brain α4β2* nAChRs (experiments 1 & 2). VCN will be administered to both PD participants
      (experiment 1) and healthy controls (experiment 2) and both populations will undergo a
      flubatine PET scan to assess VCN occupancy. Using this PET data to select an appropriate VCN
      dose, the investigators will perform a pharmacodynamic study (experiment 3) with subacute VCN
      administration to determine if α4β2* nAChR stimulation improves laboratory measures of gait
      function, postural control, and attentional function in PD subjects with loss of nerve cells
      that produce the neurotransmitter acetylcholine.
