      employs group and individual sessions of education, peer interaction, engagement in
      meaningful occupations, and self-reflections to help individuals understand the importance of
      community participation and its relationship to well-being. Program outcomes explored include
      increased confidence in community mobility, increased autonomy outdoors, social life and
      relationships, frequency of community trips, and decreased social isolation.
