      the cell therapy lab this blood is harvested and mononuclear cells are separated.This
      procedure takes roughly 4 hours.After dilution the mononuclear cells are injected into the
      cardiac muscles with fibroses area through 20 shots.This procedure is indicated for patients
      with cardiac ischemia and left ventricular dysfunction(desynchrony), on whom all the others
      known therapies have failed.
