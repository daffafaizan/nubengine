    
      The purpose of this two-part study is to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of
      multiple intra-articular (i.a.) injections of LNA043 in regenerating the articular surface in
      patients with cartilage lesions of the knee (Part A) and knee osteoarthritis (Part B). In
      Part A, this study aims to establish Proof of Concept (PoC), namely regeneration of the
      articular cartilage, in order to provide information on the potential clinical utility of
      LNA043, with the ultimate goal of replacing current surgical procedures for cartilage repair
      with an injectable, less invasive regenerative therapy. In Part B, this study aims at further
      evaluating the cartilage anabolic activity of LNA043 in a more severe knee OA population, and
      at testing the potential benefit of a higher dose of LNA043 administered i.a. monthly instead
      of weekly.
