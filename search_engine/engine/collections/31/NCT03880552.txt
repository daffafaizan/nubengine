      study and genital hiatus and perineal body measurements were taken.

      The presence and degree of perineal laceration after birth were determined. Correlation of
      genital hiatus and perineal body measurements with perineal laceration risk were evaluated.

      After birth, vaginal laceration, oxytocin use, fetal birth weight, the presence of episiotomy
      were recorded.
