      ex-vivo expanded γ9δ2 T-cells in patients with relapsed acute leukemia or myelodysplastic
      syndrome after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Γ9δ2 T-cells will be
      separated from peripheral blood of suitable donors. After expansion in vitro, they will be
      infused to the patients as an immunotherapy treatment.
