      responses in blood and liver biopsies of patients with anti-SLA/LP or anti-LKM-positive
      autoimmune hepatitis. The results will provide insight into the pathogenesis of autoimmune
      hepatitis and the monitoring of auto antigen-specific T cell reactivity in correlation to
      disease exacerbation and therapy.
