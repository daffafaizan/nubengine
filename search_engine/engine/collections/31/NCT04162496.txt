    
      This will be a prospective, evaluator-blinded, split--neck, clinical study in which patients
      will be randomized to 2 groups.

      The first group will receive up to 1cc of Restylane Refyne into the rhytides on the right
      side of the neck utilizing a 27---gauge cannula, while the left side will be injected with a
      sharp 30--gauge needle.

      The second group will be reversed with the left side treated with Restylane Refyne utilizing
      a cannula and the right side treated with a sharp needle.

      Both groups will be utilizing the same safety and comfort protocols established by the
      practice which include the use of topical numbing cream (B.L.T.), cleansing with alcohol, and
      a cold ice pack at the site of injection after the procedure.

      Before and after the procedure a set of blinded evaluators will be grading the subjects'
      static horizontal neck lines using a validated 5--point grading scale. The blinded evaluators
      will also be grading the subjects side effects such as bruising and swelling 24---48 hours
      after the first treatment. A second treatment is allowed on Day 30 for those who have not
      achieved optimal correction. Either on Day 30 or Day 60, a final assessment with digital
      photography using Canfield's Vectra imaging system, along with a patient questionnaire on
      satisfaction, improvement (GAIS), side effects, and pain levels during and after the
      procedure will also be recorded.
