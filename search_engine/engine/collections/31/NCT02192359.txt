    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To define the recommended phase II doses (RP2D) of intracranially administered
      carboxylesterase-expressing allogeneic neural stem cells (hCE1m6-NSCs) in combination with
      intravenous irinotecan in patients with recurrent high grade glioma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the relationship between hCE1m6-NSC dose and liposomal SN-38 (SN-38)
      concentrations in brain interstitium.

      II. To characterize the relationship between intracerebral and systemic concentrations of
      irinotecan (irinotecan hydrochloride) and SN-38.

      III. To investigate the biologic activity of hCE1m6 NSCs by comparing SN-38 concentrations in
      the brain after treatment with hCE1m6-NSCs and irinotecan versus irinotecan alone.

      IV. To assess for possible development of adenovirally transduced neural stem cell (NSC)
      immunogenicity after first exposure and with repeat doses of NSCs.

      V. To describe the clinical benefit (defined as stable disease, partial response, or complete
      response) in patients who receive treatment with repeat cycles of NSCs and irinotecan.

      VI. To determine, at time of autopsy, the fate of the NSCs.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of carboxylesterase-expressing allogeneic neural
      stem cells.

      Patients receive carboxylesterase-expressing allogeneic neural stem cells intracranially over
      1.5-4.5 hours on days 1 and 15 (day 1 only for patients at dose level 1) and irinotecan
      hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes on days 3 and 17. Cycles repeat every 28
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, 3 and 6 months, and
      then annually thereafter for a minimum of 15 years.
