      reconstruction. The inadequate quadriceps strength contributes to altered gait patterns
      following ACL reconstruction. Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) has been shown to
      reduce quadriceps atrophy post-ACL reconstruction. However, the effect of functional
      electrical stimulation (FES), a modulation of NMES which enables quadriceps stimulation
      synchronized with gait, has not been tested.

      Objective: The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of FES to improve the gait
      pattern of patients post ACL reconstruction.

      Methods: Fifty six Individuals post-ACL reconstruction will be randomly placed into FES or
      NMES treatment group. All patients will receive a standard exercise program three sessions
      weekly. In addition, each group will receive a different electrical stimulation treatment:
      Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation (NMES) or Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES).
      Outcome measures will include spatiotemporal gait measures (e.g., gait speed, single limb
      support, and asymmetry index), as well as isometric quadriceps strength. Measures will be
      taken a week before the surgery, a week after it, and one month from the beginning of
      rehabilitation. Strength and gait pattern will be measured. Isometric Quadriceps strength
      will measured using the Biodex isokinetic system, and gait analysis will be carried out
      through the spatio-temporal Optogait system.
