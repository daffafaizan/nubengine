    
      This is a three arms trial that investigates Temsirolimus (Torisel™) in combination with
      three chemotherapy regimens (R-CHOP, R-FC or R-DHA).

      Primary Objective:

      - To assess the feasibility of these three chemotherapy regimens in combination with
      Temsirolimus (Torisel™) and to assess the incidence of dose limiting toxicities (DLT) during
      the two first cycles of Temsirolimus (Torisel™) in combination with three chemotherapy
      regimens in order to determine the maximal tolerate dose (MTD) in a dose escalating study
      design in a population of patients in relapsed/refractory Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL).

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To assess the safety of the association Temsirolimus with the three chemotherapy
           regimens,

        -  To determine the efficacy of the association of Temsirolimus (Torisel™) and these three
           chemotherapy regimens after 4 cycles and after 6 cycles at the end of treatment:
           response rate and complete response rate (CR), progression-free survival (PFS), response
           duration (RD) and overall survival (OS).

      All subjects who received at least one dose of Temsirolimus (Torisel™) will be considered
      evaluable and will be included in the safety analysis.
