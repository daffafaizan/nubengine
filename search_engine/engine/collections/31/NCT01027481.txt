    
      To investigate the response of retinal vessel diameters to lucentis treatment in patients
      with BRVO and to correlate these changes with changes in functional outcome after 3 months.

      Pilot study in patients scheduled for intravitreal anti-VEGF (Lucentis™) treatment with BRVO

      30 patients with BRVO scheduled for intravitreal anti-VEGF treatment Intravitreous
      administration of Ranibizumab (Lucentis ™)

      Main outcome measure: Retinal vessel diameters

      Secondary outcome measures: Retrobulbar flow velocities, best-corrected visual acuity,
      macular sensitivity assessed with Microperimetry, objective functional response assessed with
      mfERG, anatomic changes in the macula region as assessed with StratusOCT and prototype of a
      Cirrus-OCT(which is available at the Department of Ophthalmology, Medical University of
      Vienna), angiographical outcomes.
