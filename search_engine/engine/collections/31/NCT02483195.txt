      outlined below, and will take the assigned treatment for a total duration of 12 months.
      Medications will be dispensed by a nurse who is blinded to the participants within each
      treatment group. Global photograph assessment and participant questionnaires at 0, 4, 8 and
      12 months will be the primary means to determine improvement in hair loss.
