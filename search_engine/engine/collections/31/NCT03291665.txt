      stretched and relaxed positions of the most symptomatic heel in patients with plantar
      fasciopathy using ultrasonography.

      In addition to this, we will compare measurements of the thickness of the plantar fascia in
      sagittal versus transversal transducer positions, compare pressure pain thresholds at the
      most tender spot of the plantar fascia in stretched and relaxed position using pressure
      algometry and investigate the association between the thickness of the plantar fascia and the
      pressure pain threshold. All measurements are performed bilaterally starting with the most
      symptomatic foot.

      To compare thickness and pressure pain thresholds in stretched and relaxed positions of the
      plantar fascia paired-t-tests are used. To compare the most and least symptomatic sides
      paired-t-tests will be used.

      The association between the thickness of the plantar fascia and pressure pain threshold will
      be investigated using the Pearson's correlation coefficient.
