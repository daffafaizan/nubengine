      population. Surgical removal of the thymus can be performed through several approaches.
      Comparison of the most commonly used surgical techniques through randomized control trials
      with long-term follow-up is scarce.

      Objective: To comparatively analyze long-term results and complications of transcervical
      (TCT) and transsternal thymectomy (TST) in a randomized controlled trial with a mean
      follow-up of ten years.

      Results: A total of 100 patients were randomized to transsternal thymectomy (50), and
      transcervical procedure (50). There were not significant differences in the demographic
      characteristics, MGFA clinical classification, and MGFA therapy status between groups before
      surgery. Twenty patients were lost of follow up during the first year and were excluded. Our
      final group included 40 patients in each group. Three patients in TCT group (7.5%) and 6
      patients in the TST group (15%) developed surgical complications. At 1 year of follow-up, 7
      patients (17.5%) of the TCT group were asymptomatic in comparison with 15 patients (37.5%) of
      group TST, after 10 years of follow-up, 26 cases (72.9%) in group TCT were asymptomatic in
      comparison with 29 cases (80.5%) of group TST. Outcomes 10 years after surgery by MGFA
      post-intervention status showed that complete stable remission was achieved in 8 (21.6%)
      patients of the TCT group, and in 20 patients (55.5%) of the TST group.

      Conclusions: Transcervical and transsternal thymectomy are safe and result in significant
      improvement of patients with Myasthenia Gravis. TST has superior results in terms of complete
      stable remission at 10 years.
