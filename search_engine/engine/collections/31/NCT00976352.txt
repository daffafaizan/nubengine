      normal copies of the GAA gene are inserted into cells. In this study, a modified virus,
      adeno-associated virus (AAV), has been engineered to carry a normal copy of the GAA gene,
      known as rAAV1-CMV-hGAA, which is used to place normal copies of the GAA gene into diaphragm
      muscle cells. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of rAAV1-CMV-hGAA delivery
      into individuals with GAA deficiency (Pompe Disease).

      Participants currently using enzyme replacement therapy will continue to receive their
      regular medical regimen during the 12 month duration of the study. Participants will first
      attend a screening study visit to confirm study eligibility. Participants will then attend a
      3-5 day inpatient visit, during which they will receive a series of intradiaphragmatic
      injections consisting of the study agent (rAAV1-CMV-hGAA). Follow-up study visits will occur
      on Days 14, 90, 180, 270 and 365. Participants will have yearly follow-up evaluations by
      either telephone or mail for a total of 15 years, or as required by the FDA and other
      regulatory agencies.
