      with SGLT2i are not yet known: osmotic diuresis and natriuresis, direct effects of weight
      reduction, increased in nitric oxide release, oxidative stress reduction, local
      renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibition are the supposed mechanism. In the
      Literature the diuretic effect of SGLT2i therapy seems to be even stronger than thiazide or
      thiazide-like drugs. However, it is not defined the role of SGLT2i on antidiuretic function
      (RAAS, brain natriuretic peptide-BNP and antidiuretic hormone-ADH). Defining this relation
      could be important for:

        -  knowing effect of SGLT2i on RAAS (drugs interferences are important particularly during
           case detection of primary aldosteronism);

        -  discovering antidiuretic response to SGLT2i treatment and interactions between RAAS, BNP
           and ADH on the volume improvement induced by this new antidiabetic drugs.

      In addition the aim of the study is to define effect of treatment on blood pressure and body
      composition.
