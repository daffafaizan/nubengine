    
      Parkinson disease (PD) is an age related neurodegenerative disorder with symptomatic declines
      in motor function due to a loss of dopaminergic neurons within the basal ganglia.

      Ironically, treatment with exogenous dopamine-replacement medication (e.g. levodopa) may have
      positive effects on existing motor skills such as handwriting or walking, but may have
      detrimental effects on the learning of motor skills necessary for effective rehabilitation.

      Although dopamine medications are routinely prescribed to replace lost dopamine in the
      sensorimotor areas of the striatum, they may actually be "overdosing" the associative
      striatum, a candidate neuroanatomical correlate for motor learning. To date, however, this
      'overdose' hypothesis has not been widely tested, given that few studies of motor learning in
      PD have reported or controlled for whether individuals were tested "on" or "off" their
      dopamine replacement medication.
