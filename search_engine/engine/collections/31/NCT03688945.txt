      I. Investigate through evidence-based randomized controlled trial the effect of exposure to
      art during the perioperative period on the outcome of surgical outcomes II. Assess patient
      response to artwork and investigate the correlation of patient response with the clinical
      outcomes of the patients.

      III. Measure cognitive changes that may occur for patients based on art exposure.
