      made more challenging for anesthesiologists on labor and delivery units to administer
      epidural analgesia. According to the World Health Organization, more than 30% of U.S. adults
      are obese with a body mass index (BMI; in kg/m2) â‰¥ 30. Recent data has shown that increased
      BMI has been associated with increased neuraxial analgesic failure and difficulty with
      prolonged epidural placement time.

      The 'Blind approach' is the current standard of care in administering neuraxial anesthesia.
      The physician palpates the patient's spinal bony landmarks; the needle is placed in relation
      to identified landmarks and inserted until loss of resistance is felt. In the obese
      population, the success rates are as low as 68%. Recently the FDA has approved a handheld
      device "The Accuro" as an adjunct for neuraxial analgesia (Rivanna Medical, LLC). It consists
      of a three-dimensional ultrasound device. By utilizing sound waves it constructs
      three-dimensional images of the spinal column, allowing the physician to better see the spine
      in order to perform spinal/epidural anesthesia.

      Hypothesize that this device will enable clinicians to assess epidural spaces for epidural
      needle placement compared with the traditional Blind approach in the morbidly obese
      parturient.

      This study will be a randomized control study, with the objective to evaluate epidural
      analgesia success rates between the two methods (Blind Approach versus Accuro Device). Also,
      will determine if ultrasound based landmarks would reduce the needle tract and thereby
      reduced the amount of post-procedure pain at the insertion site in the peripartum period by
      using the algometer.
