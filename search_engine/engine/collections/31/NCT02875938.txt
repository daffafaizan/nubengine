      and propose a first step, in the form of a single-subject research design, to determine the
      most effective and efficient method for application to the rehabilitation of patients with
      aphasia. A single-subject adapted alternating treatment design will be used to compare two
      music conditions, using music with sung lyrics simultaneously with silent reading of the
      lyrics, and priming with music and sung lyrics followed by reading of the lyrics, with a
      control condition using reading materials without music. Risks are expected to be minimal.
      The risk is confidentiality. Risk management procedures in this study include: assuring
      confidentiality of participants, assuring qualified personnel, assuring convenient location,
      ensuring adequate enrollment, continual monitoring, addressing potential conflicts of
      interest, and making a plan to manage problems. Continual monitoring will be used to assess
      whether study interventions appear to be interfering with normal speech therapy treatment. If
      the researcher sees any signs of interference, the subject will be withdrawn from the
      research and study interventions will be stopped.
