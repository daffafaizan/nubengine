      thickness, and the conventional peripheral BP does not seem to be an accurate reflection of
      central arterial BP. The pulse pressure amplification between peripheral and central arteries
      reflects the left ventricular afterload, subendothelial viability, and the intensity of
      cyclic stress imposed to the renal and cerebral micro- and macro vessels. As central
      hemodynamic parameters are independently associated with organ damage and are closely related
      to important cardiovascular outcome, it is suggested that the new clinical trials on
      antihypertensive drug treatment should compare simultaneously the chronic effect of drugs on
      both peripheral and central BP.

      OBJECTIVES

      Primary objective:

        -  To assess the effect of bisoprolol versus atenolol on the aortic pulse pressure as a
           central hemodynamic index in subjects with hypertension

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To assess the effect of bisoprolol versus atenolol on the aortic BP as a central
           hemodynamic index in subjects with hypertension

        -  To assess the effect of bisoprolol versus atenolol on the AIx and cfPWV as arterial
           stiffness indexes in subjects with hypertension

        -  To assess the effect of bisoprolol versus atenolol on the aortic pulse pressure as a
           central hemodynamic index at interim visit (Visit 4)

        -  To assess the effect of bisoprolol versus atenolol on the lipid profile and serum
           glucose as metabolism indexes

        -  To assess the effect of bisoprolol versus atenolol on the brachial BP as a peripheral BP
           index in subjects with hypertension

        -  To assess the safety and tolerability of bisoprolol versus atenolol in subjects with
           hypertension

      The present study will be approximately of 14 weeks duration comprising of 1 week screening,
      followed by a 12 weeks treatment period and a 2 weeks post study follow up contact conducted
      via telephone to monitor additional serious adverse experiences.

      There will be 4 scheduled visits (at Day -7, Day 0, Week 4 and Week 12). After screening
      period in which eligibility criteria were confirmed, subjects with hypertension will be
      randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive treatment with either bisoprolol or atenolol.
      Hemodynamic measurements will be made at baseline, Week 4, Week 12 and biochemical
      measurements will be made at baseline (Day 0) and at Week 12.
