    
      Purpose/Objectives: To investigate the effect of dapagliflozin, an SGLT2 inhibitor on hepatic
      glucose production and the role of autonomic nervous system in mediating the increase in
      hepatic glucose production in response glucosuria Research Design/Plan: the role of autonomic
      nervous system in the increase in hepatic glucose production caused by dapagliflozin will be
      examined with norepinephrine (NE) turnover in two protocols. The first protocol is cross
      sectional, in which 36 T2DM patients will receive hepatic glucose production (HGP) and NE
      turnover will be measured before and after dapagliflozin or placebo administration. In
      protocol 2, diabetic and non-diabetic subjects will receive baseline HGP, NE turnover,
      hepatic glucose uptake (HGU) and liver fat measurement before at 2 days after the start and
      12 weeks after dapagliflozin or placebo treatment.

      Methods: the following techniques will be employed (1) Measurement of hepatic glucose
      production with 3H-glucose infusion, with and without glucose clamp, (2) substrate oxidation
      with indirect calorimetry and plasma ketone/lactate/insulin/glucagon concentrations; (3)
      Measurement of HGU with Oral-IV double tracer infusion; (4) Measurement of whole body
      norepinephrine turnover with 3H-norepinephrine infusion; (5) Measurement of heart rate
      variability; (6) Measurement of liver fat content with 1H-MRS Clinical Relevance: The results
      of the present studies will help identify the mechanism responsible for the increase in HGP
      caused by dapagliflozin and the increase in ketone production. The first action of the drug
      ameliorates its clinical efficacy while the second increases the risk of adverse events
      (ketoacidosis). Identifying the mechanisms underlying these actions will help developing
      therapeutic strategies which increase the drug clinical efficacy and mitigates its adverse
      events.
