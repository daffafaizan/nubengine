      type and amount of carbohydrates it contains, as the rate at which the carbohydrates is
      digested and released into the bloodstream is influenced by many factors such as the food's
      physical form, its fat, protein and fibre content, and the chemical structure of its
      carbohydrates. For these reasons, it is possible to produce food from the same group with
      different effects on blood glucose. Consumption of low GI food has shown to improve glycemic
      control, lipid profile and reduce systemic inflammation. However, there are few dietary
      intervention studies attempting to change the GI of food by changing the staple
      carbohydrates. In this study, microfluidics was applied in the creation of low-GI food gel
      made from non-traditional ingredients like alginate and soy protein isolate. This method is
      previously tested to produce lower glycaemic response than normal noodle and pasta. With
      noodles being one of the staples to many Singaporeans, food gels formed using functional
      ingredients derived from food sources offer a lower GI alternative to the conventional noodle
      and pasta without affecting the people dietary preference.
