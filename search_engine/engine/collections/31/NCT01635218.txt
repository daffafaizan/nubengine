      depression is one of the most disabling medical conditions worldwide. At present, it is
      becoming more difficult to prove that antidepressants actually work better than placebo in
      clinical trials.Use of homeopathy to treat depression is widespread, but there is a lack of
      clinical trails about its efficacy in depression in peri- and postmenopausal women. Previous
      trials suggest that individualized homeopathic treatments improve depression in general
      population. The purpose of this study was to determine whether individualized homeopathic
      treatment and fluoxetine are more efficient than placebo for moderate depression in peri- and
      postmenopausal women.
