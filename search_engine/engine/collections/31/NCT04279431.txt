      core technology) and other multimodal assessment capabilities in a portable, point-of-care,
      non-invasive device containing algorithms designed to improve early identification, staging,
      and optimization of treatment for head injured patients (GCS 13-15) who are suspected of a
      brain injury. Structural Injury Classifier (SIC) provides objective results that indicate the
      likelihood of a structural brain injury being present, potentially visible on CT Scan. Brain
      Function Index (BFI) provides an objective measurement to determine the likelihood and
      severity of brain function impairment such as that seen in concussion/mTBI. The BFI is
      presented as a percentile compared to a normal corresponding population. Lastly, the
      Concussion Index (CI) was derived in the most recent BrainScope concussion assessment
      clinical study, and it is defined as a multivariate, multimodal index to assess the presence
      and severity of concussion and has been demonstrated to reliably reflect change over time.

      The present study population targets those patients who sustained a head injury, have high
      GCS scores (14-15) and present mild symptoms, for whom the suspicion of structural brain
      injury is therefore low. Having a rapid, reliable, and sensitive assessment tool to aid in
      the triage of patients who are suspected of a traumatically induced structural brain injury
      could aid in appropriate and timely diagnosis and subsequent medical care. It may also result
      in more appropriate utilization of medical imaging (potentially having associated health
      risks) and reductions in hospitalizations. Patients discharged from the ED who were deemed to
      not require a CT scan will be followed-up for outcome.
