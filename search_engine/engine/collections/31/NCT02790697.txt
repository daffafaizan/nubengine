      patient breath gas to measure the amount (volume) of oxygen consumption (VO2) and CO2
      production (VCO2). Energy expenditure is calculated by the Weir's equation using the measured
      VO2 and VCO2 values.

      The new calorimeter is equipped with a disposable in-line pneumotach flowmeter, which
      measures the flow of exhaled gas of patients directly within the mechanical ventilator
      circuit. It also samples small amount of inhaled and exhaled gas to measure the inhaled and
      exhaled O2 and CO2 compositions. The new dynamic micro-mixing chamber technique is used to
      meaure VO2 and VCO2 to derive the energy expenditure.

      The mass spectrometer measures the inhaled and exhaled gas compositions. The mass
      spectrometer samples inhaled gas from the mechanical ventilator circuit. A mixing chamber
      system is used to collect the expired gas from the outlet of the mechanical ventilator. The
      collected gas is measured for the second time after diluting with a constant flow of ambient
      air, which is monitored by an independent mass flow meter. The volume of the expired gas is
      calculated by comparison of the concentrations of exhaled gas before and after the dilution.
      The measurements will be used to calculate the VO2 and VCO2 to derive the energy expenditure.
