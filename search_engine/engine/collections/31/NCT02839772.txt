      20 countries in the world. In Ethiopia least 3 million people are affected with 17 million at
      risk. Irritant minerals (smectite, mica and quartz) from volcanic soil and pathogens enter
      skin breaches in the feet causing inflammation, lymphoedema and hyperkeratosis. Podoconiosis
      is preventable and treatable but is not curable. Current treatment consists of educating
      those with disease on its causes, prevention and treatment. Treatment taught in the Action on
      Podoconiosis (APA) Clinics consists of a daily hygiene regimen of washing the feet/legs with
      soap, soaking the feet and legs in water with sodium hypochlorite (NaOCI) (0.0125%) added as
      a disinfectant, air drying and the application of a thin layer of petrolatum jelly.
      Whitfields ointment (benzoic acid and salicylic acid) is applied to any fungal infections.
      Wearing shoes is encouraged but this does not offer complete protection against the alkaline
      soil.

      Although the current treatment skin care regimen is effective there is no robust evidence on
      optimal skin care regimens to improve skin barrier function in this disease.

      Objective. To evaluate the effectiveness of a new, low-cost, evidence-based skin care
      intervention to improve SBF in the lower limbs of those with podoconiosis.

      Method. A randomized control trial (RCT) was conducted over 3 months in two APA Clinics
      (n=193). Intervention was 2% glycerine (v/v) added to a reduced amount of soaking water (1
      litre versus 6 litres). The control group received the current skin care regimen. The primary
      outcome measure was skin barrier function (SBF). This was determined by measures of
      trans-epidermal water loss (TEWL) and stratum corneum hydration (SCH) at four specific sites
      on the lower limbs.
