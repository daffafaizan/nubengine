      collecting outcome measures. Each site will randomly switch over to Enhanced Usual Care (best
      practice implementation) where all physical therapists at the site will be educated on
      delivery of best practice for locomotor retraining. The specific therapy activities are at
      the discretion of the physical therapist; however, physical therapists must work towards
      thirty minutes of weight-bearing/stepping activity at greater than forty percent heart rate
      reserve. Participants will continue to be consented to collecting outcome measures.
      Additionally, participants will be given and trained to use activity watches to monitor their
      own progress.
