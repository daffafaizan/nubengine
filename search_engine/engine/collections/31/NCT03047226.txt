    
      1. Detect microsatellite instability (by next-generation sequencing and PCR capillary
           electrophoresis) and germline mutation (by next-generation sequencing) in probands.

        2. Analyze the test outcome with clinical and family information to evaluate the germline
           mutation status preliminarily: likely pathogenic germline mutation, variant of uncertain
           significance, non-pathogenic germline mutation.

        3. Verify the germline mutation in blood relatives whose proband has known likely
           pathogenic germline mutation or variant of uncertain significance.

        4. Diagnose pathogenic germline mutation and non-pathogenic germline mutation based on
           clinical characteristics, family information and germline mutation test outcomes
           (including the outcomes of probands and blood relatives). Diagnose Lynch syndrome and
           the pathogenic germline mutation carriers in the included population.

        5. Analyze the specificity and the sensitivity of detecting microsatellite instability
           (MSI) by next-generation sequencing; and analyze the consistency between IHC and MSI.

        6. Analyze the clinical characteristics and germline mutation of Lynch syndrome in Chinese
           population.
