    
      This is a Phase III, open-label, randomized, controlled, international study. Approximately
      360 patients < 82 years of age with MDS classified as RAEB-1, RAEB-2, or RAEB-t who received
      AZA or DAC for ≤ 9 months and/or ≤ 9 cycles over 12 months and had their last dose of AZA or
      DAC within 6 months prior to screening will be stratified by:

        -  Very high risk (VHR) vs non-VHR per IPSS-R, and

        -  Geographic region (North America vs Europe vs Asia; because approved products and
           standard of care may vary by region), and randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to one of the
           following 2 treatment groups:

        -  Rigosertib 1800 mg/24 hr administered as a 72 hr CIV infusion on Days 1, 2, and 3 of a 2
           week cycle for the first 8 cycles, and on Days 1, 2, and 3 of a 4-week cycle thereafter
           (N = approximately 240 patients);

        -  Physician's Choice of alternative treatment, which may include any approved or
           standard-of-care therapy that the patient has not shown to be hypersensitive to, based
           on frequently used treatment for MDS, as per institutional guidelines, after receipt of
           HMAs (N = approximately 120 patients). The drugs used in the Physician's Choice arm
           should be used according to the recommendations, if clinically appropriate, provided in
           the corresponding Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and Prescribing Information
           of these drugs. Experimental therapies are not allowed on the PC arm.

      Patients will be treated until 2006 IWG progression criteria are met (ie, 50% increase of BM
      blasts or worsening of cytopenias) or until an unacceptable toxicity or intolerance.

      For all randomized patients who discontinue study treatment, subsequent therapies with their
      start and end dates, as well as survival time after treatment discontinuation, will be
      documented at least monthly until death.

      Patients in the PC group who progress will not be allowed to cross over to rigosertib.

      All patients in both treatment groups will be allowed, as medically justified, access to RBC
      and platelet transfusions and to growth factors (granulocyte colony-stimulating factor
      (G-CSF), erythropoietin, and thrombopoietin).
