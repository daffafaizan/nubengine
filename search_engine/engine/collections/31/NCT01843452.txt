      Primary:

      -To assess efficacy of treatment regimen composed of capecitabine, mitomycin, panitumumab,
      and radiotherapy in terms of locoregional control rate in patients with stage II-IIIB
      squamous-cell carcinoma of the anal canal.

      Secondary:

        -  To further assess efficacy of this regimen based on complete response (CR) rate,
           colostomy-free survival, functional colostomy-free survival, overall survival (OS), and
           progression-free survival (PFS).

        -  To assess the tolerability and safety profile of this regimen.

        -  To assess the role of PET for staging and outcome prediction (for those patients who had
           PET following local standards).
