      efficacy and safety of chemoradiotherapy in combination with immunotherapy and/or targeted
      treatment in high-risk locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The specific
      grouping of patients' depends on the SYSUCC immune subtyping based on 100+ gene panel
      testing. The molecular subgroups include the Active, Evaded and non-Immune Subtypes. New
      treatment arms may be added and/or existing treatment arms may be closed during the study
      course on the basis of ongoing efficacy and safety as well as the current treatments
      available.
