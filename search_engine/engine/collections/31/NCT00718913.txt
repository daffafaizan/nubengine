      strategy to reduce relapses at common sites would be beneficial. Our prior trial has proved
      the feasibility of administering FOLFIRI regimen as adjuvant chemotherapy combined with
      adjuvant chemoradiation in patients with excised with curative intend gastric cancer. It
      would be important to improve the treatment involving active regimen as adjuvant chemotherapy
      and optimizing chemoradiation by introducing capecitabine as a radiosensitizer.
