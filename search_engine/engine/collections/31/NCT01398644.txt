      homozygous for C282Y) living in south-east of the Netherlands and currently treated with
      phlebotomy as maintenance treatment to keep their serum ferritin levels < 50 ug/l. Ferritin
      level at start of the inclusion between 30-50ug/l. Exclusion criteria are: patient receiving
      other therapies such as chelating therapy or forced dietary regimen, further patients with
      excessive overweight (BMI>35). After enrollment the patients will be randomized to start
      either with TE or continue with P. After a year of treatment and being at a serum ferritin
      level <50ug/l, patients will continue the study but then being treated with the other of the
      two treatments. Randomization will be done by blocked randomization.
