      a study among healthy, non-exercising individuals demonstrated that cherry consumption
      decreased serum inflammatory biomarkers after 14 days. Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common
      syndrome affecting 65 million Americans characterized by pain, inflammation, and disability.
      Such natural anti-inflammatory effects of cherry consumption may be beneficial for the
      management and treatment of osteoarthritis and inflammatory diseases. The purpose of this
      randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study is to examine individuals with
      inflammatory OA and assess the analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects of tart cherry juice
      as compared to a placebo drink among twenty 30-70 y/o OA subjects.
