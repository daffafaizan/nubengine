        -  in study one the investigators include patients who are evaluated because of PVCs and
           have no signs of structural heart disease at echocardiography and exercise test. The
           investigators follow them (average follow-up time 3,5 years) to investigate if they have
           a higher mortality och cardiovascular morbidity than standard population

        -  in study two the investigators carry out a sub-group analysis of the population in study
           one to assess whether PVC:s different sites of origin (morphology) are related to the
           clinical outcome

        -  in study three the investigators include persons with a high PVC-burden (at least 10 000
           PVC:s/day) and normal echocardiography. The included subjects undergo magnetic resonance
           (MR) to investigate whether it can identify signs of heart disease where standard
           echocardiography cannot
