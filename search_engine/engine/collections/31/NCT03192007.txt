      transplant patients. The investigators will study if MRI can reflect different levels of
      kidney function. The investigators will also evaluate if MRI can differentiate causes for
      declining kidney function. Finally, the investigators will explore how MRI measures changes
      before and after medical treatment for worsening kidney function.

      Subjects may be invited for MRI exams with different exam options. An MRI exam may use either
      of two types of MRI machines at the CMRR: the 3T scanner and the 7T scanner. Subjects may
      also be invited for a multi-session exam. A description of the MRI exam types with different
      exam options and the types of multi-session exams is provided later in this document.
