      cancer development and growth. In this proposal, GSI will be used for non-invasive in vivo
      measurement of saturated fat in the breast adipose tissue of postmenopausal women who undergo
      diagnostic breast MRI exams (Aims 1 and 2) or MRI-guided biopsy scans (Aim 3). The central
      hypotheses is that (i) the breast saturated fatty acid fraction measured by GSI is associated
      with the presence of malignant lesions in the breast and (ii) the breast saturated fatty acid
      fraction correlates positively with inflammation in the breast adipose tissue that may lead
      to increase in estrogen production in adipocytes.The proposed study will evaluate whether
      breast saturated fat is an independent risk factor for breast cancer, and whether it can
      provide additional diagnostic information to current clinical diagnostic exams. In addition,
      the proposed imaging measure of breast saturated fat can be used to assess the efficacy of
      any intervention to reduce cancer-related inflammation in the breast adipose tissue and to
      investigate the possible role of fatty acid composition in prevention and clinical management
      of breast cancer.
