      arthroplasty. The purpose of this study was to compare functional and radiographic results,
      range of motion of the knee, patient satisfaction, femoral component, revision and
      complication rates in patients receiving either a standard posterior cruciate
      substituting-flex (LPS-flex) or gender-specific posterior cruciate substituting-flex
      (LPS-Flex) total knee prosthesis.
