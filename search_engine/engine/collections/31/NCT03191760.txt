    
      Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a mental health condition that some people develop
      following exposure to a traumatic event. PTSD often results in a reduction in feelings of
      connection to other people and changes in views about others, as well as reduced
      participation in valued activities. Many veterans with PTSD do not seek treatment offered in
      specialty mental health settings and may forgo treatment of any kind.

      This study is an open-trial format (no comparison condition) of U.S. military veterans who
      will participate in a brief psychotherapy treatment for PTSD offered in a Primary Care
      setting. This is a pilot trial to see if the treatment is effective at reducing symptoms of
      PTSD and increasing feelings of social support, and an exploratory aim is to see if veterans
      engage in additional treatment after completing this treatment.
