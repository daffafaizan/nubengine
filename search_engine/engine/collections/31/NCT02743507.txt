    
      The overall objective is to examine the effects of the Bundled Payments for Care Improvement
      (BPCI) Model 2 on the quality and costs of care for conditions related to seven of the ten
      Medicare severity disease-related groups (MS-DRGs) most commonly selected by program
      participation. Five of these are surgical (major joint replacement of the lower extremity;
      double joint replacement of the lower extremity; revision of the hip or knee, hip and femur
      procedures except major joint; lower extremity and humerus procedure except hip, foot, and
      femur) and two are medical (simple pneumonia and respiratory infections; chronic obstructive
      pulmonary disease, bronchitis/asthma). These MS-DRGs represent two larger service lines:
      orthopedics and pulmonary. For each of these seven MS-DRGs, the team will first describe
      characteristics of provider organizations participating in bundled payment arrangements,
      including geographic characteristics and clinical volume. We will subsequently empirically
      test the effect of bundled payment arrangements on quality outcomes and costs of care for
      these conditions. Additionally, the team will examine any spillover effects that occur within
      the service lines that contain these seven MS-DRGs.
