      period, eligible subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either crisaborole 2%
      ointment or matching placebo for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint is assessed at week 12. At
      the week 12 visit, all subjects will enter the open label treatment period where they will
      all receive crisaborole 2% ointment for an additional 12 weeks, with the last study visit
      taking place on week 24.
