      technology(ART),especially on the patients of recurrent implantation failure. Although most
      trials proved the effectiveness of the intervention of local injury, the subjects of these
      trials are rarely the patients of repeated implantation failure(RIF). Moreover, the mechanism
      of endometrial injury is not clear.Our trial may provide further basis for this purpose by
      comparing to the quality of endometrium in two-dimensional ultrasound.If the technique
      demonstrates efficacy, it would help the patients with RIF caused by poor conditions of
      endometrium to deal with the problem of infertility.
