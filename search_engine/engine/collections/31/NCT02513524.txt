    
      This is a prospective, observational study.

      Patients fitting inclusion and exclusion criteria, after informed consent, will undergo the
      direct observed therapy test in the hypertension unit (this is usual care in the unit, which
      they will undergo even if they are not part of the study).

      The Direct Observation Therapy (DOT) Test includes the following components:

        1. Administer and observe ingestion of usual morning antihypertensive medications.

        2. Monitor BP every 30 minutes, using 5 readings of an automated oscillometric BP device (
           BP-TRU), until plateau affect achieved, defined as 3 consecutive cycles of BP readings
           declining by less than 10 mmHg per cycle).

        3. Registered Nurse (RN) repeats standing BP prior to initiation of 24 hour Ambulatory
           Blood Pressure Monitoring(ABPM).

        4. RN initiates 24 hour ABPM

      In addition, participants will undergo an additional 24-hour ABPM test 1 month after the DOT
      test is undertaken.
