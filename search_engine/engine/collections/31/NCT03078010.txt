      friendly bacteria existing in the intestinal tract (gut). Under normal circumstances, these
      friendly bacteria are not harmful and they help with normal bodily functions such as
      digestion. When these bacteria are absent, several complications may occur, such as
      infections with harmful bacteria or other inflammatory reactions, that can complicate the
      stem cell transplant course. Treatment with antibiotics or chemotherapy is known to kill off
      these friendly bacteria. In this study we compare the effects of different antibiotics on the
      community of friendly bacteria in the gut.
