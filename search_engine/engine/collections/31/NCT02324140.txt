      Surgical and interventional therapy for aortic valve stenosis exposes the patients to a
      immune reaction, which is different depending on the type of the treatment. In this study,
      the investigators would like to better understand the inflammatory and antiinflammatory
      response in this patient population by monitoring the perioperative cytokine response
      (interleukins), the human leukocyte antigen expression (HLA-DR) and assessing soluble plasma
      factors (CD62L) involved in inflammatory processes.

      Objective

      Characterisation of inflammatory and antiinflammatory response in patients receiving aortic
      valve prosthesis selected for different treatment options.

      Methods

      Whole blood analysis at different time points (preoperatively, 4 / 24 /48 hours
      postoperatively) for different inflammatory and antiinflammatory markers: IL-6, IL-8, IL-10,
      CRP, TNF, soluble CD62L.
