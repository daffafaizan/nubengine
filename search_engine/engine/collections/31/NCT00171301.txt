      serious complications in the absence of chelation treatment to remove excess iron.
      Deferasirox (Exjade, ICL670) is an oral chelator with high iron-binding potency and
      selectivity. This extension study aimed at collecting efficacy and safety data during 2 years
      of treatment with deferasirox in the extension study or until deferasirox became commercially
      available in the countries where the centers were located, whichever came first. The
      population comprised of Î²-thalassemia patients with transfusional hemosiderosis who could not
      be satisfactorily treated with deferoxamine or deferiprone.
