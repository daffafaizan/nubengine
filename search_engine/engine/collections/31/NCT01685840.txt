      needs of the rest of the body. Common symptoms of heart failure include shortness of breath,
      swelling, and fatigue. Standard treatment for heart failure include diuretics to control
      fluid, as well as drugs called "neurohormonal antagonists" (such as beta-blockers and
      ACE-inhibitors) that help the heart work more efficiently and prevent worsening of heart
      function. Typically, doctors adjust these medicines based on their clinical judgment about
      what doses and combination will work best for you. We are testing whether the use of a blood
      test called NT-proBNP (which measures a hormone released by the heart) can help doctors do a
      better job of adjusting these heart failure medicines over time than clinical judgment alone.
