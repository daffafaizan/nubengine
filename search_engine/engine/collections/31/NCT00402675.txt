    
      In this randomized, controlled, open-label clinical trial we compare a very early cardiac
      catheterization (< 2,5 hours after randomization) similar to ST-elevation myocardial
      infarction treatment, versus an early invasive approach (within 2-48 hours after
      randomization) versus a selective invasive approach in patients with non-ST-elevation
      myocardial infarction.

      All patients are treated with heparin, ASA, Clopidogrel loading dose (600 mg) with subsequent
      75 mg/d and tirofiban for 24 hours.
