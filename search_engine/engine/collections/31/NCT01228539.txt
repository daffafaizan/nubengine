      risks that are set in motion by exposure to military-related traumatic stressors in Iraq or
      Afghanistan. Trauma exposure places personnel at risk for PTSD, which in turn increases their
      risk of problems with anger and hostility, emotion dysregulation and experiential avoidance,
      and ultimately with alcohol abuse and aggression. The two types of treatments being compared,
      TARGET (Trauma Affect Regulation: Guide for Education and Therapy) and PE (Prolonged
      Exposure), are both designed to directly reduce PTSD severity by reducing emotion
      dysregulation (TARGET) and experiential avoidance (PE), and therefore are hypothesized to
      reduce the risk and severity of alcohol abuse and aggression- and thereby to reduce
      associated legal and societal costs.
