      disorder (SSD). As the disorder is characterized by the prominent attention to somatic
      concerns, patients mainly present initially in medical rather than mental health care
      settings. The fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders
      (DSM-5) is currently the "gold standard" for the diagnosis of SSD, but it is clinically hard
      to follow. Thus, It is more clinically practical to detect a disorder by self-administered
      questionnaires, that patients can score symptoms according to their own condition and
      severity in a short time. However, the current self-reporting questionnaires, such as the
      Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 (GAD-7), and
      the Patient Health Questionnaire-15 (PHQ-15) are neither sufficiently considering companioned
      anxiety or depression nor validated for monitor the treatment efficacy of SSD patients.

      The Somatic Symptom Scale-China (SSS-CN) is developed based on DSM-5 to assess SSD, and it is
      an abbreviated 20-item version of somatic symptoms that can be entirely self-administered by
      the patient, but its assessment value has not yet been widely tested. The study aims to
      investigate whether the SSS-CN could serve as a timely and practical instrument to detect SSD
      and assess the severity of the disorder.
