      I. Compare survival and progression-free survival in patients with stage III endometrial
      carcinoma treated with tumor volume-directed pelvic radiotherapy with or without paraaortic
      radiotherapy followed by cisplatin and doxorubicin with or without paclitaxel.

      II. Compare short and long-term toxic effects of these treatment regimens in this patient
      population.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      radiotherapy field (pelvic vs extended field). Within 8 weeks after surgery, patients receive
      tumor volume-directed pelvic radiotherapy with or without paraaortic nodal radiotherapy once
      daily for 5 consecutive days for up to 16 weeks after surgery. Within 8 weeks of completing
      radiotherapy, patients are randomized to 1 of 2 chemotherapy treatment arms.

      Arm I: Patients receive doxorubicin IV over 30 minutes immediately followed by cisplatin IV
      over 1 hour on day 1. Patients also receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) or
      pegfilgrastim on days 2-11.

      Arm II: Patients receive doxorubicin and cisplatin as in arm I, paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on
      day 2, and G-CSF SC or pegfilgrastim on days 3-12. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for a
      maximum of 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 614 patients (307 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 5.2 years.
