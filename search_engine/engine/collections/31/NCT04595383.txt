    
      This is an open randomized clinical trial without drugs. Patients with type 2 diabetes and
      treated with insulin will be included. Patients allocated in the intervention group will use
      the electronic platform as a communication channel with their health provider during the time
      between visits.

      The name of the platform is ti.care (https://ti.care/es) and it will be a complement of the
      control visits to resolve doubts through chats, email or video call. Health providers will
      answer the patient requests.
