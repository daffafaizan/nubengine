      topical heating for the purpose of elevating tissue temperature for temporary relief of minor
      muscle and joint pain, muscle spasm, pain and stiffness associated with arthritis and
      promoting relaxation of the muscle tissue and to temporarily increase local blood
      circulation.

      There will be a total of 20 subjects involved in this study. The study will only involve
      participants being treated at the Wake Forest University Health Sciences Wound Care Center.
      Ten participants will be randomized to the treatment arm and receive therapeutic laser
      therapy applied to the ulcer area. The other ten participants will receive a sham laser
      therapy, where the light emitted by the laser is visible, but not powerful enough to provide
      a therapeutic effect. During the first weekly visit, patients will have the wound debrided
      (dead or dying tissue will be removed),and the size of the ulcer measured and photographed. A
      wound dressing will be applied, followed by a compression wrap.

      After one week patients will return to the Wound Care clinic and the size of the wound will
      be evaluated. If the wound has decreased by less than 30%,the patient will be randomized into
      the protocol. The patient will then have weekly visits, to include a survey, wound
      measurements, survey, photos,and laser treatments. The length of the study is a maximum of 17
      weeks (less if the patient heals faster). The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether
      laser therapy can provide pain relief and speed the healing of venous leg ulcers.
