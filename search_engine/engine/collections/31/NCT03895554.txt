      volunteers using our existing 2D PET camera (Positron Attrius) and invasively validated
      software package (HeartSee) in order to 1) establish institutional values for which clinical
      patients can be compared to and 2) add to the collective data of the scientific community.
      Values to be measured will be resting myocardial blood flow (MBF), stress MBF and coronary
      flow reserve.
