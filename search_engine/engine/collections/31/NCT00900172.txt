    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine whether germline polymorphisms (DNA) of genes involved in DNA repair (e.g.,
           XPD, ERCC-1, and others) and angiogenesis (e.g., vascular endothelial growth factor
           [VEGF], interleukin-8, CXCR2, adrenomedullin, leptin, and others) are associated with
           toxicity and clinical outcome in patients with non-small cell lung cancer enrolled on
           protocol ECOG-4599.

      OUTLINE: Blood samples previously obtained from patients on protocol ECOG-4599 are analyzed
      for the association of germline variations of genes involved in DNA repair (XPD and ERCC1),
      angiogenesis (VEGF and IL-8), and clinical outcome (overall survival, response,
      progression-free survival, and toxicity).

      Tumor cells are collected from paraffin-embedded tissue using laser-capture microdissection
      and normal tissue is collected from the specimen. Polymorphisms in ERCC-1, XRCC-1, XRCC-3,
      GST-P1, TGF-Î², and IL-8CXCR are assessed using Taqman assays.
