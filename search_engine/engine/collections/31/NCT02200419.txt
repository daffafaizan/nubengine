      cases that require the use of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), occurring frequently and
      resulting in excessive blood loss, blood product transfusions, and adverse clinical outcomes.
      Current management of coagulopathy is hampered by the inability of conventional laboratory
      tests to delineate its etiology in a timely manner, thereby precluding timely and targeted
      transfusion therapy. With the advent of point-of-care (POC) coagulation tests that can
      rapidly identify the etiology of coagulopathy, it may now be possible to reduce the burden of
      coagulopathy and thereby reduce transfusions and adverse outcomes. Several single-centre
      studies (including one by the investigator group) have found that the use of POC-based
      algorithms in cardiac surgery can markedly reduce blood product transfusions and by that
      means reduce morbidities and mortality.
