    
      80 patients will be recruited from among the patients consulting the otorhinolaryngology
      department of the Nancy CHRU for the assessment of viral post-infectious olfactory disorders.

      The inclusion visit will be carried out during a standard routine care consultation with the
      following:

        -  an endoscopic endonasal examination

        -  the olfactory assessment (evaluation of smell by self-assessment, Dynachron-olfaction
           questionnaire, olfactory test by Sniffin 'Stick)

      At the end of this assessment and after having received the information on the study and
      signed the consent form, the patients confirmed to be hypo-anosmic will then be randomized
      into 2 groups:

        -  "classic" olfactory rehabilitation group

        -  "intensive" olfactory rehabilitation group The rehabilitation kits (8 jars or 4 jars
           depending on the randomization group) will be provided to the patient with therapeutic
           education in their use.

      The patient will carry out olfactory rehabilitation (intensive or classic) at home twice a
      day (morning and evening) for 32 weeks (i.e. 448 sessions). The patient will smell each odor
      for 10 seconds with an interval of 10 seconds between odors. Each training will be recorded
      by the patient in his olfactory rehabilitation agenda.

      The patient will go again for a follow-up consultation for the renewal of his olfactory
      assessment at 4 months (follow-up visit 1) and at 8 months (follow-up visit 2) post-inclusion
      as part of the routine care of disorders of the smell post virus infection. In addition to
      the olfactory assessment during these visits, the investigator will also verify that the
      rehabilitation schedule is being kept.
