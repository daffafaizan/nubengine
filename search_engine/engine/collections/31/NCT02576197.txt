      coadjuvant in the conventional treatment of mild to moderate plaque psoriasis. The efficiency
      is measured as the reduction in the PASI score in the patients (18 to 70 years old) included
      in the study, with a mild to moderate plaque psoriasis treated exclusively with topic
      treatment in the moment of being included in the study. Apart from the PASI score reduction
      from the first visit to the end of the study, the ability to reduce the improvement time in
      those patients will be evaluated as well. Additionally, the following markers of systemic
      inflammation are also compared between both active and placebo branches: Tumor necrosis
      factor, Interferon-gamma, interleukines 1b, 12, 16 and 23.
