      attenuate declines in physical activity during radiation therapy? To address this question,
      this study will assess the feasibility of a patient-centered walking program for breast and
      head-and-neck cancer patients undergoing radiation therapy. Follow-up monitoring sessions
      will be scheduled to help provide support and ongoing counseling to facilitate increased
      activity (through walking) during radiation therapy. We will also examine the effect of the
      walking program on other outcomes such as happiness, depression and sleep to determine point
      estimates and measures of variability to inform future research.
