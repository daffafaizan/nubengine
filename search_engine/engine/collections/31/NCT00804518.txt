      studies have shown that physical exercise can improve both systolic and diastolic function.
      However the impact on age-related cardiac function is to some extent conflicting. The use of
      different training intensities will impact on the cardiac result. We have in earlier studies
      shown aerobic interval training at 90 % of maximal heart rate (4x4 minutes) to have more
      impact on cardiac function, endothelial function and maximal oxygen uptake compared to
      moderate intensity.

      To our knowledge the effect of aerobic interval training on cardiac function has not been
      studied in an old, sedate group before.
