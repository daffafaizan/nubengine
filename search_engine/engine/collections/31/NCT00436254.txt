      plasmid-based DNA vaccine encoding the ICD of HER2 administered with a fixed dose of GM-CSF.
      II. To determine whether a plasmid DNA vaccine encoding the ICD of HER2 can elicit HER2
      specific immune responses. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine if the dose of the
      plasmid-based DNA vaccine effects immunologic responses. II. To determine the persistence of
      DNA at the site of vaccination. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of a plasmid-based
      DNA (pNGVL3-hICD) vaccine. Patients receive pNGVL3-hICD vaccine admixed with GM-CSF
      intradermally once a month for 3 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for up
      to 15 years with primary physicians.
