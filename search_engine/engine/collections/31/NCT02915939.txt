      not disengage from care responsibilities following relatives' admissions to residential
      long-term care settings. Families instead remain involved in a spectrum of care activities
      ranging from instrumental activities of daily living to emotional support. Perhaps for these
      reasons, a number of studies have noted that caregiving stress, depression, or other key
      outcomes remain stable or sometimes increase following residential long-term care (RLTC)
      entry for certain types of caregivers. A few interventions have attempted to increase family
      involvement after institutionalization, but no rigorous studies have demonstrated that these
      interventions are effective in helping families navigate transitions to RLTC environments.

      The Residential Care Transition Module (RCTM) provides 6 formal sessions of consultation
      (one-to-one and family sessions) over a 4-month period to those family caregivers who have
      recently admitted a relative to a RLTC setting. In this randomized controlled trial, family
      members who have admitted a cognitively impaired relative to a RLTC setting will be randomly
      assigned to the RCTM [(n = 120)] or a usual care control condition [(n = 120)]. A mixed
      methods analysis will be used to pursue the following aims: Specific Aim 1: Assess whether
      the RCTM yields statistically significant reductions in family members' primary subjective
      stress and negative mental health outcomes; Specific Aim 2) Determine whether family members
      who receive the RCTM will indicate statistically significant decreases in secondary role
      strains over a 12-month period when compared to usual care controls; Specific Aim 3)
      Determine whether RCTM family members report statistically significant decreases in
      residential care stress when compared to family members in the usual care control group; and
      Specific Aim 4) Delineate the mechanism of action of RCTM under conditions of high and low
      success by "embedding" qualitative components (30 semi-structured interviews) at the
      conclusion of the 12-month evaluation.

      The proposed project will fill an important clinical and research gap by evaluating a
      psychosocial intervention designed for families following RLTC placement that determines
      whether and how the RCTM can help families better navigate the residential care transitions
      of cognitively impaired relatives.
