    
      Adult subjects with moderate to severe facial erythema of rosacea who meet
      inclusion/exclusion criteria will be randomized at Baseline/Visit 1 in a 1:1 ratio to receive
      either CD07805/47 gel 0.5% once daily or azelaic acid gel 15% twice daily for 15 days.
      Following an appropriate washout period, subjects will then switch treatments and use the
      second investigational product as instructed for 15 days (according to the subject's
      randomization scheme). Subjects will re-qualify based upon inclusion/exclusion prior to
      Period 2 treatment.
