      3-D ultrasound imaging of the brain for the diagnosis and evaluation of stroke. Over the last
      decade, with the availability of color flow Doppler combined with effective ultrasound
      contrast agents, a renaissance has occurred in transcranial sonography as a low cost, bedside
      method for evaluation and management of patients with cerebrovascular disease in spite of the
      image degrading properties of the skull. Our hypothesis is that we can combine new
      generations of 2D array transducers with ultrasound contrast agents and phase aberration
      correction to enable real time 3D ultrasound imaging and 3D color flow Doppler of the brain
      with a factor of 10 improvement in spatial resolution compared to conventional transcranial
      sonography for improved diagnosis and evaluation of stroke.
