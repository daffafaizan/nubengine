      histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced solid tumors. Approximately 6 patients
      will be enrolled. The study will consist of 2 parts: a mass balance part (Part I) and a
      rucaparib treatment part (Part II).

      Each patient will receive a single oral dose of 600 mg [14C] rucaparib (approximately 140
      ÂµCi) in the fasted state. Patients will be confined at the study site for the collection of
      blood samples and excreta for a maximum of 13 days, from Day -1. The patient can be
      discharged sooner than Day 13, if the discharge criteria are met. If the cumulative recovery
      of radioactivity exceeds 90% of the administered dose or if radioactivity in urine and feces
      is < 1% of the administered dose over a 24 hour period on two consecutive days, as determined
      by quick counts.

      In Part II, the treatment with rucaparib in 28-day cycles will continue until progression of
      disease, unacceptable toxicity, or other reason for discontinuation.
