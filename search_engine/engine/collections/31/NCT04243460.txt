      inflammatory periimplant diseases and ensure healthy, stable and long-term survival of a
      dental implant. Due to the fact that the measurement methods in the literature differ, it is
      necessary to establish objective measurement method and to determine the minimum amount of
      tissue thickness to maintain a stable level of bone around the implant.

      Purpose:

      The aim of the study was to determine the effect of soft tissues in the implant area on the
      marginal bone level loss in the implant area and to define of the critical gingival thickness
      to minimize marginal bone level (MBL) loss.

      Materials and methods:

      75 bone level implants (Conelog® Camlog, Switzerland) were inserted in the aesthetic area.
      Thickening of soft tissues was performed both before and after implantation (group II and
      III), CTG and XCM were used (subgroup a and b). 12 months after the loading with final
      restoration, the thickness of soft tissues in the implant area was examined with
      ultrasonography (USG) device (Pirop®, Echoson, Poland), and each implant was subjected to
      Radiovisiography (RVG) RVG examination, where MBL loss was determined.
