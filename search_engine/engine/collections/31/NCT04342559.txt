      Vaginal moisturizers rehydrate the mucosal tissue and are absorbed by the skin, adhering to
      the vaginal lining, thus mimicking natural vaginal secretions. The use of vaginal
      moisturizers is intended to allow dryness / atrophy, vaginitis / non-hormonal vaginal atrophy
      and is regularly harmful or once every 2-3 days. The frequency of use is directly
      proportional to the severity of the atrophy (for example, the more severe the atrophy, the
      more frequent the application is), the effects of the moisturizer are more prolonged and the
      effects of the lubricant, lasting 2 to 3 days.

      MOD_PRO_CEP Rev. 03 All-SE-UG-EP-pH-FL-062603-07 / 08-04-18-PRV01 Vaginal moisturizers use
      this longer to change the content of the endothelium fluid, capture the vaginal pH and thus
      maintain vaginal hydration and acidity. Therefore, they are particularly beneficial, not only
      for women with VVA / GSM symptoms that cause pain during intercourse, but also for women who
      are not currently sexually active, but experience discomfort on a daily basis. Since vaginal
      moisturizers are used to moisturize the mucosa, most contain water. For the water to stick to
      the mucosa, it also contains vegetable or synthetic polymers. In addition, they can use a
      wide variety of other excipients to provide adequate viscosity, to buffer or pH and for
      conservation; these additional ingredients (some synthetic polymers) affect the pH and
      osmolality of the moisturizer.

      The products to be tested in this study are two vaginal moisturizers. These are two new
      products from the sponsor.
