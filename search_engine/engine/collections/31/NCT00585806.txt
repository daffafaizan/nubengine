      University of Pennsylvania. This project will require one visit approximately 3-5 hours in
      length. The subject will fill out a symptom questionnaire. A small gauge angiocath will be
      place to establish intravenous access. Single-lead ECG and blood pressure are monitored for
      the duration of the protocol. Tonometry (non-invasive measurement of the pulse) and
      echocardiographic images will be obtained at baseline. After baseline data are obtained,
      dobutamine will be infused at escalating doses of 2, 4, 8, and 16 µg/kg/min IV at ≤30-minute
      intervals. After 5 minutes of infusion at each dose, echocardiographic and tonometry data
      will be recorded. If 85% or more of predicted target heart rate is reached, the final study
      data collection and safety imaging will be performed and the dose not increased further.
