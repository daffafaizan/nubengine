    
      Primary Objective:

      To compare the progression free survival (PFS) of patients treated with nab-paclitaxel +
      placebo and patients treated with nab-paclitaxel + mifepristone.

      Secondary Objectives:

        1. To correlate percentage glucocorticoid receptor (GR) positivity in the most recent
           metastatic tumor biopsy (or in primary tumor if only primary tumor is available) with
           PFS in mifepristone and placebo groups.

        2. To perform an exploratory assessment of overall response rate in both groups.

        3. To collect information regarding overall survival in both treatment cohorts.
