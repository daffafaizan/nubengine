      There are 4 forms : Mediterranean, Endemic (Sub-Saharan Africa), iatrogenic and epidemic
      (HIV) The physiological hypotheses to explain the disease are not clear. A proliferation of
      immunity cells in blood vessels and also an undetermined role of the human herpes virus 8
      (HHV-8) could be involved.

      The treatment is complex and not standardized. There are a lot of different treatments.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the prevalence and described the characteristics and
      the treatment of the Kaposi's disease in the France's southeast on 10 years, from 2007 to
