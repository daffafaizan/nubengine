      undergoing scheduled subacute vascular surgery. This study looked at how well TachoSil®
      patches stopped bleeding at the surgical site compared to Surgicel® Original patches.

      The study enrolled 150 patients. Participants were randomly assigned (by chance, like
      flipping a coin) to one of the two open label treatment groups in a 2:1 ratio:

        -  TachoSil®

        -  Surgicel® Original

      This multi-center trial was conducted in the United States. The overall time to participate
      in this study was approximately 6 months. Participants made multiple visits to the clinic,
      including safety follow-up visits at 1, 3 and 6 months after surgery.
