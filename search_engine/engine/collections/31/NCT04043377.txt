      iPROGRESS is a prospective interventional study. The primary objective of this study will be
      to test the association between the intensity of 68Ga-DOTATATE uptake in coronary plaques
      quantified with PET at M0 and the absolute progression rate of coronary artery calcium
      scoring (CACS) measured between the CT acquired at M0 and after 2 years.

      Patients will be screened until 1 month before the inclusion (M0) visit. Thereafter, 3 visits
      specifics to the study will be performed.

      M0 (baseline): Injection of 68Ga-DOTATATE followed by PET-scan and a CCTA-scan M12 et
      M24(follow-up): Consultation and low-dose cardiac CT for coronary calcium scoring performed
