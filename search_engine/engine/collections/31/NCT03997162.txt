      I. Determine how the enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocol affects patient?s length
      of hospital stay after radical gastrectomy.

      II. Determine the association between ambulation (number of steps taken) while hospitalized
      and complications.

      III. Determine the association between pre-operatively and postoperatively drawn biochemical
      markers and complications, disease free survival, and overall survival.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants complete standard of care early recovery after surgery protocol beginning the
      day before surgery to day 6 after surgery.

      After completion of study, participants are followed up at days 14, 30, 80-110, and 170-200,
      and at 11-14 months.
