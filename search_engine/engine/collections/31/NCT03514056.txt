      Behçet's disease. In various studies, the incidence of fibromyalgia in Behçet's disease was
      5.7% -37.1%, which is widely distributed. There are no studies in literature comparing
      disease severity and pain thresholds at trigger points in fibromyalgia with and without
      Behcet's disease. In this study, it was aimed to investigate the frequency of fibromyalgia in
      Behcet's disease according to the criteria defined by the American Colloge of Rheuatology in
      2010 and updated in 2013. It was also aimed to compare the severity of disease in
      fibromyalgia with and without Behcet's disease.
