        1. To determine if patients with Binet Stage A CLL generate an immune response to an
           antigen delivered by a DNA vaccine.

        2. To determine if patients with Binet Stage A CLL generate an immune response to a tumor
           derived antigen delivered by a DNA vaccine.

        3. To determine the optimal dose of DNA vaccine to obtain anti-idiotype immune responses.

        4. To characterize any adverse effects of idiotypic vaccination with a DNA vaccine.

        5. To determine if DNA idiotypic vaccination is capable of inducing remission in BinetÂ´s
           Stage A CLL.
