      to type 2 diabetic patients for the initial step. Next, we will revise a questionnaire with
      professional advices for several times. Finally we will test a reliability with a final
      version as form of multisite based study and will confirm a questionnaire for a regularity of
      lifestyle in type 2 diabetes.
