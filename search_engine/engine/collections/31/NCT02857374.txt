      I. To determine the feasibility of intravital microscopy in characterizing the
      microvasculature of the sentinel lymph node (SLN) in melanoma patients requiring SLN biopsy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To identify vascular blood flow parameters and flow kinetics associated with the sentinel
      lymph node vasculature and define the utility of using commonly used fluorescent agents
      during human intravital microscopy and correlate with clinical outcomes (time to recurrence,
      survival), as a potential basis for a novel prognostic tool and/or microstaging technique.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the relationship between live microscopically-recorded images and pathology
      slides in terms of vessel density and vessel diameter.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive indocyanine green and fluorescein sodium injection intravenously (IV) and
      then undergo intravital microscopic observation over 15-20 minutes during standard of care
      sentinel node biopsy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3 weeks and then every 6
      months for 5 years or every 3 months for 2 years and every 6 months for another 2 years.
