    
      This is a single center, double-blinded, crossover, placebo-controlled pilot study to
      evaluate the effects of nesiritide in patients with chronic heart failure. This study will
      only take place at the University of Chicago Hospitals. It is double-blinded, which means
      that the neither subject nor their study doctor will know which study drug the subject will
      receive. However, in an emergency, this information can be obtained quickly. The study is
      placebo-controlled, which means subjects will not receive study drug at some point during the
      study; however because it is a cross-over study, subjects will be receiving nesiritide at
      some point in the study. Subjects will receive the study drug nesiritide for six out of the
      12 weeks of the study-either the first six weeks or the last six weeks.

      The procedures for the study consist of: informed consent, questions about the subjects heart
      failure, blood sample, assessment of heart failure severity based on symptoms, six minute
      walk test and the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire, history of heart failure
      symptoms and emergency room visits, diuretic and baseline medication history, long term IV
      for medication infusions, adjustment of study drug and regularly taken medications, 6 weeks
      of receiving long term IV infusion of drug, blood taken for lab tests at each clinic visit
      and an informational card provided for subjects to use for on-call physicians.

      Up to ten consecutive patients who decline participation in the study will be asked to
      participate in a registry to follow their course over the study interval. Baseline data,
      obtained from medical records will be recorded as will the number of hospitalizations/ER
      visits and NYHA class during the study period. These subjects will be surveyed by telephone
      monthly for the duration of the study.
