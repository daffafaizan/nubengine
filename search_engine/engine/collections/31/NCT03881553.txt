      disturbances that may be related to prematurity, opioid and other drug exposures in utero,
      illness, surgery, medical procedures, and/or treatment medications. In addition, patients
      treated in neonatal and pediatric units often require prolonged hospitalization with medical
      monitoring and life-sustaining devices equipped with patient safety alarms. Such bedside
      equipment may result in patients being exposed to loud and/or persistent noises that may
      further disrupt sleep and autonomic function and compromise recovery and outcomes.

      This pilot study will study three separate pediatric populations being treated in neonatal
      and pediatric hospital units: 1) Premature Infants; 2) Opioid-exposed newborns requiring
      medication for Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome; and 3) Hospitalized infants treated for illness
      or surgery. Subjects will participate in up to 4 study sessions during their hospitalization,
      testing independent effects of two interventions complementary to routine care: 1)
      Neurosensory, Environmental Adaptive Technology (NEATCAP), and 2) stochastic vibrotactile
      stimulation (SVS). Within-subject design will allow for comparisons between periods, i.e.,
      with and without the study-session intervention, separately for each device, for improving
      sleep and cardio-respiratory function in three independent groups of hospitalized infants.
