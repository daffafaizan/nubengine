      socio-emotional problems in the offspring, and more stressful parent-child interactions.
      Further, parenting concerns often exacerbate existing eating disorder symptoms in parents.
      Parent-Based Prevention (PBP-B) is a focused intervention aimed to support parents with
      eating disorders and their partners in developing healthy eating and lifestyle behaviors in
      their children. The program also focuses on reducing mealtime conflict and improving couple
      communication. This study tests the feasibility, acceptability and preliminary outcomes of
      the Parent-Based Prevention (PBP) program for these parents and their partners. Parents with
      any lifetime eating disorder diagnosis who have at least one child 1-5 years old will be
      randomized to receive PBP immediately or following a 16-week waitlist period. This study will
      investigate whether PBP is feasible, acceptable, and associated with improvement in
      short-term outcomes that predict long term risks of eating and weight disorders (e.g.,
      parental cognition associated with feeding practices and child eating behaviors and
      socio-emotional symptoms). The study will collect important case series data that will inform
      the design of larger, adequately powered studies to test ways to reduce the likelihood of
      eating and weight difficulties in the offspring of parents with eating disorders.
