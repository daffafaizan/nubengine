      to severe pulmonary disease who are experiencing an acute exacerbation that requires
      hospitalization will be admitted to the GCRC. Subject participation in the study will be for
      the first 10 days of hospitalization. Subjects will be randomized into one of two treatment
      groups: usual care or usual care plus non-invasive pressure support ventilation (PSV).
