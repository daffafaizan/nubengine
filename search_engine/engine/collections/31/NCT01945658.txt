      already known for Glucose intolerance. Those patients being treated for this condition will
      not have their treatment affected in any way by our study, other than having one additional
      blood test on the day that they present for their down-regulation ultrasound. They will not
      be required to give a greater amount of blood, since vitamin D measurements can be determined
      from the same blood drawn routinely for estradiol (E2) levels.

      Those patients who consent to participate in our study will have vitamin D levels drawn at
      each visit, but will not be required to present more often than otherwise required by their
      treating physician. Given that the only intervention is one additional blood sample, we do
      not foresee any side-effect or risks. Results of these tests will not have any impact on
      patients' IVF treatment protocols, as the test results will not be disclosed until after
      their treatment has ended, whether in failure or in pregnancy.

      Patients' medical history, results of blood tests and the details of their IVF treatment
      protocol will be entered into a database, which will then be analyzed using parametric or
      non-parametric tests when appropriate, as required using SPSS. All blood tests levels will be
      drawn and analyzed in the McGill Reproductive Center's laboratory using a single immunoassay
      run. Measuring all samples at the same time reduces the possibility of inter-assay
      variability, reducing the sensitivity of the study. The sample size of experimental patients
      (with 10% margins of error and 95% confidence limits) is 66 women for a control group of 200.
      These numbers are easily achievable with the current activity of the McGill Reproductive
      Centre.
