      noninvasive alternative treatments for patients who are difficult to wean from MV (i.e., â‰¥96
      hours (4 days) on MV) or who have required prolonged MV (>7 days). The intended patient
      population includes approximately one-third of all patients on mechanical ventilation. Under
      standard of care, approximately 50% of these patients will recover from mechanical
      ventilation (Jung, 2016). Standard of care involves daily weaning attempts, known as
      Spontaneous Breathing Trials (SBTs) or Ventilator Liberation Trials (VLTs) that are intended
      to encourage diaphragm use and strengthening over time.Therefore, Lungpacer DPT efficacy
      evaluation must be compared to standard of care in a Control group. Lack of recovery from
      mechanical ventilation may be due to the inability of a patient to participate in VLTs or
      weaning attempts, due to extensive diaphragm weakness or sedation, the inability of VLTs to
      induce sufficient diaphragm strengthening, or co-morbidities that prevent recovery.
