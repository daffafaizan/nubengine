      experiencing skin disease or wounds, pregnancy, less than 20 years old, and who take
      Immunosuppressants drugs or Morphine, Mechanical obstruction were excluded. These 94 patients
      were randomly divided into two groups: a Laser Acupuncture group and a control group. At the
      beginning of study, check X-ray(KUB), collect serum Gastrin, Motilin, and Pancreatic
      polypeptide, and record bowel sound per minute, frequent of enema, average amount of stool
      per day. 47 patients received Laser Acupuncture therapy three times a week in acupoints RN6,
      RN4, and RN12. The whole duration of treatment is 8 weeks. The control group patients receive
      pseudo laser acupuncture. In the end of 4th and 8th week, check X-ray(KUB), collect serum
      Gastrin, Motilin, and Pancreatic polypeptide, and record bowel sound per minute, observe the
      daily record and then calculate frequent of enema and average amount of stool per day. After
      the end of treatment, the investigators keep follow up for 4 weeks. The outcome parameters
      include:

        1. KUB,

        2. the average amount of stool every day,

        3. frequency of bowel sound,

        4. frequency of enema, (Indication of enema: the amount of stool less than 200g within 3
           days),

        5. the change of serum Gastrin, Motilin, and Pancreatic polypeptide.
