      to test HGSOC organoids obtained from PDS+adjuvant chemotherapy and NACT+IDS cases to predict
      patients' response to treatments; moreover, the investigators aim to study genomic and
      phenotypic evolution of HGSOC organoids from PDS+adjuvant chemotherapy and NACT+IDS patients
      undergoing relapse. Finally, the investigators intend to investigate splicing-targeting
      technologies as new potential therapeutic treatments to increase vulnerability of HGSOCs.
      FIGO stage IIIC or IV ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer patients will be
      included if disease at metastatic sites is supposed to be completely resectable and they will
      be triaged for staging laparoscopy to obtain histologic diagnosis and to provide the tumor
      load assessment through the laparoscopic score. If PDS is chosen, open cytoreduction will be
      performed at the same time and bioptic tissue will be collected for organoids; otherwise,
      women will be submitted to NACT followed by IDS and tissue for organoids will be collected
      from both staging LPS biopsy (pre-) and subsequent surgery (post-NACT). Part of each surgical
      specimen will be used to obtain organoids, whereas part will be frozen for direct comparative
      analysis of the original tumor. 1-6 organoids from each patient will be prepared from PDS or
      NACT-IDS patients (pre- and post-NACT) and blood samples will also be collected to purify
      extracellular circulating RNA (cRNAs).
