    
      Besides the main objectives, there are other objectives as follows:

      [Phase I]

        1. To assess the pharmacokinetic profile of HM781-36B(Poziotinib) combined with Paclitaxel
           and Trastuzumab

        2. To evaluate anticancer activity of HM781-36B(Poziotinib) combined with Paclitaxel and
           Trastuzumab in patients with HER-2 positive advanced gastric cancer

        3. To evaluate PFS(Progression-Free Survival), TTP (Time To Tumor Progression), and DOR
           (Duration of Overall Response)

      [Phase II]

        1. To assess the safety, tolerability of HM781-36B(Poziotinib) combined with Paclitaxel and
           Trastuzumab

        2. To evaluate tumor response through determination of disease control rate ,
           PFS(Progression-Free Survival), TTP (Time To Tumor Progression), and DOR (Duration of
           Overall Response)
