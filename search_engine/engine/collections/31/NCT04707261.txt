      hemoglobin change and association between hemoglobin change and readmissions due to heart
      failure, and all-cause death in patients with heart failure treated with dapagliflozin or
      placebo.

      Detailed Description: Heart failure is one of the most serious health concerns in the world,
      and it also remains the most common reason for hospitalization in older individuals. In
      patients with heart failure, anemia is associated with an increased risk of hospitalization
      and all-cause mortality. The DAPA-HF trial demonstrated that dapagliflozin was able to reduce
      the risk of worsening heart failure (HF) events and cardiovascular death comparing to placebo
      in patients with reduced ejection fraction on top of standard of care.

      This is an investigator-initiated, interventional, prospective, double-blind study. The
      primary objective is to investigate whether anemia correction is one of the prerequisites and
      determinants related to the beneficial effects of dapagliflozin in patients with heart
      failure. Impact of dapagliflozin treatment on hemoglobin level, heart failure-related
      readmission and all-cause death will be observed in comparison with placebo in heart failure
      patients receiving guideline recommended standard therapy during the 3months, 6 months and 1
      year follow up.
