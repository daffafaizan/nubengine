    
      This is a multicenter prospective observational study conducted at 12 intensive care units
      (ICU) in Sweden. All patients >18 years of age with a Polymerase Chain Reaction
      (PCR)-verified influenza A or B diagnosed up to 7 days before admission to the ICU or during
      ICU care, will be included in the study.

      A new clinical routine has been implemented at the study centers: During the ICU stay
      screening with Beta-D-glucan and Galactomannan in blood/serum will be performed twice weekly
      and a respiratory sample will be retrieved for fungal culture and microscopy once weekly.

      All results from collected samples will be available to the patient's attending physicians.
      Clinical and microbiological data will be collected, and the diagnosis of invasive
      aspergillosis will be made using predefined diagnostic criteria.

      Objectives:

        1. To determine the prevalence of influenza-related invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in
           Swedish intensive care units

        2. To assess the clinical impact of and risk factors for influenza-related invasive
           pulmonary aspergillosis
