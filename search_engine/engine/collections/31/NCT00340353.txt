      Alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS) is a rare tumor.

      ASPS is resistant to chemotherapy and radiation.

      ASPS is characterized by slow growth.

      Currently no in vitro or in vivo models of ASPS exist for use in experimental therapeutic
      studies or biological investigations were generated under this protocol.

      Additional models are needed to represent the heterogeneity of this disease.

      Primary Objectives:

      Acquisition of blood and tissue from patients with ASPS.

      Acquisition of blood from healthy controls for comparison with blood from patients with ASPS.
      These control samples will be obtained from study NCI at Frederick Protocol OH99-C-N046.

      Eligibility:

      Subjects of any age with a diagnosis of primary or metastatic alveolar soft part sarcoma who
      are undergoing medically indicated surgery for their disease.

      Design:

      Patients with Alveolar Soft Part Sarcoma (ASPS) will be eligible for this study. Biopsy
      tissue will be obtained as an additional sample at the time of a medically indicated
      procedure. Blood sample may be collected at initial visit and follow-up visits. Specific
      risks will be described in a separate consent to be obtained at the time of the biopsy. Tumor
      samples and blood samples will be processed and/or stored for use in research efforts in the
      laboratory of Dr. Robert Shoemaker, National Cancer Institute, Frederick, MD. Additionally,
      blood samples will be obtained from healthy volunteers for comparison to patients with ASPS.
      These control samples will be obtained from the National Cancer Institute at Frederick
      Protocol OH99-C-N046.
