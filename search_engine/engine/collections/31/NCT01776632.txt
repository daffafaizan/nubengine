      promoting moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and cancer screening (breast,
      cervical, colorectal, and skin) among Latinas, and is tested simultaneously in a two-group
      design. Both interventions lasted two years. The study's primary outcome was min/week of
      accelerometer-assessed MVPA at baseline (M1) and 12 months (M2) and 24 months (M3) following
      the start of the intervention.We selected cancer screening as a comparison condition given
      the relevance of this topic to our target community (i.e., low cervical and colorectal cancer
      screening rates and follow-up). It was hypothesized that over time, participants in the
      physical activity condition would engage in significantly higher levels of MVPA, compared to
      participants in the cancer screening condition. We also expected greater changes in
      individual-, interpersonal-, and environmental-level correlates of physical activity among
      participants in the physical activity condition compared to those in the cancer screening
      condition. Conversely, we expected that participants in the cancer screening condition would
      engage in higher screening rates compared to those in the physical activity intervention.We
      anticipated greater changes in individual, interpersonal, and environmental correlates of
      cancer screening in this condition compared to the physical activity condition.
