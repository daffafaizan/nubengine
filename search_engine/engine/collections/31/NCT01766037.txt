      the food left in your stomach 20 minutes after your meal, which reduces the number of
      calories absorbed by your body. This is done through a tube placed through the abdomen into
      the stomach with a small valve attached at the surface of your skin. An aspiration system
      will attach to that valve after each major meal of the day and allow you to remove a portion
      of that meal.

      During this study you will also be provided with Lifestyle therapy which includes behavioral
      therapy, diet and physical activity education. This Lifestyle therapy will also be provided
      to the participants who do not receive the AspireAssist so that the two groups can be
      compared and the benefit of aspiration for weight loss can be determined.
