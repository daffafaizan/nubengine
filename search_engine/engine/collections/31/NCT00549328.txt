    
      Study 109609 is a single-arm, non-randomized, single-stage Phase II study of pazopanib in
      subjects with Stage IIIB or IV non-small cell lung cancer who have progressed after one or
      two prior regimens of systemic therapy. The study will be conducted at a limited number of
      institutions in the US. A total of 40 evaluable subjects will be enrolled and treated.
      Pazopanib will be given at a dose of 800mg (as determined by previous Phase I studies) orally
      once per day. Subjects may continue to receive study drug for up to two years unless they
      experience disease progression or withdraw from treatment for other reasons, or unless the
      Sponsor terminates the study. A rollover study may be available to those subjects who are
      exhibiting clinical benefit (stable disease or better). Evaluable subjects will be assessed
      for response as the primary endpoint.
