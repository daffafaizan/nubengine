      Typhax (0.5, 2.5 or 10 mcg Vi antigen). Groups of 15 subjects in each dose cohort were
      randomized to receive Typhax, Typhim Vi (25 mcg Vi antigen) or placebo (saline) in a ratio of
      3:1:1, respectively. Typhax and placebo (saline) was administered as two dose regimen (Days 0
      and 28), and Typhim Vi was given as a single dose (Day 0) with matching placebo on Day 28.
      All doses were administered by a unblinded third-party as 0.5 mL by intramuscular (IM)
      injection. Safety and reactogenicity endpoints was assessed at 14 and 28 days after the first
      Typhax vaccination and 14 days after the second vaccination. Immunogenicity was assessed
      using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to measure anti-Vi antibody serum titers
      on days 0, 14, 28, 42 and 180. A positive immune response (seroconversion) by ELISA is
      defined as at least a 4-fold increase over baseline in the Vi-specific ELISA.
