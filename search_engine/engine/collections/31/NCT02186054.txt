    
      -  Approximately 50 patients undergoing routine liver MRI in our practice imaged with one
           of our 4 clinical scanners will undergo our standard liver MRI protocol with the
           addition of 2 breath-hold sequences (FSE Flex and eSSFSE) only increasing the scan time
           by approximately 3 minutes.

        -  Data will be retrieved from examinations that have been performed from the patient's
           electronic imaging file stored in our picture archiving and communication system (PACS).

        -  Images will be completely anonymized. No patient identifiers will be available on the
           images during the analysis.

        -  Analyses will include the visual assessment of image quality, presence and severity of
           imaging artifact and other non-invasive imaging outcomes performed by radiologists
           blinded to patient information and the type of sequence performed. Data will be
           presented in a Likert type scale (1=poor, 2=suboptimal, 3=average, 4=above average and
           5=excellent) and imaging parameters will be compared using the Wilcoxon sign rank test.
