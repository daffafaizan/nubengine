    
      This study was a phase Ib study of the safety and pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of F-627
      once per cycle as prophylaxis therapy to chemotherapy in women with breast cancer.

      This study was conducted at two centers in China and enrolled 15 patients with breast cancer
      receiving TAC chemotherapy (docetaxel, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide). The patients
      received the intravenous administration of the chemotherapy (docetaxol, doxorubicin and
      cyclophosphamide, 75 mg/m2, 50 mg/m2 and 500 mg/m2 respectively) on Day 1 and the
      subcutaneous injection of F-627 at 240 µg/kg and 320 µg/kg on Day 2 (approximately 24 hours
      after chemotherapy) each cycle for up to 6 cycles. Patients will remain on study drug dose
      for each of the following 6 chemotherapy cycles.

      Patients will remain on study drug dose for each of the following 6 chemotherapy cycles. The
      blood sampling will be collected for F-627 serum concentration analysis in cycle of 1 and 3.
