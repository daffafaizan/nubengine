    
      -  Patients will have a blood sample drawn that will be analyzed for altered BRCA1 or BRCA2
           genes. An alteration of BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene means there is an increased risk of
           developing breast and ovarian cancer.

        -  Patients participating in this study have either: 1) expressed an interest in testing
           for an underlying genetic factor that may account for the breast or ovarian cancer in
           their family; 2) have at least one relative that has been found to have a BRCA1 or BRCA2
           alteration; 3) have a personal or family history of breast or ovarian cancer that is
           suggestive of a BRCA1 and BRCA2 alteration; or 4) has breast or ovarian cancer, or has
           at least one close relative with a history of breast or ovarian cancer and are a member
           of an ethnic group with increased frequency of BRCA1 and BRCA2 alterations.

        -  Patients will be randomized into one of two counseling groups. Two visits with a
           specially trained genetic counselor or nurse in conjunction with a medical oncologist
           and/or a medical specialist will be done in which information will be given either about
           genetic counseling or enhanced informed consent. These visits will be audio-taped to
           monitor how the project staff is covering the important information about testing.

        -  Throughout this study patients will be asked to complete questionnaires and
           psychological measures. These forms will be completed before and after the first visit,
           and a subset of them again at 2-4 weeks after the second visit, and at 4, 6, and 12
           months.

        -  In addition 30 women will be asked to complete a 20-30 minute telephone interview with
           the program psychologist.
