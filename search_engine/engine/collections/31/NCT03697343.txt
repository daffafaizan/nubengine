    
      This is a prospective, multicenter randomized trial comparing local control and side effects
      after fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy with 12 x 4 Gy and single session radiosurgery
      according to RTOG 9005 in patients with larger brain metastases (2-4 cm). Patients will be
      randomized to either fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy with 12 x 4 Gy or radiosurgery
      with 1 x 18 Gy (2-3 cm) or 1 x 15 Gy (3-4 cm) as defined by the RTOG 9005. Randomization will
      be stratified by metastasis volume and histology.
