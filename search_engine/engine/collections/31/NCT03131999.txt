    
      This is a double blind, adjusted parallel design, randomized clinical trial comparing
      imatinib mesylate 400 mg daily or matching placebo on the primary outcome of log transformed
      serum VEGF-D level in patients with LAM.

      Sirolimus using patients will have co-administration of Imatinib mesylate or placebo for 28
      days prior to sirolimus discontinuation.

      The duration of 400 mg imatinib mesylate or placebo will be 56 days, a dose reduction is
      allowed for toxicity.

      The primary endpoint will be the change in the log transformed VEGF-D one month after
      monotherapy imatinib mesylate or placebo.

      Total trial duration is 2 months of drug administration.
