      and deadly impact of stroke in a low-income region of the world with poor medical
      infrastructure. It will do so by focusing on improving the treatment of the condition most
      closely tied to stroke, hypertension, using novel methods that incorporate the input of the
      local community. If successful, the strategy could serve as a ready model to be adapted by
      decision-makers in other under-resourced areas for lessening the burden of stroke(and other
      major public health challenges).
