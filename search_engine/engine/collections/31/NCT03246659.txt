      of CCK-2/gastrin receptor in clinical practice. On the basis of last few years preclinical
      research outcome on new biomarkers, conjugate CP04 was chosen on the basis of its good
      stability and affinity to CCK-2/gastrin receptor in vitro, as well as its favourable
      biodistribution and pharmacodynamic properties in vivo, preclinically. Within this project
      the tracer may get a chance to be introduced to clinical practice as a more selective and
      efficient tool for the diagnosis, early detection and therapy of recurrent and metastatic
      MTC.

      Furthermore, the project may become the first step to establish a new, more effective
      strategy for the treatment of MTC patients leading to reduction of incidence and mortality as
      well as improvement of quality of life. CCK-2/gastrin receptors may become viable targets for
      radionuclide scintigraphy and radionuclide therapy, similarly to somatostatin receptors which
      have been instrumental to establish nuclear medicine efficacy in clinical practice. Achieving
      key project objectives (i.e. investigation of patients after administration of high peptide
      amount of the CCK-2/gastrin receptor labelled compound, performing complete patient peptide
      assessment and research nephrotoxicity in patients with or without administration for
      nephroprotective agent gelofusine/gelaspan), we will be able to define the exact molecular
      profile of an individual patient and tumour. Eventually, safe and efficacious personalized
      treatment will be planned using radiolabelled CCK-2/gastrin ligands of higher therapeutic
      efficacy.
