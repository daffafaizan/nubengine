    
      This is an acute, randomized, controlled, cross-over study designed to identify dietary
      biomarkers of milk and cheese intake and to asses metabolic effects after the ingestion of a
      non-fermented product (milk) and a fermented product (cheese) in healthy subjects.

      Twelve healthy participants (six women, six men) in fasted state will consume three different
      foods in a randomized order on three different study days. Two days prior to each dietary
      intervention, the run-in period is initiated, during which participants have to follow a
      restricted diet. Participants will receive a standardised meal for the last dinner during
      run-in phase. The same meal will be served on the day of the dietary intervention for lunch
      and for dinner (period of controlled diet). Before and after ingestion of the test foods,
      blood samples and urine samples will be collected (up to 6 hours). Additionally, 24h-samples
      will be collected. Primary outcomes (metabolites) will be measured in blood serum and plasma
      collected at 6 different time points and in urine collected at 7 different time points.
      Transcriptomics analysis will be performed on whole blood samples collected at 4 time points
      while clinical chemistry parameters will be assessed in blood samples withdrawn at 6
      different time points.
