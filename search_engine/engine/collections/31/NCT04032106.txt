      I. Determine the efficacy of the Outsmart HPV intervention on increasing HPV vaccine
      initiation and completion.

      II. Identify mediators that explain the relationship between study arm and HPV vaccine
      initiation and completion.

      III. Determine if intervention efficacy differs across key demographic and health-related
      characteristics of participants.

      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 3 groups.

      GROUP A: Participants receive standard information about HPV and HPV vaccine via a
      mobile-friendly website.

      GROUP B: Participants receive Outsmart HPV with unidirectional vaccine reminders (i.e.
      reminders that do not give participants the option to respond).

      GROUP C: Participants receive Outsmart HPV with interactive vaccine reminders (i.e. reminders
      that allow participants to respond).

      Participants in all study group are followed for 9 months.
