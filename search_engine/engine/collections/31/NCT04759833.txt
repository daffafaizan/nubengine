    
      This study consists of a 12-week double-blind, placebo-controlled part (Part A) followed by a
      36-week double-blind safety extension part (Part B). Participants aged 3 to 17 years are
      planned for randomization in a 1:1:1 ratio to the Low Dose Group, High Dose Group, or
      matching placebo (placebo-controlled part [Part A]). After completion of Part A, participants
      in the placebo group will be re-randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the Low Dose Group or the High
      Dose Group (safety extension part [Part B]). Randomization at study entry will be stratified
      by toilet-trained status.
