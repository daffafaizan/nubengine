      Primary

        -  To validate the accuracy of the My Profile Pediatric Assay to predict risk of relapse in
           pediatric patients with non-M3 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who responded to
           cytarabine-based induction chemotherapy.

      Secondary

        -  To validate the continuous score from the pre-specified classifier as a predictor of
           relapse after response to induction chemotherapy, while controlling for the simultaneous
           effects of the following clinical and laboratory variables: age, WBC, ethnicity,
           cytogenetics, Flt3-ITD, NPM1, MRD, and bone marrow (BM) donor availability.

        -  To validate the accuracy of the prespecified low versus high relapse indicator variable
           (I_L/H) as a predictor of relapse after induction therapy.

        -  To validate the accuracy of the prespecified I_L/H as a predictor of relapse after
           induction therapy, while controlling for the simultaneous effects of the following
           clinical and laboratory variables: MRD, age, WBC, ethnicity, cytogenetics, Flt3-ITD,
           NPM1, and BM donor availability.

      OUTLINE: Archived bone marrow mononuclear cells are analyzed by single cell network profile
      assay, the My Profileâ„¢ AML Risk of Relapse Assay. Molecular markers analyzed include
      Flt3-ITD, NPM1, and MRA. Results are then correlated with each patient's clinical data
      including patient's age, race/ethnic background, gender, treatment received, and outcomes.
