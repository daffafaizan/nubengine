    
      15 healthy volunteers, between 20 and 45 years old, will use during 48 hours two specific
      oral devices with 3 glass disks each. After this period, one of the disk will be drawn from
      the device and it will be immersed in Live/Dead BacLight solution for 15 minutes and then the
      disk will be analysed by the Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope (CLSM). Immediately, another
      disk will be removed from the intraoral device and immersed in the antiseptic solution, being
      analysed by the CLSM as well. After that, the volunteers will do the mouthwash with the
      antiseptic solution (as stated in the specific protocol) and the last disk will be drawn from
      the device and will be analysed by the CLSM following the same protocol. The other 3 disk
      will undergo the same protocol of baseline, immersion and mouthwash, but with the other
      antiseptic solution.

      The CLSM data will be analysed and the bacterial vitality, thickness and covering grade will
      be calculated. Finally the statistical analysis will be applied (Pairwise comparisons, with
      the Bonferroni adjustment).
