    
      To evaluate the agreement between the methylation index of the 11p15 region obtained using
      DNA extracted from amniocytes and that extracted from cord blood leukocytes, by calculating
      the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC).

      Ancillary study :

      This second part of the study aims to determine the standard of methylation index of the
      11p15 region (inclusion of 100 additional patients). The use of amniotic liquid will allow to
      calculate :

        -  the average of methylation index,

        -  the value of the standard deviation

        -  the inter-assay coefficient of variation for the test-used.
