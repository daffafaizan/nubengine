      Diabetes and Cardiovascular Disease (CVD). However, on average, Norther Americans consume
      less than half of the recommended amount set by health agencies. It has been proposed that
      the health benefits of dietary fibre may be attritbuted to rheological characteristics such
      as viscosity. Salvia hispanica L (Salba) and Flax are nutritionally similar. The primary
      objective of this research trial is to study the effects of Salba and Flax on postprandial
      glycemia and appetite in healthy individuals.
