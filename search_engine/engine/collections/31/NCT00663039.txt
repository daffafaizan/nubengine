      markers of negative symptoms in 24 participants with schizophrenia spectrum traits. Subjects
      will be tested in two one-day studies carried out at least a month apart. Subjects will
      receive a 24 IU dose of intranasal oxytocin (or placebo) followed by a battery of
      cognitive/neurophysiological tests administered 50 minutes later completed over the next 155
      minutes. A second dose of the drug (oxytocin or placebo) will be administered 2 hours after
      the 1st in order to maintain therapeutic plasma levels and to complete all testing.
