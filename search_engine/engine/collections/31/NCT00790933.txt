      treat people who have ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease. This study will determine the
      safety profile of long-term vedolizumab treatment.

      The study enrolled 2243 patients. Participants who received either placebo or vedolizumab 300
      mg IV infusion every 4 or 8 weeks in previous vedolizumab studies received:

      â€¢ Vedolizumab 300 mg

      All participants received vedolizumab intravenous infusion every 4 weeks for approximately up
      to 510 weeks.

      This multicenter trial is being conducted worldwide. The overall time to participate in this
      study was up to October 2017 until vedolizumab was available in the country in which the
      participant resided, or until participant withdrawal, whichever came first. Participants made
      multiple visits to the clinic up to 16 weeks after receiving their last dose of vedolizumab
      and were being followed up for 2-years during which a safety questionnaire was administered
      by telephone for follow-up assessments.
