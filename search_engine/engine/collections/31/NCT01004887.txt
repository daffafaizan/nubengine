    
      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic relevance of various molecular, cytogenetic,
           and other tumor markers in high-grade glioma in paraffin-embedded tissue collected from
           patients enrolled in the Mayo Clinic or North Central Cancer Treatment Group (NCCTG)
           high-grade glioma trials conducted since 1979.

        -  To evaluate alterations of specific chromosomes and chromosomal regions including 7, 9p,
           10p, 10q, 13q, 17p, 17q, 19q, 22q, X, and Y using PCR analysis of microsatellite repeats
           and FISH.

        -  To determine DNA ploidy by flow cytometric analysis.

        -  To examine various markers of cellular proliferation and cellular function including
           flow cytometric determination of %S-phase, %G2M, and immunohistochemical evaluation of
           PCNA, Ki-67, and p53.

        -  To evaluate additional markers identified by the Glioma Markers Network.

        -  To compare the incidence of markers in the major histologic subtypes (anaplastic
           astrocytoma [AA], anaplastic oligoastrocytoma [AOA], glioblastoma multiforme [GBM]) and
           to assess their correlation in the total group, as well as within each of these
           subtypes.

        -  To compare the ploidy determinations by FISH and flow cytometry.

      OUTLINE: Paraffin-embedded tissue and peripheral blood samples, previously or currently
      collected from clinical trials participants at the time she/he enrolled in the trial, are
      evaluated for as many markers as possible, changes in cytogenic and molecular genetic tumor
      markers, frequency distributions of all tumor markers and histological and clinical variables
      by polymerase chain reaction, IHC, flow cytometry, and FISH analysis.
