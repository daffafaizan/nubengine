      common consequences of intimate partner violence, research has generally not differentiated
      the effects of different types of intimate partner violence on victim's mental health. With
      intimate partner violence treated as a single phenomenon rather than having different types,
      abused women are unlikely to receive the most appropriate interventions.

      Johnson's typology of control has been used increasingly to classify intimate partner
      violence based on physical assault and controlling behavior. Two distinct types of the
      violence, Intimate Terrorism and Situational Couple Violence, have received much attention.
      The two differ not only in the cause and trajectory of the violence but also in the effects
      including mental health outcomes. Although control is a critical factor in distinguishing
      intimate terrorism from situational couple violence, there is no consensus on what
      constitutes high or low control in physically violent intimate relationships. Partly, this
      may be due to the sole reliance on quantitative measures to determine the levels of control.
      By understanding the context in which control tactics are used, qualitatively different
      phenomena between violent relationships with high control and those with low control may be
      more apparent. Thus, there is a need to collect both quantitative and qualitative data on the
      use of controlling behaviors.

      It has also been hypothesized that intimate terrorism and situational couple violence have
      different mental health outcomes but few studies have examined this empirically and none has
      studied women's experiences of the negative psychological consequences as victims of these
      two types of violence.
