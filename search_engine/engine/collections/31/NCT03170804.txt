      nodules will have a complete clinical and US evaluation. Thyroid nodule biopsy indication and
      FNA vs core biopsy choices will be made entirely on the clinical grounds, by the managing
      physicians. Thyroid nodule biopsies may be performed at a participating medical or surgical
      endocrinology office. Following standard cytologic examination a molecular testing using
      Thyroseq will be performed.

      The biopsy results will be categorized according to Bethesda scoring system. Category I is
      non-diagnostic FNA and will require a repeat FNA. Category II is benign cytology, categories
      III, IV and V are the indeterminate group, and category VI is malignant cytology. The FNA
      analysis of registry patients will be collected under six groups. Thyroseq molecular testing
      may be deferred if not felt needed following cytology.

        1. Cytology(benign) / Thyroseq(-)

        2. Cytology(benign) / Thyroseq(+)

        3. Cytology(indeterminate) / Thyroseq(-)

        4. Cytology(indeterminate) / Thyroseq(+)

        5. Cytology(Malignant) / Thyroseq(-)

        6. Cytology(Malignant) / Thyroseq(+). Thyroid operation indication and lobectomy vs total
           thyroidectomy choices will be made entirely on the clinical grounds, by the managing
           physicians. The routine histopathology will be processed and reported as per the
           institutional protocols. The molecular testing of the preoperatively biopsied and
           intraoperatively and postoperatively identified lesions will be performed, as indicated.

      The registry is open to all interested physicians involved in thyroid patient care and
      interested in participating
