    
      The CHILD Clinic Patient Registry is an observational study designed to identify
      epidemiologic and genetic factors associated with chronic lung disease in former preterm
      infants or those with lung disease in the neonatal period.The Patient Registry is used by
      both clinicians and researchers to better understand BPD and to improve care of individuals
      with BPD. It is used to assess phenotype and genotype information from former preterm infants
      with lung disease. Data in the Patient Registry will be analyzed and an regular report of BPD
      health trends will be created. Using this information, BPD clinicians can address quality
      improvement initiatives, and examine changing health care issues, including nutritional
      status, infection control, pulmonary treatment, metabolic and associated genetic variants.
      The Patient Registry will also play an important role in directing clinical care and in the
      design of clinical research studies. Researchers use the registry to help in investigating
      various aspects of neonatal lung diseases like BPD, including medications, diagnostic
      procedures, and eligibility for clinical trials.
