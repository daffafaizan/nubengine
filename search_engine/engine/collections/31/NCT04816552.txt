    
      Aim 1. Develop an evidence and theory based WASH mHealth intervention for households in areas
      with confirmed cholera patients in Dhaka, Bangladesh through formative research

        1. Conduct formative research through in-depth interviews, focus group discussions, and
           intervention planning workshops with caregivers and household members of young children,
           and government officials to identify perceptions of WASH behaviors and to inform the
           development of intervention materials.

        2. Pilot the WASH mHealth intervention in a subset of households, and revise according to
           feedback.

      Aim 2: Evaluate the effectiveness of the developed WASH mHealth intervention in increasing
      WASH behaviors and reducing fecal contamination on hands and in stored drinking water by
      conducting a RCT

        1. Recruit and prospectively follow for 12 months 120 households (600 participants, 4 per
           household) with a child under five years of age assigned to one of two study arms (60
           households per arm). The first arm will receive the CHoBI7 mHealth program (CHoBI7
           mHealth program Arm) and the second arm will serve as a Control Arm and only receive a
           general message on oral rehydration solution (ORS).

        2. Compare the 2 study arms using structured observation of handwashing with soap at stool
           and food related events, unannounced spot checks of the presence of soap in the cooking
           and latrine areas of the household, and fecal coliform counts on caregiver hands and in
           stored drinking water.
