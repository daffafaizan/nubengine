      hemodialysis access. The autologous arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is the golden standard of
      dialysis access. Unfortunately a great number of the AVFs fail to mature, and therefore
      cannot be used for dialysis. A significant stenosis is a major cause of nonmaturing AVFs.

      Remarkable are the stenoses that seem to develop in the venous outflow tract where the
      vascular clamp was located during surgery. The primary aim of this study was to compare
      bloodless surgery using vascular clamps and a tourniquet with respect to the development of
      hemodynamic or anatomical significant stenosis in patients with a brachiocephalic or
      radiocephalic AVF.
