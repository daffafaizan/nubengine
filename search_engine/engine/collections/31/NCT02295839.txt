      Previous studies have demonstrated that children on Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL)
      maintenance therapy have problematic sleep patterns and experience fatigue. This pilot
      randomized controlled trial examined the feasibility, acceptability and effectiveness of an
      intervention to improve sleep quality and decrease fatigue levels in children aged 4-10, with
      a diagnosis of ALL, during maintenance treatment. Families were randomized to usual care or
      the intervention. The intervention included a sleep hygiene and relaxation education session
      with a nurse practitioner, literature for home, two story books, and a follow-up phone call.
      Self-reported measures were used in addition to actigraphy to measure children's quality and
      quantity of sleep. Sleep tips were evaluated by intervention group families.
