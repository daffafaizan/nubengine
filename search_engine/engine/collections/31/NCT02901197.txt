    
      The objective of this study is to develop a multi-faceted implementation program (referred to
      as the Capnography At the Bedside: Leading Emergency Education (CapABLE Trial)) to increase
      the use of capnography during two critical events in the emergency department, intubation and
      CPR, for better detection of endotracheal intubation, endotracheal tube dislodgement, and
      quality CPR.

      The specific aims of the proposed study are to examine:

        1. the effect of a comprehensive theory-based educational intervention on staff knowledge
           and skills related to capnography (outcome measure).

        2. the effect of a multi-faceted implementation program on the adherence to national
           guidelines regarding the use of capnography during critical events in the emergency
           department (process measure).

        3. the sustainability of effects of the implementation program on adherence, knowledge and
           skills (outcome and process measure).

      The design and methods of this study are based on the knowledge transfer framework, which
      dictates identification of the message, target audience, messenger, process and
      communication, and evaluation.
