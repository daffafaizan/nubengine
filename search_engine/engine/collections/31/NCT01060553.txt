      make up war-related Trauma Spectrum Disorder in both TBI and PTSD patients, including pain,
      stress and anxiety, insomnia, somatic and post-operative pain. Recent studies find very large
      effect sizes (Cohen's D .85 to 1.4). Thus, there is good reason to believe that acupuncture
      will induce recovery across a number of trauma spectrum dysfunctions in patients with TBI and
      PTSD, at low cost and with little risk.

      Project Objectives: The overall objective of this application is to determine the efficacy of
      adjunctive acupuncture for improving quality of life and function and alleviating
      co-morbidities associated with TBI and PTSD in service members injured in the current wars.
      The primary hypothesis of this study is: OIF/OEF veterans who screen positive for TBI or PTSD
      and are treated with a 12 week standard individualized acupuncture method will experience
      improved HRQL (as measured by the Veteran's SF-36) at 6, 12 and 24 week follow-up, compared
      to veterans randomly assigned to standard care alone.

      Project Methods: This is a pilot study on veterans who screen positive for TBI or PTSD in the
      VA healthcare record, which is being submitted to obtain additional pilot data, confirmation
      of recruitment strategies, and information on non-participants . Frequency distribution and
      summary statistics for demographics and baseline variables will be presented by intervention
      group and for all subjects combined. Key demographic variables to be summarized are: age,
      gender, time to deployment, number of deployments, and diagnosis. Key baseline variables are:
      PTSD CAPS score, VSF-36, and ANAM score.
