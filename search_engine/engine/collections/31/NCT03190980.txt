      study of healthy full term newborns delivered by normal vaginal delivery, undergoing heel
      prick test. They will be randomized to receive either 5% glucose, 30% glucose or sterile
      water as a placebo, 2 minutes prior to the procedure. The investigators will study the
      efficacy and safety of oral glucose, in different strengths, compared to placebo (sterile
      water) in pain alleviation.

      All parents will receive an explanation of the study before participation, and informed
      written consent will be signed by the parents for voluntary participation
