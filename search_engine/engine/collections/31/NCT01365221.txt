    
      This is a prospective, open-label, non-randomized trial of approximately 260 patients with
      Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). In order
      to compare platelet reactivity, as assessed by the VerifyNow P2Y12 assay, we plan to recruit
      two study groups of interest:

        1. Patients who have already received a 600 mg loading dose (LD) of clopidogrel in
           preparation for PCI will receive a loading dose of 60 mg of prasugrel.

        2. Patients who have not received a LD of clopidogrel will receive a 60 mg LD of prasugrel
           prior to PCI.

      A subset of 40 patients from each study group (80 patients total) will undergo additional
      platelet reactivity testing with the vasodilator stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) assay.All
      patients will be followed throughout the duration of the hospital stay.
