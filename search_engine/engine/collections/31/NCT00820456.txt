      MRI (DCE-MRI) as a surrogate marker of tumor vascularity in patients treated with the
      antiangiogenic agent bevacizumab. DCE-MRI is gaining popularity as a method to assess the
      functional response of tumors to agents targeting the vascular endothelial growth factor
      (VGEF) pathways. DCE-MRI measurements have been proposed as a non-invasive measure of both
      tumor biologic activity and (in the case of antivascular therapy) early response to
      treatment. A number of phase I and II studies demonstrate the ability for DCE-MRI to detect
      perfusion changes associated with tumor biologic response to vascularly targeted agents. It
      has been suggested that pre-treatment DCE-MRI might identify tumors with high intrinsic
      perfusion and that these tumors will be more likely to respond to antivascular-based
      therapies. However, the current use of DCE-MRI in clinical settings is challenging.
      Trade-offs between spatial coverage, time, and spatial resolution make this technique
      difficult to implement in human studies and may limit its reliability. The use of projection
      reconstruction-based acquisition can mitigate the need for these trade-offs and can
      simultaneously provide high temporal and spatial resolution data for DCE-MRI analysis.
