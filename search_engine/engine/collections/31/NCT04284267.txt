      magnetic stimulation (iTBS-TMS) to ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) can improve
      performance on emotion regulation tasks in patients with bipolar disorder. Results from this
      study will help inform future treatment development to improve emotion regulation in patients
      with bipolar disorder. The study will proceed in two phases: During Phase 1, a cohort of 30
      healthy control subjects will be recruited in order to establish a normative sample from
      which to compare patient data. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data will be
      collected from healthy control participants during performance on two emotion regulation
      tasks (probing implicit and explicit emotion regulation). Data from these subjects will
      provide a normative distribution of VLPFC function from which to compare individual patients.
      During Phase 2, a cohort of 60 patients diagnosed with bipolar disorder will be recruited.
      Patient participants will perform the same two emotion regulation tasks during fMRI scanning.
      Data from individual patients will be analyzed to detect specific VLPFC subregions showing
      activation deviations from healthy controls (Phase 1 data). Patient-specific VLPFC subregions
      showing patterns of activation greater than two standard deviations from healthy controls
      will be used as individualized target sites for TMS stimulation. Patients will then be
      randomized to receive either low-dose iTBS-TMS (600 pulses; n=20), high-dose iTBS-TMS (1800
      pulses; n=20), or sham iTBS-TMS (n=20). Post-TMS fMRI scans will be acquired during
      performance on identical implicit and explicit emotion regulation tasks from baseline.
      Effects of iTBS-TMS on emotion regulation will be evaluated by comparing pre-TMS versus
      post-TMS behavior, neural activation, and functional connectivity patterns during performance
      on implicit and explicit emotion regulation tasks.
