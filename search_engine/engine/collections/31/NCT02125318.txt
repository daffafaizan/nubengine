    
      This is an open-label, single-arm, multicenter, Phase 2 study of anagrelide CR in subjects
      with an MPN-related thrombocytosis. Eligible subjects will include those who have not been
      previously treated for thrombocytosis or have not received platelet-lowering therapy for at
      least 2 weeks prior to study treatment. Each subject will receive anagrelide CR at a starting
      dose of 0.5 mg b.i.d. (1.0 mg/day), and is anticipated to continue study treatment for at
      least 24 weeks. Subjects who have achieved clinical benefit in the opinion of the
      Investigator and who are tolerating the study drug may continue study treatment until they
      develop unacceptable toxicity or other discontinuation criteria have been met.

      The primary efficacy endpoint will be the proportion of subjects who achieve a platelet
      response (CR or PR). The safety and tolerability of study treatment will be assessed by the
      frequency and severity of adverse events as determined by NCI Common Terminology Criteria for
      Adverse Events (CTCAE) v 4.03. The PK profile of anagrelide CR will be assessed at the
      initial (0.5mg b.i.d.) and final titrated dose levels.
