    
      Open-label, non-randomized, multicentre phase 2 study with a safety run-in evaluating
      efficacy and safety of PQR309 in patients with relapsed or refractory lymphoma.

      The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of PQR309 in patients with advanced solid tumours was
      defined as 80 mg once daily given continuously (q.d. schedule) in a previous phase 1 study
      [8]. The safety run-in of this study will follow a modified 3 + 3 design to evaluate the
      safety of 60 and 80 mg PQR309 in patients with relapsed or refractory lymphoma administered
      p.o. once daily during a DLT (dose-limiting toxicity) period of 28 days.

      In the safety run-in, three patients will be treated at 60 mg PQR309 for 28 days. Enrollment
      and treatment of all three patients may occur simultaneously as 80 mg PQR309 p.o. qd was
      established as the MTD maximum tolerated dose in solid tumours. Unless a DLT (dose-limiting
      toxicity) is observed in any of the three patients during the first 28 days of treatment, the
      investigators and the sponsor will decide to escalate the dose to 80 mg.Intermittent dosing
      schedules may be evaluated if, based on the overall evaluation of all the clinical and PK
      (pharmacokinetic) data from this and other studies with PQR309, data emerge during the step 1
      of the phase 2 expansion in this PQR309 002A study, indicating that daily dosing of PQR309 is
      not adequately tolerated or inefficacious.
