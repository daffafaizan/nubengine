    
      The study has an umbrella design with 2 sub-studies: sub-study A (randomizing patients with
      PD-L1 positive tumours 1:1 into MEDI4736 (durvalumab) vs. Standard of Care) and sub-study B
      (randomizing patients with PD-L1 negative tumours 2:3:1:2 into MEDI4736 (durvalumab) vs.
      MEDI4736 (durvalumab) plus tremelimumab vs. tremelimumab vs. Standard of Care. The two
      substudies may have different durations of recruitment periods due to differences in patient
      population (PD-L1 expression). They may not run concurrently with start and completion of
      recruitment potentially occurring at different time points.
