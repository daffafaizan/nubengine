    
      Multicenter, open-label, randomized, controlled phase III clinical trial to evaluate and
      compare the activity and safety of an experimental arm consisting of PM01183/DOX combination
      followed by PM01183 alone, if applicable vs. best Investigator's choice between CAV or
      topotecan as a control arm, in SCLC patients who failed one prior platinum-containing line
      but no more than one prior chemotherapy-containing line.
