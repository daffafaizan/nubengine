      their dose level at discontinuation or completion of the BUP3201 core study. Subjects are
      allowed to titrate after 48 hours to BTDS 10 or 20 that provided stable pain control with
      minimal tolerability problems. Additional medical therapies are permitted if necessary, and
      there is no restriction on concomitant analgesic medications. The subjects have weekly visits
      for 4 consecutive weeks, and every 4 weeks thereafter, until the end of the scheduled
      extension phase.
