      intervention (HIWL) will lead to significant weight loss and diabetes remission in
      individuals with a Body Mass Index (BMI) 30-39.9 kg/m2 with T2DM of less than 6 years as
      compared to a diabetes self-management education intervention (DSME). Complete diabetes
      remission is considered to be achieved when the patient is not taking any anti-diabetes
      medication for at least 12 months, and the Glycated Hemoglobin (HbA1c) is < 5.7%. Partial
      remission is achieved when the patient is not taking any anti-diabetes medication and has an
      HbA1c of 5.7-6.4% for at least 12 months. Using a randomized controlled study design, the
      study team will randomly assign 30 participants to HIWL or DSME. Participants assigned to
      HIWL will receive a high intensity behavioral weight loss intervention delivered using a
      digital patient engagement platform. Participants will be prescribed a low calorie dietary
      plan and a recommended physical activity program designed to produce 15-20% weight loss over
      12 months. Those assigned to DSME will participate in a comprehensive diabetes education
      program designed to provide education and skills for optimal diabetes management plus
      lifestyle modification counseling to produce 5% weight loss over the same timeframe. The
      primary outcome of weight loss will be assessed at 12 months.
