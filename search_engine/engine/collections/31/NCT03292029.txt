      risk for cardiovascular (CV) disease in dialysis patients. A novel in vitro test (T50
      Calcification Inhibition Test, T50 CIT) has been developed, which measures the mineralization
      inhibition capacity of blood. This pilot study aims to exploratory examine the predictive
      power of baseline T50 CIT and fetuin-A (protein which is centrally involved in the inhibition
      of the formation of crystalline hydroxyapatite) values in terms of their association with
      all-cause mortality in an unselected cohort of haemodialysis patients. Moreover, the study
      shall investigate the association between baseline T50 CIT and fetuin-A values with CV
      related mortality, all-cause hospitalization and CV related hospitalization. Finally, the
      study aims to compare the predictive power of T50 CIT values with a set of six established
      calcification-related parameters (albumin, phosphate, calcium, magnesium, bicarbonate and
      fetuin-A). After baseline blood sampling the patients will be followed for 2 years.
