      the macula in older ages. It is irreversible if the pigment epithelium is lost (dry AMD), but
      wet AMD can be arrested or delayed with the use of intraocular injections of one of 3
      different compounds. All three drugs are injected into the eye in minute doses of usually 0.1
      ml. These are usually injected at 4 to 6 week intervals and treatment may be extended for
      several years. Different patterns of injection times are followed but usually are monthly for
      12 or more months, or monthly for 3 months and then extended observation at one to two month
      intervals unless vision (visual acuity) declines or Optical Coherence Tomography-angiography
      (OCT-A) shows recurrence of fluid or increase in size or amount of drusen (deposits of
      lipofuscin) in the retina. Vitelliform macular degeneration is a disorder that causes visual
      loss due to drusen in the macula, which have been shown to be identical to the deposits seen
      in macular degeneration. The goal of therapy in this proposal is to use sildenafil to
      increase choroidal blood flow to treat dry AMD and slow the progression of visual loss in
      vitelliform and age-related dry AMD as well as other macular, retinal and choroidal
      degenerations and dystrophies, as well as reduce or eliminate the number of injections
      required by slowing down transformation of dry AMD to wet AMD in treated patients.
