      aesthetically intrusive site; often the lateral thigh area, which is innervated by lateral
      femoral cutaneous nerve (LFCN). However if a larger graft area in needed then it will be
      obtained from the anterior aspect of the thigh, which is innervated by the femoral nerve.

      Regional nerve blockade has been proposed for skin graft harvest and proofed to provide
      better and longer standing analgesia. Application of fascia iliaca compartment block involves
      the distribution of anesthesia to the territories of the femoral and lateral cutaneous
      nerves.

      American society of regional anesthesia and pain medicine recommendations on local
      anesthetics in pediatric regional anesthesia in 2018 stated that the ultrasound guided
      fascial plane blocks as fascia iliaca block can be successfully and safely performed using a
      recommended dose of 0.25-0.75 mg/kg of bupivacaine 0.25%.

      Prolongation of analgesia after surgery under regional anaesthesia is a goal for clinicians.
      Many investigators have sought that the ideal analgesic adjuvant that would both prolongs
      pain relief and avoids side effects after a single-shot peripheral nerve block. Although many
      agents have failed this test (opioids, ketamine, clonidine, etc.), the perineural addition of
      dexamethasone to local anaesthetic has been shown in several studies to prolong the analgesic
      effect and its use has become common in clinical practice around the world. Not surprisingly,
      much research has been performed with the aim of providing Level 1 evidence via randomized
      controlled trials design and systematic review and meta-analysis. Despite this, there is
      still no adequate answer as to whether perineural dexamethasone is superior to systemic
      administration alone.
