    
      This is a Phase II dose-finding, randomized, multi-center, prospective, double blind clinical
      study. Subjects undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with the Presillionâ„¢ CoCr
      bare metal stent will be randomized into three groups and administered (in a single dose
      intravenously (IV) through a peripheral venous catheter) either: low dose Liposomal
      Alendronate of 0.001 mg, high dose Liposomal Alendronate of 0.01 mg, or placebo (IV saline
      infusion) on a 1:1:1 basis.

      All subjects will undergo angiographic follow-up at 6 months and 110 subjects enrolled from
      pre-specified sites will undergo intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) at baseline and follow-up at
      6 months.
