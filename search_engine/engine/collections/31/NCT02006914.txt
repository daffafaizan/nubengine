      glucose uptake by increasing the insulin receptor-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of
      insulin receptor substrate-1, resulting in increased association with phosphatidylinositol
      3-kinase.

      Specific Aim 1 will assess quantitative improvements in insulin-mediated glucose disposal in
      a placebo-controlled clinical trial of chromium supplementation with 1000mpg (19.2 pmol) of
      chromium as chromium picolinate, overa two-month course of therapy. The investigators have
      shown that the insulin resistance (i.e. the inability of insulin to stimulate glucose uptake
      into peripheral tissues like muscle) in patients with HIV disease is associated with a defect
      in the insulin-signaling pathway leading from the insulin receptor, through
      phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase(PI 3-K, Figure 5). A similar defect in intracellular signaling
      has also been reported in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus ):15-171. The cellular
      mechanism of improved insulin sensitivity with chromium supplementation will be determined in
      Specific Aim 2.

      Specific Aim 2 will assess the effect of chromium supplementation on the insulin-stimulated
      activity of insulin receptor substrate-I-associated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase in biopsies
      of muscle and fat tissue. This aim will also test the hypothesis that these physiological
      effects of chromium are mediated by alterations in the activity of insulin signaling.
      Understanding this mechanism may facilitate the design of even more effective strategies for
      improving insulin sensitivity.
