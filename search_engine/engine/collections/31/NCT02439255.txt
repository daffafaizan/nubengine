      I. Determine the effect of black raspberry phytochemicals on community dynamics within oral
      biofilms.

      II. Examine the effect of oral bacterial communities on metabolism of black raspberry
      phytochemicals in current and never smokers.

      III. Evaluate the efficacy of black raspberry phytochemicals and their metabolites in
      reversing the effect of smoking on oral host-microbial interactions.

      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Participants receive bioactivity of black raspberry phytochemical-rich delivery
      vehicle (BRB nectar) orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 12 weeks.

      ARM II: Participants receive placebo nectar PO QD for 12 weeks.
