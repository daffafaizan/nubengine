      hospitalized participants (not requiring mechanical ventilation) with SARS CoV-2 infection,
      Participants will receive hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine with or without azithromycin.
      Investigators are primarily interested in the time to recovery. In addition to study
      medications there will be daily symptom surveys for 14 days, then weekly thereafter for 4
      weeks resulting in a total duration of follow up of 42 days. During hospitalization, daily
      symptom surveys will be completed in conjunction withthe study coordinators. On discharge
      participants will have the option to complete electronic symptom surveys or complete symptom
      surveys via telephone with study coordinator. In the event that the participant opts for
      electronic symptom surveys on discharge participants will in addition receive a follow up
      call from a study coordination every 7 days during the initial 14 day period. In addition,
      failure to submit a symptom survey will prompt a study follow up call. Data from SOC will be
      collected from medical records.
