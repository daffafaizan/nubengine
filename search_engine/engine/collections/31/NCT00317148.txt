      that secrete large amounts of the inactive precursor steroids dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA)
      and especially its sulfate DHEA-S. The marked reduction in the formation of DHEA-S by the
      adrenals during aging results in a dramatic fall in the formation of androgens and estrogens
      in peripheral target tissues, a situation that has been proposed to be associated with
      age-related diseases including skin atrophy, insulin resistance and obesity. Much attention
      has been given to the benefits of DHEA administered to postmenopausal women, especially on
      the bone, skin, vagina and well being after oral as well as percutaneous administration of
      the precursor steroid.

      This study proposes to study the effect of 50 mg oral DHEA capsules during a period of 4
      months administered to postmenopausal women experiencing 50 or more moderate to severe hot
      flushes per week. Participants will be stratified by the number of hot flushes experienced
      per week. The two strata are: 50-70 or more than 70 hot flushes per week. During the study
      several biological and clinical parameters will be evaluated, as well as the reduction of the
      number of hot flashes and improvement of overall quality of life.

      Subjects will be evaluated at specific time intervals during the study for the above
      mentioned parameters as well as tolerability and adverse reactions.
