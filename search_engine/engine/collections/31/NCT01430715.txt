    
      Fifteen children, aged 5- to 8- years, attending a nearby preschool, with a normal body mass
      index (BMI)-for-age percentile between, > 5th % to < 85th %.BMI, will participate in
      unstructured, outdoor play and one AVGs in a randomized order. Activity type, duration and
      intensity will be measured via accelerometery and direct observation. The EE will be
      calculated from Metabolic Equivalent (MET) values and the percent of time each activity meets
      MVPA intensity will be calculated. A MET is the energy cost of the activity expressed as
      kilocalories expended per kilogram of body weight per hour of activity (7). If EE and
      intensity in AVG play is similar to EE and intensity in outdoor play, then AVG play could be
      a great supplement to efforts aimed at increasing PA in children.

      Specific Aims:

        1. To measure the EE acquired in 15 minutes during an AVG, an adventure game, as compared
           to unstructured outdoor play in children 5- to 8- years of age.

        2. To compare the percent of time each activity meets the definition of MVPA (MET value >3)
           in children aged 5- to 8-years of age.
