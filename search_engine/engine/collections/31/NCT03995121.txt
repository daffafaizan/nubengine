      (namely schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders, and cannabis use disorder) with this
      exciting new PET tracer. Secondary outcomes will include electroencephalography (EEG). A
      battery of EEG paradigms assessing sensory, perceptual, and cognitive functions will also be
      administered. The primary dependent measures will be traditional event related potentials
      (ERPs; e.g. latency and amplitude) as well as time X frequency analysis (inter-trial
      coherence and spectral power).
