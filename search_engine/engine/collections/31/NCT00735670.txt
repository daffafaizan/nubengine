      depression, both alone and combined, are well documented in the literature. While a great
      deal of research has identified specific clinical indications for many antidepressants
      currently available in the general population, little is known about the clinical indications
      of these agents in SCI. This study is proposed to test the benefits of Venlafaxine HCI
      (Effexor XR) for reducing mild to moderate symptoms of depression among people with SCI. The
      intervention will last 12 weeks and there will be 13 assessments and data collection points.
      Data will be collected at 26 weeks also. Eight face to face contacts are anticipated.

      Because of the change in protocol to reducing mild to moderate symptoms and substantially
      lower enrollment than anticipated (1/6th of what we anticipated), we deleted a number of
      study outcomes listed in the 2011 posting of this study. Most of these were not part of the
      original posting in 2008, and those that were deleted were no longer relevant to new
      protocol's focus on reducing mild to moderate depression. The two outcomes reported here were
      most relevant to the revised protocol.
