      be responsible for causing Alzheimer's Disease (AD) by collecting genetic material from
      families with multiple members diagnosed with AD. Qualifying families will have two living
      blood-related individuals who have been diagnosed with or are showing symptoms of AD or
      dementia. Local study sites are located all over the United States, and arrangements may be
      made for eligible families who do not live near a participating site. The biological samples
      and data from these families will be made available to qualified researchers, who must sign a
      Materials Transfer Agreement (MTA) in order to protect the privacy rights of study
      participants before receiving DNA and data.
