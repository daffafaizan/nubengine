        -  100 anticipated subjects

        -  Data collection methods- Patients will be evaluated with serial history and physical
           exams, as well as EMG evaluations. Patients will be asked to report their degree of
           function and satisfaction.

        -  Data analysis methods -Data that we will collect from patients will serve as anecdotal
           evidence to support the research theory.

        -  We will collect data from patients from testings conducted at the hospital and private
           office. We will be conducting pre-testing, post-testing, compare results, and surveys.

        -  The anticipated significance of this research study is that this procedure may greatly
           improve the quality of life of these severely debilitated patients, reduce the morbidity
           and mortality rates, and reduce the health care cost burden of chronic care and
           recurrent hospitalizations.

        -  The BARS technique for incisional hernia reconstruction provides excellent reinforcement
           with improved contour, decreased recurrence rates and decreased morbidity for the
           abdominal wall.
