    
      This multi-center, open-label study is designed to evaluate the long-term safety and
      effectiveness of clobazam as adjunctive therapy in subjects with LGS. Subjects enrolled in
      Lundbeck LLC (formerly Ovation Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) sponsored studies
      13108A/OV1002/NCT00162981 and 13110A/OV1012/NCT00518713 who either completed the study or who
      prematurely discontinued were offered the opportunity to rollover into this open-label study.
      Subjects will start at a common dose level of 0.5 mg/kg, not to exceed 40 mg/day, and must
      maintain the dose level for 48 hours. After 48 hours, investigators will be able to increase,
      decrease or maintain the subject's dose, up to a maximum target daily dose of 2.0 mg/kg
      (maximum dose of 80 mg/day). During the treatment period, seizures will be recorded during
      the week preceding each study visit or 30 days immediately following each study visit
      (dependent on Amendment approval). The subject or subject's caregiver will record daily
      counts of seizures, including drop seizures in the subject's seizure diary.
