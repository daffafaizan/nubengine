    
      Patients between 18 and 90 years undergoing surgery of a vestibular schwannoma will be
      included in the study. Patients will be offered an application of triamcinolone acetonide
      intratympanically on the day before surgery.

      During surgery samples will be taken to define how much triamcinolone acetonide enters into
      the perilymphatic fluid, the perilymph of the semicircular canals and CSF.

      Patients undergoing translabyrinthine surgery will undergoing labyrinthectomy during which
      samples of the semicircular canal can be taken. During translabyrinthine surgery nerve
      monitoring will be carried out using an intracochlear electrode. Before inserting the
      electrode perilymph of the cochlea can be taken. Immediately after opening the dura
      cerebrospinal fluid will be taken. Patients undergoing middle fossa or retrosigmoid resection
      of the vestibular schwannoma will not undergo sampling of the perilymph. In these patients
      cerebrospinal fluid will be taken to determine triamcinolone acetonide levels.
