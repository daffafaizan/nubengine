      abdominal surgical operations such as cholecystectomy and fundoplication. With respect to the
      thorax, video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) is the accepted technique for biopsy of
      the lung and pleura and surgical treatment of pneumothorax. A VATS lobectomy with systematic
      node dissection (SND) for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has been gradually introduced by
      many thoracic surgeons since it was first performed in 1995 by McKenna and associates. They
      reported that the survival rate for stage I lung cancer is similar between lobectomies done
      by VATS and by thoracotomy. Although minimally invasive surgery certainly sounds good, it is
      problematic if it decreases patient's safety or the oncological treatment's effect. Hence,
      the feasibility and safety of SND by VATS remain controversial. In many institutions, the
      indication for VATS major pulmonary resection is limited to clinical stage I or II. For the
      application of the procedure to clinical stage IIIA, it remains controversial. Recently,
      Watanabe et al. did a retrospective study aimed at determining the outcome of patients with
      cN0-pN2 NSCLC who underwent VATS major pulmonary resection with SND versus the outcome after
      major pulmonary resection with SND by open thoracotomy. It demonstrated that VATS major
      pulmonary resection with SND was a feasible approach to management of cN0-pN2 NSCLC without
      loss of curability. It was unnecessary to convert the VATS approach to thoracotomy in order
      to do SND even if pN2 disease is revealed during VATS major pulmonary resection. The purpose
      of this study is to know whether VATS major pulmonary resection with SND for clinical stage
      IIIA non-small cell lung cancer is possible.
