      significant levels of antibodies in their blood leading to a longer wait time for a kidney
      transplant and death. Antibodies in the blood may be due to prior transplants, pregnancy, or
      blood transfusions. These antibodies sensitize a patient and make it more difficult for the
      patient to get a compatible kidney transplant. The measure of these antibodies is called
      panel reactive antibodies (PRA) and can range from 0-100%, with 100% being most sensitized.
      The waiting time for patients with a PRA in the range of 20%-79% is over 5 years as compared
      to patients with low PRA (0%-19%) which is 3-4 years. Patients with a PRA greater than 80%
      are likely to be granted extra points to increase the chances of transplantation. Antibodies
      in these patients may be due to prior transplants, pregnancy, or blood transfusions. To date,
      no trials with belimumab have been performed in patients with pre-existing antibodies
      awaiting kidney transplantation. This study is undertaken to assess the effectiveness and
      safety of using belimumab to normalize antibody levels in sensitized patients awaiting kidney
      transplantation. It is hoped that decreasing these antibodies will decrease the waiting time
      on the kidney transplant list, and allow the patient to become compatible with a donor kidney
      for transplant.
