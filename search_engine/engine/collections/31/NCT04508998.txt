      options available to them. Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is a potent vasoconstrictor implicated in the
      small vessel obstruction that causes MVA. The PRIZE trial will apply a precision medicine
      approach to assess the therapeutic effect of Zibotentan, an ET-1 antagonist (ETA) selective
      for the ETA receptor in patients who are high ET-1 expressors (possessing the PHACTR1 minor
      GG allele single nucleotide polymorphism - SNP). Unfortunately, the incidence of this SNP
      occurs in only a third of the population, resulting in a high screen-failure rate.

      In the proposed sub-study, we aim to recruit patients with MVA but without the minor GG
      allele SNP to potentially identify other potential 'responders' to Zibotentan. In an
      observational mechanistic study, we will perform baseline genotyping for other genetic
      variants in the ET-1 pathway as well as phenotyping patients by quantification of
      microvascular disease from retrospective analysis of cardiac MRI data. Patients will also
      complete angina and quality of life questionnaires and perform an exercise stress test to
      determine maximal exercise distance. Information from this sub-study will provide a genotype
      bio-resource that could identify novel SNPs for the pathogenesis of MVA that could be
      validated in the UK biobank. This may indicate other ETA receptor antagonist
      super-responders, justifying treatment with Zibotentan and enabling more patients with MVA to
      potentially benefit from this promising drug.
