      limb motor symptoms. Presently, the Lee Silverman Voice Treatment (LSVTÃ’ LOUD) - is a time
      intensive behavioral treatment for Parkinson's hypophonia. Facilitatory TMS is a safe and a
      complimentary stimulation technique. Brain imaging has also identified suitable target brain
      regions that are readily accessible to TMS. This combined treatment modality approach should
      be more effective and efficient the LSVT alone.

      The study will enroll patients with Parkinson's disease with moderate to severe hypophonia. A
      total of 36 patients will be recruited over 3 years and divided into 3 groups (n=12 each).
      The three cohorts are: 1. LSVT +sham TMS; 2. LSVT +left rTMS and 3. LSVT + right rTMS.

      This is a longitudinal double blind randomized controlled clinical trial. All investigators
      and study personnel will be blind to the study except for the PI responsible for TMS (Dr.
      Narayana). The entire protocol occurs over 19 weeks. During the first week, the participants
      will be screened, consented. During the second week, baseline behavioral and imaging data
      will be collected. Next, the patients will be randomized to one of the three treatment
      groups. Then the patients will enter a 4-week treatment phase, where they will receive
      TMS/sham TMS and LSVT 4 days a week for 4 weeks. During the seventh week, patients will
      undergo post treatment behavioral and imaging assessments. Then the patients will return in
      week 19 to complete the follow up behavioral measures and imaging session.
