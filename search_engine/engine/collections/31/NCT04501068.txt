      in airway management especially in day surgery. The Ambu® AuraGainTM (Ambu A/S, Ballerup,
      Denmark) is a new single-use, anatomically curved supraglottic airway with an integrated
      gastric access port designed to provide functional separation of the respiratory and
      digestive tracts allowing the exit of gastric contents and the passage of a gastric tube to
      manage gastric contents.

      Its characteristics in the design, composition by a smooth and atraumatic material, the
      presence of the gastric drainage access, with potential improved patient safety and its
      characteristic of being disposable, suggests a significant expansion of its use in the coming
      years.

      The series in the literature reporting performance or safety of use of the Ambu® AuraGainTM
      come from studies on selected cases and in certain surgical procedures. However, there are
      limited studies that have evaluated the efficacy of the device in routine clinical practice
      in patients intervened in ambulatory surgery and performed by a single investigator.
