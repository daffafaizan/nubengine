      in vascular homeostasis. In animal models of ischemia, endothelial progenitor cells are
      rapidly incorporated into sites of neovascularization, have the potential to induce and
      augment vasculogenesis/ angiogenesis, prevent cardiomyocyte apoptosis in peri-infarct
      regions, and reduce adverse remodeling. Treatment with atorvastatin has been shown to
      increase endothelial progenitor cell count in patients with coronary artery disease.
      Therefore, we will investigate whether atorvastatin augments the number of endothelial
      progenitor cells after cardiopulmonary bypass in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass
      surgery (CABG). Thus, we conducted a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-way
      parallel trial in 60 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery. Patients will
      receive either 2-week treatment with atorvastatin or placebo prior to surgery. Endothelial
      progenitor cells will be quantitated by flow cytometric phenotyping obtained from peripheral
      blood samples. In addition, cardiac markers (CK-MB mass, cardiac troponin-I), biochemical
      profile, liver function tests, high sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and coagulation
      profile will be determined at 4 time points: 1) preoperatively (baseline); 2) 6 hours after
      the end of cardiopulmonary bypass; 3) 24 hours after surgery; 4) 5th days postoperatively.
      Clinical, operative characteristics, cardiac markers, high sensitive C-reactive protein and
      endothelial progenitor cell count will be compared between the groups. Adverse outcomes will
      also be noted and reported.
