      chronic kidney disease (CKD).Both nonselective and selective vitamin D receptor activators
      (VDRAs) are demonstrated in many studies for their efficacy on suppression of PTH. Most of
      them are quite expensive and unavailable in many countries. Calcitriol and alfacalcidol are
      less expensive and worldwidely distributed. There is only one short-term study which directly
      compares these two drugs. This study demonstrates that calcitriol is superior to
      alfacalcidol. However, alfacalcidol is a prohormone of calcitriol. It has to be converted by
      25-hydroxylase at the liver to generate 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 to act on target cells. Many
      pharmacokinetics studies demonstrate that alfacalcidol has lower AUC compared to calcitriol
      if they are administered in the same dose. Therefore, the authors hypothesize that
      alfacalcidol may be equivalently efficacious as calcitriol if its dose is adjusted according
      to the pharmacokinetics studies.
