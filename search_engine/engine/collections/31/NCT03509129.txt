    
      This 3-month randomized controlled trial is designed to investigate the efficacy and
      feasibility of a novel, technology-oriented physical activity intervention characterized by
      existing social networks and a team competition. Participants will be recruited via emails,
      fliers, and word of mouth. They will be randomized to a technology-mediated physical activity
      treatment (TECH) or a treatment which receives an identical intervention as TECH plus a study
      designed team competition for physical activity promotion (TECH+COMP).
