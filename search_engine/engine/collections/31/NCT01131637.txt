      RhNRG-1(recombinant human neuregulin-1)directly work on the cardiomyocyte and restored the
      normal structure and function of it. Both the preclinical trial and phase II clinical trail
      have confirmed that rhNRG-1 effectively enhance the heart function and reverse the remodeling
      of left ventricular in heart failure animals and humans. In this study, we will evaluate
      efficacy of rhNRG-1 in reducing the death rate of heart failure.
