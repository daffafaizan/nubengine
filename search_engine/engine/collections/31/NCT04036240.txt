      multi-nutrients fortification including protein, long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid, and
      micro-nutrients improves infant growth during hospitalization and health outcomes. A study of
      predominantly breastfed preterm infants with fortification after discharge shows better
      growth than unsupplemented counterparts at 3 months corrected age. Another study showed that
      post discharged growth of < 1800 g infants with human milk fortifier (HMF) supplementation
      until 48 weeks gestational age improved. But without the intensive lactation counselling the
      breast milk in HMF group were lower than control group if artificial teats were used. 4.
      Finger feeding is an alternative method to feed infants to increase successful breastfeeding,
      but unpopular in Indonesia. Study on finger feeding are still limited and most study of them
      are not randomized trial. We evaluate the method of supplementation on breastfeeding rate,
      growth and safety. We also do in depth interview with those who have high or low compliance.
