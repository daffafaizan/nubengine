      enhances gastrointestinal maturation. The gastrointestinal maturation will be evaluated by
      the ability of premature infants to achieve complete enteral feeds. The insulin concentration
      administered in the study is physiological and within the insulin concentration range present
      in human breast milk and colostrum.
