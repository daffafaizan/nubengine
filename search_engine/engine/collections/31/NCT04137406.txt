    
      The study has three parts.

        1. In large specimens of human Luminal A breast cancer with T1 tumor and positive axillary
           lymph node, study the difference expression of SIRT1 and related p53, Bcl-2,
           autophagy-related protein caspase-3, apaf-1 between primary tumor and lymph node
           metastases. Collect 50 pairs of T1 primary tumors and corresponding metastatic lymph
           node specimens. Using immunohistochemistry, anti-SIRT1, p53, Bcl-2, caspase-3 and apaf-1
           antibody staining to identify the expression of above proteins in the primary tumor and
           lymph node metastases.

        2. Eighty patients with Luminal type A breast cancer (T1N+) were enrolled in this study. At
           the same time,eighty patients were enrolled in the paraffin-embedded specimens of the
           patients with T2N+ and T3N+,too. And all patients were followed up. Immunohistochemical
           staining with anti-SIRT1, p53, Bcl-2, caspase-3, apaf-1, E-cadherin, N-cadherin,
           Vimentin antibodies to determine the relationship between above protein expression and
           routine clinicopathological and survival.

        3. Explore the involvement of SIRT1 in hormone receptor-positive human breast cancer cells
           at the cellular level. The molecular mechanism of EMT-related protein regulation, which
           affects the proliferation, invasion and metastasis of tumor cells.
