    
      Objective(s) and Hypothesis(es): The objectives to be evaluated are as follows:

      Specific Hypothesis #1: Heart disease, specifically dilated cardiomyopathy, can be identified
      early in patients with muscular dystrophy and allow for earlier institution of medical
      therapies

      Specific Hypothesis #2: Non-invasive testing via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and
      echocardiography can identify early systolic and diastolic dysfunction in patients with
      muscular dystrophy as well as document structural changes ("Reverse remodeling") following
      institution of medical therapy

      Specific Hypothesis #3: Serologic testing can identify early cardiac dysfunction prior to
      changes on magnetic resonance imaging or echocardiogram that can predict disease onset, risk
      stratify future cardiac morbidity and mortality, and response to medical therapy

      Specific Hypothesis #4: Specific dystrophin mutations can be identified that predict the
      onset or protection against dilated cardiomyopathy

      Specific Hypothesis #5: Construction and maintenance of a database of patients with muscular
      dystrophy can be established that will allow for future research in patients with muscular
      dystrophy, specifically in the area of gene therapy

      Specific Hypothesis #6: Quality of life in patients with cardiac disease can be assessed and
      used to modulate therapy and also allow for noncardiac directed therapies that will improve
      overall well-being

      Specific Hypothesis #7: Further understanding of neurohormonal profiles, responses to medical
      therapy, and dystrophin mediated cardiomyopathy will impact all patients with heart failure
      world-wide
