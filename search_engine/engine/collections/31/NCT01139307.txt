    
      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine whether megakaryocyte differentiation agents comprising a Rho kinase inhibitor
           and a JAK3 inhibitor can lead to proliferation arrest, polyploidization, and terminal
           differentiation of blasts in specimens from patients with Down syndrome and acute
           megakaryoblastic leukemia.

      OUTLINE: Cryopreserved specimens are cultured and treated in vivo (in mice) and in vitro with
      megakaryocytic differentiation agents comprising a Rho kinase inhibitor and a JAK3 inhibitor.
