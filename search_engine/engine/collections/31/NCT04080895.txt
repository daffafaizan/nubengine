      Clinical Therapeutic Unit, Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University. Subjects will be
      healthy HIV-1, hepatitis B and C uninfected individuals who comprehend the purpose of the
      study and have provided written consent. All subjects will undergo screening assessments
      (visit 1). Screening assessments (visit 1) may be carried out over more than one day,
      provided that all required assessments are completed within the 14 days prior to visit 2. If
      the interval between screening (visit 1) and day -1 visit 2 is three days or less, the
      clinical laboratory screening test result and serum pregnancy test result can be used for
      enrolment evaluation on day -1 visit 2. In such cases, these tests would not need to be
      repeated at day-1 visit 2.

      Visit 1 (Screening visit): All laboratory assessments (chemistry, hematology, FBS and
      urinalysis) must be drawn in the fasting state (8 hours fast) including serum pregnancy
      testing (if appropriate)

      Visit 2-4: 16 healthy subjects who fulfill the eligibility criteria will be recruited and
      randomized to the study. All laboratory assessments (chemistry, hematology, FBS and
      urinalysis) must be drawn in the fasting state (8 hours fast). Results of these tests are to
      be available and reviewed prior to each subject receiving the study drug on day 0.
