      Hospital for patients with indication of LEEP conization. After local IRB approval, patients
      were allocated in two arms (50 patients each): without vaginal pack (group 1 - GP1) and with
      vaginal pack (group 2 - GP2). The Monsel's solution was used in all patients. Intraoperative
      and postoperative outcomes will be evaluated: operative time, intraoperative and
      postoperative bleeding, hormonal status, age, parity and cone specimens' characteristics as
      well as short-term outcome were recorded and compared using Chi-square test, Fisher exact
      test and t-test where appropriate.
