    
      This research study is evaluating the effect of AMR101, as a chemopreventive agent to reduce
      risk of colorectal cancer in individuals with a history of colorectal cancer, colorectal mass
      or polyp(s).

      AMR101 is made of marine omega-3 fatty acid, which is a family of natural substances found in
      the oil of certain fish, such as salmon and mackerel. Marine omega-3 fatty acid cannot be
      produced in sufficient amount by the human body and has to be obtained through diet or
      supplemented to maintain normal function in the body.

      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved AMR101 as a treatment for any
      disease. AMR101 is commercially available in the US as VASCEPA (icosapent ethyl).

      The research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment including
      evaluations and follow up visits during which participants will complete a lifestyle
      questionnaire and a nutritional survey. A drug diary will be provided to be completed.
      Measurements will be taken, and blood and stool specimens will be collected. Tumor,
      colorectal mass, or polyp tissue will be collected for research purposes at the time of
      surgery or interventional endoscopy.

      AMR101 administered daily, orally for up to 30 days and it is expected that 36 participants
      will take part in this study.
