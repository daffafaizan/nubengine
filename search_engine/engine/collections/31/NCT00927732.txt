      treatment 1 (hydroquinidine or placebo) and, after 7 days of wash-out, patient will receive
      treatment 2 (meaning for example hydroquinidine if treatment 1 was placebo). Time length
      before arisen of an appropriate shock registered on the defibrillator (meaning due to
      ventricular arrhythmia) will be assessed during treatment 1 period and treatment 2 period.We
      hypothesized that hydroquinidine administration will enhance time length before arisen of an
      appropriate shock and thus mean that hydroquinidine administration can prevent heart from
      appearance of ventricular arrhythmia. Patient's defibrillator recordings will be analysed
      every 6 months plus when patient experiences an ICD shock. If the shock delivered by the ICD
      is appropriate and happens during treatment 1 period, patient will switch to treatment 2
      period after 7 days of wash-out. If the shock delivered by the ICD is appropriate and happens
      during treatment 2 period, study will be finished for this patient.Before starting the study,
      each patient will test which dose of hydroquinidine she/he requires to have an hydroquinidine
      concentration in her/his blood included between 3 and 6 Âµmol/L.

      Planned enrollment: 200 subjects (60 being symptomatic with histories of aborted sudden
      cardiac death or of ventricular fibrillation, 70 being symptomatic with histories of syncope
      considered as of arrhythmic origin, 70 being asymptomatic with a spontaneous type 1 ECG and a
      positive electrophysiological exploration)
