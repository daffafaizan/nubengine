      I. Assess the efficacy of AZD2171, in terms of volume change in target tumors by
      3-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging (3D MRI).

      II. Describe and define the toxicities of AZD2171 in these patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the value of 3D MRI data analysis in evaluating plexiform or paraspinal
      neurofibromas compared to conventional 2-dimensional MRI data analysis.

      II. Assess the value of delayed contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) in determining changes in
      vascularity of neurofibromas before and during treatment. III. Assess the quality of life of
      patients treated with AZD2171. IV. Evaluate the effect of AZD2171 on biological changes of
      human neurofibroma by comparing pre- and post-treatment specimens from patients involved in
      this trial or, alternatively, by evaluating the effect of AZD2171 on human tumor grafts in
      experimental animals.

      V. Evaluate relevant pharmacodynamic markers (circulating endothelial cells [CECs] and
      vascular endothelial growth factor-2 [VEGF2] levels) and pharmacogenetics analyses (variation
      in kdr/flk-1 and other genes) in response to AZD2171.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to tumor location
      (peripheral vs paraspinal plexiform neurofibroma). Patients receive oral AZD2171 once daily
      on days 1-28.

      Treatment repeats every 28 days for 26 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients with responding or stable disease may continue treatment
      beyond 26 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Quality of
      life is assessed at baseline, prior to course 2, prior to course 4, and every 6 courses
      thereafter.
