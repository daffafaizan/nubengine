    
      Emergency surgery is associated with high mortality rates, post-operative complications and
      prolonged duration of hospital admission. The investigators will implement a
      multidisciplinary optimized perioperative course consisting of a number of interventions
      carried out before, during and after surgery.

      Hypothesis: An optimized perioperative course will reduce the 30-day mortality in emergency
      abdominal surgery patients.

      The investigators will do a post-hoc analysis of the data registered.
