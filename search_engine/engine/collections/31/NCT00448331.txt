      have emotional issues and how many of them go unnoticed. In particular the study looks at how
      well a questionnaire for children and teenagers, the DISC Predictive Scales, Version IV
      (DPS-IV) works and what is the best way to ask the questions. In addition, for children aged
      9-17 this study will look at families' readiness to seek care when a problem is indicated.
