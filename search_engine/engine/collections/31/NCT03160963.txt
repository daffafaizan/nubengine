      often requires expensive materials. Vertical jump height has been used to assess peak power
      output using specific regression equations. The issue with this test, although it is often
      used with older persons, is that it is not practical or useful in assessing the power output
      in elderly adults due to possible injury risk and lack of familiarity with providing a
      maximal jump performance. Power is important for elderly adults; because, higher power output
      in elderly adults has been shown to highly correlate with overall functionality, the ability
      to do activities of daily living (ADL), and a reduction in fall probability. A recent study
      examined the capacity of a regression equation to quantify power in elderly adults using a
      sit-to-stand test and determined; however, the sit-to-stand lacks the difficulty and exhibits
      a ceiling effect in younger individuals. Therefore, this study will attempt to determine when
      to transition from the vertical jump to the sit-to-stand, so that the differences in
      chronological versus physiological age may be determined during aging, and conversely, during
      improvements through physical or other interventions.
