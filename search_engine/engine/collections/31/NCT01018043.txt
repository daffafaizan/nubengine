      an adult cancer population. This survey is not intended to interfere with standard medical
      practices for handling anemia. Information on laboratory values including target and achieved
      hemoglobin (Hb) levels during chemotherapy cycles, use of blood transfusions, iron
      supplementation, and epoetin will be collected in addition to information on cancer status
      and treatment. Data on the level that triggers clinicians to decide on the need for anemia
      therapy will also be collected. Each patient included in the survey will be followed for six
      months. Observational Study - No investigational drug administered
