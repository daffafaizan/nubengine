      wounds with wound areas of 2-30 cm2, who will accept participating in the study, pass all the
      accepted inclusion criteria, and sign the informed consent form, will be recruited. Then they
      will be treated with silver dressings for up to three weeks (first period). In case that the
      wounds will not show a reduction of at least 50% of the wound area during the first period,
      then the wounds will be treated with the copper oxide dressings for at least 3 weeks (second
      period). In case that there will be a clear improvement during the second period, the wounds
      may continue to be treated with the copper oxide dressings or with any other wound dressings
      according to the treating physician judgement and decision for an additional 3 weeks (third
      period) or earlier if the wound will be closed.
