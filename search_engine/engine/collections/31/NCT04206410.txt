      trial entry criteria and train patients in the mode of data collection. The screening period
      will also be used to select patients with specified levels of severity of signs and symptoms.
      During screening visit patients will undergo physical examination. Severity of IBS will be
      determined using the Francis, Morris and Whorwell's IBS severity scale (IBS-SSS): Mild <175,
      Moderate 175-300, Severe >300. Number and type of stools will be measured in all patients
      using Bristol stool scale. All eligible patients who sign informed consent form will be
      randomized within 2 weeks to receive either probiotic product or placebo and will complete
      Quality of Life assessment measured using IBS-QOL questionnaire. They will also be instructed
      to restrain from consuming foods and dietary supplements containing probiotics according to
      the clinical study requirements. After receiving probiotic product/placebo, telephone
      interviewers will call patients 3 times per week, and they will collect the following
      information by the phone: type of stools (according to Bristol Stool Score), number of bowel
      movements per day and IBS symptoms measured in 5-point scale (abdominal pain, flatulence,
      feeling of incomplete evacuation). In addition, telephone interviewers will collect
      information regarding adverse effects and using new drugs during the study. Patients will
      report to the doctor 2 times during study every 4 weeks during 8 week lasting intervention to
      receive new dose of probiotic product/placebo and to be assessed by the doctor using IBS-SSS,
      IBS-GIS and IBS-AR questionnaires, They will also complete Quality of Life questionnaire.
