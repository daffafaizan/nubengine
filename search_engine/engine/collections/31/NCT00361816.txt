      mutations in the human MATER gene. We will determine the prevalence of these mutations in a
      select group of women who have a clinical infertility history consistent with a possible
      defect in a maternal effect gene. After obtaining informed consent and DNA from 100 women,
      relevant mutations in the MATER gene will be searched for by single strand conformation
      polymorphism analysis.
