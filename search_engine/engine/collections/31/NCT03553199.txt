    
      Tissue Retraction System (TRS, Boston scientific) is a new endoscopic platform, that consists
      of an expandable and dynamically-controlled intra-luminal chamber, mounted on a flexible
      overtube, and two associated specifically designed retractor graspers. The system is
      front-loaded over the colonoscope and introduced into the colon. When the target area is
      reached, the retractor system is deployed creating an expanded, optimally reconfigured and
      stable operating field around the target lesion. Then endoscopic removal of the lesion is
      performed using available endoscopic instruments (injection needles, knives, snares, etc)
      through the operating channel of the colonoscope with assistance of two retractor graspers.
      Each accessory within the TRS can be moved forward and backward, left or right, rotated 360
      degrees, and can be advanced out and pulled in, regardless of the TRS.

      The investigators hypothesize that the TRS can improve visualization of lesions and stabilize
      the work environment by allowing retraction and tissue resection during ESD.

      TRS is a new device not yet commercially available, thus no study has been already performed
      in humans to evaluate its feasibility and safety to speed up the ESD of left colon and rectum
      lesions.

      The investigator's proposal is to perform a pilot study to evaluate the feasibility, the
      efficacy and the safety in patients undergoing ESD of colorectal lesions with the assistance
      of the TRS.
