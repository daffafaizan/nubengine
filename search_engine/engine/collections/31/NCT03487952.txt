      cancer screening by LDCT a few years ago. People living in North China who are administrated
      by these hospitals routinely took a chest CT every year. This study is to the best of our
      knowledge the first one designed to combine lung nodule and lung cancer screening with the
      application of artificial intelligence in China.

      Methods: Firstly, the study acquires epidemiological, medical information and psychological
      status of people recruited, and investigates the data acquired from past several years of CT
      scans using AI to develop a model for lung nodule detection. Secondly, evaluating the
      performance of models and apply it to analyse the CT scans from the North China population
      recruited. Thirdly, improving the model and adding function for lung nodule prediction of
      natural history and probability of malignancy.

      Aims: To depict the epidemiological results about the incidence of lung nodules and lung
      cancer in North China population; To evaluate association between people 's epidemiological,
      medical and psychological profiles and incidence, diagnosis and treatment of lung nodule; To
      develop an artificial intelligence assisted lung nodule diagnosis and management software to
      assist strategies of CT screening.
