      radiation field involves the ET and ME. These are due to mucositis and swelling in the
      surrounding pharyngeal tissue and on the long-term fibrosis. The ET is a small channel from
      the middle ear to the upper part of the pharynx. It is normally closed but briefly opens
      while swallowing or yawning. The ME pressure then equalizes and optimize sound conduction to
      the inner ear. If the function of the ET is impaired it can lead to negative pressure and
      effusion. This causes pain, tinnitus, otitis media with effusion (OME), chronic otitis media
      (COM) and hearing loss. Last can be none reversible. Almost everyone experience middle ear
      morbidity short after RT, but on the long-term up to 20 % have chronic otitis media and TD
      with significant hearing impairment and the need for hearing aid. Conventional treatment with
      insertion of ventilation tubes in to the tympanic membrane is not recommended for
      radiation-induced ME problems.

      Methods and materials: The investigators will by randomized controlled trials examine the
      effect of auto-inflation of the ET on ME morbidity with a custom-made balloon called
      OtoventÂ®. Examination of the ear is conducted by otoscopy, pure tone and impedance audiometry
      and questionnaires.
