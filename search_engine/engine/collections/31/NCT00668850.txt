    
      This is a 26 week open-label, randomized, multi-center, active comparator study to compare
      oral spray insulin (Generex Oral-lynâ„¢) with regular human insulin therapy as measured by
      HbA1c, and number of hypoglycaemic episodes in type-1 diabetes mellitus subject. All subjects
      will be on BID NPH intermediate acting insulin therapy. If subject is using long acting
      insulin (Glargine, Detemir, etc.), he/she must be switched to NPH intermediate acting
      insulin. If on insulin analogue (Novolog, Lispro, Aspart, Aphidra, Glulisine, or any other
      analogue available in the subject's geographical area), the subject must be switched to
      regular human insulin 3 times a day.
