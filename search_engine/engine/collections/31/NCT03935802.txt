      total of 161 patients with clinically proven, primarily non-metastatic breast cancer were
      sampled and examined before and after radiotherapy over a period from 09/2002 to 09/2012. The
      MAINTRAC method was used to quantitatively determine the amount of CETC in the blood and to
      observe its peritherapeutic course.
