      variability of the relationship between tacrolimus blood concentration and intracellular
      concentration, or may be the main explanatory factors. Nevertheless, most of the studies
      carried out on the subject, have been by genetic approach, neglecting in fact the membrane
      expression of these transporters, which could testify more to the real effect on the
      transport of tacrolimus. A better understanding of the cellular transport mechanisms of
      tacrolimus in the T lymphocyte could thus make it possible to identify sub-populations of
      patients under-exposed at the intra-lymphocyte level, despite satisfactory systemic exposure.
