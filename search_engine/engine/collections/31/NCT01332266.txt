    
      This open-label, multicenter, randomized study will consist of a Phase Ib: a safety run-in
      period with 3 ascending doses of E7050 in combination with Cetuximab; and a Phase II portion:
      a randomized 2-arm period. Approximately 95 patients with Platinum-Resistant Squamous Cell
      Carcinoma of the head and neck will be enrolled in the study (10-15 patients in the Phase Ib
      portion and 80 patients in the Phase II portion). Patients will only participate in either
      the Phase Ib or the Phase II portion of the study.

      In the phase II portion, Patients will receive study treatment (E7050 plus Cetuximab or
      Cetuximab alone) for approximately six 28-day cycles (24 weeks). Beyond 24 weeks, patients
      who are experiencing clinical benefit may continue E7050 plus cetuximab, cetuximab alone or
      E7050 alone (Arm 1), or may continue cetuximab alone (Arm 2), depending on the original
      randomization treatment arm, for as long as clinical benefit is sustained and the treatment
      is well tolerated.
