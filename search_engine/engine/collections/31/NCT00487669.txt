    
      Primary objective

      To evaluate the overall response rate (complete plus partial responses by RECIST criteria) to
      the combination of paclitaxel poliglumex and pemetrexed as therapy in patients with advanced
      NSCLC.

      Secondary Objectives

      To evaluate the safety and adverse event profile of the combination of paclitaxel poliglumex
      and pemetrexed as therapy in patients with advanced NSCLC.

      To evaluate the duration of response, time to progression, and overall survival of advanced
      NSCLC treated with the combination of paclitaxel poliglumex and pemetrexed.

      To compare the overall response rate using three-dimensional reconstruction of target lesions
      by Medical Metrx Solutions (MMS) and RECIST criteria.
