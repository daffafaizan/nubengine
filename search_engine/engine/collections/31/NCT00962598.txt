    
      This study rests on a confluence of findings showing that: 1) Major depressive disorder
      (MDD), is a major public health concern that often emerges in adolescence; which entails 2)
      pathophysiological abnormalities in fronto-striatal structures resulting in death and atrophy
      of glia and neurons; 3) omega-3 fatty acids (FA) effects on brain function in adolescent MDD
      can be assessed by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS); and, 4) it is critical
      that commonly used complementary and alternative medicines such as omega-3FA that have face
      validity be tested for their neurobiological effect in MDD.

      Using 1H MRSI, this study examines the effects of Omega-3FA on striatal and anterior
      cingulate cortex (ACC) concentrations of the neurocellular biomarkers total choline (tCho),
      total creatine (tCr), and Î³-aminobutyric acid (GABA, ACC only) in adolescent MDD. Hypotheses
      are: 1) relative to placebo, omega-3FA treatment will result in significant reductions of
      striatal and ACC tCho and tCr concentrations, and increased ACC GABA; 2: Regardless of
      treatment condition (placebo or Omega-3FA), MDD adolescents who are improved at the end of
      10-week treatment will exhibit a significant decrease in striatal and ACC tCho and tCr
      concentrations, and increases in ACC GABA relative to unimproved adolescents.
