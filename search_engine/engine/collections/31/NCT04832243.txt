      with important health and mental health outcomes, accurate assessment of food and water
      insecurity in resource-limited settings is paramount. The purpose of this study is to use a
      list experiment methodology to assess the extent to which there is bias in conventional
      survey-based means of direct elicitation of food and water insecurity. The list experiment
      provides an indirect means to measure a particular construct of interest. It is hypothesized
      that social desirability may cause upward bias in conventional survey-based means of direct
      elicitation of food and water insecurity.
