    
      The current clinical trial is an investigator-initiated one, and it is conducted under the
      multi-center, randomized, open-label, prospective design. The subjects meeting
      inclusion/exclusion criteria will be assigned to the treatment group or the control group.
      The randomization ratio is 1:1. The subjects of the treatment group will receive a 2-day
      hypothermia therapy followed by the process of recovery of temperature within 30 hours (the
      recovery phase). After 3 months of the onset of symptoms, mRS scores are measured. This is
      followed by the closure of the clinical trial.
