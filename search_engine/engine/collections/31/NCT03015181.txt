    
      This is the first study of the VRC-HIVMAB075-00-AB (VRC07-523LS) monoclonal antibody (MAb) in
      healthy adults. It is a phase 1, dose-escalation study to examine safety, tolerability, dose,
      and pharmacokinetics of VRC07-523LS. The hypothesis is that VRC07-523LS will be safe for
      administration to healthy adults by the intravenous (IV) and subcutaneous (SC) routes.

      Healthy adults 18-50 years of age will be enrolled. There are 4 open-label, dose escalations
      of VRC07-523LS from 1 mg/kg IV to 40 mg/kg IV, 1 route escalation from IV to SC, and 2
      open-label groups to assess repeat dosing. Groups 1-5 are expected to include 3 subjects and
      Groups 6-7 are expected to enroll 5 subjects. Subjects will be followed for 24 weeks after
      the last study product administration.
