      as morphine is the most commonly analgesic drugs, but opioid has many obviously adverse
      reactions ,for example respiratory depression,circulation inhibition,tolerance, addiction,
      nausea, vomiting, pruritus, etc. S (+) - ketamine has been described to decrease acute pain
      and opioid consumption,but it needs to confirm for chinese patients undergoing surgery.

      compatibility ,as well explore the effect of S (+) - ketamine on postoperative
