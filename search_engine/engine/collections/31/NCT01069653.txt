      which were derived from two cancer-testis antigens, CDCA1 and KIF20A, as targets for cancer
      vaccination against lung cancer. In this phase I trial, the investigators examine using a
      combination of these two peptides the safety, immunogenicity, and antitumor effect of vaccine
      treatment for HLA-A*2402-positive advanced small cell lung cancer patients who failed to
      standard therapy.
