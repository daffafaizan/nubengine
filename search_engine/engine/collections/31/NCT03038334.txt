      disease-like pathological progression by reducing AÎ²-plaque, thus preventing synapse loss and
      memory decline in transgenic mice. Common forms include magnesium sulfate.

      As a nutritional adjunct in hyperalimentation, the precise mechanism of action for magnesium
      is uncertain. Predominant deficiency effects are neurological, e.g., muscle irritability,
      clonic twitching and tremors. Hypocalcemia and hypokalemia often follow low serum levels of
      magnesium. While there are large stores of magnesium present intracellularly and in the bones
      of adults, these stores often are not mobilized sufficiently to maintain plasma levels.
      Parenteral magnesium therapy repairs the plasma deficit and causes deficiency symptoms and
      signs to cease.

      To provide a comprehensive clinical evaluation of the effects of Magnesium sulfate in AD
      patients, this study is designed to assess the impact of magnesium sulfate on amyloid plaque
      to generate valuable data on clinical utility for the use of diagnostic algorithms and
      foundation for the development of possible treatment.
