      number of patients awaiting transplantation. At the same time, the number of grafts remains
      stable. To extend the donor pool, the use of Extended Criteria Donor (ECD) donors graft
      increased each year despite the fact that these graft are known to be more vulnerable to
      ischemia-reperfusion injuries induced by cold storage preservation (CS). Their use is
      therefore associated with a greater risk of postoperative dysfunction of the graft. This risk
      can be reduced by improving preservation quality.

      The preservation by hypothermic oxygenated perfusion (HOPE) consists of keeping the graft in
      hypothermia (4 to 12 Â°C) on an machine perfusion (MP) using a specific solution, saturated
      with oxygen. In kidney transplantation, the use of MP has been shown to improve graft
      function as well as graft survival, especially for ECD grafts.

      In liver transplantation, experimental studies on animal models have demonstrated the
      superiority of HOPE over CS regarding graft function and survival. These results have been
      confirmed in humans on small retrospective series.

      As HOPE is an expensive procedure, obtaining evidence of its effectiveness could result in a
      reimbursement of the additional cost.
