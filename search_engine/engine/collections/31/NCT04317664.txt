      groups for six months. Teens will be aged 16-17 who committed a moving-related traffic
      violation and their parent/legal guardian who is most involved with their driving.
      Researchers will aim to determine the effects of the intervention on teens' risky driving
      events, unsafe driving behaviors, and traffic violation recidivism. Additionally, researchers
      will aim to determine the effects of the intervention on frequency and quality of parent-teen
      communications about safe driving practices.
