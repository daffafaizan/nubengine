      and 50-80% of patients with cancer experience morbidity and mortality as a result of
      progressive wasting.

      As a consequence of malnutrition, patients with cancer may have a poorer outcome, reduced
      effectiveness of chemotherapy and increased risk of chemotherapy-induced toxicity compared to
      those who are well nourished at diagnosis. On the other hand, in the recent years, there has
      been increased focus on the role of long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids and their effect
      on prevention and treatment of several diseases. The results of animal studies and adults
      with cancer have demonstrated that the consumption of long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids
      can slow the growth of cancer, increase the efficacy of chemotherapy and reduce loss weight
      and the side effects of the chemotherapy.

      Beneficial effects of enteral long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids has been reported in
      adults with cancer. However, in children with cancer the scientific reports are scarce;
      therefore, is necessary to evaluate if the long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids
      administration in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia has the same effects on clinical
      and nutritional outcomes that have been previously showed by different studies in adults with
      cancer.
