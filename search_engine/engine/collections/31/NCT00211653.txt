      patients undergoing cardiac surgery. The mortality associated with coronary artery by-pass
      surgery increases from 2% to almost 19% in patients with renal failure and approaches 60% in
      patients who require hemodialysis. Patients with preoperative renal dysfunction referred for
      coronary artery by pass surgery have an extraordinarily high risk of requiring postoperative
      dialysis. For example, among those patients with preoperative creatinine >2.5 mg/dL, almost
      50% require hemodialysis.

      surgery
