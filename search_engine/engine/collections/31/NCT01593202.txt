    
      The study is a long-term follow-up of a randomized trial comparing DBT-A with enhanced usual
      care (EUC). Participants were randomly allocated to receive either treatment at 1 of the
      participating child and adolescent psychiatric outpatient clinics in a 1:1 ratio stratified
      according to gender, presence of major depression, and presence of suicide intent during the
      most serious episode of self-harm behavior within the 16 weeks before enrollment. Treatment
      allocation of participants after baseline assessments was based on a permuted block
      randomization procedure with an undisclosed and variable blocking factor, and daily
      management of the randomization procedures was performed by an external group. Patients
      received either DBT or EUC by therapists working at and funded by the 10 child and adolescent
      psychiatric outpatient clinics participating in the study. They were assessed during
      treatment (9 and 15 weeks), at treatment completion 19 weeks, and at 71 weeks. In this study
      they are assessed at 2 years after treatment completion.

      The assessment of outcomes include: number of self-reported self-harm episodes (suicide
      attempts and non-suicidal self-harm episodes combined, measured by Lifetime Parasucide
      Count); the severity of suicidal ideation as measured by the 15-item self-report Suicidal
      Ideation Questionnaire (SIQ-JR; and level of depressive symptoms as measured by the 13-item
      version of the self-report Short Mood and Feelings Questionnaire (SMFQ) and through the
      interviewer rated 10-item Montgomery-_Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Other outcomes
      are hopelessness, measured by the 20-item self-report Beck Hopelessness Scale
      (BHS);borderline symptoms, assessed through the 23-itemself-report Borderline Symptom List
      (BSL); Borderline Personality Disorder as measured by SCID-II; and hospital admissions and
      emergency department visits because of self-harm.
