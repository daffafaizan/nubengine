      nilotinib, subjects will begin radiation therapy. Radiation therapy will continue every
      weekday until Day 56 of the study. If it is determined that the subject's tumor cannot be
      removed by surgery, an additional 3 weeks of radiation therapy will be applied after Day 56
      of the study.

      During study visits subjects will have physical exams, routine blood tests, urine and blood
      clotting tests, and EKGs. Subjects will also have tumor assessment by chest CT and MRI or CT
      of the tumor at screening, on approximately Day 56 of the study, then every 6 months for one
      year and then annually thereafter if ther is no disease progression.
