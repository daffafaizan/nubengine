    
      TRC150094 is an Investigational Product for the treatment of CV risk associated with
      non-traditional risk factors ie, diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidemia, which acts by
      increasing the energy expenditure and restoring mitochondrial flexibility which is deranged
      in patients with these risk factors. Treatment with TRC150094 has shown clinically meaningful
      benefits in well-established contributors of CV risk i.e., insulin resistance and
      hyperglycemia, SBP as well as non-traditional risk factors i.e. non-HDL cholesterol and MAP,
      over and above standard of care.

      The phase III trial is designed with an aim of determining the efficacy of TRC150094 in
      concurrently reducing non-traditional risk factors for CV risk i.e., HbA1c, MAP and non-HDL
      cholesterol. This study will be a randomized, double blind, parallel group, placebo
      controlled, multi-centre, multinational study in 1250 subjects. All the study subjects will
      receive once daily dose of TRC150094 45 mg or placebo tablets in addition to their standard
      of care, for 24 weeks followed by roll over to a safety extension phase of 26 weeks.

      Primary Objective of the study is, To evaluate the efficacy of TRC150094 in improving
      cardiovascular (CV) risk in subjects with diabetes, dyslipidemia and hypertension Secondary
      Objectives of the study are,

        1. To evaluate safety of TRC150094 in subjects with diabetes, dyslipidemia and hypertension

        2. To evaluate extended safety profile of TRC150094 beyond 24 weeks of treatment in
           subjects with diabetes, dyslipidemia and hypertension

      In this study there will be five visits at week 4, 12, 24, 36 and 50 after enrolment.
