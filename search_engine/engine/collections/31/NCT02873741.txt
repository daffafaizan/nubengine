      cancer. Primarily, investigators want to study a risk assessment called the Anal Cancer Risk
      Index; it gives women an overall number score based on risk factors that they may have for
      anal cancer, such as age, number of sexual partners, or smoking. The study team would like to
      determine whether women with higher Anal Cancer Risk Index scores are more likely to have
      abnormal results on anal pap smears, HPV tests, or anal biopsies. Next, the team will collect
      a swab of the cervix and swabs of the anus to study different laboratory tests that could
      identify women at highest risk of anal cancer: these tests include an anal pap smear and
      tests that detect HPV types most likely to cause cancer. Investigators would like to see
      which of these laboratory tests do the best job at predicting precancerous lesions in the
      anus. After collecting these swabs, women will have a procedure called high resolution
      anoscopy where investigators will look closely at the anus and biopsy any suspicious areas.
      Finally, the study team will look for HPV proteins and changes that HPV can make in cells to
      see if these tests predict anal lesions. The HPV protein is called E6 and E7 and the cell
      change test is called CADM1/MAL/miR-124-2. Investigators will measure E6/E7 and
      CADM1/MAL/miR-124-2 in cervical and anal samples to see if women positive for this marker are
      more likely to have abnormal results on anal pap smears or anal biopsies.
