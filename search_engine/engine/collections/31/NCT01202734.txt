    
      This is an open-label (name of assigned treatment is known), single-center study of the
      pharmacokinetics (blood levels) and safety of 3 single doses of methylphenidate HCl
      administered orally (by mouth) to healthy Japanese adult male volunteers. Methylphenidate HCl
      is a drug that is currently approved for the treatment of adults with
      attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in regions outside Japan, including the
      United States where this study will be conducted. Volunteers will participate in the study
      for a maximum of 42 days. Blood samples will be collected from volunteers during the study to
      determine the concentration of the methylphenidate HCl in the blood after dosing. Safety will
      be monitored throughout the study by evaluating adverse events reported, changes in clinical
      laboratory test results, vital signs measurements, physical examination results, and other
      protocol-specified safety assessments. All volunteers will receive a single oral dose of
      methylphenidate HCl with 240 mL (1 cup) of noncarbonated water after at least a 10-hour fast
      (without eating food) during 3 treatment periods as follows: Period 1, one 36-mg tablet;
      Period 2, three 18-mg tablets; and Period 3, two 36-mg tablets. Treatment periods will be
      separated by 3 to 7 days. Volunteers will continue fasting until at least 4 hours after
      dosing.
