      knowledge about and predict changes in self- and other-oriented emotion processes associated
      with BEPP. The investigators will also characterize the extent to which BEPP changes self-
      and other-oriented emotion processes and self- and other-oriented social behaviors. Further,
      the investigators will identify distinct trajectories of change in cognitive processes and
      self- and other-oriented emotion processes related to BEPP, and examine how those
      trajectories are associated with psychological adjustment (e.g., risk and relapse of
      psychopathology). Finally, the investigators will identify which particular features of BEPP
      are related to distinct patterns of change in self- and other-oriented emotion processes.
