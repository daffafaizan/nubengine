      In many cases family members assume the long-term burden of care after hospital discharge.
      Methods such as family education, peer support groups, and counseling are available to help
      meet the needs of caregivers, by enhancing their coping abilities. Family intervention also
      potentially benefits patients by improving the quality of caregiving skills. Few
      investigations have examined the benefits of family intervention methods.

      This trial will study the effectiveness of a family-based, telephone-administered
      intervention called Family Intervention: Telephone Tracking (FITT) for acute stroke patients
      and their caregivers. Study patients will be recruited from those admitted to the Rhode
      Island Hospital following an acute stroke. All patients and caregivers will receive standard
      medical care. In addition, these patients and their caregivers will be randomly assigned to
      one of two treatment conditions: FITT or no intervention. Treatments will begin once the
      patient returns home and will continue for a six-month period.

      During the trial, specially trained staff will carefully monitor the progress of the stroke
      patient and his/her family member, checking for changing in thinking, concentration,
      attention, memory, mood, and family functioning that sometimes occurs in stroke. Participants
      will be contacted by telephone every week for 6 weeks, then every 2 weeks for 2 months, and
      then monthly for 2 months. The telephone calls will check on how the participants are doing
      after discharge and will assist with questions and concerns.
