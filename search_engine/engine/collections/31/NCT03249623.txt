      Patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation (â‰¥ 24 h) will be considered for inclusion
      in the study on a daily basis. Patient screening will be performed by clinical researchers or
      a delegated clinician and consent/assent will be sought. Then patients will be randomised to
      the Beacon group or Standard Care group. Randomisation will be performed using sealed
      envelopes, and in blocks of patients, allowing interim analysis of results in appropriate
      steps during the study. To avoid that results are affected by patient disease type,
      randomisation will be stratified for equal distribution between randomisation groups.

      Patients will be randomly assigned to either standard care of mechanical ventilation, or to
      follow the advice of the Beacon Caresystem. The results of these two strategies will then be
      compared based upon the following outcome measurements.
