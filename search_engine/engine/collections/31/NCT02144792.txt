      epilepsy and drug sensitive epilepsy is performed. The investigators compare the whole brain
      SUV in each group (normal control, drug resistant epilepsy, drug sensitive epilepsy) and the
      asymmetry by the standardized uptake value(SUV) of ipsilateral areas and contralateral areas.

      [11C] -verapamil PET will be used as a surrogate marker of P-gp expression in patients with
      epilepsy, and will be an important prognostic factor of individualized drug therapy. Also, it
      can be used as a biomarker in checking of the drug efficacy of novel medications.
      Furthermore, by localizing epileptogenic zones for patients, [11C] -verapamil PET could
      contribute in improving the prognosis of surgical treatment in drug resistant epilepsy.
