      and cartilage and bone degradation, leading to joint destruction and progressive disability.

      The aim of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of MBS2320 in patients with
      RA following chronic administration. In addition, the study aims to evaluate the effects of
      MBS2320 on measures of disease activity.
