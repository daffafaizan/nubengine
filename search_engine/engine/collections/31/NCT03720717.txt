      adjuvants has improved postoperative pain control. The GABA-B receptor agonist, baclofen, is
      an appropriate drug to trial as such an analgesic adjuvant. Therefore, the investigators will
      conduct a study designed to determine whether or not a single, oral dose of baclofen given to
      patients undergoing kidney stone surgery will reduce postoperative opioid requirements
      measured in the first 24 hours following surgery.
