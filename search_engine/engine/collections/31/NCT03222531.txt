    
      This is a prospective, single center, pilot, open-label study of transplantation of hearts of
      HCVAb+ donors to HCVAb- recipients with subsequent therapy with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir
      (Epclusa®). Recipients of a heart from HCVAb+/NAT- donors is ARM 1 or the
      transmission-triggered arm of the study. In this arm, the study will monitor transmission of
      HCV by measuring HCV RNA in heart transplant recipients. If HCV RNA is detected, indicating
      transmission of HCV, recipients will be treated with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir (Epclusa®) for 12
      weeks. Virological response will be assessed at 4 weeks, end of treatment and 12 weeks after
      completion of therapy.

      Recipients of a heart from HCVAb+/NAT+ donors will be in ARM 2 or the prophylaxis arm of the
      study. In this arm, patients will be started on a 12-week course of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir
      (Epclusa®) on post-operative day 1 and will undergo close monitoring of HCV RNA for evidence
      of transmission as well as monitoring of adverse events from therapy.
