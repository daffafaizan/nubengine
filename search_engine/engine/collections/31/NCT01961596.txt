      popular methods used. It is very popular mainly because of its analgesic effect and easy
      application. It is assumed that such application will not affect the athletes. Nevertheless
      after an application of cold a reduced nerve conduction velocity was measured, resulting in a
      reduction in pain and a reduced transmission rate. Usually the static equilibrium or the
      perception of joint position was investigated and not the time to stability. As far as we
      have been known so far been no study that has examined the impact of a brief application of
      cooling ice spray on the time to stability after dynamic function. Therefore this study
      what's to investigate the influence of "Cooling Ice Spray" on the time to stability after a
      forward jump.
