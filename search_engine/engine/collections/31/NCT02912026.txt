      dosing. Eligible subjects will be admitted to the clinical unit on the evening of Day -1
      prior to investigational medicinal product (IMP) administration, and will be dosed on the
      morning of Day 1. In Cohort 1 (Regimen A), subjects will be dosed after a light breakfast; to
      assess tolerability of the IV administration, the first subject will be dosed at least 30 min
      prior to dosing the second subject. All subsequent dosing of the IV formulation will be
      staggered by at least 15 min. In Cohort 2 (Regimen B), subjects will be dosed following an
      overnight fast with an appropriate interval between subjects based on logistical
      requirements. Subjects will remain resident in the clinic up to 336 h post-dose (Day 15). It
      is planned that subjects will return to the clinical unit for 2 further 24 h residency
      periods on Day 21 and Day 28 if discharge criteria outlined in this protocol are not met. It
      is planned that subjects will be released from the study as a group when all subjects have
      achieved a mass balance cumulative recovery of >90% or <1% of the dose administered has been
      collected in urine and faeces within 2 separate, consecutive 24 h periods. If this occurs
      earlier than Day 28, collection of all samples (blood, urine and faeces) will be stopped and
      the subjects will undergo discharge assessments. If this criterion has not been met by all
      subjects following the Day 28 return visit, home collections of urine and faeces may be
      requested at the discretion of the investigator for individual subjects.
