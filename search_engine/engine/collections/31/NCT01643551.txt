      failure, which is characterized by poor cardiac output. The relatively abrupt increase in
      cardiac output that follows implant of a LVAD may cause reperfusion injury. Furthermore,
      selected patients may have particularly severe consequences of such injury, including
      refractory acidosis and vasoplegia. Neuron specific enolase (NSE) has been established as a
      biomarker of reperfusion injury. We hypothesize that changes in NSE following LVAD will be
      greater than the changes in NSE noted in a control population of patients undergoing non-VAD
      cardiac surgery.
