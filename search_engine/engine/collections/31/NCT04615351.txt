      discharge for women with a history of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) improves maternal
      health at 1 year post-partum. Our central hypothesis is that diabetes mellitus (DM)
      prevention with metformin can be initiated days after delivery, rather than months to years
      after delivery, and result in a pragmatic and efficacious means of preventing DM and
      improving weight loss over the first year post-partum. To test this hypothesis, we will
      perform a open-label randomized controlled trial of metformin compared to placebo routine
      care initiated at the time of hospital discharge in women with a history of GDM.
