      • Routine laboratory investigation: Complete blood picture and differential WBCs count,
      liver, kidney function tests, RBG, Na, K, CRP, ESR.

      • Microbilogical Investigations:

      To ensure that good specimens are provided for examination, it is important to note the
      following:

        -  A sterile clean dry container must be used for the collection of fecal samples.

        -  The specimen should be brought to the lab as soon as possible.

        -  The specimen container should be clearly labeled with the patient's name, date, and time
           of passage of the specimen.

      A) Conventional methods:

      Stool samples will be cultured on Selenite broth then subcultured on blood agar, chocolate
      agar, MacConkeys agar, Sorbitol MacConkys agar: Xylose Lysine Deoxycholate agar (XLD)
      ,Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA), blood agar with 10um/ml ampicillin , Cambylobacter CVA agar
      plates.

        1. Identification of the bacterial organism:

           Pure colonies of isolated microorganisms were identified by:

             -  Morphology on agar.

             -  Gram stain film was made from the growth to identify morphology of the organism.

             -  Biochemical reactions tests.

        2. Detection of antibiotic sensitivity pattern according to CLSI 2019 by disc diffusion
           method

        3. Confirmation of results by automated microbial system VITEK 2Compact.
