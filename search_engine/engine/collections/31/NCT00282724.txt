      present throughout life. Although the disorder is not life threatening, it is quite
      disfiguring and causes considerable psychological stress to affected patients. Prevalence is
      less than 1 case per 300,000 individuals. Treatment is mainly symptomatic i.e. emollients
      with or without keratolytic agents. Treatment with systemic retinoids is reserved for those
      patients, refractory to conventional therapy, because of the long-term adverse effects and
      teratogenicity of systemic retinoids.

      Liarozole may provide a new concept for the treatment of this condition. Because of its
      mechanism of action, retinoic acid (RA) levels will only be increased in tissues that are
      targets for RA production.

      The proposed Phase II/III study intends to evaluate the efficacy of liarozole compared with
      placebo, in patients with lamellar ichthyosis.
