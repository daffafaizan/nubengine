      inflammation or auto-immune diseases, due to their immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory
      properties. A number of clinical trials are being conducted worldwide testing th efficacy of
      MSC, mainly isolated from bone marrow, for different conditions, such as Graft Versus host
      Disease, refractory Crohn's Disease, ischemic stroke, acute myocardial infarction, type I
      Diabetes Mellitus, or Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. Usually, the route of
      administration of the cells in these studies is intravenous. Local injection of MSC for
      fistulizing Crohn's Disease has proven efficacious. Endoscopy is a routinary technique for
      the evaluation of gastrointestinal and colonic conditions. The purpose of our study is to
      evaluate safety and efficacy of the intracolonic injection by using a colonoscope of
      allogeneic adipose tissue-derived MSC in patients with moderate active ulcerative colitis.
