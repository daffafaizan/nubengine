      prevalence of visual hallucinations ranges from 22 to 38%, increasing after long-term
      follow-up to more than 60%. Risk factors for visual hallucinations are age, disease duration,
      and cognitive impairment. The treatment of visual hallucinations is cumbersome and options
      are limited. Only clozapine has been proven to be efficacious without deteriorating the motor
      symptoms of PD. Instead of oral dopamine agonists and rotigotine, continuous infusion of
      apomorphine is well-tolerated in PD patients with cognitive impairments and/or visual
      hallucinations. Even beneficial effect of apomorphine on visual hallucinations are suggested,
      however there is lack of a randomized controlled trial.

      The purpose of this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial is to evaluate the
      efficacy of continuous apomorphine infusion compared to placebo in PD patients with visual
      hallucinations, inadequately controlled with clozapine and cholinesterase inhibitors.
