    
      This study is divided into 3 different periods: Screening, Treatment, and End of Treatment
      Before taking the treatment, patients will have some tests and procedures done to make sure
      they are eligible for the study (Screening). Then they will enter the Treatment period, where
      Durvalumab, Olaparib and AZD5363 will be administered to them. If they stop taking your study
      medication for any reason, an End of Treatment visit will be conducted within 30 days after
      the last doze of study medication.
