      hypothesise that pituitary histopathology and plasma hyperprolactinaemia could have
      prognostic value in predicting the risk of glucose metabolic disturbances in acromegalic
      patients. The aim of this study is to examine glucose metabolic outcome in acromegalic
      patients with and without histologically verified prolactin and growth hormone (GH)
      co-secreting adenomas. 79 patients who have all undergone surgical treatment for acromegaly
      are included. Clinical and biochemical baseline data are collected from medical records.
      Patients are divided into two groups based on histopathological evaluation of pituitary
      adenomas;

        1. pure GH secreting adenomas or

        2. GH and prolactin co-secreting adenomas.
