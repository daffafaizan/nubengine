      tailored protocol, will be enrolled and randomized in two groups (groups A and B). Patients
      of group A will continue metformin administration for further three cycles followed by six
      months of progestogens cyclically administered, whereas patients of group B will continue
      metformin therapy for further nine cycles.

      All patients eligible will undergo baseline assessment consisting of anthropometric,
      hormonal, and ultrasonographic evaluations. During the study, the clinical and reproductive
      outcomes, and the adverse experience will be evaluated in each patient.

      Data will be analyzed using the intention-to-treat principle and a P value of 0.05 or less
      will be considered significant. Continuous variables will be analyzed with the unpaired t
      test and general linear model for repeated measures analysis with Bonferroni test for the
      post-hoc analysis as required. For categorical variables, the Pearson chi-square and Fisher's
      exact tests will be used. Cumulative pregnancy rate, our primary end-point, will be
      calculated by the Kaplan-Maier method, and the differences between the two groups will be
      assessed with the log-rank test. Cox proportional-hazards model will be used to calculate the
      hazard ratio for new pregnancy in both groups.
