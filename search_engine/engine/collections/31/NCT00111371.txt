      improve word learning success in healthy subjects. In this randomized, placebo-controlled,
      double-blind trial, we probe whether daily administration of levodopa, coupled with a
      training of grammatical rules, improves the training success in healthy adults as compared to
      placebo administration. In the second step of this study, patients with dyslexia will be
      trained with the identical protocol. We postulate that the combination of intensive training
      in language rules and levodopa improves the reading, writing, and spelling abilities of
      patients with dyslexia.
