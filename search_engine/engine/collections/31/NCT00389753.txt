      donor site will be treated with Aruba AloÃ« Formula F-BC-096 while a control product will be
      applied to the second site.

      If pressure garments are applied they must be equal for both donor sites. During follow-ups
      objective methods will be used to evaluate elasticity and colour of the scar.
