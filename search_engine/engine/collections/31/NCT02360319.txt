      500 patients over a year period. They will be recruited into two cohorts - the first episode
      cohort and the early phase (EP) cohort, with approximately 250 patients in each cohort.
      Enrollment of patients will be discontinued when the appropriate number for the target for
      each cohort is reached.

      After providing written informed consent, patients will be screened for general eligibility
      by the clinical team at the site. Basic demographic data will be collected to determine
      suitability for inclusion into the study. The site will complete an information interview
      comprising data regarding symptomology and history, but the diagnosis of schizophrenia will
      fall to a centralized, remote blinded rater to enable consistency for eligibility.

      Prescribers at sites in the clinician's choice arm can treat the patients in the manner most
      appropriate for that individual. Prescribers at sites in the Aripiprazole Once Monthly arm
      monthly will prescribe and administer the medication according to recommendations contained
      in the product labeling.

      For a period of 2 years all subjects will receive bimonthly calls inquiring about visits to
      emergency rooms and hospitalization. At 4 month intervals information on use of services,
      insurance status, work, school attendance, and other service use outcomes will be assessed.
