      cardiovascular, renal, or hepatic, is a major challenge to optimize the management of this
      disease.

      Teams from the University Hospital of Lille have developed the Integra cohort study to
      identify the clinical and biological determinants of the occurrence of these complications
      and the mortality of patients with metabolic disorders.

      The aim of the study is to identify clinico-biological determinants that are able to predict
      the occurence of death, cardiovascular events as well as hepatic or nephrotic one.

      Follow-up data will be collected from National System of Health Data (SNDS) where data
      concerning hospitalisations, medical consultations and treatments are registered.

      Biological samples are collected at baseline for a large OMICs analysis (metabolomics,
      genetics, transcriptomics and epigenomics) that would feed our predictive scoring system.

      This project will allow us to describe new models of prediction of metabolic diseases and its
      complications, and to offer adapted and personalised methods of management, which can slow
      the progression of the disease and improve its prognosis.
