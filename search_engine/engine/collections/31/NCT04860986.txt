      device per subject, with each testing session yielding three (3) measurements per endpoint
      per subject, for a total of six (6) measurements per endpoint for each subject enrolled. The
      order in which the subjects receive testing with each device will be randomized so that the
      same device is not always used first or last for each subject.

      The primary objectives of this study are to quantify the repeatability variability and
      reproducibility variability of all of the EarliPoint device's continuous valued outputs: the
      underlying continuous score used to classify patients into the binary diagnostic
      classification of either clinically-positive or clinically-negative for autism spectrum
      disorder (ASD) as well as each of the three EarliPoint Device severity scores (the social
      disability index, verbal ability index, and nonverbal ability index).

      The secondary objectives of this study are to quantify the repeatability and reproducibility
      variability in producing each of the three EarliPoint Device severity scores: the social
      disability index, verbal ability index, and nonverbal ability index.
