        -  Is it feasible to improve sleep duration and quality in habitually short sleepers under
           free-living conditions?

        -  What are the effects of improved sleep duration and quality on body composition, energy
           balance, dietary intake, and cardio-metabolic risk factors?

      Hypothesis

      - Improved sleep duration and/or quality in habitually short sleepers will result in improved
      energy balance, diet quality, body composition, and cardio-metabolic risk profile.

      Aims

        -  To assess the feasibility of improving sleep duration and/or quality in habitually short
           sleepers using behavioural approaches and public health messages targeting sleep
           hygiene.

        -  To identify how improved sleep duration and/or quality affect energy balance, diet
           quality, body composition, and cardio-metabolic risk profile.

      Objectives

        1. To develop a sleep extension strategy using behaviour change techniques (BCTs) targeting
           sleep hygiene.

        2. To recruit healthy adults who are habitually short sleepers and randomise eligible
           participants to an intervention and control group.

        3. To assess the feasibility and effectiveness of the intervention.

        4. To measure energy balance, diet quality, body composition and cardio-metabolic risk
           factors pre- and post-treatment in the intervention and control groups.

        5. To assess whether the intervention had an effect on the aforementioned parameters by
           comparing the intervention endpoints to control as well as baseline measures.

        6. To run the statistical analysis both on an intention-to-treat basis as well as
           per-protocol.
