      secondary to abnormal anti-diuretic hormone levels, low bladder capacity related to lower
      urinary tract dysfunction, and sleep disorders causing problems in arousal. Among them, the
      association between enuresis and lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) has gained importance.
      If these two conditions coexist, the diagnosis is nonmonosymptomatic enuresis (NME). The
      reported prevalence of LUTS among enuretic patients ranges widely from 21% to 99%. Moreover,
      it was reported that spontaneous resolution can be prolonged, and some cases of NME are
      likely to become refractory if treated like monosymptomatic enuresis (ME) cases. A possible
      explanation for this may be the presence of bladder dysfunction that is not addressed
      properly by the standard treatment of ME. However, this explanation is only speculative.

      By showing a paradoxical increase in light sleep and higher cortical arousal index in
      enuretic children with reduced bladder capacity, one of the reason for impaired ability to
      awaken (AA) in enuretic patients may lie in the chronic stimulation of the bladder. This kind
      of bladder dysfunction leading to an abnormal bladder-brain dialogue has been further
      elaborated by an experiment showing brain dysfunction in the ventrolateral periaqueductal
      gray matter as a result of the experimental reduction of the bladder capacity. If this is
      true for enuretic children, we may be able to improve arousal (improved AA) by increasing
      their bladder capacity.

      Based on this hypothesis, the present study aimed to evaluate to the effects of
      anticholinergic therapy with standard urotherapy on improvement of AA and show the effect of
      improved AA on treatment response in children with NME.
