      excision of the cervical transformation zone . When the transformation zone contains squamous
      precancer and is completely ectocervical and therefore full visible, excision or destruction
      is an effective and relatively straightforward therapeutic entity. However in a small
      proportion of women a cone biopsy is necessary. A cone biopsy often requires the excision of
      20-30 mms of endocervical canal.

      Interventions.

        1. The standard procedure, LLETZ - cone (Large Loop Excision of Transformation Zone cone
           biopsy), is performed with a large loop electrode of 20-25 mm depth. The activated loop
           was applied to the cervix outside the lateral margin of transformation zone and brought
           slowly to the controlateral margin with the objective to acquire 20-25 mm up the canal.

        2. The experimental intervention is SWETZ (Straight Wire Excision of Transformation Zone),
           a method of excision using a 1cm straight disposal of 0.20 wire to remove the
           endocervical transformation zone or glandular disease. The activated wire was used as a
           knife, fashioning a cone with desired dimensions.

      This technique may be able to excise the endocervical transformation zone with a lower rate
      of morbidity and incomplete excision rate than LLETZ cone biopsy.

      The hypothesis to be tested in this trial is that SWETZ is superior to LLETZ cone in the
      management of endocervical pre-invasive disease.
