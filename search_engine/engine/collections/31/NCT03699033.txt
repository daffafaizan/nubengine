      fractions (2.5 Gy/fraction) with 4D PET/CT-based radiation treatment planning and concurrent
      carboplatin and paclitaxel in Stage IIIA or Stage IIIB NSCLC subjects.

      Hypofractionated IMRT allows escalation of the biological effective dose (BED) to the tumor
      and reduces the radiation treatment duration to 5 weeks. Increasing the BED without
      protracting the RT course may be a more effective means of dose escalation than simply
      increasing the total dose but using only 2 Gy/fraction, as was tested in RTOG 0617.

      Investigators require the use of advanced treatment planning techniques, including 4D CT
      simulation, volume delineation utilizing PET/CT to identify gross disease and IMRT to
      minimize the total volume of normal tissue receiving a high dose of radiation.

      As minimal published work has evaluated hypofractionated RT regimens for Stage III NSCLC with
      concurrent chemotherapy, investigators selected a moderately escalated dose/fraction of 2.5
      Gy for evaluation in combination with concurrent carboplatin and paclitaxel.
