      age, who underwent one of two types of surgical resection and who may receive adjuvant
      chemotherapy. The prospective design with two cohorts representing exposure to chemotherapy
      (chemotherapy vs. no-chemotherapy) described the changes in quality of life, demands of
      illness, sexual function, and peripheral neuropathy, which occurred following curative
      resection. An analysis of the interaction between time (four measurement occasions) and the
      independent variable of chemotherapy group by mean values of quality of life, sexual
      function, peripheral neuropathy, and demands of illness addressed the central thesis
      question.

      Specific Aims

        1. Examine the relationships among quality of life, demands of illness, sexual functioning,
           and peripheral neuropathy, for the total sample and by chemotherapy group.

        2. Examine changes within-subjects (four measurement occasions), between-group
           (chemotherapy, no-chemotherapy) differences, and the interaction between time and
           chemotherapy group for quality of life, demands of illness, sexual functioning, and
           peripheral neuropathy across four measurement occasions.
