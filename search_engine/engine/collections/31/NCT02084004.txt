      Berberine, which is usually used as an antibiotic drug, has been reported a potential
      glucose-lowering effect in vitro and in vivo studies. Bifidobacterium, as a familiar
      probiotics, can modulate gut microbiota and improve glucose and lipid metabolism in animal
      experiments. Therefore, the aim of this study is to assess the beneficial effects of
      Bifidobacterium Hydrochloride and Berberine on lowering glucose in patients with T2DM and to
      detect the potential mechanism.
