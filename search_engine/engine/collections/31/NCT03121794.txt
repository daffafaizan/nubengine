      (CV) and intraosseous (IO). Of the different types of vascular access PIV and CV access have
      drawbacks when used during resuscitation, because they can be difficult to obtain when
      patients are volume depleted as in cases of trauma. Attempting CV access has numerous risks
      with complications occurring in up to 33% of attempts. These include failed placement (22%),
      arterial puncture (5%), catheter malposition (4%), pneumothorax (1%) and asystolic cardiac
      arrest (<1%). Attempting to obtain CV access may also disrupt chest compressions in cases of
      cardiac arrest. Intraosseous access has been used in scenarios where PIV and CV access is
      difficult or impossible to obtain. Pharmacokinetic studies and standard practice support the
      bioequivalence of intraosseous and intravenous administration of common medications.
      Intravascular depletion does not hinder attempts at IO access, and as the insertion sites are
      peripheral to the heart, insertion can be done avoiding interruptions in chest compressions.
      Obtaining proximal humerus interosseous (PHIO) access may also be faster than obtaining both
      PIV and CV access with a relatively low complication rate. In one survey, complications of IO
      included difficulty in identifying correct anatomical site (3%), extravasation (3.7%),
      displacement after insertion (8.5%), and very rarely late complications including compartment
      syndrome (0.6%), osteomyelitis (0.4%) and skin infection (0.3%).
