      adults worldwide (1-3). Children with AD often develop the disease within the first five
      years of life, which is a critical time for physical and psychosocial development (4). AD
      impacts an individual's physical, mental, and social health. Anxiety, itch, sleep
      disturbance, and depression have been associated with low quality of life scores. Childhood
      AD also affects the emotional, financial, physical, and social well-being of parents or
      caregivers (4). Individuals caring for a child with AD report sleep deprivation, poor social
      support, and stress about parenting (1, 4). Utilizing patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in
      clinic can provide meaningful data to monitor disease activity and response to different
      interventions, with the ultimate goal to improve quality of life for the patient and their
      family members or caregivers. Additionally, PROs can help us better understand the burden of
      AD. It is still unclear which PROs are most relevant for atopic dermatitis. This study will
      evaluate the utility of several PROs to monitor response to two different topical ointments,
      crisaborole (Eucrisaâ„¢) and tacrolimus 0.03%, to better understand the impact of these two
      non-steroidal topical treatments on overall health of children with AD of moderate or less
      severity and their caregivers.
