    
      This is a prospective single-center dosimetry study that exhaustively included brain tumor
      and prostate cancer patients treated at the ICO Site d'Angers by external radiotherapy and
      prior to which they were given an MRI and a simulation CT in treatment position over a
      12-month period.

      For patients who agree to participate in the study, CT-synthetic images will be generated
      from the MRI images by automatic assignment of densities (5 classes).

      Reference CT images from CT and synthetic CT images from MRI will be available for comparison
      for all eligible patients.
