    
      This study will enrol healthy subjects. It is considered that study results are more
      discriminative in healthy subjects than in rhinitis patients as there are no interferences by
      varying rhinitis symptoms and respective differences in the status of the nasal mucosa
      regarding the 3 study periods.

      The time schedule for plasma sampling (pre-dose and 15, 30 min, 1, 1½, 2, 2½, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12,
      24, 48, 72, 96, and 120 h p.a.; time refer to the end of the second spray into the second
      nostril of each administration) is derived from previous bioavailability study on the
      marketed product Astelin® Nasal Spray assuming a mean tmax of 2 to 3 h p.a. and a mean t1/2
      of 22 h [L7]. Sampling times are expected to cover an AUC0-tlast above 80% of the total AUC
      of azelastine hydrochloride (bioanalytical detection method with a LLOQ of 2 pg/mL).
