      needs facing many families. We hypothesized that by identifying and addressing certain
      problems, such as depressed mothers, parental drug use, and domestic violence, we would help
      decrease child abuse and neglect.

      The first step was to train pediatric residents on the importance of addressing the targeted
      problems. Then, we developed a brief screening tool to use when children under six years came
      in for the regular checkups. Parents would complete this while waiting for their doctor.
      Finally, the doctor and/or social worker would try address any problems the parent
      identified.
