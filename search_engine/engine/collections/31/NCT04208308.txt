      Union (EU) (40%) die of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) every year. CVD mortality in EU is 43%
      in women and 36% in men. In Central and Eastern Europe, much more people die of CVD than in
      Western, Northern and Southern European countries. The World Health Organization (WHO) states
      that number of deaths in Slovakia is much higher than in Western European countries, even
      higher than in V4 countries - Slovakia, Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary

      In the first stage of the project fatty acids will be analyzed with the focus on the ratio of
      omega-6 and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in fatty food for normal consumption and in
      nutritional supplements containing omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids.

      In the second phase of the project risk factors of cardiovascular diseases for people without
      and people with a history of cardiovascular disease will be monitored and compared. There
      will be monitored and compared a wide range of laboratory markers of clinical biochemistry,
      immunology, pathological physiology in order to determine cardiovascular risk for men and
      women in different age categories.

      The third stage will monitor the effect of natural plant and animal sources and
      pharmacological nutritional supplements with omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids on obesity,
      metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular risk factors.

      The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of animal, plant sources of omega-3
      polyunsaturated fatty acids and omega-3 pharmacological supplements on obesity, metabolic
      syndrome and cardiovascular disease.
