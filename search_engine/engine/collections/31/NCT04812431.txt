    
      Subjects with damage to C4-C7 cords diagnosed as AIS-A are administered with PSA-NCAM(+) NPC.

      For evaluation of safety and exploratory efficacy, 2 to 6 subjects will be enrolled depending
      on the presentation of dose-limiting toxicity.

      When the Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) is not presented in the first three subjects
      administered with PSA-NCAM(+) NPC, two additional patients are added to the clinical study.
      When the DLT is presented in two or more of the first three patients, the clinical study is
      discontinued; when the DLT is presented in one of the three patients, three additional new
      patients are added. In case of presentation of the DLT in at least one of the three
      additional patients, the study is discontinued; the clinical study is continued only when the
      DLT is not presented in all three patients.

      Screening visit (Visit 1), surgery and recovery visit (Visit 2 to Visit 6), follow-up visit
      (Visit 7 to Visit 8 + phone screening I, II, III), additional visit (Visit 9 to Visit 10),
      and close-out visit (Visit 11) are conducted. A clinical study period of at least 68 weeks is
      secured after Visit 6 (at least 5 visits and 3 phone screenings).

      All subjects are to be conducted of follow-up study of a period of 1 year and 5 months at
      Weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48, and 72 after surgery.
