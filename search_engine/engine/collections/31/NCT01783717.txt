      craniopharyngioma and germ cell tumors, and inflammatory diseases are susceptible to develop
      severe obesity and diabetes mellitus. The occurrence of hypothalamic obesity in patients
      after surgery with or without radiotherapy for craniopharyngioma can be as high as 42-66%,
      and the incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus of them is twice as much as healthy controls.
      Treatment of obesity and diabetes mellitus in this population is crucial for increasing
      morbidity and mortality. However, diet and exercise intervention has been proven useless in
      previous studies. Safe and effective medicine remains to be developed. Exenatide, a GLP-1
      receptor agonist, which play an antihyperglycemic role through a variety of mechanisms, such
      as enhancing glucose-dependent insulin secretion, increasing beta cell mass and decreasing
      glucagon secretion, possesses a potent ability to induce satiety, slow gastric emptying and
      reduce food intake, resulting in weight loss both in diabetics and patients with simple
      obesity. Previous animal study has already shown GLP-1 agonist exendin-4 leads to reduction
      of weight and caloric intake in a rat model of hypothalamic obesity. Therefore, the
      investigators hypothesize exenatide treatment might lead to weight loss in hypothalamic obese
      patients and improve their glycemic control.
