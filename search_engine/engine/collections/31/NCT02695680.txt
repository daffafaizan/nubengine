      after the end of the 4DCT scan, which is the standard-of-care for lung SBRT treatments at our
      institution. The procedure will consist of real-time surface tracking using the VisionRT
      system of the thoracic and/or abdominal region. Continuous audiovisual contact will be
      maintained with the subject during scanning. Each individual will be informed that they can
      stop the procedure at any point.

      Fluoroscopic imaging procedure - Fluoroscopic imaging will be performed in the treatment room
      with the patient lying in treatment position. Three 15s acquisitions will be performed under
      free breathing conditions, each from a different beam angle, using the on-board kV imager.
      Audiovisual contact will be maintained at all times with the patient.

      Data collection and management: An ID number will be assigned to each separate patient, and
      the correlation between ID number and patient name and medical record number will be kept in
      a password-protected file in Dr. Amit Sawant's office. The database of information extracted
      from the medical record and radiation treatment records for each patient will be stored in an
      Excel file on a computer with password protection. All image data will be de-identified by
      Dr. Sawant before his research team analyzes them.
