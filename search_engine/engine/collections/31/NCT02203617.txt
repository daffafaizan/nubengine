      anticipatory guidance) into baby books that first-time mothers read to their infants. This
      3-group longitudinal study recruited first-time mothers in their third trimester of
      pregnancy, randomly assigned them to conditions, and followed them until the child was 18
      months of age. One group received educational baby books, another group was given the same
      illustrated books with non-educational text, and the third group was not given any books.
      Thus, the effects of educational reading could be parsed from the effects of reading alone.
      The study aimed to test whether embedding pediatric anticipatory guidance in picture books is
      an effective method for increasing maternal knowledge of child development, parenting
      strategies, and safety practices, improving parenting beliefs and attitudes (e.g., parenting
      efficacy, importance of reading, use of corporal punishment), supporting optimal parenting
      practices (e.g., breastfeeding and nutrition, responsiveness, safety practices), improving
      maternal health (stress, depression), and supporting children's healthier development
      (injuries, illness, immunizations, and linguistic, social, and cognitive development).

      Survey and observational data collection occurred in participants' homes during their third
      trimester of pregnancy and when their child was 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, and 18 months of age. Twelve
      phone call interviews were conducted between these home visits. When children were 18 months,
      a retrospective medical chart audit was conducted.
