    
      This is a prospective observational multicentric French study of a cohort of 1000 ALS
      patients, 100 neurological controls and 200 healthy controls followed from the first signs to
      the end of the disease.

      The aim of the present study is therefore to determine the clinical, biological, imaging, and
      electrophysiological biomarkers of prognosis of survival without events (i.e. severe
      comorbidity, 24 hours of non invasive ventilation, tracheotomy).

      Secondary objectives will notably include i) the biomarkers of disease progression ii)
      biomarkers of diagnosis as compared with controls iii) the determination of the different
      endophenotypes according to the prognosis, the genetic profiles and the initial clinical
      presentations. Criteria of assessment will notably include detailed medical history, habitus,
      past and present treatments, vascular risk factors, ALSFRS-R, muscular testing, respiratory
      parameters including early nocturnal saturation and apneal profile, the detailed and
      predetermined clinical presentations, extensive cognitive and behavioral examination,
      extensive blood, cerebrospinal fluid, urines biological tests, genetic analyses, multiple
      brain and spinal MRI sequences, and electrophysiological tests (i.e. electromyogram, MUNIX,
      triple stimulation). Invasive tests will be optional (i.e. lumbar puncture, skin biopsies,
      muscular biopsies).

      The large number of patients will allow in depth statistical analyses, notably to establish
      decisional trees (CHAID).
