      Norway. We will include patients with the diagnosis of early infections (within 4 weeks post
      operatively)after hip or knee replacement. Patients with clinical signs of infection are
      scheduled for a standardized soft tissue revision. Diagnosis of staphylococci must be
      established by arthrocentesis or at surgical revision, and must grow in at least 2/8
      cultures.The patients will randomly be assigned to antimicrobial therapy with or without
      rifampin by a randomization programme. Antibiotics will be given for 6 weeks. Two years
      follow-up. The study end points are final follow-up visit after two years or relapse of
      infection.
