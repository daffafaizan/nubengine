    
      The purpose of this Phase I, multicenter study is to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics,
      pharmacodynamics and efficacy of HMPL-306 in Patients of Relapsed/Refractory Myeloid
      Leukemia/Neoplasms with IDH1 and/or IDH2 Mutation. The first stage of the study is a dose
      escalation phase where cohorts of patients will receive ascending oral doses of HMPL-306 to
      determine maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or the recommended Phase II dose. The second stage
      of the study is a dose expansion phase where three cohorts of patients will receive HMPL-306
      to further evaluate the safety, tolerability, and clinical activity of the recommended Phase
      II dose.
