        -  Determine the complete and overall response rates in patients with limited stage small
           cell lung cancer treated with induction chemotherapy comprising paclitaxel, topotecan,
           and etoposide followed by consolidation chemoradiotherapy.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the overall and failure-free survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the overall (partial and complete) response rate in patients treated with this
           induction chemotherapy regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

        -  Induction therapy: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on days 1 and 22, oral
           topotecan on days 2-4 and 23-25, and oral etoposide on days 5-7 and 26-28. Patients also
           receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously daily beginning on days 8 and 29 and
           continuing until blood counts recover.

        -  Consolidation therapy: Patients receive carboplatin IV over 1 hour on days 43, 64, and
           85 and etoposide IV over 1 hour on days 43-45, 64-66, and 85-87. Patients undergo
           radiotherapy daily 5 days per week beginning on day 43 and continuing for 6-7 weeks.

      Patients with rapid disease progression discontinue study therapy.

      Patients are followed at least every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and
      then annually for 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 25-60 patients will be accrued for this study within 10 months.
