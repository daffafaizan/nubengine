      I. To detect the numbers of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) during and following radical
      cystectomy in both the peripheral and central line.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To ensure the safety and of using the femoral vein to access the central venous blood
      supply for patients with primary bladder cancer and the withdrawal of blood from both a
      peripheral and central line.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo placement of a central line via the right femoral vein and undergo open
      radical cystectomy (ORC). Blood samples are collected and analyzed for CTCs pre-surgery, at
      30 minutes and 1 hour once ORC begins, post-surgery, and 7 days after surgery.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 2 weeks and at 1 month.
