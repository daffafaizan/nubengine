      with acute ischemic stroke. The pathomechanism of delirium is related to neuroinflammatory
      process and oxidative stress. Search for readily available diagnostic marker that will aid
      clinicians in early identification of delirium is an on-going process. The aim of this study
      was to investigate the role of Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR) and other derived white
      cell markers as early markers of delirium and outcome after acute ischemic stroke (AIS).
