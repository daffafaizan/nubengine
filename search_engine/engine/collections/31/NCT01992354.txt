    
      This is a non-randomized, non-statistically powered, single-site, prospective study designed
      to gather imaging data for design optimization, regulatory submission and future product
      development of an investigational hybrid PET/MRI scanner. Subjects will undergo a clinically
      indicated PET/CT exam subsequent to tracer administration. Once clinical imaging is complete,
      subjects will be transported to the PET/MR scanner at the General Electric (GE) Facility for
      additional imaging. No additional pharmaceuticals or ionizing radiation will be utilized as
      part of this study.
