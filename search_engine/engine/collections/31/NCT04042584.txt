      volume of infarcted brain witch is related to the delay of arterial recanalisation. IVT is
      available in multiple stroke units in France but, in case of LVO, the association with TM is
      needed. The availability of endovascular capable centers is limited to tertiary care
      hospitals. As a result, pre-hospital identification of these patients is a priority and the
      optimization of the triage can be done by a clinical algorithm carried out by a neurological
      tele-evaluation.

      OPTIC-AVC is a multi-phase study. This phase is about the evaluation of accuracy of our
      algorithm performed by a quick and standardized neurological tele-evaluation to predict the
      eligibility for recanalisation treatment (IVT and/or TM) of patients suspected of acute
      stroke in the emergency setting. The effective therapeutic decision for each patient,
      performed by another neurologist, will be blind to the theoretical therapeutic decision
      resulting from the algorithm.

      Theoretical and effective therapeutic decision will be compared a posteriori
