    
      This phase IV, multicenter, prospective, open-label tolerability and safety monitoring study
      will enroll a select cohort of 500 multiple sclerosis patients receiving commercially
      available Novantrone®. The patients will be assessed every 3 months during treatment followed
      by annual assessment for a total of five (5) years.

      The select cohort of MS patients enrolled will have secondary (chronic) progressive,
      progressive relapsing, or worsening relapsing-remitting disease (i.e., patients whose
      neurological status is significantly abnormal between relapses).

      The overall objective of this study is to collect data relevant to the tolerability of
      Novantrone® therapy in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) using dosing and monitoring
      recommendations specified in the package insert.
