      electrodes. These gaps can be configured to have different gap durations.

      The different variations of auditory stimulation with gaps will be presented to study
      participants via a standard MED-EL audio processor (Opus 2) bearing conformity marking. The
      programming of the processor will be performed using standard clinical hardware and software
      interfaces. These include the hardware interfaces "MAX interface box" and the "Diagnostic
      Interface Box" (DIB II) as well as the "MAESTRO" fitting software. After programming the
      respective configurations to the audio test-processor, a clinical word recognition test
      (Fournier) and a clinical consonant recognition test will be presented to the participants in
      a sound-shielded chamber using a free-field loudspeaker system.
