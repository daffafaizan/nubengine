      periods of time. This delay can potentially result in severe adverse outcomes such as
      cardiopulmonary arrest and need for admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). These
      complications occur despite the fact that, in most cases, measurable changes in physiological
      vital signs, could identify patients at risk. Moreover, occurrence of complications increase
      treatment costs considerably underpinning the rationale of early detection of patient
      deterioration in both human and economic terms.

      Monitoring of vital signs outside of ICU or telemetry units usually relies on intermittent
      manual assessments performed by clinical staff at intervals of up to 12 hours with the "Early
      Warning Score (EWS)", "Tidlig Opsporing af Kritisk Sygdom (TOKS)" or similar systems.
      However, significant deterioration may occur in-between these intervals, which may explain
      the EWS/TOKS score's proven lack of impact on morbidity and mortality in Danish hospitals.

      Recent medico-technical advances have allowed for clinical use of small wireless
      wear-and-forget devices that continuously monitor various indices of cardiopulmonary status,
      ambulatory activity, temperature etc. Studies suggest that integration of continuous
      monitoring into automated patient surveillance systems more often detects cardiorespiratory
      instability and may decrease number of Emergency Response Team activations, ICU transfers,
      length of hospital stay, morbidity and mortality but further randomized controlled trials
      (RCTs) are needed to confirm this. Other advantages may be a decrease in the time required
      for vital signs measurement and recording compared to routine monitoring and overall health
      care cost savings with return-on-investment estimates ranging from 127%-1739%.
