      studied.

      Participants of this surveillance will be patients with unresectable, advanced or recurrent
      colorectal cancer with the wild-type KRAS gene. The planned sample size is 2,000 patients.

      The usual adult dosage is 6 mg/kg of panitumumab given by intravenous drip infusion over a
      60-minute period once every 2 weeks. The dosage may also be reduced as needed, depending on
      the patient's condition.
