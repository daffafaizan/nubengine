      causing a substantial morbidity, mortality and consequently a large burden to the health care
      system in the diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of these patients.

      The primary objectives of this study is to determine carcinoma- and adenoma lesion true
      detection rate of HAL fluorescence colonoscopy in patients with known or strong suspicion of
      neoplasia in the colon. The secondary objective and endpoints are to determine carcinoma- and
      adenoma lesion false detection rate of HAL fluorescence colonoscopy, to compare carcinoma-
      and adenoma lesion true detection rates and the false detection rates of fluorescence with
      standard colonoscopy and to characterize the safety profile of HAL fluorescence colonoscopy.
