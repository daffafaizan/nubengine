      (SCIs). Nearly one-quarter of all SCI cases involve injury to the upper spinal cord segments
      which impairs neural activation of the diaphragm muscle and compromises breathing. Although
      mechanical ventilation can be life-saving after cervical SCI (C-SCI), it also triggers rapid
      and profound diaphragm muscle atrophy, thereby complicating (or even preventing) ventilator
      weaning. Intramuscular diaphragm stimulation, or diaphragm pacing, was developed to replace
      long-term ventilator support and is now used acutely post C-SCI (<4 months following injury)
      to promote ventilator weaning. This study will assess the effects of diaphragm stimulation on
      respiratory neural drive and breathing function in individuals with acute, traumatic C-SCI.
      Recording from these surgically implanted electrodes allows comparisons of electromyogram
      (EMG) recordings, in association with respiratory assessments, before and after short periods
      of diaphragm pacing to isolate the unique contribution of diaphragm pacing on neuromuscular
      diaphragm activation.
