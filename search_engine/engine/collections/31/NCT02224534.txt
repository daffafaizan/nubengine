      mg loading and 90 mg twice daily maintenance) vs. clopidogrel (600 mg loading and 75 mg daily
      maintenance) on long-term left ventricular (LV) remodeling measured by 3D echocardiography in
      STEMI patients undergoing primary PCI.

      The primary objective of the HEALING-AMI study is to demonstrate the novel role of long-term
      ticagrelor therapy in reducing the risk of LV remodeling,. The secondary objectives are to
      reveal the cross-talk between platelet and inflammatory process in ST-segment elevation
      myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients. Moreover, this study will determine whether the high
      platelet inhibition by ticagrelor culminate the protection of infarcted myocardium.
