      and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a
      specific disease. "Investigational" means that the drug is being studied.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved pembrolizumab for this
      specific disease but it has been approved for other uses.

      The study drug is an antibody that targets a molecule called PD-1. PD-1 is used to turn down
      the immune system. In general, this is used by the body to prevent the immune system from
      being too active. However, several cancers appear to use this pathway to prevent the immune
      system from attacking them. The theory behind this study is that by blocking PD-1, we may be
      able to prevent the cancer from hiding from the immune system and allow the immune system to
      attack the cancer more effectively. There is evidence that the type of lymphoma the
      participant have may use PD-1 to escape the immune system.
