      in transvaginal ultrasound(TVS).TVS can also demonstrate the interface between these tissues
      - the endometrial myometrial zone(EMJ) .This is optimally achieved in 3 dimensions images in
      a coronal section of the uterus.A specific computerized algorithm was developed in our unit
      by using MATLAB software for the quantitative measurements of the EMJ width in different
      uterine planes.The investigators aim to evaluate changes in the width of the EMJ in different
      uterine planes in participants during natural menstrual cycle .
