      mother-child emotional connection and co-regulation. Many current interventions aim at
      helping the child to self-regulate with or without the mother's help. However, the ability of
      the mother-child dyad to promote optimal development is dependent on their ability to
      co-regulate. The interactive co-regulation between the mother and the child shapes the
      behavior of both the mother and the child.

      This study aims to investigate the feasibility and short term effects of participation in the
      Family Nurture Intervention for preschool aged children with developmental and behavior
      problems. Mothers and children will be engaged by Nurture Specialists in comforting and
      calming interactions to co-regulate with each other during weekly group sessions with the
      support of study staff. Intervention sessions will occur over the course of eight weeks, and
      each mother will decide how many sessions to attend.
