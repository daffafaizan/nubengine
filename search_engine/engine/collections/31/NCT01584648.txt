      150 mg b.i.d and 2 mg q.d., respectively. Subjects in the combination therapy arm received
      both agents; subjects in the dabrafenib monotherapy arm received dabrafenib and placebo.
      Treatment was continued in both arms until disease progression, death, unacceptable toxicity,
      or withdrawal of consent.

      After treatment discontinuation, subjects were followed for survival and disease progression
      as applicable to collect data for the secondary objective of overall survival (OS).

      Crossover to the combination therapy arm was allowed for subjects still receiving study
      treatment on the dabrafenib monotherapy arm after the positive result for the final OS
      analysis.
