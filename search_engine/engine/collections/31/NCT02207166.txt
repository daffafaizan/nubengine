      engineering or usability engineering practices of various types or models of marketed
      home-use blood pressure monitors (BPM) in real use. Participants of the intended user
      population interact with marketed BPMs in research to assess ease of learning, ease of use,
      effectiveness and efficiency of use, memorability, safety, and/or user appeal among the many
      possible attributes of interest. With these understanding and analysis of human factors
      engineering / usability engineering (HFE/UE) practiced status, it can help manufacturers to
      capture the required and diversified HFE/UE essences with the minimum or limited professional
      technical resources in hand some more efficiently.
