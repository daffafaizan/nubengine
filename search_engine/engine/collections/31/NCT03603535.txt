      activity and situations that result in an increase of abdominal pressure like sneezing,
      coughing or laughing and affects up to 25% of women. Currently there are a number of tapes on
      the market with GYNECARE TVT EXACTÂ® (Tension free Vaginal Tape) and TVT- Obturator being one
      of the tapes with the highest subjective and objective cure rates and relatively low adverse
      events in women with normal sphincter pressure. Due to the recent FDA announcements several
      tapes have been withdrawn from the market and several new ones have been designed. Data from
      other tapes are available, however data especially from newer tapes is lacking.
