           control subjects.

        2. For the patients, diagnoses of schizophrenia will be confirmed using the Chinese version
           of the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI). At the baseline and Week
           12, patient blood samples will be obtained to measure the levels of neuroendocrine
           substrates (didehydroepiandrosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, pregnenolone, and
           cortisol) and metabolite markers (lipid profiles, glycerate, eicosenoic acid, pyruvate,
           b-hydroxybutyrate, Cysteine). Cognitive function will be evaluated using the Brief
           Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia. The participants' clinical symptoms and daily
           activities will be assessed using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, 17-item
           Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, and Personal and Social Performance Scale.

        3. For the healthy control subjects, psychiatric diagnoses will be verified using MINI, and
           blood samples will be obtained once to measure neuroendocrine and metabolite marker
           levels.
