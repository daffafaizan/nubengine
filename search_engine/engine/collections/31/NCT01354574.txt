      but limited evidence suggests that fatty acid oxidation may be depressed leading to periodic
      elevation of circulating lipids associated with meal ingestion and preferential storage of
      fat in adipose tissue. With the traditional approach of restrictive dieting failing to result
      in permanent weight loss and, possibly producing abnormalities in lipid metabolism, it is
      important to evaluate alternative approaches to achieve a healthy body weight through
      improved metabolism. In this study the investigators will test the postprandial metabolic
      effects of standard mixed meals containing carbohydrates with high glycemic index and compare
      these effects to responses obtained with standard mixed meals, matched for protein and fat
      content but containing carbohydrates with low glycemic index.
