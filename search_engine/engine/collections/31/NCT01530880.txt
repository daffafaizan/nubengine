    
      This is an open-label, investigator initiated single center, randomized, prospective study.
      Subjects meeting enrollment criteria will be randomly assigned 1:1 to one of two groups:

        1. Standard Care: Acetaminophen 650 mg via oral/nasogastric tube every 6 hours as needed
           for T>=38.3 C (100.9 F) for up to post bleed day 14 or discharge from the Neuro ICU,
           whichever comes first.

        2. Ibuprofen 400 mg/100 mL NS IV over 30 minutes, followed by a continuous infusion of 2000
           mg/500 mL NS at 85 mg/hour (21 mL/hour) for up to post bleed day 14 or discharge from
           the Neuro ICU, whichever comes first.

      Patients/surrogates will be approached for consent and randomized upon admission. Therapy
      will only be initiated once a patient becomes febrile (>=38.3 C, 100.9 F). The use of
      temperature modulating devices will be permitted as per institutionally approved guidelines
      in those patients continuing to demonstrate a fever (T>38.3 C, 100.9 F) with either therapy.
