      administered continuous oral dosing at 960 mg twice daily or dose administered at time of
      disease progression with Vemurafenib previous treatment (720 or 480 mg).Treatment will be
      continued until progression or unacceptable toxicity. The Progression-free survival will be
      assessed as primary endpoint, other outcomes(i.e., incidence of grade III-IV toxicity,
      Disease Control Rate, and Overall Survival) will be considered secondary endpoints.
