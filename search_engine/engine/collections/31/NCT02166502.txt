      at our institutions for prevention of vertical transmission (VT) in high risk infants, the
      optimal prophylactic dose of nevirapine is unknown. The National Institute of Health (NIH)
      guidelines currently recommend a single 2 mg/kg dose of nevirapine given to the infant within
      72 hours of birth, however, this dose is not being used in practice given the controversies
      previously described with single-dose nevirapine. In the absence of any guidance to inform
      the multiple daily dosing of nevirapine for prophylaxis of VT, we are currently using the
      treatment dose for infants >15 days of age of 150 mg/m2 once daily for 14 days, then
      increasing to 150 mg/m2 twice daily for 14 days. This is analogous to the treatment dosing of
      triple antiretrovirals (ARVs) that is given for occupational post-exposure prophylaxis.
      Nevirapine is given for 4 weeks total with zidovudine (AZT) and lamivudine (3TC), followed by
      2 additional weeks of AZT and 3TC to prevent the development of nevirapine resistance from
      its long half life. Stopping all 3 drugs simultaneously would result in a period of
      functional NVP monotherapy, resulting in a risk of NVP resistance should the infant become
      infected despite prophylaxis. Since the dose of nevirapine being used in our clinic
      populations for prevention of VT is higher than has been previously studied in neonates, it
      is important to evaluate the safety and efficacy of this dosing regimen, using therapeutic
      drug monitoring.
