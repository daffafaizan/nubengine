      the link between cognitive impairment, particularly executive dysfunction, and mobility/gait
      abnormalities in older adults, even in those labeled as "cognitively normal". Emerging
      evidence demonstrates that executive dysfunction is an early phenomenon in the pathway to
      mobility disability and subtle changes in executive function are independently associated
      with future falls. The investigators have piloted studies showing that pharmacological
      enhancement of executive function, can improve gait-motor performance and, potentially,
      reduce mobility decline and risk of falls. This supports the rationale for a promising
      intervention: enhancing cognition to prevent mobility decline and reduce risk of falls. The
      long-term goal is to create a clinical research program to apply rTMS as an early novel
      intervention for cognitive/motor interaction to ultimately delay the onset of cognitive and
      mobility disabilities and their devastating consequences, dementia and falls, in older
      adults. However, it is first necessary to study a smaller group of seniors to plan for
      recruitment, study retention and compliance, and to gather preliminary data as proof of
      principle before proceeding to a larger clinical trial.
