    
      DMD is the most common and devastating type of muscular dystrophy (incidence 1 in 3500 live
      born males worldwide). DMD is characterized by a complete loss of dystrophin, leading to
      progressive muscle weakness and wasting.

      No cure is currently available despite our present understanding of the disorder and the
      discovery and characterization of the causative gene and its protein product dystrophin in
      1987. Corticosteroids (prednisone, deflazacort) may delay disease progression and until now
      it is the only treatment that proved to be beneficial for patients with DMD. Other
      alternative supplements like creatine and glutamine also delay diseased progression.
