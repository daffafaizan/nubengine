      UK treated with cardiac ablation for cardiac arrhythmias. The potential benefits include
      support for clinicians to improve their performance, assisting patients in making informed
      choices and strengthening audit and research.

      Phase 1 of the study will involve patient interviews with approximately 30 patients from 2
      sites. These, together with input from a multidisciplinary team, will aim to improve drafts
      of disease specific questionnaires. This will be followed by Phase 2 which will trial the
      questionnaires in a group of approximately 600 patients from three sites. In Phase 2 patients
      will be asked to complete a pre-procedure questionnaire relating to their symptoms, quality
      of life and procedure expectations. They will also be sent post-procedure questionnaires
      relating to procedural outcomes, symptoms and quality of life at 8-16 weeks post procedure
      and at 1 and 5 years post-procedure.

      The responses obtained from these PROMs will be used to undertake recommended statistical
      tests of reliability and validity.
