      the mortality of those over 65 years old are the highest. The elderly patients with CAP have
      more complications and drug resistance, which makes it difficult to treat and have heavy
      burden on the society. The discharged elderly patients with CAP are still facing the risk of
      readmission or even death due to recurrent pneumonia or other reasons. Research reports
      showed that TCM syndrome differentiation treatment had a certain role in improving the
      condition of discharged elderly patients with CAP. Our previous exploratory studies suggested
      that TCM syndrome differentiation treatment on the discharged elderly patients with CAP had
      good clinical efficacy and safety.

      This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial to evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of TCM syndrome differentiation on the rehospitalization rate of
      discharged elderly patients with CAP and to explore its mechanism. 292 patients will be
      randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to experimental group or control group for 2 months
      treatment and 6 months follow-up.The experimental group will be given by Bu Fei Jian Pi Hua
      Tan granule or Yi Qi Yang Yin Qing Fei granule based on TCM syndrome differentiation. The
      primary outcomes are rehospitalization rate. The secondary outcomes include mortality,
      assessment of disease severity(CURB65 scores),quality of life (SF-36), treatment
      satisfaction(ESQ-CAP),Clinician Reported Outcome for CAP,Patient Reported Outcome for
      CAP,nutritional status (MNA-SF).
