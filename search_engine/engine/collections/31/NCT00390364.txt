        -  Determine response rate, time to tumor progression, and survival of patients with
           advanced or metastatic refractory colorectal cancer and mutations in the PI3K gene
           treated with everolimus.

        -  Determine the toxicity profile of this drug in these patients.

        -  Measure the signaling pathways activated in these patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacodynamic effects of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.

      Patients receive oral everolimus once daily on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients undergo tumor biopsies and normal skin biopsies at baseline and after the first
      course of study treatment. Tumor tissue is examined for biological markers (e.g., epidermal
      growth factor receptor, ERK, Akt, p70s6k, p27, and Rb protein) by immunohistochemistry;
      apoptosis quantification by TUNEL assay; Ki-67 quantification and Ki-index; gene expression;
      and c-fos and p27 expression by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 37 patients will be accrued for this study.
