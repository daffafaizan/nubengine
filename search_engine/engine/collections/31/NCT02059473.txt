      operative repair. The results of surgery are in most cases good but there are also good
      results in the literature from conservative treatment. So far there has been no prospective
      randomized comparison between the two treatments. When it comes to degenerative non-traumatic
      tears, level 1 and 2 studies have not been able to show the superiority of surgery.

      This study takes place in 2 clinics in Sweden (Link√∂ping and Kalmar). Patients who have no
      previous shoulder conditions, a trauma to the shoulder and pain and/or inability to lift
      their arm will undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). If this indicates a full-thickness
      rotator cuff tear of the cranial part of the rotator cuff the patient will be randomized to
      surgery or physiotherapy. Surgical intervention is mini-open repair.

      Follow-up takes place at 3 months, 6 months and 12 months with patient scores taken by a
      blinded independent physiotherapist. At 12 months a new MRI is conducted as well.
