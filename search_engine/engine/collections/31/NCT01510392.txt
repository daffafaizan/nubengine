      than is available with typical eye exams. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an imaging
      technology that can perform non-contact cross-sectional imaging of tissue structure in real
      time. It is similar to ultrasound B-mode imaging, except that OCT measures the intensity of
      reflected light rather than sound waves.
