      mortality, particularly in patients undergoing hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). HCT
      patients are at high risk for CLABSI due to multiple factors, including prolonged immune
      suppression and the need for long-term central venous access. The investigators want to
      assess the feasibility of the use of a parafilm central line barrier (parafilm) as standard
      of care in pediatric HCT patients. The investigators will also assess the effectiveness of
      the parafilm to reduce the incidence of CLABSI in these patients.
