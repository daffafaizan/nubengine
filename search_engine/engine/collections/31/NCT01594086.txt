      aged society. Among them, the Alzheimer disease is a major cause of the illness, which is
      progressively worse, has no fundamental curable therapy, and induces the burdens of
      caregivers as well as the health insurance and national budget. Recently, homocysteine
      metabolism is reported to be related to atherosclerosis in aging, and draw attention as the
      etiology of cognitive dysfunction in elderly.

      Green tea contains catechins and theanine as main ingredients. These components are reported
      to have anti-atherogenic action and effect on improving cognitive dysfunction. However,
      clinical evidence for homocysteine metabolism and cognitive dysfunction has not been
      clarified. Therefore, in this study, the investigators attempted to investigate the effects
      of green tea consumption on homocysteine metabolism and cognitive dysfunction in elderly with
      impaired cognitive function.
