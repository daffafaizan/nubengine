    
      Multicenter, non-randomized, longitudinal case series clinical trial designed to reinforce
      the current safety and efficacy clinical data of the Dokimos Plus aortic valve and renew the
      CE mark.

      The study foresees the inclusion of 80 patients recruited prospectively. Patients over 65 who
      have been diagnosed with a heart valve disease and who require surgical aortic valve
      replacement, or younger patients who are unsuitable for long-term anticoagulation due to
      medical contraindications or lifestyle considerations. The study will collect information on
      the Dokimos Plus aortic valve transvalvular gradient at 6 months and 12 months after the
      implantation. In addition, patients will be annually followed-up, up to 10 years after
      implantation.

      The objective of the study valve is to improve life expectancy and quality of life of
      patients with a diseased aortic valve, replacing it with a bioprosthesis that can be safely
      implanted, with good hemodynamics and long durability.

      Clinical studies carried out up to date have shown that the Dokimos Plus aortic valve
      presents satisfactory clinical and hemodynamic results, similar to those of other
      bioprothesis available on the market. In addition, the post-marketing surveillance carried
      out by the manufacturer has not revealed any relevant events regarding the Dokimos Plus
      aortic valve safety profile.
