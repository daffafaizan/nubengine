    
      BACKGROUND:

      Blister fluid has been used to measure cytokine expression, proteomic profiles, and
      pharmacokinetics in a variety of disease states.

      Blister fluid inside radiation treatment fields has been shown to have altered expression of
      cytokines and products of collagen metabolism.

      Evaluation of blister fluid in normal skin inside and outside the radiation field may allow
      the development of a minimally invasive marker of radiation exposure or damage induced by
      radiation in irradiated skin.

      OBJECTIVES:

      This protocol will evaluate the ability to determine a cytokine pattern and global changes at
      the protein level measured in blister fluid that correlates with radiation exposure, absorbed
      skin dose, or skin toxicity from patients receiving radiation.

      ELIGIBILITY:

      Patients in whom radiotherapy is required for standard management of their breast or prostate
      cancer.

      Healthy volunteers with no history of cutaneous inflammatory condition of the skin such as
      eczema, or psoriasis.

      DESIGN:

      This protocol is designed to evaluate blister fluid in and out of the radiation field in
      patients that are receiving radiation therapy and in healthy volunteers.

      Patients will undergo blister induction and blister fluid collection prior to treatment
      outside of the radiation field, and after completion of radiation within the radiation field.

      Blisters will be induced in a non-sun exposed area and if possible in matched sites (i.e.
      left and right).
