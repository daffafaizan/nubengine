    
      This study is performed in order to investigate the molecular mechanisms of action of
      photo(chemo)therapy in skin diseases, including psoriasis, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, other
      lymphoproliferative disorders of the skin, eczema, lichen planus, prurigo/pruritus,
      polymorphic light eruption, mastocytosis, graft-versus-host disease, vitiligo and other
      photo(chemo)therapy-responsive diseases. Twenty patients will be enrolled per diagnosis
      group. The phototherapeutic modalities administered will be UVB, UVA, PUVA and/or
      extracorporeal photochemotherapy (photopheresis). The severity of disease and clinical
      response to treatment will be assessed with scores including dermatological quality of life
      (DLQI) and disease-specific scores such as PASI (psoriasis area and severity index), mSWAT
      (modified severity-weighted assessment tool), SCORAD (scoring atopic dermatitis), scleroderma
      score and/or different visual analog scale (VAS) scores for pruritus. The effect of treatment
      on a variety of laboratory endpoints will be investigated in blood samples and optionally
      also skin samples. Those endpoints include among others the regulation of
      cytokines/chemokines, immune function, clonality of immune cells, vitamin D, and serum
      lipids. The study will address whether and how photo(chemo)therapy affects specific biologic
      pathways in the different disorders and determine whether predictive biomarkers for
      therapeutic response exist.
