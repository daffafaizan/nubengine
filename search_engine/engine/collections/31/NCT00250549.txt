      Medical Center Adult ED were recruited for rapid HIV testing. After consenting for the rapid
      HIV test and completing measures on condom intention and condom use self-efficacy,
      participants were randomized to either a fifteen-minute HIV post-test educational video
      available in English or to an HIV counselor for post-test counseling. Afterwards, both groups
      completed a measure of HIV knowledge assessing relevant testing information and level of
      satisfaction. An equivalence analysis was carried out to assess whether the video was at
      least as good as counseling, measured by total score on the knowledge questionnaire, with a
      lower equivalence bound of -5%.
