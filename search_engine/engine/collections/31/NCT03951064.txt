      Randomized-controlled clinical trial. Patients will be enrolled within 4 days of mechanical
      ventilation and randomized 1:1 to titration of PEEP based on esophageal balloon pressures or
      based on the "High PEEP" ARDSnet PEEP/FiO2 (fraction of inspired oxygen) table. All patients
      will have esophageal balloons placed with baseline measurement of Ptp. Patients randomized to
      the intervention arm will then undergo titration of PEEP based on Ptp measurements to achieve
      "Optimal PEEP," defined as end expiratory Ptp of 0 to +2 cm H2O.
