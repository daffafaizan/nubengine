      plasma samples collected at rest and immediately after the completion of an all-out ergo
      spirometry test, conducted during the baseline examination. Additionally participants will
      perform a pulse wave analysis to evaluate their arterial stiffness, a bioimpedanzanalysis to
      evaluate their body composition, blood lipids will be measured as well as their exercise
      capacity.

      After the baseline examination, all participants will perform once per week a supervised
      endurance and strength training at our facility. In addition, the participants will be
      provided with a digital application for planning and documentation of their home based
      physical activity. Together with an expert, they plan their weekly physical activities so
      that they reach 150 min of physical activity each week over a period of 4 months.

      After this training/exercise intervention all participants will perform all measurements from
      the baseline examination again.
