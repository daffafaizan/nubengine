        -  Compare survival of patients with previously untreated stage IB, II, or selected IIIA
           non-small cell lung cancer after preoperative chemotherapy comprising paclitaxel and
           carboplatin plus surgery vs surgery alone.

        -  Compare these regimens in terms of operative mortality and other toxic effects in these
           patients.

        -  Evaluate the response rates (confirmed and unconfirmed) and toxic effects associated
           with combined paclitaxel and carboplatin in these patients.

        -  Obtain samples for correlation of radiologic, pathologic, molecular, and biologic
           factors with the outcome in patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      clinical stage (IB or IIA vs IIB or IIIA).

      Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms:

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo thoracotomy. All accessible hilar (level 10) lymph nodes are
           dissected, and complete mediastinal lymph node sampling is performed.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours followed by carboplatin IV over 30
           minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for a maximum of 3 courses in the
           absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Within 2-6 weeks of course 3,
           patients undergo thoracotomy and lymph node dissection as in arm I.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 5 years, and then
      annually until year 10.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 600 patients (300 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 4 years.
