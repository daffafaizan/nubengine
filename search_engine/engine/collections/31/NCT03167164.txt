      experience progressive disease (PD) or experience unacceptable toxicity (not correctable with
      dose reduction), withdraw consent, or if the investigator feels it is no longer in the
      subject's best interest to continue treatment. Those who have a complete response (CR) will
      enter phase 2 of the study. Subjects may remain on phase 2 of the study for up to 1 year.
      Treatment will continue in phase 2 until the subject experiences PD or unacceptable toxicity
      (not correctable with dose reduction), withdraws consent, or if the investigator feels it is
      no longer in the subject's best interest to continue treatment.
