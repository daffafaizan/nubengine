      accurately predicts which patients will develop metastasis. Tumors with a class 1 gene
      expression signature have a very low risk, and those with a class 2 signature have a high
      risk of metastasis. The molecular test was initially performed on tissue obtained from
      enucleated eyes using commercial microarray platforms. We are now able to perform the
      molecular test on fine needle biopsy specimens, and we have developed a customized test that
      has greater dynamic range and sensitivity than commercial microarray platforms. The goal of
      this study is to validate the prognostic accuracy of the customized platform by performing
      the molecular test on primary uveal melanomas obtained from enucleation, local tumor
      resection or fine needle biopsy. Each sample will be diagnosed as either class 1, class 2 or
      indeterminate. Outcomes will be collected and the ability of the molecular diagnosis to
      predict metastasis will be evaluated at regular intervals.
