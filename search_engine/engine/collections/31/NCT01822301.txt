      crashes, are characterized by destruction of bone and soft tissue anatomy. While the bony
      skeleton can often be reconstructed, the overlying soft tissue is difficult to restore.

      Importantly, it is the structure of the soft tissue that imparts the normal human form, and
      adequate reconstruction of soft tissue defects allows trauma victims to reintegrate into
      society. Accepted procedures for soft tissue reconstruction of the face involve tissue flap
      reconstruction procedures and autologous fat grafting. Tissue flap operations are extensive,
      often including microvascular surgery, and do not precisely correct the deformities. Fat
      grafting is a less invasive technique that allows for more precise shaping of the
      reconstructed tissues. However, autologous fat grafts may undergo resorption that can affect
      the appearance of the reconstruction over time. The degree of change in appearance after fat
      grafting has not been well studied for facial trauma patients.

      We hypothesize that subjects who have successfully completed participation in the study
      (PRO09060101) and experienced graft resorbtion will have improved outcomes with an additional
      fat graft treatment. We anticipate that additional fat graft treatment will fully restore the
      facial features and overcome fat loss from the initial fat graft treatment. Additionally, we
      hypothesize that the cellular properties of the fat precursor cells (preadipocytes) may
      correlate with fat graft retention
