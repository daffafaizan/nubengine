      predominant subtype of exudative or "wet" AMD in Asian populations, in contrast to choroidal
      neovascularization secondary to AMD (CNV-AMD) in Western populations. There are distinct
      differences in pathophysiological, clinical and epidemiological factors between the two
      subtypes, although they also share some common risk factors. In contrast to CNV-AMD, PCV does
      not seem to respond as well to anti-VEGF treatment. The optimal treatment option for PCV
      remains elusive, with most studies showing good short-term visual outcome but poorer
      longer-term outcome with current treatment strategies. Therefore, understanding the
      pathogenesis of PCV, while developing novel and effective treatments strategies to prevent
      PCV-related vision loss is significant unmet needs.

      The purpose of this study is to assess the effects and safety of ranibizumab therapy combined
      with TA versus ranibizumab monotherapy in patients with PCV. Second, the pharmacogenetics
      effect of inflammatory related genes and polymorphism in response to the treatments of PCV
      will be explored. To further confirm the role of inflammatory factors in the pathogenesis and
      advance of PCV, it is important to determine the levels of inflammatory factors in the
      anterior chamber aqueous humor from PCV patients, comparing with the aqueous humor acquired
      from the age-matched age-related cataract patients undergoing phacoemulsification.
