      The purpose of this protocol is to perform a screening evaluation of patients referred with
      stroke to determine their eligibility for current and future protocols aimed at understanding
      the mechanisms underlying plastic changes in the human central nervous system after brain
      lesions like stroke.

      Study population:

      Up to 1,200 adult patients with a history of stroke that occurred at least 3 months prior to
      participation and meeting the eligibility criteria below will be enrolled.

      Design:

      This is a screening protocol to determine eligibility for other HCPS protocols.

      Outcome measures:

      The outcome measure is the number of subjects who are eligible to subsequently enroll in HCPS
      studies.

      Description of Sites/Facilities Enrolling Participants:

      This protocol utilizes the NIH Clinical Center Outpatient Clinic.

      Study Duration:

      15 years.

      Participant Duration:

      One main screening visit that may be remote, in-person or both lasting approximately 4-5
      hours with periodic optional return visits as needed.
