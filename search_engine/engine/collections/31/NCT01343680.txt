      oncology patients. Flushing with heparin solution is routinely recommended to prevent
      occlusion of long term CVCs, although the concentration of heparin used, and frequency of its
      use varies between centres. Once weekly Normal saline is also used successfully in some
      pediatric enters. There is little evidence to support one method over the other.

      The investigators have designed a randomised crossover trial to directly compare once weekly
      Normal saline flushing with 3 times per week 10U/ml heparin flushing, to determine whether
      Normal saline is not inferior to heparin.
