      only NIDA Standardized Research Electronic Cigarettes (SREC) and tobacco cigarettes (TC)
      while enrolled on the study. Our overall goals are two-fold: (1) to compare nicotine and
      toxicant exposure and pharmacological effects of SREC used alone vs tobacco cigarettes alone
      (TC), or dual use; and (2) using SREC alone, TC alone, or ad libitum SREC use combined with
      50% reduction in usual TC use as a model for dual use, to examine the extent to which
      nicotine and toxicant exposure and biomarkers of potential harm compare among the 3 groups.
      The former would inform the effects of total switching, the latter would inform the potential
      harm reducing effects of smoking fewer TC while using EC.
