      blood at baseline in patients with SCD will correlate with leukotriene (LT) levels and will
      be reflective of the degree of airway obstruction; and that acute elevations in PlGF levels
      will occur during an acute sickle event and precede clinical and radiological recognition of
      ACS. This is a biological study that does not fall into the criteria of a phase I-IV trial.

      Measurements will be done at two stages. First, patients who are admitted to the hospital
      with an acute sickle event will have a daily evaluation for the first 4 days of the admission
      or up until the patient has an ACS event. Measurements of inpatient spirometry (at primary
      site only) and impulse oscillometry will be performed daily. Measurements on 35 ACS events
      with ACS developing on the 3rd/4th day of admission will be collected. Measurements on
      patients developing ACS will be compared to those who do not develop ACS will allow for
      earlier prediction of ACS. Finally, patients who have an ACS or admission for an acute
      sickling event will be evaluated again after 3-4 weeks in order to get a baseline
      measurement. One hundred baseline measurements will be made. Twenty of these baseline
      patients will also have one or two additional baseline evaluations at subsequent clinic
      visits to evaluate the overall non-event baseline distribution and intra-subject baseline
      variability. Patients will have measurements repeated if admitted for an acute event greater
      than one year since the last baseline measurement . These measurements will be used to see if
      there is any prognostic information for a subsequent acute or ACS event. Some patients may
      only have baseline data collected.
