    
      Autologous cultured fibroblast is derived from in vitro expansion of fibroblasts harvested
      from the patient's normal skin. Biopsies from behind a patient's ear are the source of
      fibroblasts, which are isolated, expanded through cell culture, and used for the correction
      of facial contour deformities such as nasolabial folds, glabellar crease, deep wrinkles of
      the forehead, and acne scars. Prior to final packaging, cell viability is assessed to be at
      least 85%.

      Each single use container of autologous cultured fibroblasts has approximately 20 million
      cells aseptically processed and suspended in 1 mL of sterile, buffered Dulbecco's Modified
      Eagles Medium (DMEM). Both the biopsy transport media and the cell culture media contain
      gentamicin. Residual quantities of gentamicin up to 5 Âµg/mL may be present in the Cell
      product
