      placebo-controlled, single-center interventional design. The aim is to investigate the
      effects on cognitive function and cardiometabolic risk markers after 12 weeks intake of a
      berry product vs. a reference product. The reference will be isocaloric and matched in taste,
      appearance, volume and macronutrient composition to the active berry product.

      Two groups, each of 50 volunteers, are studied. Volunteers will be patients attending the
      Cognitive medicine unit at Ã„ngelholm hospital, who have mild cognitive impairment (but not
      dementia). One group of volunteers will consume the berry product while the other group act
      as control and will consume the reference product.

      Each volunteer will be seen for a screening visit as well as one pre- and one
      post-intervention visit at the clinic. In addition, there will be 2 follow-up calls in
      between visits. Pre- and post-intervention visits will include cognitive assessment with the
      CANTAB battery (episodic memory and verbal recognition memory), as well as additional
      cognitive and behavioral tests. Cardiometabolic parameters will be addressed (plasma glucose,
      insulin, inflammatory markers, blood lipids, body composition) and fecal samples collected.
