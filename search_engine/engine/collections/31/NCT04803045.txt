    
      From July 2017 to March 2018 all patients who had attended an initial visit with an
      infertility specialist at the clinic, but had not returned for at least three months were
      selected to receive a follow up email. Those selected for an email excluded patients who the
      Investigator's knew had achieved a pregnancy, already had a plan for treatment, had visited
      for an egg freeze and all LGTBQ patients. The email asked if the patient had any questions
      about that visit, offered support to the patient and included contact information for the
      patient liaison sending the email. The email also asked each participant to indicate why they
      had not returned and were provided 4 options and an opportunity to write in a response. From
      April 2018 to December 2018 no emails were sent to patients. No other change of patient
      contact practice was initiated during the trial period. This study will observe routine to
      care behavior of these patients after 11 months post initial consult date.
