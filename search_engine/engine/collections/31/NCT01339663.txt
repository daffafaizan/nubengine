      I. Assess the safety and toxicity of T-APC vaccination following adoptive T cell therapy.

      II. Evaluate the functional and numeric in vivo persistence of adoptively transferred
      cytotoxic t lymphocytes (CTL) followed by T-APC vaccination.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the antitumor effect of adoptive T cell therapy followed by T-APC vaccination.

      OUTLINE : This is a dose-escalation study of T-APC vaccine.

      INFUSION I: Patients receive high-dose cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) on days -4 and -3
      and low-dose aldesleukin (IL-2) subcutaneously (SC) twice daily (BID) on days 0-14. Patients
      also receive CTL IV on day 0.

      INFUSION II: Beginning 6-48 hours later, patients receive high-dose cyclophosphamide,
      low-dose IL-2, and CTL as in Infusion I. Patients also receive T-APC vaccine IV within 18-36
      hours following CTL infusion and in week 4, and IL-2 SC BID on days 0-14 following second
      T-APC vaccination.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 8 weeks.
