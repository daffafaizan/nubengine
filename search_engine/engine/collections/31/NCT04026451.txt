      propofol consumption with respect to deep sedoanalgesia guided by the sedation-agitation
      scale in patients hospitalized in the Intensive Care Unit under mechanical ventilation.

        -  Group intervention: sedation will be guided by SEF95 and SAS. Patients will be sedated
           to keep a SAS 1-2 with a SEF95 between 10 to 13 Hz.

        -  Group control: sedation will be guided by SAS. However, SEF95 will be also recorded but
           covered.
