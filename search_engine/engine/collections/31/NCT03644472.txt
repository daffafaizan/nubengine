      estrogen, women experience a unique accelerated rise in cardiovascular disease risk factors
      following menopause. Postmenopausal women represent a population at heightened risk for
      cardiovascular disease development. Function of the endothelium has been shown to decline
      across the menopause transition, resulting in less production of nitric oxide. As such the
      investigators are investigating a potential therapeutic strategy in women have recently
      undergone menopause to boost nitric oxide availability.
