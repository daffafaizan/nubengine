      from the School of Dentistry, University of Greifswald. All subjects gave their written
      consent to participate in the study. They then completed a TMD history questionnaire and
      underwent a clinical examination. The examination included palpation of the masticatory
      muscles and the TMJs, range of mandibular motion measurements, and assessment of joint
      noises. The TMD cases were required to have a diagnoses of myofascial pain and/or arthralgia.
      Controls had to be free of pain symptoms in their masticatory muscles and TMJs. Body posture
      was measured during five minutes of walking using an ultrasound-distance measuring device
      (sonoSensÂ® Monitor) with small sensors placed on the skin that continually record changes in
      the distance between them. A static posture evaluation was performed with a contactless, and
      radiation-free static measurement of the back surface and spine using a 3D measurement system
      (formetric II). A second measurement was performed after insertion of the occlusal appliance
      and a third one after 7 days of treatment.

      The occlusal appliances were inserted after the first examination and all participants were
      instructed to use it at night and during examinations.
