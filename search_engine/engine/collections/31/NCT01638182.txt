      (MK-n; K2). The latter can be subdivided into the short-chain (e.g. MK-4) and the long-chain
      (e.g. MK-7, MK-8, and MK-9) menaquinones. Earlier studies have shown that high vitamin K
      intake leads to improved bone and vascular health by increased carboxylation of vitamin
      K-dependent proteins in these tissues. In the dietary range, MK-7 has been suggested to be
      the most effective cofactor for the carboxylation of Gla-proteins, such as osteocalcin (OC)
      and matrix-Gla protein (MGP).Until now, no randomized controlled trial has compared the
      efficacy of K1 versus MK-7 in a nutritional dose range. The investigators are therefore
      interested to compare the effects of K1 and MK-7 on OC and MGP carboxylation after
      supplementing these vitamins at a dose not exceeding the RDA.
