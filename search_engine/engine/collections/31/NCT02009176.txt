      accounting for more than 90% of primary liver cancer, the incidence ranked fifth of malignant
      tumors in the world. surgery and comprehensive treatment is recognized by the medical
      profession Surgical approach, including the open HCC hepatectomy and laparoscopic
      hepatectomy, minimally invasive surgery is the main theme of the 21st century, and
      laparoscopy as the one of the elements in the field of minimally invasive surgery which
      carried out more and more in liver surgery, but which one of the two methods to choice to
      hepatectomy lack of sufficient scientific evidence.The RCT research of laparoscopic
      anatomical and non-anatomical hepatectomy for HCC has not been reported at home and abroad;
      Intervention:We let the 110 patients divide into A, B groups randomly who are meet the
      inclusion criteria .Group A is Laparoscopic Anatomical Hepatectomy: Anatomy the corresponding
      liver segment pedicle and hepatectomy along the Glisson fiber sheath.Group B is Laparoscopic
      Aon-anatomical Hepatectomy:1 to 2 cm along the edge of the tumor complete hepatectomy

      Results:

        1. operation time, intraoperative blood loss, rate of blood transfusion, complications and
           mortality, postoperative liver function, resection margin, number of micrometastases
           ,long-term curative effect and survival time were collected and analysed.

        2. groups t-test ，univariate/multivariate analysis, logistic regression analysis, mixed
           linear regression, Cox survival analysis ，Kaplan-Meier survival analysis，Log-rank
           survival curves were used.
