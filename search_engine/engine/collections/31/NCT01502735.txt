      days. The illness is characterized by fever, headache, severe pain in muscles, joints, pain
      behind the eyes, and a rash. DENV infection can be complicated by the development of
      hemorrhagic fever (DHF) or shock syndrome (DSS), which is manifested by plasma leakage and a
      bleeding diathesis or frank hemorrhage. DHF is fatal in at least 0.5% of pediatric cases but
      rarely in adults. People, particularly children, living in hyper-endemic areas who have
      antibodies from an earlier dengue infection with one serotype are at increased risk for DHF
      if subsequently infected by another dengue virus serotype.

      Currently, no specific anti-viral therapy exists. Therapy is largely supportive. Mosquito
      control has failed to prevent dengue transmission; therefore, prevention of dengue through
      vaccination is an important objective of the World Health Organization (WHO) and many
      national governments, including the United States.
