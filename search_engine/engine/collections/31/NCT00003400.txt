      survival of patients with metastatic hormone refractory prostate cancer treated with high
      dose chemotherapy plus peripheral stem cell transplantation followed by consolidation
      chemotherapy. II. Evaluate the toxic effects associated with this treatment in these
      patients. III. Evaluate the quality of life, and need for analgesics, in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified by stage of disease and extent of metastatic disease.
      Patients receive daily filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously for 4 days until peripheral blood
      stem cells are collected. Patients then receive carmustine IV over 2 hours on day -2 and
      melphalan IV over 20 minutes on day -1. Stem cell infusion will be on day 0. At 3, 6, 9, and
      12 months after transplant, patients receive vinorelbine IV over 10 minutes and cisplatin IV
      over 24 hours. Quality of life and pain are assessed before the transplantation, just before
      discharge after transplantation, prior to each consolidation course, and then at 3, 6, and 12
      months after the final course of chemotherapy. Patients are followed at least every 3 months
      for the first 2 years, and then every 6 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-45 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
