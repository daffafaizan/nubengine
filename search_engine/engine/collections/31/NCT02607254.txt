      eligible for the single blind pregabalin treatment phase. Patients who respond to pregabalin,
      with at least 1 point improvement in neuropathic pain from baseline at the end of the single
      blind pregabalin treatment phase and meeting all other study requirements are considered
      eligible for participation in the withdrawal phase. These eligible patients are randomly
      assigned (1:1) to continue pregabalin or to be switched to placebo for a comparison of
      pregabalin efficacy and safety. Patients who have a worsening of average pain relative to the
      last week of the single blind pregabalin treatment period by more than one point and average
      pain level > =4 will be considered to have a loss of therapeutic response (LTR).
