      alone in patients with unresectable or recurrent gastric cancer. There is no standard
      second-line chemotherapy for advanced gastric cancer and no randomized-controlled trial data
      suggest a benefit of second-line chemotherapy compared with supportive care alone. Response
      rates of second-line therapy in phase II trials are similar to those seen for other cancers
      that are more commonly retreated. Combination therapy may achieve higher response rates than
      single agents, however, the survival outcome are the same. In addition, data suggest that
      patients may obtain symptomatic benefits from second-line therapy. In comparison to the
      toxicity profile of single agent with combination regimen, patients are more tolerable to
      single agent therapy than combination.

      Based on the previous clinical experience in second line chemotherapy of advanced gastric
      cancer, the single agent of PEP02, irinotecan and docetaxel are selected as the regimens for
      this randomized phase II study. The efficacy and toxicity outcome of the three-arm design
      will be a valuable reference for future combination therapy or phase III study design.
