    
      Observational pilot single-center study aiming to determine the microbiota of critically ill
      patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. COVID-19 patients will be compared to historical
      critically ill controls with no SARS-CoV-2 infection.

      Respiratory and fecal microbiota (microbial and fungal) will be determined in COVID-19
      patients on bronchoalveolar lavage and rectal swab.

      Inflammatory biomarkers will also be measured in COVID-19 patients.

      Characteristics of study patients will be collected at ICU admission and during ICU stay.
