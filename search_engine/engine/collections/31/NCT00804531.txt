      disc for patients with chronic back pain and MODIC I discopathy on MRI

      Methods: a multicenter double blind randomized control trial Setting: 3 tertiary care
      hospitals in France Patients: 134 patients with disabling chronic low back pain not relieved
      by usual recommended treatments and MODIC I (inflammatory) discopathy on MRI Intervention:
      Injection of 25 mg of methylprednisolone in the inter-vertebral disc during a discography
      (intervention group, 67 patients) or discography alone (control group, 67 patients) Outcome
      measures: The primary outcome measure is pain level assessed on a 11-point numeric scale
      (0-100) at 1 month. Success is defined as less than 40 on pain numeric scale at 1 month.
      Secondary outcome measures are pain level at 12 months, Disability (Quebec questionnaire),
      quality of life (SF-12) at 1 and 12 months, anxiety and depression (HAD), analgesics and
      anti-inflammatories during the last week, return to work, assessment of the disabilities at 1
      and 12 months and disc inflammation (on MRI) at 12 months. Tolerance and adverse effects will
      be recorded.

      Trial duration: 36 months(24 months for inclusion and 12 months follow-up) Follow-up visits:
      at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months Statistical analysis: intention to treat
