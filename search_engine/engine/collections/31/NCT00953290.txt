    
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the Cutera radio frequency device for the new
      indication of reduction of thigh circumference.

      At investigator's discretion, each subject will receive up to three treatments on one thigh
      and will be scheduled for two follow-up visits after the final treatment. The treated thigh
      will be clinically evaluated for side effects and both treated and untreated control thigh
      will be measured and photographed at each visit for analysis. Subjects will also be weighted
      at each visit and asked to fill out a survey during follow-up visits.
