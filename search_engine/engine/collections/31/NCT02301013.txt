      which connects the lower margin of the pubic bone and the lower side of the urethral part of
      the bladder. First measurement will be done on litotomy position in resting state, second on
      45 degrees reverse trandelenburg position in resting state and third one on 45 degrees
      reverse trandelenburg position in maximal valsalva straining state. The alteration between
      the angles measured at resting litotomy position and the resting reverse trandelenburg
      position is named as "passive mobility angle" (trigger gap) and the angle measured between
      the trigger gap and maximal valsalva state is named as "active mobility angle". Furthermore,
      post voiding residues have also been measured by transperineal ultrasonography.
