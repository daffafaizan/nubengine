    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine the safety of hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) in patients
           with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.

      Secondary

        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose of SRT in these patients.

        -  To determine the objective tumor response rate in terms of the percentage of tumor size
           change on CT, percentage of intensity change on MRI, and the percentage of change in
           alfa fetoprotein in patients treated with this therapy.

        -  To determine the value of 4-dimensional CT in liver cancer planning in terms of the
           extent of liver motion (three dimensionally) and the percentage of patients requiring
           breath gating due to the amplitude of organ motion exceeding 1 cm in any dimension.

        -  To determine the value of breath gating in liver cancer SRT in terms of the success rate
           of breath gating and the percentage of treatment time prolongation secondary to the
           gating.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy once daily on days 1-5.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed at 1 and 3 months.
