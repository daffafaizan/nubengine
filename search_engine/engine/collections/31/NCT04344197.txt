      Covid-19 pandemic, symptom driven guidelines for testing, hospital allocation and personal
      protective equipment (PPE) use do not seem appropriate to limit in-hospital transmission. At
      time when lockdowns are in place in most countries, hospitals can become the new source of
      infection.

      Guidelines are very variable depending on local policies and availability of medical
      supplies, resulting in most hospitals taking different preventive measures.
