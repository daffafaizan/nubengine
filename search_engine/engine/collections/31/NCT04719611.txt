      in a pilot, open-label interventional study for approximately 6 weeks following obtainment of
      informed consent. Participants will be asked to maintain their usual diets with the exception
      of probiotic supplements, probiotic fortified products or foods with added fiber supplements.

      On the first day of the study, participants will take part in a 1-week pre-baseline period
      where they will begin daily questionnaires inquiring about gastrointestinal symptoms, stool
      form and number, stress, and medications taken.

      On the first day of the intervention period (Day 1), participants will self collect a
      baseline vaginal swab sample, a skin swab, a vaginal pH swab, and a stool sample.
      Participants will begin consuming 1 capsule of probiotic supplement daily for 2 weeks (start
      of intervention). After these two weeks (Day 14), participants will increase the consumption
      of the probiotic supplement to 2 capsules per day for another 2 weeks (Day 28, end of
      intervention).

      Participants will self collect a vaginal swab sample, a skin swab, a vaginal pH swab, and a
      stool sample at Day 14 and at Day 28. An additional vaginal swab sample will be collected at
      Day 35 to assess for probiotic strains persistence.

      At the conclusion of the study, participants will be instructed to return any unused
      supplements to the study site.
