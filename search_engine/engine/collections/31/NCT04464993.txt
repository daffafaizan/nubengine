      inclusion in StandUPTV reduce SST by >60 min per day per day at 16 weeks. The three
      components tested will be: (a) LOCKOUT (no vs. yes); (b) TEXT (no vs. yes); and (c) EARN (no
      vs. yes). The investigators will use a highly efficient experimental strategy to detect
      effects of individual components as well as all two- and three-way interactions.

      The secondary aim of this study is to examine how reductions in SST displace time into other
      active behaviors, i.e., light-intensity physical activity (LPA), moderate-to vigorous
      physical activity (MVPA) and activity type (e.g., housework, walking, exercise behaviors).
      The investigators will use both device-based (activPAL3c) and self-report (ACT24) measures to
      understand whether SST displacement can increase active behaviors, particularly MVPA.
