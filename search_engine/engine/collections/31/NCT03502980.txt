      (PICCs) remain a cornerstone for the delivery of necessary intravenous therapy. PICCs are
      being selected for venous access more frequently today than ever before.

      The advantage of PICC is that it can be used for all intravenous therapy. However, PICC
      requires the use of fluoroscopy or other type of guidance which add to the cost and time
      required to insert the catheter. Midline, on the other hand, can be inserted under ultrasound
      guidance, takes less time to be inserted and cost less than PICC insertion.

      Despite lower cost and better accessibility of midline in comparison with PICC for
      non-vesicant intravenous therapy, there is very little evidence in the literature to suggest
      that one type of venous access is better than the other.

      The primary objective of this study is to assess the non-inferiority for safety and efficacy
      of using Midline in comparison with PICC for intravenous therapy that do not require a
      central catheter.

      Results of this trial will allow improving a quality of evidence for using midline instead of
      PICC for specified indications. If Midline are non-inferior for some indications, they would
      represent a more accessible and less expensive alternative than PICC insertion.
