      polymeric matrix that encompasses anti KRASG12D siRNA (siG12D) drug, designed to release the
      drug regionally within a pancreatic tumor, at a prolonged rate of 12-16 weeks.

      The majority of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas involve mutations in the KRAS oncogene (the
      most common is G12D), therefore stable administration of KRASG12D siRNA has the potential to
      silence and lead to apoptosis of such cancer cells and thereby slow and even halt the tumor
      growth.
