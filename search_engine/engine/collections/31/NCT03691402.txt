      (MCT-Silver). The study intends to investigate the extent to which MCT-Silver leads to a
      significant reduction in depressive symptoms compared to an active control group
      (mybraintrainingÂ©) (primary outcome: change in clinician-assessed depressive symptoms from t0
      to t1 and t2). Secondary outcomes include change in self-reported depressive symptoms and
      dysfunctional (meta) cognitive beliefs, as well as quality of life, rumination, self-reported
      anxiety, attitudes toward aging and neuropsychological functioning from t0 to t1 and t2. The
      study design is a randomized-controlled trial with one intervention group and one active
      control group.
