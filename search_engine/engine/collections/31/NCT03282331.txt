      complications, ranging from desaturation, severe hypoxemia and bradycardia with potential
      cardiac arrest and death. International recommendations suggest the use of non-invasive
      ventilation (NIV) technique whenever possible. High flow nasal cannula (HFNC) has recently
      gained growing interest in the ICU as a treatment of acute respiratory failure, to improve
      extubation success and as a preoxygenation device before endotracheal intubation. Conflicting
      results have been published.

      The PREONIV study was designed to compare NIV, HFNC and conventional preoxygenation with
      valve bag mask for the preoxygenation before endotracheal intubation.

      Investigator propose to add a lung morphology analysis during preoxygenation. Electrical
      impedance tomography (EIT) is a non invasive tool which analyse lung aeration variations via
      the evolution of local thoracic impedances with electrical loop circulating around a thoracic
      belt with electrodes.

      The hypothesis is that the technique of preoxygenation might correlate with oxygen
      desaturation and potential intubation related complications (PREONIV study). Moreover lung
      morphology modifications evaluated by EIT might be associated with the preoxygenation
      technique (MORPHEIT study).

      Investigator wish to asses lung morphological modifications evaluated by EIT during
      preoxygenation in a prospective non blinded randomized fashion.
