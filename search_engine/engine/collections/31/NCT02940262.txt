    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To assess the sensitivity on a per-patient and per-region-basis of Gallium Ga 68
      Gozetotide (68Ga-PSMA-11) PET for detection of tumor location confirmed by
      histopathology/biopsy, clinical and conventional imaging follow-up.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the positive predictive value (PPV) on a per-patient and per-region-basis of
      68Ga-PSMA-11 PET for detection of tumor location confirmed by histopathology/biopsy, clinical
      and conventional imaging follow-up (composite reference standard).

      II. To assess the sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) on a per-patient and
      per-region-basis of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET for detection of tumor location confirmed by
      histopathology/biopsy only.

      III. To assess the detection rates on a per-patient basis of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET stratified by
      prostate specific antigen (PSA) value (0.2 - < 0.5, 0.5 - < 1.0, 1.0 - < 2.0, 2.0 - < 5.0, >=
      5.0).

      IV. To assess the impact of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET on clinical management in biochemical recurrence
      (BCR) patients.

      V. To assess the inter-reader reproducibility. VI. To assess the safety of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET.
      VII. To assess the detection rates on a per-patient basis of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET stratified by
      PSA velocity and PSA doubling-time.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive gallium Ga 68-labeled PSMA-11 intravenously (IV). Beginning 50-100 minutes
      after receiving gallium Ga 68-labeled PSMA-11, patients undergo PET imaging.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up for 3-12 months.
