      ratio, were carried out involving patients diagnosis of CMC joint OA grade 1-2 (aged 18 years
      and above). Both assessor and statistician remained blinded. The research diagnostic criteria
      for carpometacarpal joint osteoarthritis was used to assess all individuals who agree to
      participate. All participants were submitted to a clinical examination and X-ray assessment
      of thumb base to determine carpometacarpal osteoarthritis grade. Based on the clinical and
      radiological findings, the participants were classified by a rheumatology. Those with CMC OA
      grade 2-3 were included in the study. The experimental group received laser therapy and
      control group received a placebo treatment.

      The primary outcome measures was pain scores during daily living activities (DLA)- at the
      base of the thumb measured with VAS (Unidimensional measure of pain: 0-10 (0, no pain and 10,
      worst pain), and changes in hand function measured using the Quick-Dash questionnaire.
      Secondary outcome measures included changes in pinch strength. All outcome measures were
      collected at baseline, immediately following the intervention at 4 weeks and at 12 weeks
      following the end of the intervention.
