      high-dose cohorts, 16 subjects per cohort) and will be randomized in a double-blind manner to
      PRV-101 or placebo in a 3:1 ratio. Each subject will receive up to 3 administrations of the
      study drug (PRV-101 or placebo) at 4-week intervals and will be followed for 24 weeks after
      the final dose. Each cohort will start with a sentinel dosing group (2 subjects). Cohort 2
      will commence after safety data from the first 2 doses from all Cohort 1 participants are
      reviewed.
