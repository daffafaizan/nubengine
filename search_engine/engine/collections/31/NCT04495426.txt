    
      Spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 (SCA10) is a rare ataxic disorder due to a large expansion of
      intronic (ATTCT)n repeat in ATXN10. SCA10 afflicts primarily Latin American (LA) populations
      of Native American Ancestry; recent discoveries of two East Asian (EA) SCA10 families
      suggests an Asian origin. SCA10 families from LA and EA share an ancestral haplotype that
      includes the G allele (allele frequency: 2-4% in EA and LA populations but 0% elsewhere) of a
      C/G/T single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at rs41524745
      (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/rs41524547#frequency_tab). Two characteristics suggest that
      rs41524745 has a functional role over the expansion: this SNP resides in the sequence
      encoding miR4762; and total linkage between the SNP and the SCA10 repeat, although they are
      ~35kb apart, a distance sufficient for multiple recombination events within the 15,000-20,000
      years since human migration across Bering landmass. We studied DNA samples with G allele at
      rs41524547 from the 1000 Genomes repository and our own samples from general populations and
      surprisingly found 0-25% of these G(+) samples have SCA10 repeat expansions. Since our
      genotype-phenotype data suggest that SCA10 expansions with (ATTCC)n or (ATCCT)n(ATCCC)n
      repeat insertion in the 3' end of (ATTCT)n expansion exhibit full penetrance while pure
      (ATTCT)n expansion has reduced penetrance, the last one can be more common than previously
      expected. Hypotheses: (1) the G allele at rs41524547 predisposes the SCA10 (ATTCT)n repeat
      for expansion (Type A expansion), that remains mostly non-penetrant, and (2) the
      (ATTCT)n-(ATTCC)n (Type B) or (ATTCT)n(ATCCT)n-(ATCCC)n (Type C) repeat drives the SCA10
      pathogenicity. To test the hypothesis, we propose three Aims in close collaborations between
      US and Brazilian SCA10 consortia:

      Aim 1. To determine the relationship between SCA10 and the G allele at rs41524547.

      Aim 2. To confirm that Type B and Type C expansions are pathogenic, but Type A expansions
      have significantly reduced pathogenicity.

      Aim 3. To determine if the G allele at rs41524547 reduces downstream recombination rates,
      protects against the toxicity of SCA10 RNA expansions, or promote expanded states of the
      SCA10 repeat.

      This effort will enable long term goals to: (1) identify people at risk for SCA10 by
      high-throughput screening of general populations for the G allele at rs41524547 in Brazil,
      (2) determine the frequency of non-penetrant SCA10 expansion alleles in Brazil, and (3)
      develop treatments of SCA10 based on results of this project.

      The proposed project requires complimentary expertise in multiple areas, including
      coordination of the clinical studies, along with recruitment plans and executions, management
      of tissue repository, maintenance and expansion of the clinical database, clinical MR
      technology and data analyses, which will be ongoing in both the US and Brazil.
