    
      Twelve obese HFpEF subjects with exercise intolerance (reduce cardiorespiratory fitness
      measured at maximal cardiopulmonary exercise test [CPX]) will be assigned to a single-arm
      open-label dietary intervention in which subjects are encouraged and financially supported to
      increase daily UFA consumption. The investigators will measure dietary compliance with a
      validated 24-hour dietary recall and with objective operator-independent biomarkers of UFA
      consumption.

      The investigators will also measure the effects of UFA supplementation on: metabolic
      flexibility, glucose tolerance and body composition. Participants will have the option to
      participate in overnight session in the whole indirect calorimeter room (WIC) at baseline and
      at the end of the study.
