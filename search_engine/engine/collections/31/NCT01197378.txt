      day treatment with cysteamine bitartrate delayed-release capsules (RP103). It will involve
      6-9 monthly clinic visits followed by quarterly clinic visits for the duration of the study
      and home use of cysteamine bitartrate delayed-release capsules.

      Initially, enrollment was open to those patients who had completed the previous Phase 3 Study
      (RP103-03, NCT01000961). Subsequently enrollment in Study RP103-04 was opened to additional
      participants, including children aged 1 to 6 years and renal transplant recipients, who had
      previously been on a stable dose of CystagonÂ® for at least 21 days.
