      to determine eligibility. If eligible and willing, subjects are given Palonosetron
      intravenously. Subjects are given the Palonosetron and Dexamethasone 30 minutes before the
      first dose of Irinotecan and Bevacizumab chemotherapy. The total expected duration of
      participation is 57 days. Subjects are also asked to complete 4 questionnaires about nausea
      and vomiting, as well as daily functioning and fatigue. Subjects are asked to complete these
      questionnaires before starting chemotherapy, the day of starting chemotherapy and for the
      next 4 days after receiving chemotherapy, for a total of 6 times. Subjects are asked to
      complete this set of questionnaires each of the 3 times that they receive chemotherapy during
      the 6-week treatment cycle.

      The other treatments subjects would normally receive for their brain tumor and their routine
      care are not affected by the study.
