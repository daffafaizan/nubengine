    
      This trial is a prospective randomized controlled study including the treatment of AO/OTA
      31-A2 fractures in 200 patients with 2 different surgical devices. 100 patients are treated
      with a Gamma Nail 3 (GN3) (Stryker) the other 100 patients with a Proximal Femoral Nail
      Antirotation (PFNA) (Synthes).

      All surgeries are performed by trauma surgeons at a Level 1 University Hospital. One hundred
      patients are randomized to the gamma nail and 100 are randomized to the proximal femoral nail
      for treatment fixation. A 1:1 randomization is performed using sealed envelopes (200 in
      total), which are opened by the surgeon immediately before the operation.

      Patients missing an informed consent form, incomplete chart, or showing a pathologic fracture
      are getting excluded from final comparisons.

      Patients anthropometric data as well as pre-injury mobility assessments, and ASA will be
      documented. Furthermore the time from admission to going to surgery, surgery length, length
      of stay and mobility assessment at dischargement are recorded.

      After surgery the stay in the hospital is documented precisely and patients are scheduled for
      next appointments 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months and 1 year after surgery.

      Postoperative X-rays are measured precisely to determine the Tip-Apex Distance (TAD), the
      Parkers-Ratio, the Singh-Score and the Neck-Shaft-Angle of the injured and contralateral
      side. Rates of complications as cut-out and reoperation-rates are evaluated. All
      intra-operative complications are noted and included in the chart.
