      study is to determine the feasibility of a large single dose Phase III study of hemophilia
      adult prophylaxis. The primary efficacy endpoint will be bleeding frequency. Secondary
      endpoints will include factor usage, joint range of motion, cost, quality-of-life, and
      inter-dose hypocoagulability by thrombin generation time and F.VIII activity will also be
      determined. Safety will be measured by the frequency of bleeding unresponsive to up to two
      rescue treatments. Inhibitor formation by anti-F.VIII Bethesda assay, and clinical frequency
      of thrombosis and allergic reactions will also be assessed. Subject acceptance and adherence
      to the treatment interventions will be determined; and web-based data entry of case report
      forms, digital range-of-motion images, and quality-of-life instrument will be implemented.
      The relation of bleeding frequency to relative inter-dose hypocoagulability, will be assessed
      by inter-dose thrombin generation time (TGT), endogenous thrombin potential (ETP), and factor
      VIII levels. Optimal blood sample collection and shipping methods will be determined. For all
      tests, we will estimate and determine completeness and congruency, in order to determine
      adjustments or revisions required before initiating a large phase III Randomized clinical
      trial. All testing will be exploratory, so that we may determine if the test, approach are
      realistic, and to estimate standard deviations for future power analyses.
