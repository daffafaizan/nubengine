      inflammation which may aid in the identification of non-flow obstructing lesions with an
      increased risk for future acute coronary events. This study will ascertain the prevalence and
      clinical significance of non-flow obstructing lesions, which subsequently result in acute
      coronary events - defined as vulnerable plaque. The safety of regional imaging of non-culprit
      lesions in ACS patients will also be assessed.
