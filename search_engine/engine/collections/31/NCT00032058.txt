        -  Compare the accuracy of MRI vs MRI combined with magnetic resonance spectroscopic
           imaging (MRSI) for the localization of prostate cancer prior to radical prostatectomy in
           patients with stage I or II adenocarcinoma of the prostate.

        -  Compare the incremental benefit of these tests on diagnostic accuracy in these patients.

        -  Compare the incremental benefit of MRSI for interobserver agreement vs MRI alone in the
           localization of prostate cancer in these patients.

        -  Compare the accuracy of combined MRSI with that of other available information on tumor
           extent derived from digital rectal exam, PSA level, Gleason score, and Partin nomogram
           in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      At least 6 weeks after biopsy, patients undergo MRI and magnetic resonance spectroscopic
      imaging (MRSI) over approximately 1 hour. Within 6 months of MRI/MRSI, patients undergo
      radical prostatectomy.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 134 patients will be accrued for this study within 7 months.
