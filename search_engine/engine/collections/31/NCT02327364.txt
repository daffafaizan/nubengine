      will be offered enrollment into this study. Patients followed at participating NAMDC clinical
      sites will be enrolled at those sites. Patients who are not followed at participating NAMDC
      clinical sites and wish to participate may contact one of the member sites directly or their
      local doctor may direct them to one of the member sites. Both male and female patients from
      all racial and ethnic backgrounds who satisfy the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be
      encouraged to participate. Children and adults will be eligible to be enrolled, but we expect
      the patient population to be mostly children.

      Each patient with Pearson Syndrome who enrolls in the NAMDC Clinical Registry will be
      encouraged to participate in this study. Each patient enrolling in this study will be
      required to enroll in the NAMDC Clinical Registry either prior to or upon enrolling in this
      study. Demographic, medical history, biochemical, histological, genetic, and other clinical
      data from the registry will be incorporated into this study.

      Every effort will be made to minimize the inconvenience to patients of participating in this
      study. The study-related activities at each patient visit will be kept to a maximum of one
      hour, and will, whenever possible, be scheduled to coincide with the patient's regular
      follow-up with his or her treating physician. This study is observational and has no
      associated medical procedures.
