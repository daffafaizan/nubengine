    
      This study will be a randomized controlled trial conducted over a 6 to 7 month period.
      Subjects will be enrolled by cohorts and randomly assigned to one of two groups.

        -  Group 1 (PA): physical activity intervention that will consist of brisk walking or other
           aerobic-type activities (6 days per week), resistance exercise (using free weights,
           resistance bands or weight stacks for weight lifting, 3 days per week), and 'active
           lifestyle' activities such as gardening, dancing, participation in sporting activities.
           The total time spent in these activities will add up to ~60 min/day for 6 days/week
           (~360 minutes per week).

        -  Group 2 (CON): control group will maintain their usual level of physical activity and
           participate in testing protocols, record keeping, and interviews on the same schedule as
           PA. This group will be offered an opportunity to have a gym membership/access to the
           training facility after completion of the 6-month period of serving as controls.

      The specific aims of this pilot study are to:

        -  Assess each participant's level of compliance/adherence

        -  Assess the dietary habits of study participants as they become more physically active.

        -  Identify barriers to physical activity in this specific population.

        -  Measure changes in body composition, physical fitness and energy expenditure.

        -  Evaluate changes in chronic disease risk factors.

        -  Determine if regular physical activity reduces chronic stress.
