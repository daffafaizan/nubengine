      functioning and health related quality of life in the two study regions, in relation to known
      predictors and to differences in organization of treatment- and rehabilitation. The inclusion

      months post stroke added information on functioning and rehabilitation. A questionnaire
      package was mailed to the participants 3- and 12-months post stroke. These included validated
