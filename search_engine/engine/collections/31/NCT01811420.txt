      in this randomized clinical trial. A total of 40 teeth were randomly divided into two
      treatment groups: group A, papain-based gel; and group B, conventional technique. Data
      collection included the time required for caries removal, need for local anesthesia, degree
      of discomfort, changes in the number of viable bacteria, and clinical evaluation of glass
      ionomer-cement restorations 6-month post-treatment.
