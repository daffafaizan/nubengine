    
      Zambia is a high burden country for both HIV and TB infection and HIV clinic enrollees are a
      high-risk group for active TB. Current Zambian Ministry of Health screening protocols are
      symptom-based even though active case-finding studies in HIV-infected populations have shown
      that symptoms are not always predictive of active TB. As a result, there may be a significant
      amount of un-diagnosed TB among HIV-infected Zambians even in the context of accessing HIV
      care. This study will examine an enhanced protocol to systematically screen a cohort of 400
      new HIV clinic enrollees for prevalence and 1-year incidence of TB using symptoms, light and
      fluorescence microscopy, chest radiography and TB culture of sputum and extra-pulmonary
      fluids (when indicated). In addition, the sensitivity, specificity and cost-effectiveness of
      each diagnostic tool will be evaluated.
