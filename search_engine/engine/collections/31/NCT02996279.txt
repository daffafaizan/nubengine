      (FIRS). The aim of this pilot study was to evaluate S100A12, a marker of innate immune
      activation, in mothers with or without HCA and in their infants.

      Concentrations of S100A12, Interleukin 6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were evaluated
      in maternal, cord, and neonatal blood of very preterm infants. Histologic examinations of
      placentae and umbilical cords were performed.
