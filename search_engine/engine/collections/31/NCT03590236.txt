      to the structures of the pelvis. This condition lasts at least 6 months, and many times is
      associated with negative cognitive, emotional, sexual and behavioral consequences.In addition
      to the high economic cost, CPP is also costly in emotional and psychological suffering. This
      clinical trial aims to evaluate the effects of a program based on graded exposure therapy in
      women with chronic pelvic pain.
