      suppressing ovulation; inhibiting ovarian follicular development; and altering endometrial
      development and implantation. In males, obesity may impair reproductive function by several
      mechanisms including: decreasing libido, causing erectile dysfunction, influencing semen
      composition, or sperm function. Therefore the long term goal of the current project is to
      understand the impact of severe obesity on reproductive function and how this is influenced
      by dramatic weight loss.
