      To compare the prevalence of SAHS in patients with ischemic heart disease or dilated
      myocardiopathy and moderate-severe left ventricle dysfunction with ICD with that of the
      general population. To study the incidence of supraventricular arrhythmias (atrial
      fibrillation, atrial flutter or supraventricular tachycardia) and inappropriate defibrillator
      therapies in these patients. To value the effect of the treatment with CPAP on the above
      mentioned arrhythmias. To relate the effect of ventricular and supraventricular arrhythmias
      with sleep parameters, cardiovascular biomarkers, inflammation and oxidative stress. To
      evaluate the long-term effect of the CPAP on systemic biomarkers in patients with ischemic
      heart disease or dilated myocardiopathy and moderate-severe left ventricle dysfunction. To
      evaluate the long-term effect of CPAP on the quality of life in these patients.

      Sample size:

      224 patients with ischemic heart disease or dilated myocardiopathy and moderate-severe left
      ventricle dysfunction with ICD will be included to randomize 19 SAHS subjects for arm.
