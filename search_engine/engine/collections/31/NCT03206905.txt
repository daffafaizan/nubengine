    
      This is a single center, prospective randomized case control study with an additional non
      randomized case arm. This study includes two research interventional groups. Groups A: ESG
      with diet and exercise modules. Group B: Diet and exercise modules only. Investigators
      propose to compare ESG to behavioral modification including diet and exercise for patients
      who have a BMI greater than or equal to 40 kg/m2 or greater than or equal to 30 kg/m2 with 1
      or more obesity related co-morbidity and who cannot undergo conventional bariatric surgery(or
      decline the surgical option). Investigators will also compare the effects of ESG to diet and
      exercise on comorbidities such as diabetes, sleep apnea and high cholesterol as well as the
      various obesity related hormones.
