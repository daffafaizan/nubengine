      coordination between colon motility and recto-anal activity is abnormal and that autonomic
      nervous system assessment suggests a dysfunction of communication between the spinal cord
      autonomic nerves and the colon-rectum-anus. The therapy consists of a 3 week treatment with a
      total of 8 sessions of low level laser therapy. Effects will be assessed using symptom and
      quality of life questionnaires and physiological assessments of colon and pelvic floor
      function, at 4 weeks and 12 weeks.
