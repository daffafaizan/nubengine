      for diagnostic or prognostic purpose.

      Subsequently all patients will be evaluated by cardiac ce-MR and PET imaging for verification
      of inclusion criteria.

      Patients will be allocated in a single blind manner to one of two therapeutic arms: surgical
      revascularization alone or surgical revascularization associated with autologous bone marrow
      derived stem cells injection in viable territories.

      During the follow up evolution of left ventricular volumes and contractility will be analyzed
      by ce-MR and PET imaging at 1 year. Additionally patients' functional status will be assessed
      by metabolic stress tests and quality of life questionnaire at 6 months, 1 year and 2 years.
