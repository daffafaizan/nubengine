      general population. HCM represents a major cause of SCD in the young, and is the first cause
      of SCD in athletes less than 35 years of age. The only efficient prevention of SCD, apart
      from exercise restriction, is ICD.

      Given this dreadful potential outcome of HCM, the identification of patients that should
      receive an ICD is of paramount importance. However, the indications for ICD are controversial
      and very different guidelines are currently available, coming from the American society of
      Cardiology, the French Haute Autorité de Santé and from the European society of Cardiology.
      In addition, these guidelines are all based on retrospective studies and have major
      limitations. The situation faces a critical need of improvement. Thus, this study has been
      designed with the objective to propose a revision of international recommendations for
      defibrillator implantation in HCM patients.

      This prospective multicenter non-interventional single-arm study is planned to be conducted
      in 40 sites with a collection of clinical and biological data, carried out as required for
      the usual management and care of patients. No investigation will be performed specifically
      for this study except for an additional blood sample collection at baseline during routine
      outpatient care and annual interview during follow-up.
