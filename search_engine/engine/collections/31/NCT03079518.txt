      iron application has significantly improved clinically meaningful endpoints in such patients.
      The best evidence is existent for ferric carboxymaltose. Intravenous HD iron may influence
      phosphate metabolism via increases in levels of intact FGF23 and hence induce prolonged
      hypophosphatemia. Such increases in FGF23 may particularly occur depending on the type of
      iron carrier.

      FGF23 is a significant risk factor for mortality and morbidity in patients with HFREF and
      other cardiac populations at risk and may directly cause left ventricular hypertrophy and
      dysfunction. Hence, the application of i.v. HD iron may have potentially beneficial effects
      on cardiac function but harmful effects via FGF23-induction and hypophosphatemia at the same
      time. However, FGF23 metabolism has not yet been evaluated in HFREF patients following i.v.
      HD iron.

      FGF23 is elevated in patients with chronic kidney disease. Patients with HFREF + CKD =
      chronic cardio-renal syndrome are at particular risk regarding elevated morbidity and
      mortality. The effects of intravenous HD iron upon phosphate and FGF23 metabolism in patients
      with HFREF + CKD is unknown and effects in this setting may be different compared to effects
      in patients without pre-existing FGF23 stimulation.
