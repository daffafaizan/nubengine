    
      This is an extension study of protocol CT-EV-21, to evaluate the long-term immunogenicity of
      EV71vaccine.

      The first study visit will be approximately 3 or 4 years after the administration of first
      vaccination of EV71 vaccine or placebo in CT-EV-21 study; 4 years after the first vaccination
      for subjects 2 to < 6 years of age (2b), and 3 years after first dose for subjects 2 months
      to < 2 years of age (2c and 2d).

      Subjects of 2b will remain in the study for approximately 12 months and will have 2 clinic
      visits; subjects of 2c and 2d will remain in the study for approximately 24 months and will
      have 3 clinic visits. Immunogenicity response against EV71 virus antigen at each visit will
      be assessed.
