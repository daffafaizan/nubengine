        -  Determine whether nutritional supplementation with soy protein isolate, vitamin E, and
           selenium can delay the time to development of invasive prostate cancer (disease-free
           survival) in patients with high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia.

        -  Determine the effect of this supplementation on intermediate endpoints that may reflect
           a lessened risk of invasive prostate cancer (e.g., serum PSA levels, hormone levels,
           lycopene, malondialdehyde, vitamin E, and reduced thiol groups) in these patients.

        -  Determine the safety of this supplementation in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, multicenter study. Patients are stratified
      according to participating center. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral vitamin E, oral selenium, and oral soy protein isolate
           twice daily.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo twice daily. In both arms, treatment continues for
           3 years in the absence of invasive prostate cancer (demonstrated on biopsy) or
           unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 306 patients (153 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 6 years.
