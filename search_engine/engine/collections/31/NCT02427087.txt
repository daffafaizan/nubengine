      affecting approximately 20-30% of the adult population and is more common in obese
      individuals (70-80%). The main risk factors associated with the disease are the components of
      the Metabolic syndrome. To date, there is no specific pharmacological treatment for NAFLD and
      changes in lifestyle with weight reduction and exercise are always recommended. Few data
      exist on the impact of physical activity and optimal nutritional strategy for the treatment
      of NAFLD. Seen the need to elucidate the impact of physical activity and the search for an
      ideal nutritional strategy in the treatment of NAFLD, the investigators proposed a randomized
      controlled trial evaluating the effects of a hypocaloric high-protein diet and aerobic
      exercise associated with this diet on metabolic and anthropometric parameters in sedentary
      postmenopausal women. 40 sedentary postmenopausal women with NAFLD who had liver biopsy for a
      period equal to or less than 2 (two) years were included. These patients were randomized into
      2 groups: TRAINING group (19): aerobic training with hypocaloric high-protein diet and DIET
      group (21): only hypocaloric high-protein diet, and followed for a period of six months.
