      patients, and many of them also havea great desire to rejoin the workforce. Unfortunately,
      first episode patients become non-compliant or intermittently compliant with prescribed
      antipsychotic treatment at least as frequently as multi-episode patients. We believe that
      assured treatment with Risperal CONTSTA will provide first episode patients wiwth their best
      opporutnity for continued improvement in cognitive function beyond 3 months of treatment and
      that improvements in cognitive function will be associated with a greater likelihood of
      employment, real-world outcomes, such as independent living, as well as measures of brain
      function.
