      recently, troponin I was found to be elevated in patients with acute critical limb ischaemia.
      In another study, troponin I was associated with a higher mortality in patients with chronic
      critical limb ischaemia followed over two years. In a longitudinal study design we intend to
      follow all patients that were treated for symptomatic PAOD (Fontaine stages II-IV) from
      01/2007 to 12/2007 in our department of angiology. Main outcome parameters are death and the
      occurrence of major vascular events and revascularization procedures during follow-up.
