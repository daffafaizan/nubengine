      identification of patients with RA who are unlikely to show an initial response to infliximab
      and methotrexate combination therapy.

      The RA-INF-Dx test is indicated for use in patients:

        -  18 years of age or older,

        -  Eligible for a first line biologic therapy with infliximab. The RA-INF-Dx test is
           indicated for use by rheumatologists as a biological basis for guiding infliximab
           treatment prior to its initiation.
