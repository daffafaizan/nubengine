    
      This study is designed to test the applicability and suitability of e-health services (e.g.
      by use of SKYPE) to the psychosocial needs of patients and their families who are getting
      services through home hospice care. In addition, the attitudes of the hospice staff will be
      investigated to the use of e-health methods. The study will clarify selection criteria,
      referral pathways and barriers and/or supporting elements that will allow e-health services
      to be provided in a highly professional fashion. Up to 20 dyads of a patient and their
      primary caregiver will be recruited from those who are receiving services from the home
      hospice unit of the Kupat Holim Clalit (General Sick Fund) in the South of Israel.
