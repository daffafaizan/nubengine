    
      This is a multicentric therapeutic trial, randomized and double blind: standard enteral
      nutrition plus L-citrulline (5 grams/12 Hours for 5 days from the admission in Intensive Care
      Unit (ICU)) versus standard enteral nutrition plus placebo.

      Methods-Patients: Non-surgical patients admitted in medical intensive care unit, under
      mechanical ventilation for an expected duration > 2 days, without severe sepsis or septic
      shock, will be enrolled. Symptoms leading for ICU admission ongoing for five days maximum. On
      admission (before treatment), the severity will be evaluated with the Sepsis-related Organ
      Failure Assessment (SOFA) score together with an assessment of plasmatic arginine, cytokines
      (InterLeukin-6 (IL6) ), and expression of Human Leukocyte Antigen - antigen D Related
      (HLA-DR) by monocytes. The same evaluation will be repeated on day 3 (during treatment) and
      on day 7 (after treatment).

      The enrolment of 100 patients is statistically enough to demonstrate a decreased SOFA scores
      in the L-citrulline group as compared to the placebo group on day 7.
