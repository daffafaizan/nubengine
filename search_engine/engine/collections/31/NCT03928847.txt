      patients with interstitial lung disease, but not intended to affect lung function or disease
      modifications. Doses of oral Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) that achieve plasma levels
      known to be safe in human volunteers and likely to target fibroblast TGFbeta RI kinase will
      be established. Disposable fragments of biopsies will be evaluated in biochemical assays
      including pSmad3 and Snail 1 or assayed to determine lysyl oxidase-like 2 (LOXL2) protein and
      LOXL2 enzyme activity. Urine collected before and after EGCG exposure will be used to
      determine whether terminal collagen cross-link breakdown products, termed
      pyridinoline/deoxypyridinoline (PYD/DPD) are changed from baseline. Blood collected before
      and after EGCG exposure will be assayed for serum biomarkers.
