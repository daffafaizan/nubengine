      trials of non-demented elderly. Although greater social engagement was found to reduce
      dementia risk in observational studies, randomized trials of social interventions have not
      been reported. A representative sample of 120 elderly from Shanghai, China was randomized to
      four groups (Tai Chi, Walking, Social Interaction, No Intervention) for 40 weeks. Two MRI's
      were obtained, one before the intervention period, the other after. A neuropsychological
      battery was administered at baseline, 20 weeks and 40 weeks. Comparison of changes in brain
      volumes in intervention groups with the No Intervention group were assessed by t-tests.
      Time-intervention group interactions for neuropsychological measures were evaluated with
      repeated-measures mixed models.
