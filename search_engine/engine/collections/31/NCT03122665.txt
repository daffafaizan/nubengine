      defenses including vasoconstriction and shivering. Nefopam, a non-opioid, nonsteroidal
      centrally acting analgesic, has an opioid-sparing effect and anti-shivering potency without
      sedation, making it an ideal candidate to counteract thermoregulatory shivering.

      Since complete compartmental pharmacokinetics (PK) are lacking this prospective, randomized,
      double-blind study in 8 volunteers was set to investigate the PK of arterial nefopam samples
      with non-linear mixed effect modelling. A two compartment mammillary model independent of
      covariates was found to describe the data best and could be implemented to drive automated
      pumps, achieving and maintaining a desired plasma concentration.
