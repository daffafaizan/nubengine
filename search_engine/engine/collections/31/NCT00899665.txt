        -  Examine the roles of proteases and protease-associated molecules in bone metastases in
           patients with metastatic prostate cancer.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo bone marrow aspiration and core bone biopsies. Tissues are analyzed
      by immunohistochemistry methods, in situ hybridization assays, gelatin zymography and/or
      Western blot analysis, and gene profiling analysis in order to visualize and quantitate
      protease or protease-related levels.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study.
