      from plaster dental casts through measurements which might be influenced by subjective
      interpretation and bias when constructed.

      *So another method of diagnostically measuring study models was introduced (Digital
      software). This system creates digital images of dental casts with software. From the
      digitized models, various analyses and routine measurements could be done that might
      accelerate and solve many problems and difficulties associated with storage, retrieval,
      reproduction, communication, and breakage of conventional plaster casts.

        -  Perform a measurements using Tanaka and Johnston equation for an arch analysis using a
           caliper and 3Shape ortho-analyzer software.

        -  Casts will be scanned using the 3D scanner then by using the 3shape software
           measurements will be held according to Tanaka and Johnstopn prediction equation.
