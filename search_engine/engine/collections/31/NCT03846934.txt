      Department (ED) and one of the major clinical problems prompting admission in intensive care
      unit. In the ED, evaluation of an ARF is mainly based on clinical examination and frontal
      chest x-ray performed to the patient bedside. This practice has a limited diagnostic capacity
      due to a lack of specificity of clinical and radiological semiology, especially in the
      polypathological patient. Thoracic ultrasonography provides morphological information
      regrouped as a syndrome (interstitial syndrome, alveolar condensation, pneumothorax) and
      allows the identification of pleural effusions (PE). The PE diagnosis is easy, quick, and
      relies on two-dimensional ultrasound imaging. Compared to CT scan, which remains the
      reference examination although ill-suited in the context of emergency, thoracic
      ultrasonography has a sensitivity and specificity greater than 90% for PL diagnosis. In
      addition, thoracic ultrasonography is used to assess the volume of PL, determine its nature
      and guide the pleural puncture with higher performance than chest x-ray. The
      semi-quantitative evaluation of PEs has been validated in patients with mechanical
      ventilation hospitalized in intensive care unit. On the other hand, few data on the
      prevalence and quantification of PL for hospitalized patients in ED for an ARF are currently
      available.

      Thus, the objective of this study is to evaluate the prevalence and severity of the PL
      identified by thoracic ultrasonography in patients admitted to the ED for an ARF by emergency
      physicians with ultrasound skills recommended by the French Society of Emergency Medicine.
