      siblings. There is widespread agreement that it is critical to investigate the medical and
      psychosocial aspects of sibling pediatric HSC donation for multiple reasons including (a) the
      vulnerability of the pediatric population undergoing donation, (b) increasing use of
      pediatric HSC donation as a therapeutic option,1,7,8,9 (c) evidence that ~20% of pediatric
      HSC donors experience clinically important HRQoL deficits,7 and (d) the impact that improved
      understanding of factors predicting poor HRQoL will have on our ability to develop guidelines
      and/or interventions for assisting at-risk donors/families. The proposed study will help to
      compare donors to their non-donor counterparts and healthy controls as well as to generate
      trajectory classes based on longitudinal patterns of donor HRQoL and identify predictors of
      poor donor HRQoL.
