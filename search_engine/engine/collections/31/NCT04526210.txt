    
      The study is being conducted as a randomized, 2-period, 2-sequence, cross-over study to
      determine the effect of a single dose of ALXN1840 (perpetrator) on the single-dose bupropion
      (victim) kinetics in healthy male and female participants.

      The study has a Screening Period (Day -28 to Day -2), two 11-day study periods (Day 1 to Day
      11) with a minimum of 14 days between doses of bupropion, and an End of Study Visit (Day 15 Â±
      2 days) after Period 2 dosing. Participants will report to the clinical research unit on the
      day prior (Day -1) to both dosing periods. All participants will receive 1 treatment in each
      study period; treatment order will be defined based on randomization: Treatments A and B.

      The time between dosing bupropion alone or in combination with ALXN1840 in each treatment
      sequence will be a minimum of 14 days.

      The PK profile of ALXN1840 and bupropion will be determined by blood sampling following
      single dose administration.
