      terms of morbidity and in terms of quality of the graft.

      The secondary aim is to evaluate the outcome of gingival recessions treated with grafts
      obtained from different harvesting approaches, in terms of mean root coverage, complete root
      coverage, keratinized tissue gain, clinical attachment level gain and gingival thickness
