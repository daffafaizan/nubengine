      infections, and to prevent resistance development. However, it is unclear if this is achieved
      in severely ill patients with severe infections. Underdosing of antibiotics leads to lack of
      effect against bacteria and selection of multi-resistant strains. Overdosing of antibiotics
      increases the risk of toxicity and poses a threat to the environment. Currently there is no
      method for rapid or bedside determination of antibiotic concentration in routine health care.

      Pharmacolog AB, an Uppsala Med-tech company, has developed a technology and a product
      DrugLogÂ® based on absorption spectroscopy in ultraviolet - visible (UV-VIS) frequencies that
      can measure the concentration of antibiotics.

      The goal of this project is to investigate if antibiotic concentrations in patients could be
      monitored by the UV-VIS spectroscopy.

      In a prospective observational study, blood samples from 100 patients with severe infections
      treated with cefotaxime, piperacillin/tazobactam or meropenem will be measured by UV-VIS
      spectroscopy as well as with the golden standard, High-performance liquid chromatography-mass
      spectrometry (HPLC-MS) at Klinisk farmakologi, Huddinge hospital, Stockholm.

      After informed consent, samples will be taken prior to antibiotic treatment and three times
      thereafter. Demographic and clinical data will be registered.
