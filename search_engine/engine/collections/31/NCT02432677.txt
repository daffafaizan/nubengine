      treatment of moderate to severe pain. Several technologies of brain stimulation , including
      transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS) are emerging as therapeutic options for many
      pain conditions. The effect of tDCS was demonstrated in sensory perception , decreasing the
      threshold for acute pain in healthy volunteers and in various chronic pain conditions . There
      is evidence about the use of tDCS with the participation through many mechanisms in cortical
      modulation , including the regulation of neurotransmitters, including opioids. In the context
      of neurostimulation, opioidergic system and cortical pain modulation, emerge the hypothesis
      of a possible potentiating effect of tDCS on clinical application of opioid analgesia.
