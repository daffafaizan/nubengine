    
      Masitinib is a selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor that is thought to exert a neuroprotective
      effect through its activity on mast cells and other non-neuronal cells of the central nervous
      system, with subsequent modulation of inflammatory and neurodegenerative processes. The
      objective of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of masitinib at 4.5 mg/kg/day
      versus matched placebo, or masitinib at 4.5 mg/kg/day with a dose escalation to 6 mg/kg/day
      after 3 months of treatment versus matched placebo, in the treatment of patients with primary
      progressive multiple sclerosis or relapse-free secondary progressive multiple sclerosis.
      Approximately 600 patients will be randomized into four treatment groups with a 2:2:1:1
      design. The primary outcome measure is the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) after 96
      weeks of treatment in the overall study population with subgroup analysis performed in
      stratum (primary progressive multiple sclerosis / secondary progressive multiple sclerosis).
