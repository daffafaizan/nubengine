      maintenance patients. Varenicline's demonstrated efficacy may not be generalizable to
      methadone maintained smokers because of poor adherence, which is highly prevalent among drug
      users. Adherence to smoking cessation medication is strongly associated with cessation, and
      is one of the few factors shown to increase cessation among methadone maintained smokers, but
      strategies to promote smoking cessation medication adherence have not been evaluated in
      methadone patients. Based on the Information, Motivation, and Behavior model, the
      investigators plan a directly observed therapy (DOT)-based intervention targeting behavioral
      skills necessary for optimal adherence. Because methadone clinic-based DOT interventions have
      been shown to improve medication adherence and clinical outcomes in HIV and TB, the
      investigators plan to determine in a randomized trial whether DOT varenicline provided at a
      methadone clinic is more efficacious than self-administered varenicline for promoting smoking
      cessation and enhancing adherence. The investigators will also evaluate moderating effects of
      drug and alcohol use and psychiatric symptoms on DOT effects. The investigators hypothesize
      subjects in the mDOT arm will have greater 7 day point prevalence abstinence at 12 weeks,
      reduction in cigarettes/day, time to first daily cigarette, â‰¥ 24 hour quit attempts, and 7
      day point prevalence abstinence at 24 weeks compared to subjects receiving self administered
      varenicline. The investigators also hypothesize that adherence in the mDOT arm will be higher
      than in the TAU arm. Lastly the investigators hypothesize that ongoing illicit drug use and
      psychiatric symptoms will moderate the effect of mDOT on adherence.
