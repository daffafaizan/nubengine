        -  Determine the rates of hematologic and immune reconstitution in patients with high risk
           hematologic malignancies who are undergoing high dose chemoradiotherapy followed by
           unrelated umbilical cord blood (UCB) transplantation.

        -  Determine the incidence of graft-versus-host-disease in this setting.

        -  Describe the incidence of recurrent disease in these patients post UCB transplant.

        -  Describe the incidence of serious infections and secondary lymphoproliferative diseases
           following transplantation with UCB in these patients.

        -  Determine specifically whether larger recipients can be durably engrafted with unrelated
           UCB, and determine whether nucleated cell or progenitor cell content of the graft is
           predictive of hematological engraftment.

      OUTLINE: Patients may undergo a back-up peripheral blood stem cell collection prior to
      treatment.

      Patients receive 9 fractions of total body irradiation (TBI) on days -9 to -5 followed by
      melphalan IV for three days on days -4 to -2 and antithymocyte globulin IV or
      methylprednisolone IV for three days on days -3 to -1. On day 0, patients receive umbilical
      cord blood infusion. If TBI is not tolerated, busulfan is substituted and administered orally
      every 6 hours for 4 days on days -8 to -5. Cyclosporine and methylprednisolone begin on day
      -2 and continue for 6 months.

      Patients are followed at least monthly for 1 year, then every 6 months for the second year,
      and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: There will be a maximum of 48 patients accrued into this study over 4
      years.
