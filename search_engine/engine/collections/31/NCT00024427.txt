        -  Compare the survival of patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic
           pancreatic cancer treated with triacetyluridine and high-dose fluorouracil vs
           gemcitabine.

        -  Compare the time to tumor progression, overall response rate, and response duration in
           patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the safety of these regimens in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified
      according to disease stage (II or III vs IV). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment
      arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive high-dose fluorouracil (5-FU) IV over 30 minutes once weekly on
           weeks 1-3 followed by 1 week of rest. After each dose of 5-FU, patients receive oral
           triacetyluridine every 8 hours for a total of 8 doses. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in
           the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes once weekly on weeks 1-7
           followed by 1 week of rest (course 1). Subsequent courses are given on weeks 1-3.
           Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
           toxicity.

      Patients are followed for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 260 patients (130 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 30 months.
