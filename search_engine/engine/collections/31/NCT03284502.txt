    
      This is a Phase Ib, open-label, multicenter dose-escalation study designed to assess the
      safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of oral dosing of HM95573 in combination with
      either cobimetinib or cetuximab in patients with histologically/cytologically confirmed,
      locally advanced, or metastatic solid tumors with RAS- or RAF-mutation for which standard
      therapies either do not exist or have proven ineffective or intolerable. Treatment will
      continue until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, any other discontinuation
      criterion is met.

      There are two stages of this study: Stage 1 and 1b, standard 3+3 dose escalation, and Stage
      2, an indication-specific dose expansion. Stage 1 is designed to establish the combination
      MTD for cobimetinib and HM95573. Stage 1 consists of concurrent administration of cobimetinib
      and HM95573. Stage 1b, is designed to select the combination dose of cetuximab and HM95573
      for expansion stage.

      In Stage 2 expansion cohort I and II, the RD of cobimetinib and HM95573 with different dosing
      schedules or regimens might be investigated (which may beâ‰¤ MTDs established during dose
      escalation) in indication-specific expansion cohorts. Stage 2 expansion cohort III will
      further characterize the safety and tolerability of cetuximab in combination with HM95573.
