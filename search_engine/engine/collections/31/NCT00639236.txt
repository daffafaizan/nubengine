      bronchiectasis, cystic fibrosis and COPD as method of bronchial challenge and sputum
      induction, but studies that evaluated others endpoints are required. Objective: To analyse
      the effects of inhaling hypertonic saline compared with placebo with respect to functional
      exercise capacity, dyspnoea and quality of life. Design and Setting: This was a double-blind
      randomised parallel placebo-controlled trial, conducted at the Clínicas Integradas of the
      Evangelical Faculty of Paraná. Methods: sixty-eight patients (age 67 ± 6.5 years; FEV1 38.9 ±
      16.2 predicted) were randomised to inhale 3% hypertonic saline (n=34) or placebo (n=34),
      combined with a program of exercise, three times a week, for 8-weeks. Results: After the
      8-weeks the treatment period, both groups showed significant changes in functional exercise
      capacity (p<0,001), dyspnoea (p<0,001) and quality of life. When compared both groups, there
      was a significant improvement in placebo group in functional exercise capacity (p<0,001).
      Conclusion: the present study concluded that inhaling HS reduces the functional capacity,
      compared to placebo and being associated with the appearance of coughs and bronchial spasms.
