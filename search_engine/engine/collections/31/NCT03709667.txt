      intervention, CON), consisting of 50-min health education sessions 3x-weekly for 8 wk.
      Participants will undergo positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic
      resonance imaging (fMRI) scans while performing the stop signal task (SST) and the reversal
      learning task (RLT) (cognitive computer tasks) at baseline and after completing the 8-wk
      protocol.
