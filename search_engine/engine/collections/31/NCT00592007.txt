    
      Erlotinib is an oral drug which is able to block endothelial growth factor receptor (EGFR).
      EGFR stimulates cancer cell growth. Fulvestrant (faslodex) block estrogen hormone from
      gaining access to tumor and stimulating the tumor cells to grow. Both of these drugs are
      already approved by FDA but have not been studied in this combination.

      We will study if the combination of these drugs will delay treatment failure. Lung cancer
      tumors in both males and females can be sensitive to estrogen. Only patients whose tumor
      expresses the estrogen will be eligible for the trial. Estrogen sensitivity will be tested on
      previously removed tumor specimens.
