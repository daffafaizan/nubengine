    
      Qualitative observational study of human and social sciences (SHS), multicenter, conducted
      with schoolchildren.

      The qualitative methodology used combines the use of photographs, open questionnaires and
      focus groups, over very large panels, aiming at both diversity and representativeness.

        -  Photo expression: to identify the determinants perceived as having a positive or
           negative influence on one's health;

        -  CQR : Certainty/Question/Rumour on how to take care of one's health (health promotion
           input following on from school policies, i.e. PES: Politique d'Etablissements
           Scolaires);

        -  Photo narration: to identify argumentative frameworks in health and alternatives
           perceived as being positive or negative for one's health,

        -  Focus groups: to improve understanding of the rationalities built by adolescents in
           relation to that which determines their health.

      This choice is justified by the need to explore and understand the actions from the
      participants' point of view.

      The diversity of schools and pupils (5 classes in 4 schools in the AURA region, i.e. 320
      pupils) will make it possible to obtain the data saturation required in qualitative research.

      This makes it possible to consider a mixed analysis strategy, both qualitative and
      quantitative.

      This project aims to better understand the rationalities elaborated by children and the way
      in which their concepts on the determinants of cancer interlink, as well as to describe the
      declared impact these concepts have on the decision-making regarding their health.
