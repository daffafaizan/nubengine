    
      This is a transversal study allowing to compare the microcirculatory reactivity before and
      after a 30-minute intravenous infusion of 40 mg/kg vitamin C.

      Design:

      â€¢ A monocentric, open-label, transversal study

      Sample size :

      30 patients

      Assessement:

      Between 6 hours and 24 hours after admission, the patient will be included after collection
      of the non opposition.

      There will be two evaluation times: T0 before the start of vitamin C's perfusion, and T1: 1
      hour after the end.

      No interim analysis is planned. Analysis will be performed at the end of the study after data
      review and freezing of data base.
