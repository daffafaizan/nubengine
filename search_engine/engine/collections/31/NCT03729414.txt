      patients will be randomized to either mucopexy without Doppler guided artery ligation or
      mucopexy with doppler guided hemorroidal artery ligation.

      Primary aim of the Hamlet trial is to demonstrate that mucopexy without DGHAL for grade III
      haemorrhoids have equivalent recurrence rate at 1 year follow up of DGHAL with mucopexy
