    
      This will be a randomized, evaluator-blind, single-center, controlled, within-subject
      comparison study of the investigational products (abametapir lotion) and its vehicle lotion
      and positive and negative controls under occlusive conditions in healthy volunteers. All
      subjects will have the investigational product (abametapir lotion), the vehicle product, the
      positive control patch, and negative control patch applied to 4 randomly assigned, adjacent
      skin sites on the infrascapular area of their back, for the purpose of determining irritation
      potential.

      The investigational products, vehicle, and controls will be applied to one side of the
      infrascapular area of the back. Evaluation of dermal reactions at the application sites will
      be assessed clinically using a visual scale that rates the degree of erythema, edema, and
      other signs of cutaneous irritation (see Section 3.5.5).

      A total of 21 applications of each product will be made.
