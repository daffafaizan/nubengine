      standard radiation therapy to the prostate and at-risk lymph nodes by intensity-modulated
      radiation therapy (IMRT). The subsequent *boost* radiation therapy to the prostate alone will
      be given using the CyberKnife, rather than using the standard Intensity Modulated Radiation
      Therapy. This study will also see how CyberKnife affects the quality of the participant's
      life.
