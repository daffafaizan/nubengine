      stimulation (NMES) combined with conventional physiotherapy (Experimental Group), compared to
      conventional physiotherapy only (Control Group) in critically ill ICU patients, by means of a
      randomized controlled clinical trial. Primary outcomes evaluated during ICU patient's
      hospitalization are (1) the time spent in the ICU; (2) time of mechanical ventilation; (3)
      time and success of weaning (up to 48 hours), (4) the isometric torque from contractions
      artificially generated by NMES and evaluated by dynamometry; (5) muscle morphology and
      quality by means of ultrasonography. Secondary outcomes include (6) the sit and stand test;
      (7) gait speed test; (8) autonomic control (heart rate variability); (9) peripheral
      polyneuropathy by means of MRC scale; (10) Inflammatory profile - inflammatory (IL-6 and
      TNF-Î±) and anti-inflammatory (IL-10) cytokines; (11) blood muscular biochemical markers
      (IGF1, LDH, CK); (12) predictive mortality index for patients admitted to the ICU (SAPS 3);
      (13) survival rate; and (14) mobility (PERME). After discharge from the ICU or as soon as the
      patients are able to perform force voluntarily, the maximum voluntary torque will also be
      evaluated by means of dynamometry. Also, clinical data, hemodynamic variables, dosage of
      neuromuscular blockers and corticosteroids, blood glucose levels in the morning, daily water
      balance, oxygenation index, arterial blood gases, mechanical ventilator parameters, Glasgow
      scale, sedation scale (RASS), will be recorded daily. The investigators expect that the NMES
      program will be able to reduce muscle structure and function losses compared to control
      group, and will improve muscle quality, will reduce the ventilation time and the total time
      spent at the ICU, as well as improve functionality of these patients. In addition, the
      researchers expect to understand which mechanisms determine such adaptations in the
      musculoskeletal system of these patients.
