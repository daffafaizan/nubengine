      of reproductive aging is the egg (1). Egg dysfunction affects most women beginning by their
      late '30's and for many women age related egg dysfunction represents a major cause of
      infertility. The cause of age related egg dysfunction is poorly understood, but telomere
      dysfunction may play an important role. Our group has demonstrated that genetic or
      pharmacologic shortening of telomeres in the eggs of mice, which normally do not exhibit age
      related egg dysfunction, mimics reproductive aging in women, with cell cycle arrest,
      apoptosis, spindle dysmorphologies and chromosomal abnormalities (1,2). Moreover, a pilot
      study the investigators conducted five years ago suggested that telomere length of spare
      human eggs may predict the outcome of womens' InVitro Fertilization (IVF) cycles (3).
      Subsequently, other investigators have demonstrated that telomere length of circulating
      leukocytes predicts miscarriages (4).
