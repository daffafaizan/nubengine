      and its complex effects on multiple brain physiological functions, may be best deciphered
      using a network properties-metric approach. This approach is critical because it provides
      insight into the function of brain networks (e.g., resilience to disruption, central hubs),
      which is likely to be more closely linked to behavioral outcomes. Furthermore, we will
      conduct an exploratory investigation of the in vivo molecular effects of lithium by measuring
      peripheral gene expression. To bring these together, we will also explore whether connectome
      changes serve as mediator between molecular changes (i.e., gene expression) induced by
      lithium treatment and behavioral changes (e.g., depression, mood stability, suicidality).
