      service will be compared to 400 patients after AGS. The latter group is divided to two 200
      patients groups: 1) with AGS 2) with AGS extended to first control in 3 months (AG- nurse may
      be contacted by phone). Patients are followed up up to 5 years. Controls will be held after 3
      months, 1 year and 5 years after operation including B-Hba1c, 15 D Quality of life assessment
      and patient interview.

      There are several aims of the team and study: to detect, diagnose and optimize treatment
      (including medication) of diabetic/ dysglycemic patients from preoperative assessment 1 week
      before operation to postoperative care. With blood glucose target 42 - 86 mmol/mol results
      better overall survival, lesser complications (i.e. infections, cardiovascular or renal
      complications) and shorter length of hospital stay. Other aim is to find undiagnosed
      diabetics or those at risk of developing diabetes. One aim is to find risk factors, which
      lead to stress hyperglycemia during perioperative period or diabetes in 5 years.
