    
      Rationale: To explore patient preference for vascular access site in percutaneous coronary
      procedures, by assessing the perceived importance of benefits and risks of both transradial
      access and transfemoral access. In addition, direct preference for vascular access and
      preference for shared decision-making were evaluated.

      Objective: To investigate the patient preference of vascular access -transradial versus
      transfemoral- in future percutaneous coronary procedures, by use of the Best-Worst Scaling.

      Study design: Single-center, prospective, observational registry

      Study population: A consecutive series of patients, who between June and August 2014,
      underwent elective coronary procedures at Thoraxcentrum Twente in Enschede.

      Intervention: All subjects will receive a questionnaire containing basic baseline questions
      and a best-worst scaling scenario in which they were asked to indicate the most and least
      desirable characteristics of the vascular access approach.

      Furthermore, their direct preference was asked and to which extent they preferred to
      participate in the decision-making process regarding the choice for vascular access route in
      future percutaneous coronary procedures.

      Main study endpoints:

        -  The primary endpoint is the patient preference on specific treatment characteristics
           with regard to vascular access in coronary procedures.

        -  Secondary endpoints include

             1. direct patient preference for transradial access or transfemoral access

             2. the valuation of participation in decision-making on the choice of vascular access
                together with the interventional cardiologist.
