      cancer. Previous studies suggest that reduced tumor platinum levels may significantly
      contribute to platinum resistance and thus poor outcome following platinum-based chemotherapy
      in lung cancer.

      Tetrathiomolybdate (TM) is a fast-acting copper chelator that has been under significant
      investigation as an anti-cancer strategy due to its anti-angiogenic property. Furthermore,
      more recent preclinical evidence suggests that combining TM with platinum drugs resulted in
      higher intratumoral platinum concentration and greater tumor response. The oncologists at the
      University of Rochester are studying addition of TM to commonly used 1st line platinum-based
      doublet, carboplatin/pemetrexed, in patients with non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer.
