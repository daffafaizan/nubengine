      on four different VAS usage, as it is most often used in clinical practise in Denmark. Which
      in this case implies VAS horizontal, with and without endpoint, and VAS vertical, with and
      without endpoint. Every participant will grade their pain on each of the listed VAS
      representations. Furthermore, as a guideline, the participant will be asked to grade the pain
      on a Numerical Ranking Scale (NRS).

      The ordering of VAS lines will be subject to randomization, for each participant
