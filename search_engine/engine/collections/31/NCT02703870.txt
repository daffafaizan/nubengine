      restoration training (VRT), but when combined with transcranial direct current stimulation
      (tDCS) which alters brain excitability, vision restoration can be potentiated in the chronic
      stage. Because it is possible that such therapy may be more effective during the early
      recovery phase after the stroke and can reach patients during the rehabilitation phase,
      investigators wished to explore the applicability, efficacy and safety of early intervention
      with a combined tDCS/VRT treatment.

      19 post-acute stroke homonymous hemianopia patients were randomly assigned to either 10
      sessions of combined rea-tDCS (2mA, 10 daily sessions of 15-20 min) and VRT, or sham-tDCS and
      VRT. The primary outcome criterion was the pre-post change in perimetric detection
      thresholds. Secondary outcome is neurophysiological changes in EEG measures (VEP,
      Connectivity, Spectral Power, ...)
