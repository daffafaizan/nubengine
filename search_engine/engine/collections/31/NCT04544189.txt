    
      This is a Phase II, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center study
      conducted in Chinese men and postmenopausal women with HR- positive, HER2-negative, PIK3CA
      mutant advanced breast cancer which progressed on or after AI treatment. The study also
      includes a single arm, open-label cohort (the PK cohort) to conduct pharmacokinetic analysis.

      For the randomized cohort, in the randomized treatment phase, subjects will be randomized 1:1
      to receive alpelisib or matching placebo plus fulvestrant.

      A total of approximately 120 subjects will be enrolled; randomization will be stratified by:

        1. Lung and/or liver metastases (yes versus no)

        2. Previous treatment with any CDK4/6 inhibitor (yes versus no) The total number of
           subjects pre-treated with any CDK4/6 inhibitor will be limited to 30% of the total
           number of subjects.

      Approximately 15 subjects meeting the same inclusion/exclusion criteria as the randomized
      cohort will be enrolled into the PK cohort. Subjects in the PK cohort will receive alpelisib
      plus fulvestrant.

      Subjects will continue to receive study treatment until disease progression as determined by
      investigator, unacceptable toxicity, or until discontinuation of study treatment due to any
      other reason.
