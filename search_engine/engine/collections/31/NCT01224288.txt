    
      To perform a DCE-CT scan, a small amount of a special dye (called "CT contrast medium") is
      injected by vein into the body. Several CT images are then taken over a few minutes to learn
      how much dye spreads outside of the tumor. This can show how much blood flows to and from the
      tumor. By performing DCE-CT scans after several weeks on treatment, researchers may learn if
      changes in blood flow may be a sign that the treatment is working.

      Study Procedures:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will have a DCE-CT scan to
      check the status of the disease at the following times:

        -  Within about 4 weeks before you begin treatment on study 2010-0085.

        -  Eight (8) weeks after starting treatment on study 2010-0085.

      Before each of the DCE-CT scans are performed, blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn to
      check your kidney function.

      If your doctor thinks it is needed, you will also have a standard-of-care CT scan at these
      timepoints to check the status of the disease.

      Length of Study:

      Your participation in this study will be over after the scan(s) 8 weeks after starting
      treatment on study 2010-0085. You will be taken off of this study if you leave the 2010-0085
      study early.

      This is an investigational study. The DCE-CT scan is commercially available. Using DCE-CT
      scans to check the status of kidney cancer is investigational.

      Up to 120 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.
