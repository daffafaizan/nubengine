      to therapeutic advancements in the treatment of substance use disorders. Oxytocin has been
      shown to promote trust, social bonding, and calmness; however, its potential effects have not
      been explored in cocaine-dependent individuals. Oxytocin receptors have been localized to
      brain regions that are activated by drug-paired cues and preclinical studies have shown that
      oxytocin attenuates the acute and long-term behavioral effects of psychostimulants. However,
      little is known about the role of oxytocin in mediating the affective response to
      cocaine-paired cues and associated neural activity in cocaine-dependent men and women. This
      project is a direct evolution from our previous SCOR-supported research. Our work has
      progressed from characterizing sex/gender differences in response to social stressors and
      cocaine cues in cocaine-dependent men and women, to our on-going work evaluating whether
      stress potentiates cue-induced craving and the impact of hormones on this response. The
      proposed study will investigate the role of oxytocin in the sex/gender differences in stress
      response and craving in cocaine-dependent individuals and preliminarily explore its
      therapeutic potential.
