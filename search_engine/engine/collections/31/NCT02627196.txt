      randomized trial in subjects with reduced ejection fraction heart failure. Subjects will be
      randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive Barostim Activation Therapy with an implanted BAROSTIM
      NEO System in addition to medical management or to receive medical management alone (no
      device implant). The trial will be conducted at up to 120 investigational centers in the U.S.
      and up to 20 investigational centers outside the U.S. These centers will enroll up to 1200
      subjects to randomize approximately 480 subjects who meet the entry criteria.

      For all subjects, trial visits will occur at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months
      post-implant (post anticipated implant for medical management). Visits will occur quarterly
      from 15 to 24 months and semi-annually thereafter.

      Subjects are followed in an identical manner regardless of trial arm.

      The data will provide evidence of the safety and efficacy of BAROSTIM THERAPY. The
      accumulated morbidity and mortality data collected will provide evidence of morbidity and
      mortality benefit. This trial will involve one or more interim analyses to evaluate when
      sufficient evidence is reached for the final morbidity and mortality analysis.
