      To compare the effectiveness of intervention groups using Kinect-based ULMTS with
      constraint-induced therapy on motor improvement in children with hemiplegic CP. The
      investigators hypothesize that motor improvement in using Kinect-based ULMTS will be
      comparable to constraint-induced therapy.
