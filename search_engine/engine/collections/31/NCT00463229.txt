      disabling chronic condition. Approximately 40,000 to 50,000 people in Canada experience a
      stroke each year and about 80% of these people survive. Many of these people who survive a
      stroke never fully recover and are left with significant impairments and disabilities, and
      12% to 25% will have another stroke within the first year. This results in a significant
      burden to individuals, families, and society as a whole. Of every 100 people who are
      hospitalized for a stroke, 15-40 return home and require home care services for
      rehabilitation. Stroke rehabilitation is one of the key components of stroke care. The goal
      of rehabilitation is to assist stroke survivors to reach his or her optimal level of
      physical, social, and emotional function.

      Information gained from this study will be used to inform home care practice, policy
      decisions and the allocation of home care resources and make a national contribution to
      health care delivery reform.
