    
      This is an open-label, single-cohort study to assess the safety and tolerability of relugolix
      in combination with abiraterone plus prednisone for 12 weeks in men with high-risk mCSPC or
      mCRPC being treated with standard-of-care leuprolide acetate with abiraterone plus prednisone
      and in whom abiraterone has been well tolerated (that is, without evidence of hepatotoxicity
      requiring dose adjustment for abiraterone) for a minimum of 12 weeks.

      The study will consist of a 45-day screening period followed by a 12-week treatment period.
      All participants, either with high-risk mCSPC or mCRPC, are required to have been treated
      with standard-of-care leuprolide acetate with abiraterone plus prednisone for a minimum of 12
      weeks prior to baseline (Day 1). Participants will be transitioned from standard-of-care
      leuprolide acetate 3-month injection to relugolix; with relugolix treatment initiated the day
      the next dose of leuprolide acetate (3-month injection) is scheduled for administration with
      the prior dosing regimen of abiraterone plus prednisone being continued.

      In addition to safety and tolerability, the study will also provide safety data as
      participants transition from injectable leuprolide acetate to treatment with relugolix as the
      androgen-deprivation component of the treatment.
