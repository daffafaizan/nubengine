      controlled clinical trial and randomly assigned to either test (57.0 ± 7.9 yrs, n=23) or
      control (55.4 •± 8.3 yrs, n=22) group. Patients in control group were instructed to have only
      one cup (150 ml) of black tea/day, as a 2.5 g tea bag that had to be prepared in a standard
      way for one week (washout period). Patients in the test group were instructed to have 300,
      450, and 600 ml (2, 3, and 4 cups, respectively) in weeks 2, 3 and 4 respectively. We
      assessed the change in serum glutathion, superoxidismutase, total antioxidant capacity, FBS,
      CRP, HbA1C, lipid profiles and fibrinogen during the end of each week.
