    
      This protocol collectively addresses the following goals: 1) What are the changes in gene
      expression in osteoblasts and osteocytes that lead to impaired bone formation with aging; 2)
      Since recent work from the investigators' group has demonstrated that osteoclasts produce a
      number of growth factors and cytokines (coupling factors) that enhance osteoblast
      proliferation and/or differentiation, is aging associated with reduced osteoclast coupling
      factor production; and 3) If osteoclasts are markedly reduced using the FDA-approved
      medication for osteoporosis, denosumab, how does that effect the quantity of coupling factors
      in the bone microenvironment and the target genes of these coupling factors in osteoblasts?
