      processes involved in potentially suicidal behavior in depressed elderly persons but that
      have been little or not studied to date. These include:

      A. cognitive control and sensitivity to interference (Victoria Stroop test, incompatibility
      test, flexibility test, Go / No-Go);

      B. Strategic recovery of semantic memory (verbal fluency test);

      C. Working memory (TEA);

      D. Insight related to depression (Mood Disorders Insight Scale);

      E. Recognition of facial emotions;

      F. Emotional regulation;

      G. Negative attitudes;

      H. Self-perception and;

      I. Time perspectives.

      Finally, patients will be contacted by telephone at month 6 to assess the occurrence of a
      suicidal act during this period and thus calculate the predictive ability of cognitive and
      psychological factors.
