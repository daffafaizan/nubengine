      ventricular (LV) myocardial hypertrophy and fibrosis. Patients can experience symptoms of
      effort intolerance, progressive heart failure and abnormal heart rhythms. There are currently
      no treatments that alter the natural history of HCM. Patients and the cardiovascular field
      have identified a "critical need" for clinical studies of drug therapies that target HCM
      pathophysiological mechanisms.

      Trientine dihydrochloride is a copper-chelating agent licensed for Wilson disease, a genetic
      disorder of copper excretion, in which patients exhibit a cardiac phenotype that mimics HCM.
      Proof of concept has been established through an MRC-funded study to suggest that use of
      trientine may also be beneficial in HCM.
