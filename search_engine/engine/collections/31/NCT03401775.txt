      elderly or patients with cognitive impairments. The study will enroll 40 healthy subjects
      with a normal cognitive function between 55 and 85 years of age. Forty subjects will be
      randomly assigned into two groups. Subjects in the intervention group will receive four weeks
      of cognitive rehabilitation training, three times per week and 30 minutes per day. The
      control group will not receive any intervention. The investigator will measure their
      cognitive and brain functions three times at pre-intervention, post-intervention and four
      weeks after intervention to assess the effectiveness of the cognitive training program.
