    
      This is a Japanese Phase I/II, open-label, non-controlled study to evaluate the safety,
      tolerability, pharmacokinetic profile, and efficacy of the combination of GSK2118436 and
      GSK1120212 in subjects with BRAF V600E/K mutation positive advanced solid tumors (Phase I
      part) and BRAF V600E/K mutation positive cutaneous melanoma (Phase II part). Phase I part is
      designed to primarily assess the safety and tolerability of GSK2118436 and GSK1120212
      combination therapy in subjects with BRAF V600E/K mutation positive advanced solid tumors.
      Six evaluable subjects will be enrolled into Phase I part and receive the combination therapy
      of GSK2118436 (150 mg, twice daily) and GSK1120212 (2 mg, once daily). A decision for
      starting Phase II part will be made by careful review based on available safety, tolerability
      and pharmacokinetic data in Phase I part. Phase II part is designed to primarily evaluate ORR
      of the combination as first-line therapy in subjects with unresectable (Stage IIIC) or
      metastatic (Stage IV) BRAF V600E/K mutation positive cutaneous melanoma. Subjects who have
      had prior systemic anti-cancer treatment in the advanced or metastatic setting will not be
      eligible for Phase II part although prior systemic treatment in the adjuvant setting will be
      allowed. Six evaluable subjects will be enrolled in Phase II part.
