      although they are not demented. This condition is known as mild cognitive impairment (MCI).
      Healthy older people can learn mnemonic strategies to improve their memory abilities. Can
      cognitive rehabilitation help people with MCI do better on mental tasks or maintain better
      functioning in everyday life? This study will evaluate the effects of two different
      rehabilitation programmes. Patients in the memory training group will learn mental strategies
      aimed at improving memory. Patients in the memory compensation group will learn to use
      external memory aids.
