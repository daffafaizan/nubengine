    
      This is a Phase II, open- label, randomized, noncomparative study. Patients will be
      stratified at randomization by ECOG PS. There is no intent to have equal numbers of patients
      for each PS (ie, 0, 1, and 2), but rather stratification will be conducted to ensure that the
      2 treatment arms are well-balanced for ECOG PS.

      Patients will be randomly assigned to either Arm 1 - Taxotere 60 mg/m2 as an intravenous (IV)
      infusion over 1 hour, followed by Eloxatin 130 mg/m2 IV over 2 hours or Arm 2 - Taxotere 60
      mg/m2 as an IV infusion over 1 ho ur, followed by Eloxatin 130mg/m2 IV over 2 hours, followed
      by ERBITUX 400 mg/m2 IV over 120 minutes (first dose only), all other doses are 250 mg/m2
      over 60 minutes. Taxotere and Eloxatin will be given on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle; ERBITUX
      is given on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each cycle.

      Treatment will continue until disease progression or intolerable toxicity. Patients who
      achieve a CR will receive an additional 2 cycles of treatment. Patients will be limited to 24
      months of participation, counted from the date of the first dose of study drug.
