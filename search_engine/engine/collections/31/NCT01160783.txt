      Boston is not required. Participants are asked some questions about their medical and family
      history. The investigators also request permission to review medical records related to the
      ASD diagnosis. Finally, the investigators obtain a small blood or saliva sample in order to
      search for genes that may be important in understanding ASD. The investigators can arrange
      for the blood draw through a participant's physician or a clinical laboratory and saliva
      samples can be obtained through the mail. The study questions are answered via telephone or
      mailed questionnaires. There is no cost to participate.
