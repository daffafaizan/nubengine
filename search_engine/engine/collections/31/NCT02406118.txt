      the anus and standard laparoscopy. Transanal visualization will be using endoscopy. At the
      end of the procedure, the rectum will be removed though the anus or ileostomy formation site,
      the bowel will be re-connected to the anus, and a temporary diverting stoma will be created,
      which is standard of care following surgery for this type of cancer.
