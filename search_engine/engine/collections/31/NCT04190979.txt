    
      Pre-market, single-arm, prospective, open-label, multi-center clinical trial aimed at
      assessing the safety and the performance of the Medyria TrackCath system in patients above
      the age of 18 years who have been diagnosed with aneurysms in the thoracoabdominal (TAAA) or
      abdominal (AAA) aorta and require endovascular intervention.

      The TrackCath System is a non-implantable disposable device, intended to measure real-time
      changes in the Blood Flow Velocity and to provide a pathway for delivering third-party
      guidewires and/or catheters.

      Following patient consent, data is collected until discharge.

      To reach 80% power, a total number of 32 patients (minimum 42 target orifices) is scheduled,
      including a minimum of 8 roll-in patients for the training phase, which comprises at least
      two successful cases per center.
