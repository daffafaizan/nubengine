      flutter (AFlut) and atrial fibrillation (Afib). After initiation of Afib this may organize
      under special intrinsic conditions or due to antiarrhythmic medication to AFlut so Afib may
      be supposed the underlying arrhythmia. Therefore after successful ablation of AFlut this
      reentrant circuit is not longer possible and Afib persists. After new occurrence of Afib a
      long diagnostic and therapeutic marathon begins with AF ablation at the end of all
      therapeutic efforts. This double burden for the patient and the health system can probably be
      avoided by directly and effectively treating the underlying arrhythmia AF.
