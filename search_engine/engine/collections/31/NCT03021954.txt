      pelvic floor muscle damage in primipara. Therefore, this double blinded randomized clinical
      trial compares the pelvic floor muscle repair in primipara following labor between the
      interventional group who received intramuscular PRP injection in levator ani muscle and the
      control group, as assessed by ultrasonography, perineometry, and biomarker assessments. The
      ultrasonography outcome measures include lower hiatal area during contraction and during
      valsava. Menawhile, the biomarker assessments include Creatine Kinae, MyoD, and IGF-1. The
      assessments are performed at multiple time points, which are before labor, 24-48 hours post
      labor, 7 days post labor, 40 days post labor and 3 months post labor.
