      Primary

        -  Compare the progression-free survival of patients with low-grade gliomas treated with
           radiotherapy vs temozolomide.

      Secondary

        -  Compare the overall survival of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Determine whether the incidence of late toxicity can be decreased in patients who are
           randomized to receive temozolomide.

        -  Compare the toxic effects of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Compare the quality of life of patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, controlled, multicenter study. Patients are stratified
      according to participating center, chromosome 1p status (deleted vs normal vs
      undeterminable), contrast enhancement on MRI (yes vs no), age (< 40 years vs ≥ 40 years), and
      WHO performance status (0 or 1 vs 2). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo radiotherapy once daily, 5 days a week, for a total of 28
           fractions (i.e., 5½ weeks).

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral temozolomide once daily on days 1-21. Treatment repeats
           every 28 days for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
           toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline and then every 3 months until disease progression.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 6 months for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A minimum of 699 patients (a total of 466 randomized [233 per treatment
      arm]) will be accrued for this study within 5 years.
