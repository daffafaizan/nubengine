      form of stroke. The aim of this single centre, single arm pilot study is to provide an
      assessment of safety and feasibility of early minimally invasive image guided endoscopic
      hematoma evacuation (within 24 hours of symptom onset) in patients suffering from
      intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH).

      Furthermore this study contributes to the understanding of secondary neuronal damage involved
      in ICH through the measurement of biomarkers for neuronal damage and their response to early
      hematoma evacuation.
