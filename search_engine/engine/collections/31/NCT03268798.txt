      (non-paretic, LA) sides. "Cross-education" is training one side of the body increases
      strength or motor skill in the same muscles on the untrained side. This can be applied to
      enhance muscle strength in the MA side and we found that 6 weeks of dorsiflexion resistance
      training with the LA leg improved strength bilaterally in chronic stroke. To explore if
      cross-education occurs also in the upper limb after stroke, participants will complete a
      5-week unilateral wrist extension training.

      Twenty four participants will be recruited, 12 from Rehabilitation Neuroscience laboratory at
      University of Victoria, 12 from Brain Behaviour Laboratory at University of British Columbia.
      Before and after training, maximal voluntary contraction wrist extension force was measured
      with a 6-axis load cell using Cartesian coordinates (Fz = extension). Electromyography of
      extensor and flexor carpi radialis, biceps and triceps brachii were recorded. Fugl-Meyer and
      partial Wolf Motor Function Test were performed by the same physical therapist at each
      location. Reciprocal inhibition from wrist flexors to extensors, cutaneous reflexes evoked by
      median and superficial radial nerve stimulation were assessed in those at UVIC. Cortical
      silent period, short-interval intracortical inhibition, intracortical facilitation and
      transcallosal inhibition from transcranial magnetic stimulation were measured in participants
      at UBC.
