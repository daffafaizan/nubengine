      Children exposed to ZIKV in utero during the years of 2015-2017 are now in early childhood.
      Children with severe neurologic injury (Congenital Zika Syndrome; CZS) have a poor
      developmental outcome, however the developmental outcome of apparently normal infants
      following in utero ZIKV-exposure is not well known. The incidence of abnormal
      neurodevelopmental outcome in apparently normal children with in utero ZIKV-exposure is not
      known.

      We will determine if neurodevelopmental assessment scores in children exposed to ZIKV in
      utero who are normal appearing differ from norms. We hypothesize that ZIKV-exposed normal
      appearing children will have lower multi-domain developmental assessment scores compared to
      normative samples. We hypothesize that the presence of mild postnatal non-specific cranial US
      findings is associated with persistent lower developmental assessment scores compared to
      ZIKV-exposed children who had normal cranial US and quantitative imaging will find structural
      and functional brain differences between ZIKV-exposed children and controls..

      We will perform a prospective developmental outcome study at 2 sites: 1) Department of
      Atl√°ntico, Colombia through collaboration with BIOMELAB, the research center of Dr. Carlos
      Cure, and 2) Children's National, Washington, DC.

      The objective of the study is to determine whether children who were exposed to ZIKV in utero
      and who do not have CZS have abnormalities in neurodevelopment during early childhood.

      The primary outcome will be neurodevelopmental assessment scores at age 3 and 4 years. Scores
      will be compared between Zika-exposed children and controls.
