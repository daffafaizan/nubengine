      lines of evidence suggests alterations in right ventricular (RV) function may be precipitated
      by RV ischemia. This ischemia results from both decreased right coronary artery perfusion
      pressure and from arteriolar- capillary rarefaction. It has been proposed that this
      contributes to insufficient oxygen delivery needed to support the increase RV demand in right
      heart failure (RHF), this stimulating glycolytic shift. However, this glycolysis is
      insufficient to compensate for suppression of glucose oxidation in severe right ventricular
      hypertrophy (RVH), resulting in a state of RV hibernation and progressive RHF.

      This study is designed to assess if 24 weeks of treatment with riociguat will be associated
      with changes in glucose metabolism and improved RV blood flow using N-13-ammonia (NH3) to
      measure myocardial perfusion.

      We will assess the response in both treatment naive patients as well as patients who have
      been titrated to maximally tolerated doses of riociguat with total treatment duration of at
      least 3 months.

      The assessment of quantitative myocardial blood flow will be combined with an advanced 3
      dimensional echocardiographic assessment of RV volume and function and with cardiac magnetic
      resonance (MR).
