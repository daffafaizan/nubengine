      for 12 weeks. Before and after treatment with metformin, the following will be assessed:

        -  Weight, blood pressure, waist circumference

        -  Lipids (cholesterol)

        -  Hormone levels (including testosterone and other androgens)

        -  IV glucose tolerance test (to assess for early evidence of insulin resistance)

        -  Effect of metformin on muscle mitochondria (this will involve one MRI scan and one
           muscle biopsy each before and after treatment with metformin)

      Ovulation will be closely monitored at least twice a month with pelvic ultrasounds and blood
      tests for estrogen and progesterone levels.
