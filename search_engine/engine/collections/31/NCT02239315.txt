      treatment is by measuring the size of the breast tumor after each cycle of chemotherapy. The
      drawback to this method is, it will take several weeks before we can actually measure a
      significant change in size; and the initial response to chemotherapy is often evident as a
      softening of the tumor without an apparent decrease of the tumor size. Finding a reliable way
      to identify early response to chemotherapy would be helpful to enable matching of
      chemotherapy to an individual's need.

      In a previous trial of breast cancer treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, researchers have
      identified that the pCR to a full treatment of chemotherapy could be predicted by the change
      in RNA pattern obtained from a biopsy of the tumor half way through the chemotherapy course.
      [Parissenti et al. 2010] The purpose of this study is to determine if we can predict the pCR
      to neoadjuvant chemotherapy by examining the pattern of RNA disruption (RNA Disruption Assay
      or RDA score) from breast biopsy tissue obtained 7 to 14 days after the first, second and
      third cycle of chemotherapy. If we can determine the optimal time during neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy to measure the RDA score for the prediction of pCR, we can optimize breast
      cancer management. For example, if RDA score can identify non-responders earlier, we can
      switch to other chemotherapy agents and reduce the exposure to the unnecessary side-effects
      of ineffective treatment.
