      the measurement of water content of biological tissues. It measures the dielectric constant
      values of the skin and subcutaneous tissues non-invasively and locally in a few seconds. The
      dielectric constant value is directly proportional to the amount of water in the tissue.

      As lymphedema produces local water content increase, we are interested if the device is
      suitable for daily use in lymphedema patients. Therefore we designed a protocol to measure
      the results with a moisturemeter in a standardized edema formation by histamin induced
      scratch test edema. This method is well known in type I allergy testing.

      The aim of the study is:

        1. research the inter- and intra observer variability

        2. measure the reproducibility of edema formation in a standardized edema formation
