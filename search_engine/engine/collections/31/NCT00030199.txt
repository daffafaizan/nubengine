      eyelid closure using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Conventionally the primary
      motor cortex (M1) has been thought to control upper facial movement . However, recent
      neuroanatomical and neuroimaging studies suggest that the upper facial muscles are mainly
      controlled by the mesial frontal region, not M1 . Recently, we performed a transcranial
      magnetic stimulation (TMS) study to investigate the cortical center for the upper facial
      muscles, especially those related to blinking, and observed possible cortical responses from
      the surface electrodes attached to the orbicularis oculi (OOC) muscles with the stimulation
      applied to the mesial frontal region. In this study, we are planning to use monopolar needle
      electrodes to confirm that these responses originate from the cortical stimulation.
