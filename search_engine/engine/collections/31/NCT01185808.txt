      with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) have insufficient levels of vitamin D3. This is a proposal to
      conduct a placebo controlled trial on the use of vitamin D3 (5,000IU/day for 6 weeks) to
      determine clinical and immunologic outcomes in these patients.

      General Investigational Plan: We routinely examine vitamin D levels in all patients with
      CRSwNP. Those that are insufficient (less than 32 ng/ml) and have agreed to undergo sinus
      surgery will be randomized to placebo or vitamin D3 supplementation (5,000IU/day) for 6 weeks
      prior to surgery. Blood will be drawn pre- and post-supplementation to examine systemic
      immune parameters such as dendritic cell and T cell expression and cytokine levels. Sinus
      tissue will be collected at the time of surgery to analyze local immune parameters (dendritic
      cell, T cell and cytokine levels) between supplemented and placebo groups. Clinical outcomes
      will be analyzed using quality of life questionnaires, endoscopic grading and nasal peak
      inspiratory flow pre- and post- supplementation. IRB approval for this research project is
      pending.
