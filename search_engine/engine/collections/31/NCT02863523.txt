      trial, a unique collaborative, stepped-care intervention for patients with uncontrolled Type
      2 diabetes and co-morbid distress and/or depression. The investigators approach will combine
      practice-based medical and cognitive behavioral treatment with strong community-based support
      to immediately place the patient at the right level of intervention based on disease and
      severity and to step-up treatment intensity and follow-up if the initial response is
      inadequate. The practice-based component will use a care manager linked to medical,
      pharmacologic, and behavioral colleagues. The community based component will utilize
      community health workers to provide support and facilitate access to resources. Goals
      include: 1) implementing and evaluating the effectiveness of this intervention; 2) examining
      the impact of this approach on psychological mediators of improved glycosylated hemoglobin
      (HbA1c); and 3) building, sustaining, and disseminating a cost-effective care model.
