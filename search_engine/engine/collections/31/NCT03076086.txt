    
      Within the study, sputum samples will be collected at 3 repetitive occasions in a 3 week
      interval of the different donors.

      The objective is to assess for biomarker specificity and reproducibility in the two groups
      (smokers and non-smokers). The methods for measurement shall be validated by repetitive
      measurement of the sputum samples, i.e. comparison of multiple measurements of the same
      sample and comparison of different samples from the same donor.
