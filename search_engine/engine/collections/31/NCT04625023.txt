    
      METAMECH has been designed to streamline the study of the co-evolutionary landscape between
      tumor and host cells in a cohort of breast cancer (BC) patients, with the aim of
      understanding how their outcomes can be significantly improved (e.g. reduction of their
      chance of recurrence and survival improve). This clinical resource for integrative clinical
      data and sample collection will allow to generate hypotheses on mechanisms supporting the
      outgrowth of human metastases, mine for new potentially actionable targets and the selection
      of appropriate patients for experimentally-driven trials. To achieve the required level of
      'experimental precision', patients will enter METAMECH at two different 'therapeutic
      checkpoints': i) prior to a tumor sampling event (surgery, biopsy) or ii) prior to any line
      of treatment.

      To optimize the enrollment of patients, the longitudinal collection of data/samples and their
      logistic management, METAMECH has been designed as a flexible infrastructure organized in
      Tiers for the stepwise comprehension of the biological processes that drive tumor evolution,
      and precisely:

        -  TIER0, Retrieving: the ability to retrospectively retrieve clinically annotated BC
           archival samples to validate/discover new mechanotransduction-linked biomarkers;

        -  TIER1, Recording: the ability to prospectively record BC characteristics under standard
           of care treatments and to define new mechanotransduction-linked biomarkers;

        -  TIER2, Modelling: the ability to develop pertinent experimental models to study the
           aberrant mechanisms underlying the metastatic outgrowth and define
           mechanotransduction-targeting therapeutic strategies;

        -  TIER3, Linking: the ability to access data and samples of patients enrolled in POC
           trials to prove the efficacy and study/understand resistance mechanisms of
           mechanotransduction-targeting therapies.
