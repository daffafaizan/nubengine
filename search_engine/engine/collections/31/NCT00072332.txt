      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose of edotecarin when
           administered with cisplatin (administered in 2 different schedules) in patients with
           advanced or metastatic solid tumors.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the safety profile of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the plasma pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the antitumor activity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation study of edotecarin. Patients
      are assigned to 1 of 2 schedules.

        -  Schedule A: Patients receive cisplatin IV over 30 minutes and edotecarin IV over 1 hour
           on days 1 and 8.

        -  Schedule B: Patients receive cisplatin IV over 2 hours and edotecarin IV over 1 hour on
           day 1.

      In both schedules, courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients in each schedule receive escalating doses of edotecarin until the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at
      which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is
      determined, 10 additional patients with metastatic esophageal or gastric cancer receive
      treatment as above at the MTD.

      Patients are followed every 2 months for 1 year or until disease progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 80 patients (40 per schedule) will be accrued for this study.
