      treatment will be enrolled over an 18 month period. Tissue samples including synovial fluid
      from the injured and contralateral knee, serum and urine will be collected pre-operatively at
      the time of framing and ORIF. If patients only need to have one surgery (ORIF) sample will be
      collected only once. MRI imaging of the injured knee will be obtained after fixation at
      between week 6 and 8 and at 18 months. Tissue samples will be analyzed for established
      biomarkers of joint inflammation and degradation. Patients will be followed for 18 months to
      assess for signs of post-traumatic arthritis. Imaging with plain film and MRI will occur at
      18 months. MRI imaging analysis of cartilage thickness and composition changes will be
      assessed in the injured knees. Assessment of articular cartilage and joint space narrowing
      and KOOS will be correlated to biomarkers that may be indicative and predictive of joint
      degeneration and the development of PTA.
