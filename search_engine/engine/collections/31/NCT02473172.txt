      system. Often in the acute phase of critical illness patients are ventilated in the control
      mode (CMV), where the patient is completely passive. This quickly (within 48 hours) has been
      shown to induce diaphragm atrophy and dysfunction (Levine et al New England Journal of
      Medicine, 200; 358:1327-35). To preserve diaphragm function, guidelines suggest to shift as
      soon as possible to the assisted mode (the ventilator applies positive pressure to assist
      spontaneous inspiratory effort). The synchrony between patient and ventilator is critical in
      this context. PSV is the classical assisted mode and applies a constant pressure whatever the
      patient effort. NAVA is a newer mode based on the diaphragm electrical activity (EAdi)
      measurement. It assist patient effort proportionally to the EAdi and hence to patient's
      effort. The investigator hypothesis is that NAVA would improve diaphragm efficiency more
      efficiently than PSV.
