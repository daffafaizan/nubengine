      derived from umbilical cord blood for intramyocardial delivery into the right ventricle
      during a planned and non-emergent Stage II surgical palliation in subjects with HLHS. This is
      the first critical step towards applying autologous MNC therapy as an add-on regenerative
      intervention for congenital heart disease management. The choice of HLHS as the target
      disease for regenerative therapies in congenital heart disease management is multi-factorial
      and includes the following considerations: 1) Severity of of this incurable disease, 2)
      palliative nature and burden of long-term outcomes with a single right ventricular system, 3)
      three stages of planned surgical procedures that provide time points to adjunctively
      intervene, and 4) prenatal diagnosis enabling planned collection of UCB. An emerging goal for
      cardiac regeneration includes the application of cell-based technology to congenital heart
      disease, which is a favorable substrate due to the lack of fibrotic scaring, and the presence
      of a microenvironment that is expected to support ongoing cardiac proliferation and growth
      for functional remuscularization. This Phase I safety study will determine the feasibility of
      collection, processing, and delivery of autologous cells as used in adult cardiac
      regenerative protocols in the setting of HLHS surgical management.
