    
      This study is a single-arm, single-center, exploratory phase II study to observe the efficacy
      and safety of anlotinib combined with dose-reduced olaparib in patients with
      platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer, fallopian tube cancer and primary peritoneal
      cancer. We will enroll the subjects who are treated with olaparib as maintenance treatment
      followed by dose reduction due to adverse events. The primary end points are progression free
      survival and adverse events. The secondary end points include objective response rate,
      disease control rate, overall survival, time from enrollment to first subsequent treatment,
      quality of life.
