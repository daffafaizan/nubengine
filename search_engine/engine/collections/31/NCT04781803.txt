      administered on days +3 and +4, however, there is no standard prevention or treatment regimen
      for CRS after haplo-TCPH and therapeutic behavior has usually been adopted.

      Sample of 32 patients between the ages of 16 and 60 who receive their first haploidentical
      transplant at our center. In the control group, CsA 6 mg/kg orally divided into two doses per
      day starting in the morning on day +5 of the transplant, mycophenolic acid 1 gram orally (2
      tablets of 500 mg) from day +5 post-transplant and post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PT-CY)
      at 50 mg/kg per day on days +3 and +4 and in the experimental group, CsA 6 mg/kg orally
      divided into two doses per day starting in the morning on day 0 after transplantation,
      mycophenolic acid 1 gram orally (2 tablets 500 mg) from day 0 post-transplant and PT-CY at 50
      mg/kg per day on day +3 and +4.

      Will document the presence of CRS and its degree, as well as the need for hospitalization,
      associated infectious processes, and a day to recover neutrophils and platelets.
      Additionally, 4 blood samples will be taken from the patients to determine the level of
      cytokines and C-reactive protein.
