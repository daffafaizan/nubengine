    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To investigate the prostate tissue concentration of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG),
      epicatechin gallate (ECG) and quercetin and their methylated metabolites in men scheduled for
      prostatectomy and consuming green tea (GT)extract (N=15) or GTextract with quercetin (N=15)
      for 3 weeks prior to prostatectomy.

      II. To determine the concentration of EGCG, ECG, epigallocatechin (EGC), epicatechin (EC) and
      quercetin and the methylated metabolites in plasma collected before (T=0) and two hours (T=2)
      after the intake of the morning dose of GTextract and placebo or GTextract with quercetin
      during the third week of intervention.

      III. To determine the effect of GTextract/quercetin intervention on reducing the enzyme
      activity and protein and gene expression of catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) and
      deoxyribonucleic (DNA) (cytosine-5) methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) as well as protein and gene
      expression of multidrug resistance transport protein 1 (MRP1) in prostate tissue collected in
      specific aim 1 and COMT activity in erythrocytes from blood collected at baseline and week 3.

      IV. To determine the inter-individual variation in genotype of COMT in buffy coat DNA.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive GT extract orally (PO) twice daily (BID) and quercetin PO BID for 3-6
      weeks before undergoing prostatectomy.

      ARM II: Patients receive GT extract PO BID and placebo PO BID for 3-6 weeks before undergoing
      prostatectomy.
