      (DBD) donor kidney and who meet all eligibility criteria will be randomized 1:1 within 48
      hours prior to transplant surgery to receive: two infusions of SANGUINATE at a dose of 320
      mg/kg or placebo on the day of surgery and approximately 24 hours after surgery. Patients
      will be hospitalized for up to 5 days and the study duration will be 30 days. Results will be
      used to inform the study design characteristics for Phase III, including sample size.

      Phase III: The same inclusion/exclusion requirements, dosing schedule, hospitalization stay
      and outpatient visits as in Phase II with additional visits scheduled at Day 90, Day 180 and
