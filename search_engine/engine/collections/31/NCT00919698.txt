    
      This is a single center, observational, cross-over design study assessing the impact of daily
      awakening from sedation on delirium in the ICU. Enrolled patients will receive a daily
      baseline delirium assessment using the CAM-ICU tool before the awakening from sedation and an
      assessment during the awakening from sedation. Each patient will thus serve as their own
      controls for these interventions.
