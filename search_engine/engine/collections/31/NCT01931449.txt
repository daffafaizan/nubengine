      practice. It is widely used in the treatment of pancreatic head carcinoma, periampullary
      carcinoma, chronic pancreatitis with intractable pain, pancreatic head mass which unable to
      rule out pancreatic cancer. PD was improved in many ways in the last 80 years and the
      post-surgical mortality has decreased under 5%. Since the resected region of PD is wide
      including gall bladder, billiary tract, duodenum, pancreas, stomach, jejunum and regional
      lymph nodes. It has a high prevalence of complications, of which pancreatic leakage is the
      most common and serious one with a prevalence rate of 5-25% and mortality rate 20-50%ã€‚ The
      objective of the present study is to evaluate a new surgical procedure used for the digestive
      tract reconstruction following PD. The new procedure enables the pancreatic juice and bile to
      bypass at the pancreatointestinal anastomosis and merge at gastrointestinal anastomosis which
      can decrease the risk of post-surgical pancreatic leakage and keep the digestive function of
      patients. A multicenter, randomized, controlled study is designed to observe the prevalence
      of pancreatic leakage, other post-surgical complications, hospital stay, medical costs, life
      quality and other indexes to evaluate the efficacy and safety of this procedure. It is
      anticipated that through the study, this new procedure can be systematically verified if it
      is an ideal procedure of digestive reconstruction following PD which can be promoted into
      wider use.
