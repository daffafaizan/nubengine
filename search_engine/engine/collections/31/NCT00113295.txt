    
      Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a relatively common condition affecting 5% of the
      population, with a typically chronic course and associated with significant psychosocial
      impairment and decreased quality of life (Schweizer, 1995). Although a number of therapeutic
      agents demonstrate some efficacy in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder, only a
      minority of anxious patients experience remission with initial treatment.

      The purpose of this study is to examine the efficacy of one strategy, the addition of
      quetiapine, for the treatment of patients with GAD who remain refractory despite an adequate
      treatment trial with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). This is an
      investigator-initiated augmentation study of an already approved drug for a different
      indication. Quetiapine is a novel antipsychotic agent with potent effects at the
      serotonergic, as well as dopaminergic receptor, and a more favorable side effect profile than
      standard neuroleptics, including a low potential to cause extrapyramidal symptoms.

      This is a two phase, 18-week research study in which participants who remain symptomatic at
      the end of one phase (10 weeks) enter into the next phase. In phase I, all participants
      receive paroxetine CR (Paxil CR) for 10 weeks. Participants who continue to have anxiety
      symptoms will enter the 8-week Phase II, in which they continue taking Paxil CR and they will
      also be randomly assigned (by chance, like a flip of a coin) to receive quetiapine (Seroquel)
      or placebo (contains no active medication).
