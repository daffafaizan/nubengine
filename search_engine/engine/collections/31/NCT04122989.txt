    
      MS-SUPPORT is a novel shared-decision making tool. More specifically, it is a web-based
      decision aid (DA) that includes 'values clarification exercises' to support people with MS
      (PwMS) incorporate their preferences and values when faced with a DMT treatment decision.
      Each 'values clarification exercise' includes a written passage about a specific topic, with
      a series of questions. It covers topical domains related to living with MS and treatment
      decision making, including but not limited to lifestyle, tolerability, safety, risk
      tolerance, health goals, and personal values.

      This validation study will evaluate the effect of using MS-SUPPORT on starting or switching
      DMTs, patient-provider communication, DMT adherence, Quality of Life (QoL), decision quality
      (the concordance of the treatment chosen, which includes no treatment, with the patient's
      values), quality of care, and decisional conflict. Participants will include adult patients
      with relapsing forms of MS and their MS healthcare providers (HCP). Patients will be
      randomized into one of two groups: MS-SUPPORT (intervention) or Usual Care (control).
