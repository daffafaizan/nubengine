      with diversion of surplus medication playing a key contributing role. As the majority of
      reproductive age women in the U.S. will experience childbirth, understanding opioid
      prescription patterns and patient opioid utilization in the postpartum period is critical.

      Postpartum women will be recruited during a 9-month period to take part in pre-hospital
      discharge and 2-4 week postpartum surveys to prospectively assess opioid medication use with
      regard to quantity of opioid tablets prescribed and quantity used, storage and disposal of
      unused opioids and satisfaction with pain control.
