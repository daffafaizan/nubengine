      surgeon to preoperatively evaluate these alignment parameters and simulate a patient-specific
      plan using a combination of procedures, techniques, and implants. Once in the operating room,
      realignment objectives can be verified from a lateral fluoroscopic image in real-time using
      NuvaMap O.R. (NuVasive, Inc.), a software application integrated with the NVM5®
      neuromonitoring platform (NuVasive, Inc.). This real-time verification allows for
      confirmation and subsequent changing of the plan as necessary. The objective of this study is
      to validate the utility and effectiveness of comprehensive surgical planning in restoring and
      preserving sagittal alignment through the collection of clinical and radiographic outcomes.
