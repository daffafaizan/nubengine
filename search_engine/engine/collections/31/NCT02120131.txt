    
      a sample of 50 patients requiring mandibular third molar extraction was selected for the
      study. Healthy patients with mild symptoms of pericoronitis affecting at least 1 mandibular
      third molar were included in the study. A total number of 52 consecutive cases of mandibular
      third molar surgical extractions were performed using either a trapezoidal flap or an
      envelope flap. The choice of the flap was randomized. The following parameters were recorded:
      Probing Pocket Depth, Clinical Attachment Level, Bleeding on Probing, Full Mouth Plaque
      Score, Full Mouth Bleeding Score, total time for the surgical intervention, age of the
      patient, type of inclusion, ostectomy. All the patients received a questionnaire to evaluate
      the post-intervention discomfort (swelling, pain, number of pain-killers, bleeding).
      Periodontal parameters were checked at 6-month follow up.
