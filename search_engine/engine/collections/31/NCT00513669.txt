    
      Volunteers will be screened, enrolled, injected with the vaccine or comparator and followed
      by the clinicians at the Bagamoyo Research and Training Unit of the the Ifakara Health
      Research and Development Center (BRTU-IHRDC).

      First, 10 adult males will be enrolled and randomized in 2 groups: Group AV (n=8) will be
      injected with the vaccine combination and group AP (n=2) will be vaccinated with the
      placebo=comparator (Inflexal V). 5 weeks later, 8 children will be enrolled first and
      randomized in 2 groups: Group CV (n=6) will be injected with the vaccine combination and
      group CP (n=2) will be vaccinated with comparator. 1 week later, the rest of the cohort
      (n=32) will be enrolled and randomized in 2 groups: Group CV (n=26) will be injected with the
      vaccine combination and group CP (n=6) will be vaccinated with comparator.

      Immunogenicity assessments for humoral immune response will be made at baseline (days -10 to
      -2), day 30 (+4), day 90 (+4) (day of 2nd vaccination), 120 (+4), 180 (+7), and 365 (+14).

      Cellular immune responses will be assessed before 1st vaccination (day 0), two weeks after
      2nd vaccination (day 104 Â±2), and one year after the 1st vaccination (day 365) Safety
      assessments will be made by the investigator at baseline (days -10 to -2, before the 1st
      immunization) and at day 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, 30 after each vaccination.
