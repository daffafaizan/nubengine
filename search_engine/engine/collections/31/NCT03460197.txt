      (Capillarity versus Wet) and identify which obtains the best sample quality for
      histopathology analysis as tissue acquisition method in patients diagnosed with tumors of
      pancreas, biliary tract, liver or lymph nodes.

      The researchers are planning a prospective, pilot study in 30 subjects. All patients will be
      submitted to both techniques of tissue acquisition (capillarity versus wet) in the same
      procedure of endoscopic ultrasound. Obtained samples for histopathology analysis will be
      submitted to a blind examination by two different pathologists.
