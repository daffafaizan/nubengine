      hypothermia in term infants following perinatal asphyxia is a safe procedure that improves
      survival without neurodevelopmental disability. Outcome will be assessed by survival and
      neurological and neurodevelopmental testing at 18 months of age.

      Within 6 hours of birth, infants will be randomized to either a non-cooled control group with
      rectal temperature kept at 37+/-0.5 degC or to head cooling with mild systemic hypothermia as
      follows. A cooling device capable of circulating cool water in a temperature-regulated manner
      through a cap fitted around the infant's scalp will cool the head. The core rectal
      temperature of the infant will be maintained at 34.5+/-0.5 degC by adjusting the cap water
      temperature. The infant's rectal, nasopharyngeal, scalp (fontanel), and skin (abdominal)
      temperatures will be continuously monitored. Also, metabolic, cardiovascular, pulmonary and
      coagulation laboratory measurements will be assessed at predefined time points. Cooling will
      be maintained for 72 hours, followed by four hours of rewarming, with the goal of raising the
      rectal temperature to normal body temperature by 0.5 degC per hour. The outcome measure of
      severe neurodevelopmental disability and survival rates at 18 months of age will be assessed
      by blinded, independent observers.
