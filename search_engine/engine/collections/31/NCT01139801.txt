      undergo placement of a Foley catheter, through the external and internal os of the cervix,
      according to standard practice. In group A, receiving intravenous infusion of oxytocin, will
      serve as the control group as it is standard protocol at Aultman Hospital. Group B,
      intravaginal placement of misoprostol, will serve as the experimental group. The expected
      duration of participation begins at induction of labor and concludes at time of delivery.
