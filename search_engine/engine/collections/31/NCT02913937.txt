    
      Full medical and dental history using a dental chart for all patients treated in this study.

      Clinical and radiographic examination will be done for all patients to verify the diagnosis
      of apical periodontitis with periapical radiolucency at least 2mm in diameter.

      The treatment protocol and its associated risks and benefits will be explained to the
      eligible patients before obtaining informed consent. Endodontic procedures will be done in a
      single visit as follows: access cavity preparation using sterile round bur and Endo-Z bur,
      isolation using a rubber dam, canal preparation using a nickel-titanium rotary system then
      obturation. During mechanical preparation, irrigation will be done using passive ultrasonic
      irrigation (Experimental group) where ultrasonic activation will be done for irrigant-filled
      canals using the U- file tip (Varios NSK) in an ultrasonic device (P5 Newtron; Satelec
      Acteon) 1mm from the working length after each file change for 10 sec, or needle irrigation
      (Control group) where only the endodontic irrigation needle will be used; the irrigation
      protocol for each patient will be determined following a random-number sequence.
