    
      Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a feared complication of premature birth. If discovered
      in time, the disease can be treated, and impaired vision or blindness can be reduced.
      Premature infants are therefore examined regularly after birth. However, the examination is
      painful and stressful for the infant. Painful experiences might lead to a pathological stress
      response later in life and should therefore be prevented.

      This is a double blinded, controlled and randomized study where the infants are examined and
      assessed either with or without the use of paracetamol.
