      in order to improve the exhalation by means of so-called pursed-lips breathing (PLB). But the
      effects have never been studied quantitatively. In this study, the PLB effect is simulated
      during lung function diagnostics, using different sized resistors inserted into the routine
      mouthpiece of the flow sensor to resemble the effective airway resistances of a PLB maneuver.
      This prospective, randomized study includes 20 healthy subjects and 50 COPD patients, who
      will perform lung function testing with 4 different sized resistors.
