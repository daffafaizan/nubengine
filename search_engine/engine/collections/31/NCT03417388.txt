    
      WARRIOR trial is a multi-site, PROBE design, that will evaluate an intensive statin/ACE-I (or
      ARB)/aspirin treatment strategy (IMT) vs. primary prevention risk factor therapy treatment
      strategy (UC) in 4,422 symptomatic (chronic angina or equivalent) women with non-obstructive
      CAD (<50% diameter narrowing).

      There will be ~50 US sites, including VA/ military and OneFlorida CDRN sites, with a proven
      record in prior trials. The investigators will use web-based, real-time data entry, and
      management University of Florida Data Management System (UFDMS) for site selection,
      screening, participant eligibility confirmation, enrollment, and randomization. Participants
      will be recruited from screened women with symptoms suspected to be ischemic with
      non-obstructive CAD by invasive coronary angiogram or CT angiogram. The high dose statin
      (atorvastatin or rosuvastatin) and ACE-I (lisinopril) [or ARB (losartan)] are generic
      commonly used medications previously demonstrated effective for improving angina, stress
      testing, myocardial perfusion and coronary microvascular flow reserve in small size trials in
      this population. Additionally, aspirin will also be recommended to IMT participants without
      contraindications or excess bleeding risk, however aspirin will not be provided by the study.
      Both the groups will also receive Lifestyle Counseling (PACE Assessment), and the same visit
      schedule and "face-time" with site staff to reduce bias. Events will be adjudicated by the
      Clinical Events Committee (CEC), according to objective criteria and masked to treatment
      assignment clues.
