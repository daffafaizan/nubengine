      and/or fulguration. However, recurrence and progression rates following endoscopic treatment
      of visible lesions are significant. To prevent recurrent and progressive disease, adjuvant
      intravesical chemotherapy and immunotherapy are applied. There is also increasing interest in
      new therapeutic strategies such as photodynamic therapy.
