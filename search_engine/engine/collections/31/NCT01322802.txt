      I. To determine the safety of an insulin like growth factor binding protein 2 (IGFBP-2) Th
      polyepitope plasmid based vaccine in patients with advanced stage or recurrent ovarian
      cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the immunogenicity of IGFBP-2 Th polyepitope plasmid based vaccine in
      patients with advanced stage or recurrent ovarian cancer.

      II. To determine whether intermolecular epitope spreading occurs with the generation of an
      IGFBP-2 specific Th1 immune response.

      III. To determine whether IGFBP-2 vaccination modulates T regulatory cells.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive pUMVC3-hIGFBP-2 multi-epitope plasmid DNA vaccine intradermally (ID) monthly
      for 3 months.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months, and
      then every 6 months for 5 years.
