      radiation for patients with brain metastases in relapsed neuroblastoma. This will be an
      adjunct study to NMTRC009 onto which patients will be enrolled to for treatment with
      precision therapy. This study will follow the efficacy, safety, and CNS progression-free
      survival of surgery and radiation.
