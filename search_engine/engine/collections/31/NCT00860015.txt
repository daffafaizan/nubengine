      peak incidence occurs in children and young adults with a second peak occurring in middle
      age, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality in young, productive individuals.
      Although limb preserving surgery and radiation therapy have improved the primary treatment of
      these tumors, the therapy of advanced, metastatic tumors is unsatisfactory. The purpose of
      this phase II study is to evaluate the efficacy of treatment with Alimta and gemcitabine
      given on day 1 of a 14 day cycle to patients with unresectable or metastatic soft tissue
      sarcomas. Gemcitabine is an established salvage therapy for soft tissue sarcomas in
      combination with docetaxel. Alimta is a multitargeted antifolate drug which inhibits several
      folate dependent enzymes required for cell proliferation. Alimta has shown efficacy in
      several solid tumor types both as a single agent and in combination with other agents. The
      combination of Alimta and gemcitabine is synergistic and is likely to have efficacy against
      soft tissue sarcomas. The primary objective of this study is to determine the response rate
      among patients with unresectable soft tissue sarcoma treated with this combination. Secondary
      endpoints will evaluate the median survival of this patient population, as well as time to
      objective tumor response, time to treatment failure and overall survival. The toxicities of
      this regimen in this population will also be analyzed. Given the desperate need for new
      agents to treat these patients, a phase II trial of this combination therapy should be
      pursued.
