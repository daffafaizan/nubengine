      their families, caregivers, and healthcare systems. Neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia
      (NPS) affect up to 80% of patients with Alzheimer's dementia. These symptoms include
      aggression and agitation, anxiety, depression, hallucinations, and delusions. These symptoms
      impair patient and care giver's quality of life, increase the chances of hospitalization and
      also result in faster progression of the illness. The efficacy of current treatments is
      limited and the antipsychotic medications commonly used to treat these symptoms are
      associated with serious side effects including cerebrovascular events, falls and increased
      risk of death. Electroconvulsive Therapy may be effective as well, however it requires
      anaesthesia and adversely affects cognition. Non-pharmacological or behavioral interventions
      are universally recognized as the first line treatment for agitation and NPSD. They are most
      effective when individualized and delivered in a person centered approach. Transcranial
      direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique that uses a
      very low intensity electric current to modulate cortical excitability and brain plasticity.
      tDCS can be safely administered to awake persons and is very well tolerated. Studies in
      healthy individuals and patients with Alzheimer's disease have shown that tDCS applied to
      frontal brain regions can enhance cognitive function. Further, tDCS applied to frontal brain
      regions can improve depressive symptoms. The effects of tDCS on NPSD are not known. In this
      study the investigators will use tDCS to treat agitation related to NPSD.The objective of
      this proposal is to conduct an open label pilot study of tDCS for treatment of agitation.
