    
      Patients treated for diabetic ketoacidosis receive 1000 ml of Sodium Chloride during the
      first 30 minutes of treatment.

      Before, during and after this infusion regular blood samples(and urine) are collected (0, 10,
      20, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 60, 120, 180 and 300 minutes after infusion start).

      B-Hemoglobin, P-Albumine, B-Glucose, P-Sodium, P-Potassium. P-Chlorides, U-Sodium, U-Chloride
      and U-Glucose. Hourly volume of urine is measured.

      The 30 minute infusion can be used to calculate the urine extracellular volume. Thereafter
      during infusion of Ringers acetate changes in electrolytes in blood as well as urine volume
      and in the urine excreted electrolytes can be used to calculate the fluid shifts between the
      different fluid compartments.

      Eventually 8 to 12 hours later a second infusion of SodiumChloride is as a control performed.
