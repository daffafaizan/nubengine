    
      Research Plan:

      The experimental design is a prospective, randomized controlled trial evaluating the impact
      of a Chronic Care Model (CCM) based quality improvement program on CKD guideline adherence.
      The intervention will focus on three main goals: 1) reduction of BP to target levels, 2)
      appropriate monitoring of patients for metabolic complications of CKD, and 3) reduced use of
      dialysis catheters in patients initiating dialysis. The CKD CCM QI program will include a
      lecture on CKD guidelines and hypertension to all CBOC providers and a centrally located
      pharmacist with access to the CKD registry.

      Methodology:

      Veterans receive primary care at Community Based Outpatient Centers (CBOCs) throughout
      Northeast Ohio. Patients with CKD who receive their primary care at a Northeast Ohio CBOC
      will be eligible for the study. The hypothesis was formulated before data collection.
