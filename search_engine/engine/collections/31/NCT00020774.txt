    
      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the biologic activity and toxicity of neoadjuvant SCH 66336 with or
      without gemcitabine followed by surgical resection vs surgical resection alone in patients
      with resectable primary liver cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label study. Patients are randomized to one of three
      treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive neoadjuvant oral SCH 66336 twice daily for 14 days
      followed by surgical resection. Arm II: Patients receive neoadjuvant oral SCH 66336 twice
      daily for 14 days and gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes once weekly for 2 weeks followed by
      surgical resection. Arm III: Patients undergo surgical resection. Patients receive no
      neoadjuvant therapy prior to resection.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 30 patients (10 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
