      Strattice® (LifeCell Corporation, Branchburg, NJ, USA) and Gore® Bio-A® (W. L. Gore &
      Associates, Inc., Newark, DE, USA) for the repair of abdominal wall defects in at-risk
      patients. Primary endpoints of the study will include hernia recurrence, duration of
      postoperative drains, the incidence of systemic and wound-related complications, the need for
      percutaneous intervention or reoperation and quality- of-life with 3 years of follow-up. The
      study will be prospective and randomized, and the evaluator and patient will be blinded as to
      the type of mesh implanted.
