      pharmaceuticals, and from dietary supplements. The FDA has regulated amino acid preparations
      as drugs since the 1940s as they can elicit pharmacologic effects similar to conventional
      single molecule pharmaceuticals. The best known amino acid preparations are used to treat
      conditions such as maple syrup disease and phenylketonuria (PKU). An official definition and
      categorization of medical foods was made in 1988 as part of the Orphan Drug Act. Medical
      foods are regulated similarly to drugs except they do not require pre-approval because all
      ingredients are found on the FDA's generally recognized as safe (GRAS) (Sections 201(s) and
      409 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act) list and claims are confined to the
      nutritional management of a specific disease. Medical food claims must be supported by
      recognized scientific data as determined by medical evaluation. A GRAS substance is
      distinguished from a food additive on the basis of the common knowledge about the safety of
      the substance for its intended use. The standard for an ingredient to achieve GRAS status
      requires not only technical demonstration of non-toxicity and safety, but also general
      recognition of safety through widespread usage and agreement of that safety by experts in the
      field. Many ingredients have been determined by the FDA to be GRAS, and are listed as such by
      regulation, in Volume 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Sections 182, 184, and 186.
