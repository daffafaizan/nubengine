      acknowledged that subjects with chronic pain in the NSM arm group might not experience any
      benefit as there was little evidence at the time that NSM was helpful. The protocol included
      optional crossover to other treatments, including surgical treatment. The protocol
      anticipated a high crossover rate and therefore did not include any comparative analyses
      after month 6.
