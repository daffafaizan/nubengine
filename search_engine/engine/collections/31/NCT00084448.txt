        -  Determine the antitumor activity of paclitaxel and celecoxib in patients with recurrent
           or persistent platinum-resistant ovarian epithelial or primary peritoneal cancer.

        -  Determine the nature and degree of toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15 and oral celecoxib twice
      daily on days 2-6, 9-13, and 16-27. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 19-51 patients will be accrued for this study within 11-22
      months.
