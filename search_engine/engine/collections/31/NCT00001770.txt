      receiving hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and that this disturbance in mood is related to
      the progestin component of the HRT. The bulk of this evidence is anecdotal. While some
      authors have attempted to examine this putative problem in a more systematic fashion, there
      are no controlled studies that attempt to identify the mechanism through which the
      perturbation in mood occurs. Adverse effects of progestins might be mediated directly through
      the progesterone or androgen receptor. Alternatively, the effects of progestins might be
      consequent to the antiestrogen effects of progesterone. This latter possibility is in part
      supported by our observation in previous studies of the beneficial effects of estradiol on
      mood and the possible precipitation of mood disturbance following acute estrogen withdrawal.
      Finally, despite the popular lore that progesterone causes mood disturbances, a placebo
      effect cannot be ruled out, since women taking HRT know when they are receiving the progestin
      component of the regimen. Our research questions therefore are as follows: 1) Are progestins
      associated with changes in mood during HRT, and 2) If progestins are associated with mood
      disturbance, is it because they are blocking the beneficial effects of estrogen?
