      stent implantation procedures and/or the eventual implantation of temporary mechanical blood
      circulation assistant devices [aortic counterpulsation, Impella, ECMO (Extracorporeal
      Membrane Oxygenation)], could further favour the phenomenon. Vice versa, thrombocytosis
      occurring during ACS has a reactive origin, caused by increased IL-6 production which, in
      turn, leads to an increase in thrombopoietin formation in the liver, causing a consequent
      stimulatory activity on megakaryocytes. Different studies have demonstrated a significant
      correlation between platelets count disorders and patient outcome (survival during
      hospitalization and in the immediate follow-up). This association has, however, often been
      considered an epiphenomenon of the underlying pathology. Platelets count alterations are,
      indeed, usually consensual to other hemogram alterations (anaemia and neutropenia), an
      indication of a coexisting medullar insufficiency (thrombocytopenia) or other heterogenous
      diseases such as cancer, iron deficiency or immuno-modulated diseases, usually associated
      with an increase in comorbidity indexes. Those alterations, moreover, can usually influence
      changes to the therapeutic approach (reduction/suspension of recommended standard therapies)
      and further condition the prognosis. Since a few years,the investigators have been
      established a cardiac-haematological collaboration aiming at finding early alterations in
      platelets count or, more generally, in cell blood count (CBC), collegially evaluating those
      alterations with a cardiologist and a haematologist (even in mild cases) and scheduling, on
      the basis of the aforementioned evaluations, a more precise and tailored therapeutic approach
      toward the specific patient needs in order to minimize the downgrading of potentially
      life-saving therapies. Until now, however, no precise evaluation of the impact that this
      strategy had in influencing the therapeutic approach and in improving patient outcome in our
      population has been performed.

      A retrospective evaluation of consecutive ACS patients, their clinical, biohumoral and
      procedural characteristics and the adopted pharmacological treatments is, therefore, an
      important epidemiologic tool for the characterization of this phenomenon and for identifying
      potential associations which could suggest possible future therapeutic developments.
