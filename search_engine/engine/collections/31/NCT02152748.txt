      The aim of this study is to analyze systematically morphological and molecular changes
      associated with glioblastoma progression and therapy-resistance in matched pre- and
      post-therapeutic glioblastoma samples.

      The following primary aims will be addressed:

        1. Morphological characterisation of changes in a large series of matched glioblastoma
           tissues pertaining to i. Vascularization and hypoxia-mediated factors ii. Tumor necrosis
           and chemoradiation-induced necrosis iii. Inflammatory response iv. Tumor cellularity and
           proliferation v. Tumor cell phenotype after treatment e.g. glial-mesenchymal transition

        2. Molecular analyses

           i. Transcriptomic, DNA methylation and genomic profiling will be performed to detect
           changes in gene expression, methylation and copy number aberrations in post-therapeutic
           as compared to pre-therapeutic tumor tissue. ii. The relationship between the
           transcriptomic, DNA methylation and genomic profiles will be analyzed.

        3. Exploratory analysis of associations between morphological and molecular changes in a
           screening set of 30 glioblastoma cases (with available fresh frozen tissues at first and
           second surgery) and subsequent validation of relevant findings in a larger glioblastoma
           cohort (150 cases with matched formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues) by appropriate
           methods including immunohistochemistry, fluorescence-in-situ-hybridization, and
           sequencing.

        4. Special attention will be paid to gender-specific patterns of therapy-related changes
           and tumor progression.
