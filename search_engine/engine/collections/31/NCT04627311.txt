    
      A retrospective observational study was conducted on a cohort of 213 patients referred to the
      Cardiac Rehabilitation programme of "Santa Caterina" Hospital ("Girona", Spain) following
      acute coronary syndrome (ACS). We evaluated the long-term control of Cardiovascular Risk
      Factors and the occurrence of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) in a 3-year period of
      follow-up.

      we found that short-term CVRF control was significantly improved after discharge from the CR
      unit for all CVRF analysed (LDLc, Systolic blood pressure, tobacco consumption, HbA1C and BMI
      (body mass index)). Long-term control of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) and
      tobacco consumption was maintained from post-CR to year three, although both showed a trend
      towards deterioration. There was a significant increase in systolic blood pressure and
      glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1C) and body mass index (BMI) from post-CR to year three.
