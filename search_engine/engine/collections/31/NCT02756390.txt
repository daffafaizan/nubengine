      intervention for improving insomnia in cancer survivors. In this study, the investigators are
      testing whether this 3-session intervention (Cognitive Behavior Therapy for Insomnia in
      Cancer Survivors: CBTI-CS) will improve insomnia in cancer survivors whose continue to have
      insomnia symptoms after receiving sleep hygiene education.

      In addition to the participants who will be offered sleep hygiene education and the 3-session
      CBTI-CS,10 additional participants will be recruited to participate in a pilot evaluation of
      the CBTI-CS intervention delivered via telehealth. This will be a pilot aspect of the study
      and data from these participants will be for descriptive purposes.
