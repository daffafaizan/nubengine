      hypoxia in oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma after a course of treatment of 9-14 days.

      The primary endpoint of the trial is the change in hypoxia-regulated gene expression upon
      Treatment with Metformin. Secondary endpoint are changes in MRI imaging correlating with the
      changes in gene expression.

      Study design: This is a single-arm, open-label interventional window of opportunity study for
      proof of principle. Oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma is primarily treated by surgical
      tumor resection. This offers the possibility to study the effect of metformin on the tumor
      tissue.

      Baseline tissue from potential participants before the intervention will be acquired by
      biopsy during diagnostic panendoscopy. Provided surgery is recommended by tumor board
      decision, participants will be orally administered 850 mg of metformin twice daily between
      the therapeutic decision of the tumor board and the surgical resection of the tumor. The
      duration of the treatment is 9-14 days, depending on the date of the planned surgery. The
      resected tumor tissue as well as the biopsy taken prior to metformin treatment will be
      subjected to massive parallel sequencing and immunohistochemistry.

      To assess whether changes in hypoxia regulated gene expression can be correlated to changes
      in MRI scans, each participants will undergo a MRI scan before metformin treatment and a
      second MRI scan within 48 hours prior to the surgical resection of the tumor.
