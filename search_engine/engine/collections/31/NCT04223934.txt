      claims 1000 deaths every day. Despite medication and life-style management, the cost of HTN
      associated hospitalizations had escalated to $113 billion in 2016, or 15% of all hospital
      costs, with >135 million Emergency Department (ED) visits.

      Uncontrolled HTN for even a few weeks is associated with increased risk for acute
      cardiovascular (CVD) events [stroke, heart failure (HF), myocardial infarction (MI)] and
      death. Medication treatment optimization to BP goal reduces the incidence of stroke by
      35-40%, HF by up to 64%, and MI by 15-25%.

      optima-for-blood pressure [optima4BP] transforms the episodic and reactive nature of
      uncontrolled HTN pharmacological treatment management into a process that is continuous,
      proactive, and personalized. The innovation simulates the established clinical reasoning
      treatment decision process undertaken during a patient's visit.
