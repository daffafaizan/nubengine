      MRI) to determine if there is a differential effect between aripiprazole and risperidone on
      brain morphology in participants with first-episode psychosis. A secondary objective is to
      see if fasting metabolic indices measured in the blood (i.e. glucose, insulin, total
      cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, adiponectin and leptin) are
      also correlated to changes in brain morphology or symptom severity (as measured by
      neuropsychiatric assessments).
