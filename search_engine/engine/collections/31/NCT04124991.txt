    
      This is a single arm, open-label study to evaluate safety and efficacy of Radioembolization
      with Yttrium-90 Microspheres in Combination with Durvalumab in Locally Advanced and
      Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma which to be implemented at a single site in Korea.

      Transarterial radioembolization (TARE) with yttrium-90 microspheres will be employed in
      combination with an intravenous (IV) durvalumab until PD. TARE will be performed before the
      first dose of durvalumab. Exploratory biomarker testing will be done on tumor tissues prior
      to treatment and plasma samples prior to treatment and at the time of PD.
