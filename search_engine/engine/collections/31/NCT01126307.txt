      open-label-treatment. There are 9 visits over 32 weeks. During the baseline period, the
      number of seizures will be recorded during 2 months while the patient is on a dose of
      antiseizure drug(s) that was previously established to provide better seizure control. Blood
      work, including blood for DNA baseline ECG and echocardiogram will be done and may be
      repeated if necessary. During the 3 months of double-blind treatment phase, verapamil/placebo
      will be added to the current medications. Visits are every 4 weeks. Vital signs, seizure
      counts and adverse events will be evaluated. All patients who received placebo will be
      offered 3 months of open-label treatment with verapamil.
