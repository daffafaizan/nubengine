      and lipid abnormalities, particularly with an elevated level of plasma apoprotein E
      (apoE).There are no efficiency way to treat lipoprotein glomerulopathy. We firstly
      successfully treat 2 patients by protein A immunoadsorption with remarkable decreased urine
      protein and reduction of lipoprotein thrombi on repeated renal biopsy.
