        -  Assess the feasibility of minimal residual disease (MRD) determination in pediatric
           B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) using deep sequencing of the immunoglobulin
           heavy chain locus.

      OUTLINE: Archived blood and tumor tissue samples are analyzed for MDR using deep sequencing
      of immunoglobulin heavy chain locus. MDR quantification results are then compared with the
      flow cytometry reference methods used in COG studies.
