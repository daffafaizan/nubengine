      during hospitalization, few receive outpatient cessation counseling and/or pharmacotherapy
      following discharge, which are key factors associated with long-term cessation. The primary
      objective of this research study is to determine whether a nurse-initiated intervention,
      which couples brief inpatient counseling and proactive telephone counseling by a centralized
      tobacco quitline, improves 6-month cessation rates in hospitalized VA smokers. Co-primary
      aims are to determine whether the intervention improves the prescription of recommended
      pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation and the referral of patients for telephone counseling
      (or other outpatient cessation counseling). We will perform a quasi-experimental before-after
      trial in hospitalized patients, aged 18 or older, who smoke at least one cigarette per day on
      average. After a 6-month baseline period, we will implement the intervention and enroll a
      separate cohort of patients over the subsequent 6 months. The intervention will include: 1)
      nurse training in delivery of bedside cessation counseling, 2) use of CPRS-based practice
      tools (to streamline nursing assessment and documentation, to facilitate prescription of
      pharmacotherapy), 3) computerized referral of motivated inpatients for proactive telephone
      counseling, and 4) use of nursing peer leaders to provide coaching and performance feedback
      to ward nurses. Enrolled patients will be contacted by telephone at 3 and 6 months to assess
      7-day point prevalence abstinence and prolonged abstinence (with biochemical confirmation of
      self-reported quitters at 6 months). We will identify barriers and facilitators to
      implementation by using clinician focus groups, and will assess attitudes of staff nurses
      toward cessation counseling by questionnaire. We will also conduct semi-structured interviews
      in a subsample of patients and nurses to assess perceptions of the intervention, and will use
      content analysis to interpret the data.
