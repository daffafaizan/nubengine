      reflected image through multiple lenses and prisms. MacCoy laryngoscope is a modification of
      Macintosh laryngoscope. It has a lever which, when pressed, moves its flexible tip. In the
      investigators' study, the researchers compared the performances of Airtraq laryngoscope with
      MacCoy and Macintosh laryngoscopes in simulated difficult laryngoscopy using a rigid neck
      collar. The researchers recruited 120 patients and randomly divided those patients into three
      equal groups i.e. 30 patients in each group. These three groups are 1-Airtraq, 2-MacCoy and
      3-Macintosh. The researchers compared efficacy and safety in these three laryngoscopes. The
      researchers compared efficacy in terms of time of intubation, ease of intubation, overall
      success, Intubation difficulty score, visualization of vocal cord in terms of POGO
      (percentage of Glottic Opening) score. The researchers compared safety in terms of
      hemodynamic pressor response and airway trauma.
