    
      Patients scheduled for hepatic resection who voluntarily agree to participate the study will
      be recruited for the screening procedures.

      Patients who meet the eligibility criteria will be assigned to the study. Subjects will
      receive HLBLS-200 as a supplementary hemostatic technique for oozing hemorrhage which can be
      occurred during hepatic resection.

      A dose of HLBLS-200 based on the area of liver resection will be applied and time to
      hemostasis of blood oozing will be evaluated.

      Patients will be followed for 12 weeks after application of HLBLS-200 to monitor any adverse
      event.

      Study objective:

        1. To investigate the safety of HLBLS-200 application.

        2. To explore hemostatic function of HLBLS-200 in patients receiving hepatectomy.
