    
      Postoperative delirium (POD) is an acute confusional state associated with changes in
      consciousness, arousal level and cognitive status. Elderly patients with hip fractures have
      the high incidence of delirium. The high risk factor of delirium include: Age 65 years or
      older, cognitive impairment/dementia, current hip fracture, severe illness and so on. Many
      previous studies predict that the majority of general anesthetic and sedative agents can
      favour postoperative delirium. However, none of studies have investigated the effect of
      general anesthesia and the effect of regional anesthesia and general anesthesia on the
      postoperative delirium in elderly patients undergoing hip fracture surgery in China. This
      multicentre, prospective, randomized controlled clinical trial is designed to evaluate
      postoperative delirium after general anesthesia and regional anesthesia in elderly patients
      undergoing hip fracture surgery. Our research hypotheses are: (1) regional anesthesia may
      contribute to decrease the incidence of postoperative delirium. (2) Regional anesthesia may
      improve the outcome of elderly patient and reduce healthcare costs associated with
      postoperative delirium. (3) Postoperative delirium may result in poor long-term functional
      outcomes.

      This trial has the following nine investigational centers: Department of Anesthesiology, The
      Second Affiliated Hospital & Yuying Children hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou,
      China; Department of Anesthesiology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical college, Huazhong
      University of Science & Technology, Wuhan, China; Department of Anesthesiology, West China
      Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu, China; Department of Anesthesiology, Southwest
      Hospital, Chongqing, China; Department of Anesthesiology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of
      Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China; Department of Anesthesiology,
      Beijing Jishuitan Hospital, Beijing, China; Department of Anesthesiology, The First
      Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang, China; Department of Anesthesiology,
      The Second Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Anhui, China; The First Affiliated Hospital
      of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China;

      Eligible patients will be assigned into two study groups (group RA: regional anesthesia will
      be used, group GA: General anesthesia will be used) by centre-minimization randomization (web
      or telephone). There are 3 stratification factors: age (65-79,≥80), presence of delirium(yes,
      no), dementia(yes, no). There will be two teams of investigators involved in trial procedure
      and the patient's follow-up. Investigator A (experienced anesthetist), who are competent in
      caring for patients undergoing hip fracture surgery, will perform following works, which
      includes informed consent, randomization, anesthesia and recovery parameters. Investigator B
      will visit patient the day before surgery and 7days after surgery or until discharge to
      assess patient for presence, type and severity of delirium, collect other data during in
      hospital stay and follow up patients at 6 and 12 months. Investigator B will receive uniform
      training of using of CAM, Delirium Rating Scale-Revised-98 (DRS-R-98), MMSE and other test
      used in this trial) and will be not clear about protocol.

      Within 24 h before surgery, cognitive function of each patient will be assessed with the
      MMSE, the presence of delirium will be diagnosed with the CAM, the type and severity of
      delirium will be assessed with DRS-R-98 and the pain will be assessed with a 100-mm visual
      analog scale (VAS). Routine monitoring (NBP, continuous ECG, and pulse oximetry) was
      initiated on all patients. Premedication for anesthesia will be avoided before surgery. Any
      medication impairing cognitive function will not be recommended, if administered, must be
      recorded it in detail.

      Investigator A will allocated the patient into group GA or group RA according the
      centre-randomization with a unique registration number for each eligible patient. Treatment
      protocols for both groups will also stipulate no sedative be administrated during operation.
      Routine monitoring was initiated on all patients. Hypotension (Systolic Blood Pressure<90mmHg
      or drop of Mean Arterial Pressure>30%) should be treated with vasoactive agents or fluid
      boluses as deemed appropriate by anesthetists.

      Postoperative analgesia will be administered according to the local procedures of each
      clinical trial site, aiming to maintain a VAS pain score ≤ 30 mm. Both groups will receive
      routine postoperative care on orthopedic ward.

      All randomized patients will be followed up to 7 days after surgery (or discharge from the
      hospital). The 7 days follow-up includes: CAM, DRS-98-R (if applicable), VAS, Analgesic use
      (if applicable), Sedative use (if applicable), Post-operative morbidity and laboratory
      results (including serum hemoglobin, hematocrit, leucocytes, aspartate aminotransferase
      (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), albumin, serum creatinine and urea concentrations,
      serum sodium and potassium and serum glucose concentration). Concomitant medications, adverse
      events and serious adverse events are record in all study visits. Economic parameters
      include: time to be discharged from post operation, total cost in hospital and cost for
      anesthesia of patient. Investigator B will also assess patient with POD in clinic or at their
      residence at 6 and 12 months to assess for presence of delirium, its type and severity (CAM,
      DRS-98-R), cognitive function using MMSE, and quality of life using The MOS 36-item
      Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) questionnaire.

      The study will be monitored regularly by the clinical research associate (CRA) through visits
      or telephone. CRA will verify the consistency of the data recorded on the case report forms
      with the source documents and the management of therapeutic batches, the presence and
      completeness of the investigator file.
