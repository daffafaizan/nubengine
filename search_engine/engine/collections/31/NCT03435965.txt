      release of the amniotic fluid prior to the onset of labour. PROM may be subdivided into term
      -PROM (TPROM, i.e. PROM after 37 weeks of gestation) and preterm PROM (PPROM, i.e. PROM prior
      to 37 weeks of gestation). PPROM occurs in approximately 3% of pregnancies and is responsible
      for a third of all preterm births.The diagnosis of PPROM is made by examination , patient
      history and simple testing. Patient history has an accuracy of 90% for the diagnosis of PPROM
