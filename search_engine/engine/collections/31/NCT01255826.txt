      can reduce mortality but probably can significantly decrease subsequent morbidity.

      Premature infants need appropriate respiratory support and a lung-protective strategy,
      starting from the delivery room where, on the contrary, an inadequate respiratory approach
      may influence pulmonary outcome.

      Mechanical ventilation in the form of positive pressure ventilation has remained the mainstay
      of treatment of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in preterm babies. In recent years, a
      number of new ventilation strategies have been introduced but the problem of bronchopulmonary
      dysplasia (BPD) has not been solved.

      Sustained lung inflation (SLI) lead to a large increase in the tidal volume and the
      functional residual capacity(FCR) as this intervention may influence the clearance of lung
      fluids and allow a more even distribution of air throughout the lungs, thus facilitating the
      formation of FRC.

      Nasal CPAP and early PEEP act through stabilization and subsequent recruitment of collapsed
      alveoli, increased FRC resulting in increased alveolar surface area for gas exchange and a
      decrease in intrapulmonary shunt .also it conserves endogenous surfactant.

      Previous studies with promising results showed that a combination of sustained lung inflation
      and early nasal CPAP may be the most effective and least injurious way to recruit the lung in
      preterm neonates at birth.

      This study will evaluate sustained lung inflation followed by early nCPAP as delivery room
      ventilatory management for preterm neonates at risk of respiratory distress syndrome in
      reducing their need for mechanical ventilation and ameliorating lung injury without inducing
      adverse effects compared with intermittent bag and mask ventilation.
