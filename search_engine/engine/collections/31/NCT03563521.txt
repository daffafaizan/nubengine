      follow-up and 15 control subjects will be investigated. Stable (controlled or
      partly-controlled) status (of all) and exacerbated-status (if any) serum cytokine levels
      [IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, IL-13, IL-25, IL-33, thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), IL-17A,
      periostin) will be evaluated. Also nasopharyngeal brush samples will be obtained for
      respiratory tract panel work-up with PCR in exacerbated patients. Effect of viral infections'
      on cytokine response in different inflammatory phenotypes will be evaluated.
