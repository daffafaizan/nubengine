    
      This is a blinded, four-arm randomized controlled trial with crossover design to explore the
      effects of warm water footbaths with different water temperatures on cardiovascular stress,
      reaction of the autonomic nervous system and a feeling of comfort and warmth in healthy
      female volunteers. Cardiovascular and ANS measurements are performed continuously throughout
      the interventions and the participants rate their feelings of warmth, general well-being and
      the footbath-related comfort with questionnaires.
