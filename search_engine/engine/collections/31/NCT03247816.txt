      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) in the UK, including
      treatment effectiveness, patterns of use and tolerability. By describing the characteristics
      of patients treated with Feraccru® and their outcomes, this study will provide the medical
      community with important information to support treatment decisions for their patients. This
      will ultimately support improvements to patient care, including the long-term outcomes of
      patients with IBD and IDA
