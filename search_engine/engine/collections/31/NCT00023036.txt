      be caused by mutations in any one of at least 60 different genes. Enlargement of the
      vestibular aqueduct (EVA) is a radiologic finding known to be associated with mutations in
      one of these genes, the Pendred syndrome gene (SLC26A4, formerly known as PDS). EVA may thus
      serve as a clinically useful marker to facilitate the diagnosis of hearing impairment. Recent
      data from our laboratory and others indicates that only a subset of individuals with EVA have
      SLC26A4 mutations, and therefore some EVA cases are likely to be caused by other genes,
      nongenetic factors, or a combination of these etiologies. Families with two or more
      individuals with hearing impairment and EVA will be enrolled in this study in order to
      identify other genetic factors that cause EVA. Siblings and parents may also be enrolled in
      order to define inheritance and to perform molecular genetic analyses.
