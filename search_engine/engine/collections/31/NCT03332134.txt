    
      The goal of this study is to test and evaluate the feasibility, acceptance, safety, and
      efficacy of an an intimate partner violence (IPV) intervention in recently-married,
      low-income husband-wife dyads in Pune, India conducted over a six week period.

      Acceptability and feasibility will be assessed through semi-structured interviews with
      participants and staff post-intervention. Safety will be gauged through semi-structured
      interviews with women participants and efficacy will be gauged through change in proximal
      determinants of IPV in this population (i.e. time spent in the relationship, self-esteem,
      resilience, communication and conflict management skills, sexual communication, attitudes
      toward IPV acceptability, and conceptualization of IPV).
