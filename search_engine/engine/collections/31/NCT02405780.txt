    
      The first period of this extension study was an open label, randomised, comparative, multi
      centre, 2 arm extension Phase 3 study in patients with RA who were taking a stable dose of
      MTX and who had continued from the preceding Study FKB327-002 (NCT02260791). The transition
      from Study FKB327-002 was ideally to occur without interruption: the Week 24 visit of Study
      FKB327-002 was to be on the same day as the Week 0 visit of Study FKB327-003. Patients who
      had received FKB327 in Study FKB327-002 received FKB327 or Humira in a 2:1 ratio and patients
      who had received Humira in Study FKB327-002 received Humira or FKB327 in a 2:1 ratio (Period
      I). The second period of the study was an open label, single arm extension in which all
      patients received FKB327 treatment from Week 30 to Week 76 (Period II), followed by a 4 week
      Follow up period.

      Clinic visits were scheduled for Weeks 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 30, 32, 34, 42, 54, 66, 76, and
      80. The patient or carer was allowed to administer interim doses of study drug at home every
      other week (eow) between clinic visits.
