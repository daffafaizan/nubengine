      I. To determine whether mixed or full donor hematopoietic chimerism can be safely established
      using a non-myeloablative conditioning regimen.

      II. To determine whether mixed chimerism can be safely converted to full donor hematopoietic
      chimerism by infusions of donor lymphocytes (DLI).

      III. To evaluate potential efficacy of this approach as a treatment for metastatic renal
      cancer.

      OUTLINE:

      CONDITIONING REGIMEN: Patients receive fludarabine phosphate intravenously (IV) on days -4 to
      -2 and undergo low-dose total-body irradiation (TBI) on day 0.

      TRANSPLANTATION: Patients undergo allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplant on day 0.

      IMMUNOSUPRESSION: Patients receive cyclosporine orally (PO) twice daily (BID) or IV once
      daily (QD) or BID on days -3 to 35 with taper to day 56, and mycophenolate mofetil PO or IV
      over 2 hours thrice daily (TID) on days 0-40.

      DLI: Patients with stable mixed chimerism on day 56 with no evidence of graft-vs-host disease
      (GVHD) may receive escalating doses of non-mobilized DLI over 30 minutes. Patients may
      receive up to 4 DLIs at escalating doses if there is disease progression with no evidence of
      GVHD.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for 5 years.
