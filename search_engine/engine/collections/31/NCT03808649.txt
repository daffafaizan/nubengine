      especially in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases. Small bowel distension is mandatory
      for the assessment of the bowel wall. So, it is important to find clinical risk factors for
      inadequate small bowel distension and prescribe personalized regimen according to patient's
      personal characteristics to reduce patient acceptance.
