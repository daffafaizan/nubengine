      patients with metastatic and/or locally recurrent adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum
      treated with ISIS 2503, an antisense inhibitor of H-ras. II. Determine the safety profile of
      this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive ISIS 2503 IV continuously for 14 days.
      Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-25 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.
