      in patient-specific image data. Image guidance is effectively used in various surgical
      domains such as neurosurgery, nose-surgery and orthopaedic surgery with benefits for patients
      such as less invasiveness and reduced surgery time. Its application for lateral skull base
      surgery was proposed and is considered an unmet clinical need. However, the small geometric
      scale (~0.5 mm) of the anatomical structures within the lateral skull base prevents the
      effective application of commercially available systems due to their insufficient guidance
      accuracy. Within the context of robotic cochlear implantation, stereotactic image guidance
      technology with a guidance accuracy <0.5 mm was developed. The aim of this study is to apply
      the developed technology in lateral skull base surgery other than robotic cochlear
      implantation.

      This study primarily seeks to determine the effective end-to-end image guidance accuracy of
      the investigational device at predefined artificial landmarks on a task-specific registration
      device attached to the skull.

      The main secondary objective is to qualitatively assess the available accuracy at predefined
      anatomical landmarks by visual inspection through surgeons in the absence of quantifiable
      ground truth information.
