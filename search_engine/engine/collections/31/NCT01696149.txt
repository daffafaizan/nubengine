    
      15 healthy subjects (8 females, 7 males) with a mean age of 22.6 Â± 3.7 years participated in
      this study.

      All subjects participated, randomly, in a 4 Hz TENS session, a 110 Hz TENS session, and a
      control (off-TENS) session. Each session consisted of a 20- minute stimulation period and a
      10-minute follow up period.

      Outcome measures: Sympathetic skin response from the simulated (Right) hand and skin
      temperature of both stimulated (Right) and none stimulated (Left) hand was measured 15
      seconds before, just 15 seconds after, and 10 minutes after application of interventions.
