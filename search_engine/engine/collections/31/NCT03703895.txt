    
      This is a double-blind, pilot study with 20 subjects to determine the tolerability and
      efficacy of topical AFX 5931 in the treatment of mild to moderate hand dermatitis. Subjects
      are screened up to 30 days before the baseline visit. Subjects who meet the eligibility
      criteria may qualify for the study. Subjects will be randomized in a 3:1 ratio to receive
      either the active or vehicle medication. 15 subjects will receive the active, therapeutic
      product and 5 subjects will receive the inactive, vehicle product. Subjects will complete 4
      study visits according to the following 4-week timeline: Day [-30] - [-1] (Screening), Day 0
      (Baseline), Day 14 (Follow-Up), Day 28 (Follow-up | ET | EOS). At Visit 2, IP will be
      dispensed and baseline readings of efficacy as well as safety/tolerability assessments will
      be obtained prior to application of the IP. Subjects will apply IP twice daily and compliance
      will be monitored by periodically reviewing the subject diary. The evaluations that will be
      used to measure efficacy of the product will be the Investigator's Global Assessment and Hand
      Eczema Severity Index. The Subject's Local Dermal Tolerability Assessment and Local Skin
      Reaction Assessment will be used throughout the course of the study to evaluate tolerability.
      Additionally, the actions that will be taken to evaluate safety will be the monitoring of
      adverse events, vital signs, and changes in concomitant medications. Digital photographs will
      be taken at each visit (excluding Visit 3).
