      population has Type 2 Diabetes, which is 2-3 times higher than the world average. Although
      much of the clinical studies of diabetes often focused on microvascular phenotypes such as
      retinopathy and nephropathy, and macrovascular diseases presenting clinically as myocardial
      infarction, stroke, and peripheral vascular disease, other rare complications such as Charcot
      foot disease confer a significant burden in Qatar diabetic population, leading to decreased
      life quality.

      Charcot foot is estimated to affect 0.8% to 8% of diabetic populations. It occurs most
      commonly in patients with diabetes complicated by severe peripheral neuropathy, often with
      coexisting sympathetic denervation, causing increased blood flow to the foot and increased
      bone resorption.

      Uncontrolled and inappropriate inflammation leading to bone resorption and deformation has
      been the hallmark of diabetic Charcot foot pathophysiology. There are two major theories that
      provide the likely mechanism of the disease. The "neurovascular (French) theory" suggests
      that increased blood flow, as a result of autonomic neuropathy, can lead to bone destruction
      and mechanical debilitation. On the other hand, the "neurotraumatic (German) theory" argues
      that the loss of protective sensation leads to unperceived injury and trauma in the insensate
      foot. One can argue that the pathogenesis of Charcot neuro-arthropathy is most likely a
      combination of these processes. For unknown reasons, Charcot foot is trigged only in some
      susceptible individuals with diabetes.
