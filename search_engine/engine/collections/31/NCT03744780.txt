      and has been linked to weight concerns, mental health concerns, and disordered eating
      behaviours. Effective interventions have been developed that address emotional eating, namely
      to improve weight loss. Such interventions are based in Acceptance and Commitment Therapy
      (ACT), which encourages tolerance of internal cues, such as emotions, and external cues, such
      as food.

      Emotional eating, however, is not exclusive to those who struggle with their weight. Many
      individuals maintain a normal weight despite engaging in emotional eating. These individuals
      still consume an excess of high calorie (for which they somehow eventually compensate), high
      fat, and high sugar foods as part of their emotional eating. Unhealthy dietary habits such as
      these have been shown to be associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality, as well
      as health concerns including diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Individuals with normal
      weight are not eligible for ACT programs described above, despite the increased risk of
      health concerns associated with emotional eating.

      The present study aims to test the feasibility and acceptability of a one-day ACT workshop to
      reduce emotional eating and improve health that is not focused on weight loss as its primary
      outcome, and rather targets all individuals who engage in emotional eating.
