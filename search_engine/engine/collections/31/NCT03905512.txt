    
      This is a randomized, parallel-arm, multicenter study to compare the safety and efficacy
      profiles of SEL-212 and KRYSTEXXA速. Patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive treatment with
      SEL-212 [a combination of pegadricase (SEL-037) and ImmTOR (SEL-110)] or KRYSTEXXA速 for 6
      months.

      Study patients in the SEL-212 arm will receive study drug every 28 days for a total of up to
      6 infusions of SEL-212. Study patients in the KRYSTEXXA速 arm will receive study drug
      according to the manufacturer's prescribing information, i.e., every 14 days for a total of
      up to 12 infusions of KRYSTEXXA速.

      Efficacy assessments, as measured by SUA levels, will be conducted at intervals that are
      appropriate to determine treatment effect differences. Safety will be monitored throughout
      the study.
