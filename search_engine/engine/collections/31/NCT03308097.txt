      with men (BMSM) living in the Southern United States. This is a significant issue because
      eight of the ten states with the highest rates of new HIV infections are located in the
      South. Jackson, Mississippi (MS) (the site of this project) has the second highest AIDS
      diagnosis rate in the nation, and the highest rate of HIV infection for young urban Black men
      who have sex with men. This study will develop and test an engaging, interactive, and cost
      effective mobile messaging intervention to improve linkage to PrEP care for BMSM (18-35 yrs)
      living in Jackson, MS. BMSM eligible for PrEP, receiving care at the University of
      Mississippi Medical Center sexually-transmitted infections (STI)/HIV testing clinics, will be
      texted interactive links to publicly available, online content about PrEP and HIV prevention.
      Links will be sent to PrEP eligible BMSM by 8-16 interactive text messages over 4 weeks. The
      material used in the intervention will be consistent with the Information Motivation Behavior
      (IMB) Model and will address cultural and structural barriers to initiating PrEP care. A
      small randomized controlled study among 66 new participants in the clinics will examine the
      preliminary efficacy of the intervention compared to enhanced standard of care on attendance
      at a PrEP Services Appointment (the first step in initiating PrEP care). It is hypothesized
      that, compared to BMSM receiving enhanced standard of care, BMSM receiving the PrEP Mobile
      Messaging Intervention will show greater attendance at a PrEP Services Appointment and
      decreased HIV risk behavior at 4 and 16 weeks.
