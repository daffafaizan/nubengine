      sclerosis, taking into account the insufficient efficacy of first line therapy, lack of
      availability (government approval) and high cost of monoclonal antibodies as a second line
      drugs. In this setting, according to the safety-efficiency ratio the most appropriate are
      reduced intensity conditioning regimens in autoHSCT. In 75% of cases for refractory forms of
      multiple sclerosis it is possible to achieve 5 years remission with transplant mortality less
      than 1%. In recent years, it is quite clear that gut microbiota abnormalities may be one of
      mechanisms for autoimmune diseases development. Therefore, the correction of gut dysbiosis
      through FMT from a healthy donor can improve the effectiveness of basic therapies. Currently,
      FMT is a rapidly developing method of treating intestinal infections associated with
      multi-resistant bacteria, based on the replacement of the recipient's microbiota by the
      donor's microbiota.
