    
      The key question is whether scaling and root planing (SRP) followed by one or two doses of
      photodynamic disinfection using 0.01% MB result in improved outcomes that persist over time
      in adults with chronic periodontitis when compared with subjects with SRP alone. This study
      is meant to be pivotal in nature in the evaluation of photodynamic disinfection.

      Primary Endpoint

      The primary outcome of interest in this study is improvement in or stabilization of clinical
      attachment level. The clinical attachment level is the distance in mm from the cemento-enamel
      junction to the base of the sulcus or periodontal pocket as measured with a periodontal
      probe. In order to prevent study bias all endpoint measurements will be performed by a single
      examiner throughout the course of the study. A clinically significant difference will be
      considered as:

      1) A measurement difference of 0.4 mm between treatment groups

      Secondary Endpoints

      The secondary objectives are to assess the effects of photodynamic disinfection on clinical
      symptoms including reductions in probing depth and decreases in bleeding on probing.
