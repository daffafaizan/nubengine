      morbidity and mortality rates. Especially in the presence of both diseases, these risks
      increase exponentially. The combined endpoint of death and myocardial infarction reaches up
      to 30% within four years. A lifestyle intervention with exercise training and dietary change
      can reduce the mortality by 20-30% and is a class-I indication in the current guidelines of
      the European Association of Preventive Cardiology (EAPC). Nevertheless, the implementation of
      lifestyle interventions in the population is insufficient.

      This prospective randomized controlled trial examines whether a structured, individual and
      telemedicine-supported lifestyle intervention improves health literacy and reduces
      cardiovascular risk factors compared to a guideline-based recommendation (usual care).
      Furthermore, the effectiveness of the intervention will be compared between urban and rural
      areas.

      In total, 1500 patients with diabetes mellitus type II and chronic ischemic heart disease
      will participate in the trial. After randomization (1:1), the 750 patients of the
      intervention group will receive individual exercise prescriptions and nutritional
      recommendations based on a maximum exercise stress test and a multi-day nutrition protocol.
      The intervention is accompanied by pedometers, heart rate sensors, blood glucose meters and
      smartphones as well as regular oral and written feedback.
