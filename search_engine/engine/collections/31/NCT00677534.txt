    
      The goals of this study are to elucidate the function of extrarenal 1 alpha-hydroxylase
      activity in the setting of renal failure and to evaluate the role of nutritional vitamin D
      deficiency as a potential contributor to monocyte-associated inflammatory pathways in
      patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). This study will consist of patients on chronic
      maintenance hemodialysis three times per week who have been identified to have nutritional
      vitamin D deficiency. After consent for study enrollment, patients will undergo a 4 week
      washout period of all active vitamin D supplementation. After washout is complete, an blood
      sample will be obtained for baseline 25(OH)D levels and monocyte isolation for analysis by
      flow cytometry. Patients will then be started on cholecalciferol 50,000 IU twice weekly for 8
      weeks. 25-vitamin D levels will be monitored midway through the treatment phase of the study
      and dosing adjusted as further described in detail within the protocol section. An additional
      blood sample will be drawn post-therapy for repeat 25(OH)D levels and monocyte isolation for
      flow cytometry analysis.
