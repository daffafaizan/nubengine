      mg administered intravenously every 2 weeks in adult hyperuricemic patients with gout
      refractory to conventional therapy. Study duration is approximately 63 weeks, including 51
      weeks of treatment and 12 weeks of follow-up.

      The design of this study follows the FDA-approved Full Prescribing Information for the use of
      pegloticase and allows for capturing additional data related to the safety and efficacy of
      pegloticase within the standard healthcare setting.
