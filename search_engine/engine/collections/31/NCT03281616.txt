      patients were instructed in a 12-week diet that was reduced by in caloric content by at least
      30% based on calorimetric measurements of 24 h resting energy expenditure and estimated
      additional expenditures by diet- and activity-induced thermogenesis. Before and after the
      diet, anthropometric measures and various MetS-associated blood parameters were determined.

      The subjects were not instructed in an exercise program. However, the subjects were advised
      on the value of increased physical activity. For additional motivation, effects were tested
      by an activity monitor. Therefore, in one of the arms, 24 hour locomotor activity and energy
      expenditure were determined by means of the SenseWear® MF armband (Body Media Inc., AliphCom
      dba Jawbone®, Pittsburgh, PA, U.S.A.). This device detects activity contest using
      accelerometers and assesses daily energy expenditure. For allocation of the subjects, a
      computer-generated list of random numbers was used. The randomization sequence was created
      using SPSS 18 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) statistical software and subjects were assigned
      to be tested or not for locomotor activity with a 1:1 allocation using random block sizes of
      2, 4, and 6.
