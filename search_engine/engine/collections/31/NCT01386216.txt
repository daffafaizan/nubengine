      and mortality despite conventional therapies. Modulation of angiogenesis is a promising
      alternative to surgical revascularization. Trials of isolated angiogenic growth factor
      therapies using recombinant proteins or gene transfer have been conducted, but with
      disappointing results because it is unlikely that a single angiogenic factor is solely or
      even primarily responsible for angiogenesis. Emerging stem cell therapies represent a new
      approach to the modulation of angiogenesis. Pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) hold
      promise because they can reproduce a pro-angiogenic milieu in the ischemic limb rather than
      upregulate a single angiogenic factor.

      For this CLI study, the MagellanÂ® System is utilized for the preparation of autologous cell
      concentrate at the point of care. The bone marrow aspirate is obtained from the patient and
      concentrated with the cell concentration kit, and delivered intramuscularly to the affected
      limb for the treatment of impaired ischemic tissue in order to improve perfusion, reduce pain
      and revascularize tissues in patients who have inadequate tissue blood flow, prohibitive
      medical comorbidities, or failed previous treatments for revascularization for the prevention
      of amputation.
