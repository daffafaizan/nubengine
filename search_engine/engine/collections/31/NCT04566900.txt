      gamma-neurofeedback (G-NFB) compared to a placebo (P-NFB) in individuals with MCI. 112
      consented participants will be randomized to receive G-NFB (n=56) or placebo-NFB (n=56)
      during 30-45 minute sessions twice per week for 12 weeks (24 total sessions). Memory and
      other cognitive domains will be measured using paper and pencil and computerized tests every
      4 weeks during the study and at 4 weeks post completion of study.
