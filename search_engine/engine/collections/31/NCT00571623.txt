      intracranial pressure (ICP). Because CPT is a normal part of the routine care provided to
      patients in the neurocritical care unit (NCU) this is an observational study of current
      practice.

        2. The study will include only patients who currently have intracranial pressure monitoring
           devices in place (intraventricular and intraparenchymal). The study will last 1-hour and
           all subjects in the study will receive 10-minutes of CPT. The 10-minute CPT episode will
           be randomly assigned to occur 10, 20, 30 or 40-minutes into the study.

        3. ANCOVA using SAS will be used to explore for within and between group differences in
           ICP. This study observes current standard practice, there are no additional risks to the
           subject.
