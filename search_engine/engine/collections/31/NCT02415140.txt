      Wong Tai Sin Hospital, Hong Kong SAR. Age and comorbidity-matched COPD and control subjects
      were recruited from clinics. Depressive symptoms were measured by a validated Chinese version
      of Geriatric Depression Scale short form (GDS - 15 items) with 2 cut-off points. A score of 8
      or above was considered significant depressive symptoms while the cut off score of 5 or above
      was for patients with mild depressive symptoms. Prevalence rates of depressive symptoms were
      measured in both COPD and control groups. Predictors for depression (GDS = or> 8) were
      determined using univariate and multivariate analysis.
