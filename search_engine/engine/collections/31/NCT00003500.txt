    
      Refractory or Recurrent Intermediate-Grade Stage II - IV Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma patients
      receive gradually escalating doses of intravenous Antineoplaston therapy (Atengenal +
      Astugenal) until the maximum tolerated dose is reached. Treatment continues up to12 months in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To determine the efficacy of Antineoplaston therapy in patients with Refractory or
           Recurrent Intermediate-Grade Stage II - IV Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma, as measured by an
           objective response to therapy (complete response, partial response or stable disease).

        -  To determine the safety and tolerance of Antineoplaston therapy in patients with
           Refractory or Recurrent Intermediate-Grade Stage II - IV Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma.

        -  To determine objective response, tumor size is measured utilizing physical examination,
           radiologic studies, and bone marrow biopsies as necessary, performed every 8 weeks for
           the first two years, every 3 months for the third and fourth years, every 6 months for
           the 5th and sixth years, and annually thereafter.
