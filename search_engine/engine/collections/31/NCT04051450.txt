    
      Aim: To examine the role of PD-L1/PD1 in immune cell-mediated cytotoxicity in colorectal
      cancer patients.

      Objectives: 1. Comprehensive investigation of PD-L1/PD1 in colorectal cancer in association
      with chemotherapy responses and immune activities; 2. Examine the functional role of
      PD-L1/PD1 targeting in immune cell-mediated cytotoxicity.

      Hypothesis: It is hypothesized that PD-L1/PD1 has pivotal role on the immune cell-mediated
      cytotoxicity in colorectal cancer.

      Significances: The current study will elucidate the significance of PD-L1/PD1 on
      chemo-resistance and the effect on immune cells and their functional properties. The study
      will enhance the understanding on chemotherapy response and immune evasion. The long-term
      goal is to provide the crucial information on oncoimmunology to improve efficacy of
      immunotherapy in cancer treatment.

      Subjects: Only those patients for whom colorectal cancer is the indicated clinical diagnosis
      will be recruited in the current study. Possible participants will be patients undergoing
      tumor resection or endoscopic examination at the Department of Surgery, Prince of Wales
      Hospital, Shatin, Hong Kong. Specimens will be collected from sixty-eight colorectal cancer
      patients. The estimated duration for collection of all the necessary samples will be two
      years. With at least one year of follow-up information, the proposed study should be
      completed in three years. For the current study, single blood sample (10 ml of peripheral
      blood in EDTA) will be drawn before the operation or endoscopic session. A small portion of
      the tumor and non-tumor tissue tissues from resected specimens or biopsy tissues will be
      collected for histological evaluation, primary culture and for comparison of the genetic and
      protein components in the blood specimen.
