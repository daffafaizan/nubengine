      stroke participants Group 1 of study participants will use the Manumeter with interactive
      functions to monitor and motivate upper extremity functional activity. Group 2 of study
      participants will use the Manumeter but receive no feedback and will be given the current
      standard-of-care, a booklet describing a home exercise program for increasing upper extremity
      exercise. The investigators hypothesize that study participants who interactively monitor
      functional activity with the Manumeter will improve their upper extremity function
      significantly more.
