      combination with RT and TMZ. This phase will follow a standard 3+3 dose design with the
      starting dose of BPM31510 at 110 mg/kg/week (wk), with 1 potential dose de-escalation to 66
      mg/kg/wk in the event a DLT is experienced at the 110 mg/kg dose. Toxicity at this dose level
      will be graded according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse
      Events version 5 (CTCAE v5). Subjects will be monitored for DLTs associated with combination
      therapy for 30 days (d) (± 5 d) after the end of RT (DLT assessment period). Subjects will
      continue to be monitored for late radiation-related DLTs during follow up, every 8 wk (± 2
      wk) during the first 12 months (mo), and then every 12 wk (± 2 wk) for a total of 5 years
      (y). Safety oversight will be provided by the independent Data and Safety Monitoring
      Committee (DSMC). The DSMC will review and confirm all DLT data, make recommendations for
      dose modifications, if necessary, and continue to monitor safety throughout the study. The
      efficacy phase of the study will begin after the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) has been
      confirmed.
