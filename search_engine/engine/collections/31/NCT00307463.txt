    
      This randomised, controlled and prospective study aims mainly to investigate the effects of
      two approaches to control blood pressure in hypertensive hemodialysis patients; using
      antihypertensive drugs versus persistent strict volume control without using antihypertensive
      drugs on cardiac structure (mainly left ventricular hypertrophy)and inflammation.

      We hypothesize that better blood pressure control and regression of left ventricular mass may
      be reached by a policy of strict volume control consisting of strict dietary salt restriction
      and persistent ultrafiltration.

      258 Hypertensive hemodialysis patients (BP>130/80 mmHg and/or being on antihypertensive
      medication) will be randomized to two arms:

      Group 1: Antihypertensive medicine will be stopped and strict volume control policy will be
      applied.

      Group 2: Antihypertensive medicine will be continued. Target BP will be 130/80 mmHg in both
      groups.

      The patients will be evaluated at 12 months for primary outcomes. Primary end-points are
      significant changes in left ventricular hypertrophy and left ventricular mass and significant
      change in left ventricular end-diastolic volume.

      Secondary end-points are changes in post-dialysis weight, changes in hematocrit, albumin, BNP
      and hsCRP levels.
