      Anaesthesia including choice of airway devices play an important role. Endotracheal
      intubation has long been regarded as the technique of choice for airway management in
      laparoscopic surgery. However, there is currently an emerging interest in laryngeal mask as
      the substitute for endotracheal tube in laparoscopic surgery.

      The increased abdominal pressure secondary to gas insufflation in Laparoscopic surgery
      demands a good supraglottic airway device with features of good seal, aspiration prevention
      and effective ventilation.

      Few studies have evaluated the performance Baska® Mask for various type of surgery and had
      obtained high "first-attempt" success rate, easy insertion and a good oropharyngeal leak
      pressure above 30cmH2O with low complications such as sorethroat, dysphonia and dysphagia.

      However, study regarding comparison of Baska® mask with endotracheal tube has not been
      carried out before. Therefore, the investigators would like to evaluate this novel device in
      comparison with endotracheal tube for laparoscopic surgery in our centre.

      This will be a prospective randomized controlled study in University Malaya Medical Centre to
      compare Baska® mask with the conventional laryngoscope-guided endotracheal intubation for
      laparoscopic surgeries.

      The investigators would like to study the efficacy of this device in term of : time to
      effective airway insertion, efficacy of airway seal, post-operation device of complications.
