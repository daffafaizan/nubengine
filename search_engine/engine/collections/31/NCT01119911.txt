      Recently, we have found that blood sampling via peripheral venous catheter used for fluid
      administration in children significantly reduces pain and, except for glucose, can replace
      venipuncture for determining complete blood count and basic chemistry analytics, including
      white and red blood cell counts, hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, mean corpuscular volume,
      mean corpuscular hemoglobin level, red blood cell distribution width, platelet count, mean
      platelet volume, and sodium, potassium, chloride, and urea levels (Berger-Achituv S,
      Budde-Schwartzman B. Ellis MH, Shenkman Z. Erez I. Blood Sampling through Peripheral Venous
      Catheters for Selected Basic Analytes in Children. Pediatrics. In press).

      The goal of this study is to investigate whether blood sampling via peripheral venous
      catheter used for fluid administration can significantly reduces pain and replace
      venipuncture for determining complete blood count and basic chemistry analytics in infants
      under 2 years of age.
