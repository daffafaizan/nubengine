    
      The primary purpose of this study is to continue to provide clinical follow-up for
      ADA-deficient patients treated with gene therapy under the original protocol 90-HG-0195 (IND
      3624) and its amendments (IND 4647 and IND 5056). The objectives are the long-term monitoring
      of the beneficial effects of gene therapy and continued surveillance of potential adverse
      effects associated with the gene transfer procedures.

      No new subjects will be enrolled in this protocol.
