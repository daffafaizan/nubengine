      healthy adult male and female travelers for whom typhoid vaccination with Vivotif is
      recommended, as per standard practice.

      The study will enroll 950 subjects who will be randomized at a ratio of 1:1 into two groups,
      A and B, of 475 subjects each. Group A will receive 6.9-10.0 x109 CFU/capsule and Group B
      will receive 4.0-6.8 x109 CFU/capsule, respectively.

      All subjects will receive four doses of Vivotif. One dose per subject will be administered on
      Days 1, 3, 5 and 7.

      Investigators, subjects and all personnel involved in running the study will not be aware of
      the actual release titer associated with the distributed lots. Blinding is maintained using
      the commercial packaging that does not include the actual value of the release titer.
