      Despite available therapies, the disease remains uniformly fatal and participants who have
      received prior lenalidomide and bortezomib have a median overall survival of 9 months.

      Combination therapy is often used in clinical practice. In an attempt to overcome drug/clone
      resistance, other report with pomalidomide, dexamethasone and cyclophosphamide (PomCyDex)
      show efficacy and safety information, regimen for refractory myeloma patients with higher
      overall response rate than pomalidomide and dexamethasone.

      In this case a phase II trial scheme is proposed: 1. Pomalidomide at 4 mg orally on days 1-21
      of a 28 day cycle, 2. Cyclophosphamide 300 mg IV on days 1 and 15 of a 28 day cycle; and 3.
      Dexamethasone 40 mg PO weekly. Participants who were >75 years of age or those who were known
      to be intolerant to 40 mg weekly dexamethasone are going to receive 20 mg dexamethasone on
      the same schedule.

      Pomalidomide is a drug wide studied in American and European population, but not in MÃ©xico.
      Even it has been approved by local Regulatory authority, there is not any trial supporting
      data about safety and efficacy in Mexican population. Alkylating agents are very active in
      MM, and in combination with novel therapies, such as immunomodulatory drugs, has shown to
      enhance efficacy in relapsed/refractory setting.

      It is proposed phase 2 study to assess safety and efficacy of treatment with Pomalidomide in
      combination with Cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone in a sample of Mexican RRMM participants
      from ISSSTE.
