      cases, and the mortality rate is higher, compare to patients with ARF alone (70% vs 45%).
      Clinical and experimental studies demonstrated the key role of apoptosis, or programmed cell
      death, in the induction of tubular and glomerular injury in the course of sepsis. Indeed, it
      has been shown that inflammatory cytokines and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) cause renal tubular
      cell apoptosis via Fas- and caspase-mediated pathways. In addition, LPS is able to alter the
      normal expression pattern of sodium, urea and glucose renal transporters and to modulate
      tubular polarity by changing the expression of tight junction proteins with consequent
      back-leakage of tubular fluid in the interstitial spaces and enhancement of the inflammatory
      process. Therefore a novel extracorporeal therapy to remove circulating LPS, using the
      Polymyxin-B fiber (PMX-B) cartridge was developed. The PMX-B cartridge is an extracorporeal
      hemoperfusion device and consists of a polystyrene-based, fibrous adsorbent on which the
      polymyxin B antibiotic is covalently immobilized as a ligand to adsorb endotoxin.

      Aim of this study is to verify whether the removal of LPS, using the PMX-B hemoperfusion
      system, protects from acute renal failure, reduces the need for Renal Replacement Therapy
      (RRT) and consequently improves the outcome in severe sepsis from gram negative infection.
