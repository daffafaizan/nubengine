      I. Demonstrate that our image-guided interstitial photodynamic therapy (I-PDT) dosimetry
      system can be used to tailor this therapy to individual patients.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive porfimer sodium intravenously (IV) over 3-5 minutes on day 0. Patients then
      undergo image-guided I-PDT on day 2.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 1 month, 2 months, 4 months, and then
      every 2 months for up to 12 months.
