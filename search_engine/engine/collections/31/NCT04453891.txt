      to generate quantifiable information regarding the feasibility of a virtual trial with the
      Hexoskin Platform, collection of data quality in COVID-19 patients, and values for algorithm
      construction. In essence, sixteen participants with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis will be
      invited to wear the Hexoskin biometric garment during the course of several hours per week,
      over a period of 28 days. In addition to the biometric data collection, participants will be
      invited to complete four questionnaires. The biometric data will be combined to the
      sociodemographic information and patient symptomatology to construct an algorithm which can
      accurately predict patient outcomes.
