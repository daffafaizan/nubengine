    
      Keratoplasty, also known as corneal transplantation, is a surgical procedure in which a
      damaged or diseased cornea is replaced entirely (penetrating keratoplasty) or partially
      (lamellar keratoplasty) by a donated corneal graft. The postoperative refractive error,
      post-keratoplasty astigmatism particularly is one of the most important factors that
      contribute to poor visual outcome following successful keratoplasty. This study is to inquiry
      the contrast sensitivity function in the keratoplasty patients with quick contrast
      sensitivity function (quick CSF), as well the relationship between visual quality.

      50 eyes of 50 keratopathy patients with corneal transplantation more than 1 year were
      included in this study. All participants underwent an ophthalmic examination that included
      slit-lamp biomicroscopy, visual acuity, quick CSF under full optical correction, 9-SF life
      quality questionnaire and fundus examination. Then the normal group would be covered by the
      positive spherical lens of 1.0D to 6.0D to repress the BCVA to 0.1 to 0.9 respectively to
      compare the visual functions with the keratoplasty patients on the same visual acuity.
