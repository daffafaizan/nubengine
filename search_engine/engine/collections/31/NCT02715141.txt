      has been implemented. Screening will increase the demand for surveillance. However, solid
      evidence on the reduction of death from CRC through the current colonoscopy-based
      surveillance is lacking. Furthermore, colonoscopy-based surveillance leads to high logistic
      demands, high patient burden and high costs. Therefore, there is need for new surveillance
      strategies. Stool-based molecular testing (Cologuard®) or Faecal Immunochemical Testing (FIT)
      may serve as an alternative for colonoscopy surveillance.

      OBJECTIVES:

        1. To compare the accuracy of an established molecular stool test (Cologuard®) and FIT to
           colonoscopy for detection of advanced adenomas or CRC (advanced neoplasia) in a
           surveillance population.

        2. To model various strategies of stool-based molecular surveillance to inform health
           policy decisions.

      MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this prospective observational cross-sectional cohort study,
      individuals aged 50-75 years that are scheduled for surveillance colonoscopy will be invited
      to participate. They are asked to collect a whole-stool sample prior to the surveillance
      colonoscopy. The sample will be used to test for the presence of molecular stool markers. The
      results of the molecular stool test and FIT will be compared to the colonoscopy findings.

      EXPECTED RESULTS: Frequent surveillance using stool-based molecular testing is more
      cost-effective than the current colonoscopy-based surveillance.
