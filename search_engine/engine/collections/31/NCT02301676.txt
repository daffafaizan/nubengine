      60 year are particularly affected for postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) (26-41%).
      The patients experiencing POCD are at an increased risk of death in the first year after
      surgery. So, POCD is important because it can influence to patient's quality of life.

      In the investigator's hospital, laparoscopic cholecystectomy is performed with increasing
      frequency in aging patients. So the investigator's study will be conducted in elderly
      patients during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The anesthetic methods are divided into the
      following 3 kinds: sevoflurane, propofol, dexmedetomidine. These anesthetic drugs are used in
      general anesthesia generally. The control group include a spouse of the patient which must be
      older than 60 year and does not have anesthetic history.

      After the surgery, the patients are discharged from the hospital, the investigators will
      check the postoperative cognitive function 4 times: 1week, 3months, 6months, 1 year later
      using the Korean version of telephone interview for cognitive status (TICS). The Korean
      version of TICS was validated tool for examination of cognitive function and this tool and
      mini-mental state examination (MMSE) be linked directly. The test will be administered to
      spouse simultaneously by telephone.

      Sample size was calculated for the primary outcome parameters (whether long-term
      postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is occured after general anesthesia), and the
      investigators hypothesized that two groups are in this study, one group is for postanesthetic
      patients, another is for their spouses. Total sample size was calculated to 190.
