    
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the efficacy, in terms of disease-free
      survival (DFS), the use of HIPEC treatment combined with standard care (PDS or IDS) or
      standard care alone (PDS or IDS alone).

      Secondary objectives of the study include:

        -  Evaluating the efficacy of HIPEC in terms of overall survival (OS) in combination with
           standard of care

        -  Evaluating the morbidity associated with HIPEC.

        -  Evaluating the trade-off between efficacy and morbidity using the Q-TWiST approach.

        -  Evaluating the impact of HIPEC in terms of quality of life.

      Exploratory objectives (optional) include:

        -  Evaluating the impact of HIPEC on the count of residual viable cells (evaluated by flow
           cytometry) in abdominal drainage fluids for patients recruited in Centre Oscar Lambret
           only.

        -  Constituting a biobank (tumoral samples and blood samples) for future translational
           researches
