      traditionally been referred for cardiac surgery to widen the left ventricular (LV) outflow
      tract. More recently, percutaneous transluminal septal ablation (PTSA) has also been shown to
      thin the subvalvular septum and thereby to reduce LV outflow pressure gradients and to
      improve symptoms in obstructive HCM. However, this procedure is not infrequently limited by
      septal coronary artery anatomy and inability to identify and cannulate the appropriate artery
      that supplies the septal region of interest. Some attempts are also associated with coronary
      artery dissection, particularly, if there is associated coronary artery disease. A
      trans-right ventricular (RV) alcohol septal ablation (TRVASA) would significantly simplify
      the procedure, and increase its safety. The purpose of this study is to initially test our
      ability to visualize and guide a delivery catheter to a targeted part of the anterior
      interventricular septum involved in the generation of the LV outflow obstruction using
      intracardiac echocardiography (ICE). No therapy is intended: alcohol will not be injected
      into the septum in this initial study.
