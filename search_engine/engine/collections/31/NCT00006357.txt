      patients with refractory or recurrent soft tissue sarcoma. II. Determine the pharmacokinetic
      profile of this treatment regimen in these patients. III. Determine the objective response
      and duration of response in these patients with this treatment regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation and dose efficacy, multicenter study. In the dose efficacy
      portion, patients are stratified according to disease type (gastrointestinal stromal tumor vs
      all other soft tissue sarcomas). Phase I: Patients receive oral STI571 daily for a maximum of
      24 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-8
      patients receive escalating doses of STI571 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is
      determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which 2 of 6-8 patients experience dose
      limiting toxicities. The recommended phase II dose is defined as the dose preceding the MTD.
      Phase II: Patients receive the recommended phase II dose of STI571 as in phase I. Patients
      are followed every 8 weeks until disease progression, and then every 16 weeks thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 47-72 patients (7-32 in phase I and 40 in phase II) will be
      accrued for this study.
