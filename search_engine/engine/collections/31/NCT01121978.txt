      Chinese.

      Choroidal neovascularization is well-noted cause of VA deterioration, but nowadays, with
      improvement of diagnostic tools, such as OCT, VA deterioration from myopic tractional
      maculopathy is being concerned as well.

      But till now, the necessity of early vitrectomy on MTM is controversial. By now some
      clinicians prefer conservative treatment, which means pars plana vitrectomy would be
      postponed till structural change such as macular hole formation is noticed. And the others
      prefer early vitrectomy, which means pars plana vitrectomy should be performed when the
      symptom begins.

      In this study, investigators try to verify the validity of early vitrectomy comparing
      conservative treatment.
