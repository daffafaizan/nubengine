    
      This study is to be conducted in 2 phases, a dose escalation phase and a cohort expansion
      phase. Dose escalation will be completed using a modified 3+3 study design with up to 4
      Cohorts of increasing doses in MBq/kg. Pre-defined Dose Limiting Toxicities will be monitored
      for 6 weeks post administration of 67Cu-SARTATE. Once either the MTD for a single
      administration of 67Cu-SARTATE is established, or Cohort 4 has been completed, the study will
      be expanded to enroll an additional 10 subjects who will receive 2 therapy cycles of
      67Cu-SARTATE at the MTD dose level.
