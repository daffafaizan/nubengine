    
      The trial is designed to investigate the specificity of C-Tb under various definitions of
      cut-off in a double blind randomised, split-body study comparing 0.1 µg/0.1 mL C-Tb with the
      reference agent 2 T.U. Tuberculin PPD RT23 SSI. (Each volunteer receives the C-Tb agent in
      one arm and the 2 T.U. Tuberculin PPD in the other arm).

      The C-Tb and 2 T.U. Tuberculin PPD agents are given concomitantly to each volunteer in the
      RIGHT AND LEFT forearm according to a double blind randomisation scheme.

      The primary objective of the trial is to assess the specificity of the C-Tb test as a
      function of the cut-off value (i.e., the smallest size of induration measured in mm resulting
      in a negative outcome of the C-Tb test) when the test is administered intradermally by the
      Mantoux technique to healthy BCG vaccinated adults The specificity of the C-Tb test is
      defined as the relative frequency of subjects in a healthy population (i.e., no exposure to
      MTb) who have an induration response < cut-off after a C-Tb test.

      Similarly the sensitivity is defined as the relative frequency of patients with an induration
      response ≥ cut-off in TB patients.

      An optimal cut-off point of being infected will be determined by combing the results from the
      present specificity study with those from a parallel sensitivity study in patients recently
      diagnosed with TB.

      The secondary objectives of the trial are to compare the induration response of C-Tb with the
      induration response of 2 T.U. Tuberculin PPD RT 23 SSI, to compare the induration response of
      C-Tb with the in-vitro IFN-γ response measured at screening and 28 days after the injections
      of the skin test agents using the QuantiFERON®-TB Gold In-Tube assay and finally to record
      all adverse events occurring within 28 days after application of the agents.
