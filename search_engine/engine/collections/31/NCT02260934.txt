    
      Lupus nephritis is a severe form of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with active disease in
      the kidneys. SLE is a complex disease in which the body's own immune system attacks some of
      the body parts: the skin, the joints, the kidneys, the nervous system, the heart, the lungs
      and the blood. The cause of SLE is not known. Treatment for SLE usually involves drugs that
      are designed to block the immune system attacks. When SLE affects the kidneys (nephritis),
      stronger immune suppressing treatment is usually needed.

      The drugs used in treatment of lupus nephritis often do not cure the disease and can cause
      serious side effects, including lowering the immune system too much. When the immune system
      is too low, a person is at a higher risk of getting infections. Therefore, research into new
      treatments with fewer serious side effects is needed for lupus nephritis.
