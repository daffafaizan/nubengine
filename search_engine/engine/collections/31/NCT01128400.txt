           fat in humans.

           Hypothesis: Orally applied Orlistat will increase detection thresholds of TAGs but not
           FFA in humans.

           To test this hypothesis we will measure triolein (a TAG) and oleic acid (a FFA) taste
           detection thresholds with a three-alternative forced-choice (3-AFC) ascending
           concentration method under two conditions (Orlistat day vs. Control day). To control for
           olfactory input, subjects will be assessed wearing noseclips.

        2. Determine the effect of CD36 variants on fat taste perception in humans. Hypothesis:
           SNPs that associate with reduced CD36 expression will be associated with higher FFA and
           TAG detection thresholds

      To test this hypothesis we will measure triolein and oleic acid taste detection thresholds in
      subjects who carry of the common CD36 e-SNP rs1761667 (i.e. a SNP that significantly reduces
      CD36 level and has a minor allele frequency of 38-48%). We expect subjects who are at least
      heterozygous for the expression reducing allele to have higher triolein and oleic acid taste
      detection thresholds compared to non-carrier subjects.
