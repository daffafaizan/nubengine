      fatty acid oxidation on insulin resistance in humans. Mitochondrial dysfunction has been
      implicated in the development of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes during excess dietary
      fat intake and from increased release of endogenous free fatty acids , such as occurs in
      obesity. Controversy exists, however, as to whether this insulin resistance results from
      intrinsic defects in mitochondrial energy utilization or from abnormalities resulting from
      excess free fatty acid flux, as well as the role that subsequent accumulation of cellular
      metabolic intermediates play in impaired insulin signaling.

      To address these controversies, the investigators will study a unique population of patients
      with inherited defects in each of the three mitochondrial enzymes in the fatty acid oxidation
      pathway: 1) very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (VLCAD); 2) trifunctional protein (TFP,
      which includes long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (LCHAD)); and 3) medium-chain
      acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD). These proteins are required for the oxidation of sequentially
      shorter fatty acids . The investigators will test the hypothesis that intrinsic defects in
      mitochondrial function involving oxidation of long-chain, but not medium-chain, fatty acids
      are sufficient to prevent intralipid-induced insulin resistance.
