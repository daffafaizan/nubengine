      whereas only 3-10% is in the free state. Salivary free cortisol (SC) is an index of plasma
      free cortisol. In previous studies it was shown that in low-dose cosyntropin stimulation
      test, SC increases significantly in normal but not in hypoadrenal patients. It was suggested
      that dynamic assessment of the SC response to ACTH may be particularly helpful whenever the
      measurement of serum cortisol is complicated by increased or decreased CBG levels.

      Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a rare malignancy with a heterogeneous presentation and a
      variable but generally poor prognosis. Mitotane is the main drug for ACC treatment and it
      plays a role both in adjuvant treatment after complete resection and in recurrent, inoperable
      and/or metastatic ACC. Mitotane blocks adrenocortical steroid synthesis and also exerts a
      specific cytotoxic effect on adrenocortical cells. Mitotane induces adrenal insufficiency,
      requiring hydrocortisone replacement therapy. In mitotane treated patients, serum cortisol
      cannot be used to diagnose hypoadrenalism, since mitotane increases CBG levels, artificially
      raising total cortisol. SC is not affected by CBG alterations, and reflects the free serum
      cortisol and may be more accurate in diagnosing hypoadrenalism in mitotane treated patients.

      In the current study, investigators will assess serum and SC responses during low-dose
      cosyntropin stimulation test in healthy volunteers, mitotane-induced hypoadrenal patients on
      steroid replacement therapy and in patients who suffer from hypoadrenlism caused from any
      other etiology. Investigators will compare results between groups and try to demonstrate the
      superiority of SC in assessing adrenal function in mitotane treated patients.
