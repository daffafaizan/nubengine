    
      This is a randomized, parallel group clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of two protocols
      of repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS), the application will be over
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) right and left, in patients with borderline
      personality disorder. 40 ambulatory patients with a borderline personality disorder diagnosis
      from the National Institute of Psychiatry in MÃ©xico will be included. All Patients will be
      randomly assigned and will complete a total of 23 sessions rTMS, in any of two groups:

      5 Hz Group.- This group will receive rTMS sessions, 5 per week during three weeks (acute
      treatment phase), and after that, one session a week for the next eight weeks (follow up).
      The rTMS will be applied over the left DLPFC at 5 Hz, 1500 pulses per session in 100% of
      Motor threshold

      1 Hz Group.- This group will receive rTMS sessions, 5 per week during three weeks (acute
      treatment phase), and after that, one session a week for the next eight weeks (follow up).

      The rTMS will be applied over the right DLPFC at 1 Hz, 900 pulses per session in 100% of
      Motor threshold All sessions will be applied with a "Dantec" transcranial magnetic
      stimulator. The affective, borderline and anxiety symptoms will be evaluated at baseline, and
      every 5 TMS sessions during the acute treatment phase, and once at the end of the 8-weeks
      follow up. In same form for neuropsychological evaluations .

      Categorical variables will be described by percentages and frequencies. Continuous variables
      will be described by means and standard deviations. Treatment groups will be compared using
      Student's T test. Cognitive, anxiety, borderline and affective symptom scale scores between
      treatment groups will be compared using repeated measures ANOVA
