      I. Determine the sensitivity and specificity of next generation sequencing for the detection
      of esophageal cancer from esophageal sponge cytology specimens.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the ability of next generation gene sequencing (NGS) of esophageal sponge
      samples to collect an adequate sample to detect mutations that are present in the underlying
      tissue.

      II. Determine the cost associated with esophageal cytology with next generation genome
      sequencing as a screening tool.

      III. Continue to collect safety and tolerability data related to the use of the Oesotest
      esophageal sponge.

      IV. Determine the limitations of esophageal sponge cytology and future needs to improve this
      technique.

      V. Use the data collected to design a larger screening trial to determine the ability of
      esophageal cytology with next generation sequencing to screen for esophageal cancer in the
      general population.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo cytology specimen collection procedure using a swallowable sponge cell
      sampling device.
