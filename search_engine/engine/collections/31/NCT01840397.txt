      can be traced by monitoring serum levels of neuromarkers is not yet answered. This study has
      its background from other studies on patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI), in whom
      elevated serum levels of the two neuromarkers S-100B and NSE are associated with injury
      severity, neuronal damage, brain, tissue damage, and outcome. Patients undergoing spine
      surgery with or without pre-existing traumatic neurologic symptoms are planned to be the
      study cohort. Pre- and postoperatively the serum levels of S-100B and NSE are obtained and
      are statistically compared with patients undergoing other types of bone-related surgery.
