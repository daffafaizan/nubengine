    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To compare progression free survival (PFS) among participants with Schlafen family member
      11 (SLFN11) positive extensive stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) randomized to
      atezolizumab or atezolizumab plus talazoparib as maintenance therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare overall survival (OS) between the arms. II. To compare objective response rate
      (ORR) among participants with measurable disease between the arms, including complete
      response (CR) and partial response (PR) (confirmed and unconfirmed) by Response Evaluation
      Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1.

      III. To evaluate the frequency and severity of adverse events within each treatment arm.

      TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE OBJECTIVE:

      I. To bank specimens for future correlative studies.

      OUTLINE: Patients are screened for SLFN11 biomarker during Step 1: Screening Registration by
      submitting tumor tissue to MDACC. Patients with SLFN11 biomarker are registered to Step 2:
      Randomization and are randomized to 1 or 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive atezolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30-60 minutes on day 1. Cycles
      repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive atezolizumab IV over 30-60 minutes on day 1 and talazoparib orally
      (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21. Cycles repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for 2 years and
      at the end of 3 years from randomization.
