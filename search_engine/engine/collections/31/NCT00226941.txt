    
      Part of the treatment plan for this study is surgical removal of the tumor that is planned to
      occur 6 to 8 weeks after completion of radiotherapy (XRT). This study consists of 2 distinct
      phases (Phase 1 and Phase 2).

      In Phase 1, the objectives are to

        1. Assess dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) and

        2. Determine a maximum-tolerated dose (MTD)

      The Phase 1 endpoints are assessed on an initial cohort of patients after the completion of
      the chemo-radiotherapy regimen at defined timepoints that precede surgery.

      Phase 2 is the efficacy assessment portion of this study. In Phase 2, the objective is to
      accrue an expansion cohort. Efficacy assessments for phase 2 are to be assessed across all
      study participants at the time of, or after, surgery, as measured by the pathologic response
      rate; downstaging; and survival at 5 years from the start of treatment.
