      as surgeon satisfaction (surgeon being blinded to positioning). Patients will be allocated to
      either a hyperlordotic or a standard positioning group by computer generated randomization.
      Surgeons will perform all of their standard techniques to promote lordosis with
      instrumentation. Adult patients, ages 18-65, undergoing lumbar surgical fusion will be asked
      to participate.
