      arrest survivors using guideline-recommended prognostic assessment tools with central
      adjudication of results, while avoiding premature withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy
      (WLST). The investigators will prospectively collect data on demographics, premorbid
      characteristics, details of cardiac arrest and resuscitation, post-cardiac arrest care,
      detailed neurological examination findings, electrophysiologic studies, chemical biomarkers
      and neuroimaging at standardized time points, and will assess functional outcomes at
      discharge, 6- and 12-month follow-up, as well as annually up to 5 years. The international
      cohort will have a derivation subset that will be used to create a multimodal outcome
      prediction model (using regression analysis), which will then be confirmed by the validation
      subset. A substudy of MOCHA will also explore the impact of the practice of WLST in the
      prediction model by analyzing its performance in a pooled cohort of subjects unexposed to
      WLST originating from countries where this practice is not common.
