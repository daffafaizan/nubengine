      was calculated using Minitab version 15. 36 Participants recruited from patients attending
      the Department of Orthodontics and Dentofacial Orthopedics at Damascus University with class
      II division 1 malocclusion that indicates the extraction of first maxillary premolars will be
      randomly assigned into one of three groups: Low-Level Laser Therapy (LLLT) group, flapless
      corticopuncture group, or control group. Titanium mini-implants (1.6 mm diameter and 7 mm
      length) will be inserted between the maxillary second premolar and first molar at
      approximately 8-10 mm height above the archwires below the mucogingival junction. After
      complete leveling and alignment of the maxillary dental arch, which will be defined by
      passive insertion of 19*25 inch S.S. archwire, the retraction stage of the six maxillary
      anterior teeth will begin.
