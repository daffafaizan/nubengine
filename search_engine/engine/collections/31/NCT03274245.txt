      use in rural Odisha India. The present study builds off of previous research, which resulted
      in the design of an intervention to increase latrine use. This research evaluates the
      intervention designed to determine if significant increases in latrine use are observed among
      those who received the intervention compared to those that did not. Qualitative research will
      supplement trial data collection to help explain findings and understand perceptions of the
      intervention.

      For trial data collection, household members will be engaged in a survey that asks questions
      about the household, the latrine use practices of their family members, and may include
      additional questions about social norms attitudes, and other factors influencing latrine use.

      Investigators will carry out two discrete qualitative research activities both digitally
      recorded: in depth interviews (IDIs) and focus group discussions (FGDs). Topics to be covered
      during the qualitative research include: perceptions of the intervention, reasons for
      using/not using latrines, motivations for sanitation behaviors.

      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate a multi-level, theoretically informed
      intervention designed to increase latrine use for defecation among all members of households
      that currently own a latrine.
