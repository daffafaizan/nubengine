      stem cells may prove useful for the treatment of a variety of diseases including diabetes and
      other systemic diseases. In the hematopoietic system, recent studies have also demonstrated
      the ability of adult erythroid stem cells to undergo differentiation toward a fetal-like
      phenotype. This fetal-like phenotype is crucial in eliminating the clinical sequelae of
      sickle syndromes and beta hemoglobinopathies. However, additional studies are needed to
      determine if these results can be applied to patients with diseases involving hematopoietic
      stem cells or other blood cells. In addition, it is clear that the stem cells from separate
      donors do not possess identical properties of growth and differentiation.

      The immediate aim of this protocol is to obtain hematopoietic stem cells from many human
      donors for examination of the biological properties of those cells. The study is also
      designed to determine if the donor-specific factors can influence the properties of their
      hematopoietic stem cells. Each volunteer will undergo stem cell mobilization after
      administration of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) for five consecutive days
      followed by a large volume apheresis on the 5th day after G-CSF injection. The harvested
      product will be purified for the primitive hematopoietic progenitor cells and viably
      preserved in multiple aliquots. The cells will then be studied in-depth for a better
      understanding of their biological properties, growth and differentiation. Donor-specific
      information will be correlated with these research studies to identify factors that may
      assist with the understanding of adult stem cell biology.
