    
      Participants are parents of children with ASD and anxiety between the ages of 6-10.

      We will recruit 30 families. Recruitment takes place through social media, the Autism Center
      of Hebrew University, lab contacts and community partnerships. Participants are parents of
      young children between the ages of 6-10, where the child has a recognized diagnosis of ASD by
      Ministry of Health, Social Security or Ministry of Education, average (or above) cognition as
      per parent report and communication as measured by ABAS, and anxiety as measured by SCARED.
      Parents of children who have other relevant neurological or medical conditions will be
      excluded. Participants will be asked to provide a copy of the latest diagnosis prior to
      participation. Measures (attached) will be administered prior to the intervention, at the
      conclusion and again 2 months later. Participants will complete questionnaires online
      (Qualtrics). Treatment sessions will be held on ZOOM and certain sessions will be taped for
      supervision purposes.

      The program is designed to reduce child anxiety symptoms, parent stress and family
      accommodation. Parents are likely to gain important skills and experience an increase in
      feelings of self-efficacy. The SPACE program is parent-based and is applicable in cases where
      children are not cooperative, and if proven to be effective in the ASD population, could
      serve not only as an alternative treatment but also as a primary intervention in the context
      of ASD..
