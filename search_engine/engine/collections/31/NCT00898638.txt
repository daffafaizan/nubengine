        -  Maintain and update a clinical database pertaining to diagnosis and treatment outcome of
           patients with head and neck cancer.

        -  Develop a repository of biospecimens from these patients.

      OUTLINE: Tumor tissue samples and/or bronchial washings are collected from patients
      undergoing planned surgery and/or bronchoscopy, respectively. Buccal swabs and/or mouthwash
      samples and saliva samples are collected. Patients also undergo blood sample collection at
      baseline and then every 2-6 months thereafter.

      Healthy participants contribute blood samples, buccal swabs, and mouthwash samples at
      baseline only.

      Information about medical and family history and cancer risk factors is also collected.
