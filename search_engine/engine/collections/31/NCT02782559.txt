      thirty-four weeks of gestation, expectant management is the standard practice in stable
      patients with the goal of extending pregnancy and therefore decreasing the risk of adverse
      outcomes in the premature neonate. Our aim was to assess the efficacy of Sildenafil, a
      phosphodiesterase inhibitor, versus placebo, in addition to expectant management, for the
      treatment of preterm preeclampsia to prolong pregnancy.
