      in extensive posterior spine fusion surgery for idiopathic scoliosis. Methadone 0.2 mg/kg
      will be given to the treatment group. Postoperative evaluation for narcotic use, pain
      control, and adverse effects will be compared to a standard treatment approach used at
      Children's Hospital of Wisconsin.
