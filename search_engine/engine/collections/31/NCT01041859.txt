    
      This is a randomized-withdrawal (only patients that have an initial response to tapentadol
      are assigned to either tapentadol or placebo), placebo-controlled, multicenter study
      evaluating the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of orally administered tapentadol, using
      the extended release tamper-resistant formulation (TRF), at dosages of 100 to 250 mg twice
      daily in patients with moderate to severe pain due to chronic, painful DPN. The study
      consists of 1) an open-label (all people involved know the identity of the intervention)
      phase, including a 13-day screening period, a 5-day washout period (where patients are to
      stop taking their pain medication), a 3-day pre-titration pain-intensity evaluation period
      (where patients will record their pain intensity twice daily in the morning and evening), and
      a 3-week, open-label titration period (all patients receive tapentadol study drug), 2) a
      12-week, double-blind (neither physician nor patient knows the name of the assigned drug)
      maintenance phase, and 3) a posttreatment phase of approximately 10 to 14 days. The study
      will evaluate the effectiveness of orally administered tapentadol ER versus placebo in
      reducing patients' pain intensity. The pain intensity will be assessed by comparing the
      baseline pain level to the level at week 12 of the maintenance phase. The total duration of
      study drug treatment for each patient will be approximately 15 weeks. Safety and tolerability
      will be evaluated by vital signs, physical examinations, clinical laboratory tests, 12-lead
      electrocardiograms (ECGs), standardized neurologic examinations, and monitoring of adverse
      events. Patients will be titrated on tapentadol ER from a starting dose of 50 mg twice daily
      to the patient's optimal dose ranging between 100 mg and 250 mg twice a day, or placebo. All
      doses of study medication will be taken orally with approximately 120 ml of water with or
      without food for a maximum timeframe of 15 weeks.
