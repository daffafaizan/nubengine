      acid synthesis lack the enzymes needed to synthesize the primary bile acids cholic acid and
      chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA). These conditions are serious and account for approximately 1%
      of cases presenting as idiopathic cholestatic liver disease. The liver disease associated
      with these inborn errors in bile acid synthesis is progressive and, if untreated, may lead to
      death from cirrhosis and liver failure.

      Monotherapy with cholic acid is considered the most appropriate therapeutic strategy to treat
      inborn errors in bile acid synthesis because it provides a stimulus for bile flow and
      inhibits endogenous production and accumulation of potentially hepatotoxic and cholestatic
      bile acid precursors, while additionally facilitating the absorption of fats and fat-soluble
      vitamins. At therapeutic doses, adverse effects are not generally observed and as such,
      cholic acid has become the treatment of choice at the Cincinnati Children's Hospital since
      1994.

      This study will bridge data on the effectiveness of a standardized manufactured preparation
      to data obtained from patients originally treated with the currently used cholic acid
      capsules formulated in the CCHMC Pharmacy before being switched to the manufactured
      preparation.
