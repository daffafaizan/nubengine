    
      This evaluator-blinded, randomized, 12-week parallel-group controlled trial compares
      Nicorette® Freshmint gum versus Nicorette® Microtab in healthy smokers who are motivated to
      quit smoking and who have visible staining of teeth.

      The trial is comprised of five visits (baseline, Weeks 1, 2, 6, and 12). At baseline,
      subjects will be provided with a standardized toothpaste and toothbrush; use of any other
      oral hygiene or tooth-whitening product is prohibited. At all visits after baseline, smoking
      status and use of study treatment will be checked. Teeth staining and teeth shade will be
      rated at baseline and at 2, 6 and 12 Weeks using the Modified Lobene Stain Index and the
      Vita® Shade Guide, respectively.
