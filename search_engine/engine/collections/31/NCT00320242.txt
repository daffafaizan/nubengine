      with daily functioning and quality of life and often results in falls that potentially can
      inflict serious injury. In recent years, much more attention has been focused on the clinical
      characteristics of gait freezing, the severity of falls that can result, and the use of
      visual cues as a possible treatment in order to understand the implications of episodic
      freezing. Few clinical studies have been done to confirm the clinical observations to date.
      The laser cane is a device that has been used and prescribed in movement disorder centers as
      the only form of treatment for freezing of gait. Although it has been shown to be effective
      in many cases, there is no published data to support what has been observed in the clinic.
      The proposed study seeks to clarify unanswered questions regarding the laser cane and its
      efficacy in aiding with episodic gait freezing and falls.
