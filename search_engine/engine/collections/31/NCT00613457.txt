        -  Compare the relative efficacy of induction therapy comprising dexamethasone or
           prednisone, in terms of a higher rate of event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival
           and a reduced rate of relapse, in pediatric patients with intermediate-risk or high-risk
           acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).

        -  Compare the relative safety of a reduced-intensity reintensification regimen comprising
           dexamethasone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and anthracyclines vs a standard treatment
           regimen in pediatric patients with standard-risk ALL identified by fast clearance of
           leukemic cells.

        -  Compare the efficacy of a second delayed reintensification regimen vs standard
           reintensification therapy, in terms of improved EFS, in pediatric patients with
           intermediate-risk ALL.

        -  Compare the efficacy of extended reintensification therapy (triple reinduction) vs
           standard reintensification therapy (intensive pulses and one reintensification) in
           pediatric patients with high-risk ALL.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study.

        -  Prednisone prephase therapy: Patients receive oral prednisone on days 1-7 and one dose
           of methotrexate (MTX) intrathecally (IT) on day 1.

        -  Induction/consolidation therapy, protocol I: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment
           arms.

             -  Arm I (closed to accrual as of 6/30/2006): Patients receive prednisone (PRED) on
                days 8-28.

             -  Arm II (closed to accrual as of 6/30/2006): Patients receive dexamethasone (DEXA)
                on days 8-28.

      Patients in both arms also receive vincristine (VCR) and daunorubicin hydrochloride (DNR)
      once weekly in weeks 2-5; asparaginase (ASP) on days 12-33; cyclophosphamide (CPM) on days 36
      and 64; cytarabine (ARA-C) in weeks 6-9; mercaptopurine (MP) on days 36-63; and MTX IT on
      days 1, 15, 29,38 and 52.* NOTE: *Patients with CNS disease also receive MTX IT on days 8 and
      22. After completion of induction/consolidation therapy, patients are stratified according to
      risk group based on disease response (standard-risk [SR] group [negative minimal residual
      disease (MRD) on day 33 and before protocol M, day 78] vs high-risk [HR] group [MRD ≥ 10^-³
      on day 78] vs intermediate-risk [IR] group [all nonSR/nonHR]).* Patients with SR and IR
      disease proceed to consolidation therapy-protocol M. Patients with HR disease proceed to HR
      block therapy.

      NOTE: *Patients meeting any of the following criteria are placed in the HR group regardless
      of MRD response: Philadelphia chromosome-positive disease (BCR/ABL or t[9;22]; translocations
      [t4;11][q11;q23] or MLL/AF4); "prednisone-poor-response" (≥ 1,000 blasts/mm³ in the
      peripheral blood on day 8 after prednisone prephase therapy); or no response to study
      induction therapy (M2/3 at day 33).

      • Consolidation, protocol M: Patients receive MP on days 1-56 and MTX on days 8, 22, 36, and
      50.

      After completion of extracompartment therapy, SR and IR patients proceed to reintensification
      therapy. SR patients are randomized to arms I or II. IR patients are randomized to arms I or
      III. HR patients who have completed induction/consolidation therapy are randomized to arms IV
      or V.

        -  Reinduction therapy:

           o Arm I (standard reinduction therapy, protocol II [closed to accrual as of 6/30/2006]):
           SR and IR patients receive DEXA on days 1-22; VCR and doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX) in
           weeks 2-5; ASP on days 8, 11, 15, and 18; CPM on day 36; ARA-C and thioguanine (TG) on
           days 36-49; and MTX IT on days 38 and 45. Patients then proceed to maintenance therapy.

        -  Arm II (reduced-intensity reinduction therapy, protocol III [closed to accrual as of
           6/30/2006]): SR patients receive DEXA on days 1-15; VCR and DOX on days 1 and 8; ASP on
           days 1, 4, 8, and 11; CPM on day 15; ARA-C and TG on days 15-28; and MTX IT on days 16

        -  Arm III (reduced-intensity reinduction/second delayed reinduction therapy [double
           reintensification therapy] [closed to accrual as of 6/30/2006]): IR patients receive
           reduced-intensity reintensification therapy as in arm II. After a 10-week interim
           maintenance phase, treatment repeats once for a second delayed course of
           reintensification therapy. Patients then proceed to maintenance therapy.

        -  Arm IV (standard reintensification therapy [closed to accrual as of 6/30/2006]): HR
           patients receive one sequence of the following HR therapy elements, in this order: 1, 2,

                (4 doses); etoposide five times daily on days 3-5; ASP on day 5; and MTX/ARA-C/PRED
                IT on day 1.

        -  Arm V (extended reintensification therapy [triple protocol III] [closed to accrual as of
           6/30/2006]): HR patients receive HR therapy elements 3, 2, and 1 following
           reintensification therapy repeated the therapy element three times with 4-week interim
           maintenance phases in between. Patients then proceed to maintenance therapy.

             -  Interim maintenance/maintenance therapy: Patients receive MTX once weekly and MP
                daily until week 104 plus IT MTX every eight weeks.
