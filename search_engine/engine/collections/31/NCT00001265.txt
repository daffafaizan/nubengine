    
      Polymyositis, dermatomyositis and related disorders, also known as the idiopathic
      inflammatory myopathies (IIM), are an uncommon, heterogeneous group of diseases. This is an
      omnibus protocol designed to continue our description of this rare group of diseases, further
      delineate important groups of patients, and obtain useful material for further study of
      immunological abnormalities, pathogenesis and etiology of IIM. Often the diagnosis of an IIM
      can be confused with other illness (such as adult-onset dystrophies), and therefore, we will
      be evaluating patients with other illnesses (who are referred with a preliminary diagnosis of
      an IIM) (1). Patients evaluated with IIM will receive consideration for entry into any
      therapeutic protocols. MRI will be performed on healthy volunteers to help develop a
      mathematical method for quantitating edema of muscle MRI in patients (2). MRI/PET will be
      performed on some patients and on healthy volunteers to evaluate its role in understanding
      muscle disease.
