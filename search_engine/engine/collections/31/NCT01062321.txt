    
      The study will include pregnant women with acute viral hepatitis and fulminant hepatic
      failure (jaundice). The women with FHF will be recruited from the medical wards and antenatal
      wards as all such patients are routinely admitted in the hospital.

      The pregnant women with acute viral hepatitis will be recruited either from antenatal clinic
      and medical outpatient, or from the medical and antenatal wards because pregnant women with
      AVH are admitted if they have serum bilirubin levels > 15- 20 mg / dl, persistently high
      bilirubin levels for more than 2-3 weeks, abnormal prothrombin time, evidence of progression
      of the disease, need parenteral therapy (because of excessive vomiting).

      The enrolled subjects will be evaluated on the basis of a pre-designed and pre-tested
      proforma with respect to history and clinical examination, obstetrics examination and
      ultrasonography. Ten ml venous blood sample will be drawn from the patient at the time of
      enrollment detection of hepatotropic viruses (Various serological markers of hepatitis will
      be done which includes: IgM anti-HAV, HBsAg, IgM anti-HBc, HBeAg, anti-HCV Ab and IgM
      anti-HEV would be done using commercially available ELISA kits and Extraction of HEV-RNA from
      serum will be done) & levels of cytokines (IL-6, TGF-beta, IFN-g and TNF-Î±). All the subjects
      will be followed- up till delivery. The promoter region of cytokine gene will be amplified by
      PCR in appropriate reaction conditions using suitable sets of primers. PCR product will be
      used for studying the polymorphisms by restriction fragment length polymorphism.

      The control group would comprise of age and POG matched healthy asymptomatic pregnant women

      Follow up

      All participants will be followed up till delivery for obstetrical complications, medical
      complications and pregnancy outcome.
