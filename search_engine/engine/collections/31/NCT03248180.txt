      better treatment response. Once symptoms subsided, the majority of patients wish to
      discontinue medications, yet currently the mainstream opinions still recommend maintenance
      antipsychotic therapy because non-adherence to medication is the most significant risk factor
      to predict a relapse. However, recent longitudinal studies assessing patients in community
      for a longer term found that their functioning is not necessarily poorer despite not
      regularly treated with antipsychotics. Also there are studies suggesting a lower percentage
      of dopamine occupancy by antipsychotic is acceptable in stable patients with psychosis. To
      elucidate such discrepancies, a hypothetical compromised approach "guided dose reduction, but
      not aiming at discontinuation"is proposed. In this study, we will recruit outpatients with
      schizophrenia related psychotic disorders under remitted states, randomize into guided dose
      reduction group (GDR, n = 80) and maintenance treatment group (MTG), including those who
      willing to have dose reduction but assigned to maintenance group (MTG1, n = 40) and those who
      willing to continue medication serving as naturalistic observation group (MTG2, n = 40), and
      follow up for at least 2 years. The main outcomes of interests are differences in relapse
      rates, personal social performance, quality of life, drug-related adverse reactions,
      medication satisfaction, and neurocognitive function between groups.We will also have
      patients to keep logs of medication status, blood tests for therapeutic drug monitoring,
      biochemistry, and potential biomarkers, as well as take into account demographic variables
      such as age, gender, education, employment status, and supportive system, and clinical
      variables such as age of onset, duration of illness, history of psychiatric admission, the
      highest and the lowest doses of antipsychotics during previous treatment, the number of
      different antipsychotics having being tried before, if a history of impending relapse during
      tapering down dose of antipsychotics, and concomitant psychotropic agents, to test whether
      these variables are related to outcomes during follow-up. Hopefully we can identify a
      satisfactory and balanced solution between improving patient's psychosocial and
      neurocognitive outcomes and prevention of relapse by redefining the role of antipsychotics.
