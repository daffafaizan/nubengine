      protocol to reach and intervene with non-treatment seeking adolescents who use marijuana
      heavily. Two hundred fifty adolescents who use marijuana heavily will receive a 2-session
      individual motivational enhancement therapy. All participants will also be offered the
      opportunity, over a 12-month period, to repeatedly re-initiate marijuana counseling.
      Participants will be randomly assigned to receive one of two types of periodic follow-up
      contacts: Motivational interviewing-based Marijuana Check-Ins (MCI) or Computer Based Control
      (Comp) sessions.

      All participants will be reassessed at the 6, 9, 12, and 15-month anniversaries of
      enrollment. Following their initial motivational enhancement therapy, the 125 experimental
      condition participants will additionally have a motivational enhancement treatment "check-in"
      session with their counselor at the 4, 7, and 10-month anniversaries of enrollment intended
      to reinforce the maintenance of treatment gains and motivate continued success, increase
      motivation to change for participants who did not meet their marijuana use goals, and/or
      prompt utilization of cognitive-behavioral treatment (CBT) sessions as needed. The 125
      comparison participants will complete a computer based questionnaire at the same time
      intervals to serve as an attentional control.
