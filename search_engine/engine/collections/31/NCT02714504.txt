    
      Patients admitted for autologous or allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation,
      induction-remission chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia, myelodysplasia or acute lymphoid
      leukemia, or to receive immunosuppressive therapy for aplastic anemia will be screened on
      admission. Patients may be included more than once, provided that a new treatment is
      administered and >30 days elapses from one to other admission (episode).

      Screening will consist of a thorough physical examination in the extremities. In case of a
      skin lesion, direct exam and fungal culture will be performed. Nail samples will be obtained
      by scrapping the nails with a curette, and samples from interdigital areas will be obtained
      using swabs.

      In a first phase no intervention will be performed. In a second phase, if direct exam and /or
      culture indicate the presence of Fusarium spp., primary antifungal therapy with an anti-mold
      azole (voriconazole (200 mg BID) or posaconazole (200 mg TID) will be started.

      Patients will be followed until discharge. The primary endpoint is invasive fusariosis,
      comparing the observational period with the intervention period.
