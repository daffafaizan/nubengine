      Ultrasound (DUS) of both upper- and lower extremities will be performed within 48 hours after
      ICU admission and thereafter twice a week until discharge from ICU or ICU stay equal to 30
      days. An additional DUS will be performed 3 months after ICU discharge.

      Description of heparin effect measured in blood samples: Blood samples will be drawn from
      intravasal catheters (preferably arterial, alternatively central venous) to examine heparin
      effect (anti-Xa activity, thrombin generation assay (TGA) and thrombelastography (TEG) and
      other haematological analyses including antithrombin concentrations. Whole blood will be
      drawn on two separate days (from minimum day 2 to maximum day 30 dependent on the dialysis
      therapy) of ICU stay immediately before and 4 hours after dalteparin administration in order
      to measure tough and peak effect of heparin. Dalteparin effect in ICU patients undergoing
      dialysis therapy will be measured one day with and one day without ongoing dialysis therapy
      in order to distinguish the effect of AKI from the effect of continuous renal replacement
      therapy (CRRT).
