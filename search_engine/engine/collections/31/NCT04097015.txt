      electrical stimulation in a subject with SCI to reduce pain and patient perceived improvement
      of quality of life first, and second, movement below the SCI injury. The Hypothesis is that
      NI-ES is beneficial in reducing pain following SCI injury, patient perceived quality of life
      measures, and functional outcomes. We plan to achieve this goal by conducting a Pain
      Questionnaire and assessment of movement below the injury site prior to external
      micro-current electrical stimulation with the Spinal Stim (Alpha-Stim M with the Ocular
      Interface and the Spinal Interface) and again six weeks following the first treatment. These
      results will be used to characterize the extent and duration of any improvement in pain and
      movement as a result of treatment with the Spinal Stim.
