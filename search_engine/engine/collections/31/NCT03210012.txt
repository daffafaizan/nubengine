      cardiac ultrasound before diving (baseline).

      Participants will be requested to perform recreational dive, which does not require
      particular decompression stops, at a depth of 30 meters with a 30 minutes botton time. 20
      minutes after dive the same measurements as baseline will be repeated, once at rest and once
      after a physical effort by performing a series of 10 bending on the legs (squats). The day
      after dive, the participants will be interviewed by phone (FOLLOW-UP) by a physician. It will
      be required to report any unusual event, MDD symptom, or neurological complication.

      Same procedure will be repeated with three different type of blends (AIR, NITROX, TRIMIX).
