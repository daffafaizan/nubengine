      treatment of acute stroke is limited except thrombolytic therapy in hyperacute stroke within
      several hours. Currently, aspirin is widely used in spite of its small benefit compared to
      bleeding complications.

      Cilostazol will be compared to aspirin in acute stroke patients in terms of functional
      outcome at 3 months, efficacy to prevent stroke recurrence, and safety for bleeding
      complications.
