      all anesthesiologists, pediatricians, and critical care specialists. Inadequate ETT size will
      results in soft tissue injury to trachea by means of the pressure, insufficient ventilation,
      and aspiration, therefore choosing the adequate ETT size has very important clinical aspect.

      Subglottis is the narrowest portion of upper airway. Thus, ETT size should be determined
      according to the subglottic diameter. Several conventional methods are available to determine
      ETT size. These methods are based on the demographic data of patient, such as age, weight,
      height, but could not be customized for each patient. Ultrasonography (US) is one of the most
      accurate method to measure the subglottic diameter. Also, US is quick, easy to perform, and
      non-invasive measure. The investigators tried to measure the exact subglottic diameter with
      US and analyze the correlation of the diameter and demographical data. Furthermore, the
      investigators will try to develop the equation that could determine the adequate ETT size
      based on demographical data, instead of actually measuring the subglottic diameter using US.
