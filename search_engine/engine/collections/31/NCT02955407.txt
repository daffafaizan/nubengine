    
      The following genes will be investigated:

        -  Insertions-/deletions-polymorphism of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE-I/D gene
           polymorphism; 3 genotypes: ACE-II, ACE-ID, ACE-DD).

        -  Anti-adhesive extracellular matrix protein Tenascin-C: gene polymorphism rs2104772

      The goals of this study are to investigate whether these genotypes correlate with 1)
      endurance of back muscles, 2) comorbidities such as asthma and diabetes and 3) the risk for
      LBP as assessed by a LBP-classification tool.
