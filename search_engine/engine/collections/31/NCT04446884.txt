      incontinence using injection of autologous adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells mixed with
      collagen was developed.

      Effectiveness of MSCs is due to the following:

        -  the ability of MSCs to stimulate tissue regeneration

        -  positive results of preclinical studies of the method of treatment of stress urinary
           incontinence (SUI) in animals (female rats).

      After gynecological examination, diagnosis of SUI, MSCs were isolated from adipose tissue,
      cultured and then transplanted back to directly under mucosa of urethra by three point
      injection in one third distal from the urethral neck at 3, 6 and 9 o'clock and to the
      paraurethral area.

      Injected volume was 3 ml per patient. For injection MSCs (6*10^6 cells) were mixed with
      collagen solution (3,5% w|w).

      Follow up patients monitoring was mperformed at 2, 4, 6 and 12 months after injection.
