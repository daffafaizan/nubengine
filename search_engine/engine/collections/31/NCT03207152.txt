      exposure to influenza in humans. The data obtained will be essential for further
      understanding of the natural history of human antiviral responses, and will allow us to
      identify a panel of biomarkers that can predict which individuals will go on to more severe
      symptoms and higher viral shedding, so that treatments and other interventions can be made at
      an early stage.
