        -  The primary objectives are

             -  to determine the clinical response of hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy
                (HIPC) in patients at the time of first clinical recurrence of ovarian, fallopian
                tube, or primary peritoneal carcinoma

             -  to determine the feasibility of delivering HIPC in a recurrent setting.

        -  Secondary objectives are

             -  to determine disease free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS),

             -  to determine treatment related changes in quality of life (QOL)

             -  to monitor the toxicities and complications associated with HIPC.
