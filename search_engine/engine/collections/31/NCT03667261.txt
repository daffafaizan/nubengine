      challenge to redevelop during the restorative process. The preservation of the soft tissue
      level from the time of extraction may optimize the final prosthetic outcome. One technique
      that can be used to achieve ideal tissue form is immediate dental implant placement with a
      custom-healing abutment.

      Immediate implant placement followed by immediate provisional restoration of single sites is
      a protocol used to replace a failing tooth. This technique may benefit patients with a thin
      periodontal biotype. Another benefit is the simplification of the final restorative
      procedure. Pre-fabricated healing abutments are circular in shape. Attempts at molding the
      tissue from a small opening above the implant to a contour similar to the missing tooth can
      take time. The preserved tissue profile can be easily duplicated in the impression process
      and allow for an accurate fabrication of a restoration in harmony with ideal tissue
      architecture at the day of insertion.

      This form of maintenance of the supporting gingival tissue has been demonstrated to be
      beneficial using immediate pontics for tooth replacement. Preservation of form, rather than
      re-creation, is achieved with the extension of the pontic into the subgingival zone with a
      contour replicating that of the extracted tooth. Concepts from immediate pontics have been
      applied to immediate dental implants with a similar goal. This is achieved with either a
      custom healing abutment or a complete provisional crown. The use of a custom-healing abutment
      is recommended in patients who have a deep anterior bite, who present with signs of bruxism,
      or who have a malocclusion that is not conducive to the protection of an immediate
      restoration.
