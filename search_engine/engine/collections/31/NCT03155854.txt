      at risk for complications including but not limited to scarring, adhesions, stiffness, injury
      to underlying structures such as blood vessels, tendons and nerves, loss of motion, pain,
      bowstringing, and recurrent triggering or contracture. They have been shown to have higher
      risk for these complications including a thickened scar response. The cause for this is not
      fully understood, but it could be because the pretendinous cord was cut and not removed. By
      cutting and not removing this pretendinous cord, this may cause extra scarring that may lead
      to a thicker palmar scar that may become symptomatic. This study will investigate a different
      surgical method for relieving the tension caused by a pretendinous cord and whether it
      reduces complications and scarring.
