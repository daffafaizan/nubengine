    
      Setting up a multicenter, MRD (Minimal Residual Disease)-driven study that relies on addition
      of gemtuzumab ozogamicin to conventional chemotherapy to reduce the pre-transplant levels of
      MRD of patients with favorable/intermediate-risk (according to ELN 2017) AML.
      Post-consolidation assessment of MRD will be exploited to establish the final risk assignment
      and to verify whether the delivery of a post remission therapy intensity (AuSCT, Autologous
      Stem Cell Transplant, vs ASCT, Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplant) of which is MRD-driven will
      improve the outcome in terms of anti-leukemic efficacy. Finally, the role of a post-SCT
      maintenance with glasdegib will be explored.
