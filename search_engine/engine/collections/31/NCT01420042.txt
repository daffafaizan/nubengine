    
      Double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized (with a 6:2 randomization for active versus
      placebo) safety, dose-escalation, and pharmacokinetic study of NNZ-2566.

      Three cohorts will be sequentially dosed, starting with two cohorts receiving a single dose
      (6mg/kg followed by 30mg/kg). The third cohort will receive two 100mg/kg doses over the
      course of one day and following a formal safety review the same subjects will then receive
      two 100mg/kg doses each day for five days.
