      40 healthy volunteers. Near infrared spectroscopy will be adopted to assess the metabolic
      characteristics of meridian phenomenon for Heart and Lung meridians in the
      physiology/pathological state. In addition, by comparing the metabolic characteristics in the
      acupoints along the Heart and Lung meridians, the relative specificity of the two meridians
      will also be investigated.

      Primary outcomes will be regional oxygen saturation (rSO2). Furthermore, this study will
      build standardized techniques and schemes for detecting the metabolic characteristics of
      meridian phenomenon for Heart and Lung. The results of this study could also provide
      scientific foundation for traditional meridian theories.
