      floor dysfunction diseases at home and abroad. Electrical stimulation can also relieve
      depression and anxiety and play a sedative effect. In recent years, some studies have shown
      that pelvic floor electrophysiological therapy can improve the intimal blood flow resistance
      index of thin endometrium. Therefore, whether or not the pelvic floor electrophysiological
      therapy can relieve the muscle soreness caused by carbon dioxide retention after endoscopic
      surgery, reduce the postoperative urinary retention, shorten the postoperative anus exhaust
      time, and repair the endometrium after the intrauterine adhesion. we expect this
      electrophysiologic therapy can solve some common postoperative complications and difficult
      problems, such solve muscle soreness and retention of urine after laparoscopy, and
      endometrial repair after electrosurgical resection of intrauterine adhesions. Hope to help
      patients recover quickly after surgery.
