      syndromic, etc.) will be correlated with genotype and validate inheritance mode by
      segregation analysis. Ocular exam of proband, parents and two unaffected siblings is needed,
      retina analysis, autofluorescence and ocular coherence tomography (OCT) are needed as well as
      family map. Blood samples 10ml max blood extraction will be sent and genotype will be
      analyzed.
