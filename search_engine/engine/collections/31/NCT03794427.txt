    
      Prospective, double blind randomized clinical trial of hip fracture patients who will be
      assessed for CD pre- and postoperatively, using the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE). The
      presence of CD will be determined at follow-up evaluation up to three months after surgery.
      Patients undergoing hip surgery will be randomized into two groups. Group 1 will receive
      unilateral lumbosacral nerve block (sciatic nerve block and paravertebral block at levels
      L3-L4 and L4-L5) as well as placebo injection (1 ml normal saline) at the spinal anesthesia
      level (L3-L4 or L4-L5). The sciatic nerve will be injected by 20 ml of the anesthetic mixture
      whereas levels L3-L4 and L4-L5 will be injected by a total of 20 ml of the anesthetic mixture
      without exceeding the maximum injected volume of 1 ml/kg. Group 2 will receive spinal
      anesthesia (3 ml of 0.5% bupivacaine) in addition to placebo injection at the sciatic, L3-L4
      and L4-L5 levels.
