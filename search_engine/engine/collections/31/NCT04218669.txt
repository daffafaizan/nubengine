      lead to the formation of stones in the biliary tract. Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy (HJ)
      shows considerable advantage for prevention of reflux of intestinal content into the bile
      duct. As a result, A randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluate the therapeutic safety, and
      perioperative and long-term outcomes of HJ versus T tube drainage for hepatolithiasis with
      SOL.

      Intervention: In total, 210 patients who met the following eligibly criteria were included
      and were randomized to choledochojejunostomy arm or T tube drainage in a 1:1 ratio.

      Clinical data include: the incidence of biliary complications (stone recurrence; biliary
      stricture; cholangitis); sphincter of oddi function; biliary leakage; mortality; hepatic
      injury; quality of life.
