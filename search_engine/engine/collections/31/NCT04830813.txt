    
      Chiauranib is a novel orally active multi-target inhibitor that simultaneously inhibits the
      angiogenesis-related kinases (VEGFR2, VEGFR1, VEGFR3, PDGFRa and c-Kit), mitosis-related
      kinase Aurora B and chronic inflammationrelated kinase CSF-1R in a high potency manner with
      the IC50 at a single-digit nanomolar range. In particular, Chiauranib showed very high
      selectivity in the kinase inhibition profile with little activity on off-target non-receptor
      kinases, proteins, GPCR and ion channels, indicative of a better drug safety profile in terms
      of clinical relevance.

      In July 2017, the sponsor initiated a phase Ib/II trial (CAR105). As of October 9, 2020, a
      total of 42 subjects entered the safety analysis and 41 subjects entered the efficacy
      analysis. The results of the phased trial analysis show the preliminary efficacy of this
      product in the treatment of SCLC at â‰¥3 lines.

      This clinical trial is studying the efficacy and safety of chiauranib works in treating
      patients with relapsed or refractory small cell lung cancer, in the meantime, exploreing the
      latent biomarkers accompany with chiauranib, as well as the relevancy of which and clinical
      benefit.
