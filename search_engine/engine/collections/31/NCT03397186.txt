      I. Percentage of tumor tissue in pre- and post-treatment biopsies comprised of T-cells, as
      determined by flow cytometry.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore additional potential biomarkers including: numbers of tumor associated
      macrophage (TAM) in tumor II. To explore additional potential biomarkers including: phenotype
      (classically activated macrophages [M1] versus [vs] alternatively activated macrophages [M2])
      as characterized by CD163, CD115, CD206 on infiltrating TAM.

      III. To explore additional potential biomarkers including: phenotype of T cells infiltrating
      tumor (CD4, CD8, markers of CD4 phenotype including FoxP3 and memory).

      IV. To explore additional potential biomarkers including: expression T cell inhibitory
      markers (PD-1, CTLA-4, TIM3).

      V. To explore additional potential biomarkers including: recognition of autologous tumor by
      expanded tumor infiltrating lymphocyte lines.

      VI. To explore additional potential biomarkers including: in tumor infiltrating lymphocyte
      (TIL) expanded from myxoid/round cell liposarcomas, recognition of cancer testis antigens.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo a biopsy at baseline and then receive trabectedin for up to 4 cycles.
      Beginning 1 week after completion of cycle 2 and prior to cycle 3, patients undergo a second
      biopsy. Patients who achieve clinical benefit (complete response [CR], partial response [PR],
      stable disease [SD]) after the first post-treatment scan and who continue trabectedin for 4
      cycles undergo a third biopsy after cycle 4.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up for 30 days.
