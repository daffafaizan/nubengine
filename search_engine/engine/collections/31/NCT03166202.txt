      Aim 1: To examine the association between RMDA as assessed by the rod intercept time and self
      reported driving difficulty and experiences during night time driving.

      Aim 2: To examine the association between RMDA as assessed by rod intercept time and reading
      performance as assessed by the MNREAD test administered under a low light level. Reading
      performance will be defined in terms of maximum reading speed, critical print size (i.e., the
      smallest print size that supports maximum reading speed), reading acuity (i.e., the smallest
      print size that can be just read) and the reading accessibility index (i.e., an individual's
      access to text over the range of print sizes found in everyday life).
