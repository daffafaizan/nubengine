      and to an increase in total body fat. These body composition changes have especially been
      observed in postmenopausal women, due to the hormonal changes taking place. After the
      menopause, the gynoid fat distribution with fat deposits in the gluteo-femoral region changes
      to an android fat distribution with an increased upper body fat, especially in the abdominal
      region. These consequences of the menopause associated with a decrease in aerobic capacity
      and reduced total energy expenditure may lead to the metabolic syndrome (MetS). The aim of
      this study was to investigate the anthropometric, metabolic, cardiovascular and symptomatic
      profile in gynoid and android postmenopausal women.
