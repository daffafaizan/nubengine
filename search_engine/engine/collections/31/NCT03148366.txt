    
      Methods:

      This will be a multi-center, open labeled, randomized comparative trial with cross-over
      design Patients: Participants with refractory H. pylori infection after one eradication
      therapy

      Testing for H. pylori infection Before Second Line Treatment : Any two positive of CLO test,
      histology, and culture or a positive UBT will be considered as H. pylori infected

      After Second Line Treatment: C13-UBT will be used to assess the existence of H. pylori 6-8
      weeks after first line therapy.

      Long term reinfection: C13-UBT will be used to assess the recurrence of H. pylori 1 year
      after eradication therapy

      Interventions:

      Second line therapy: eligible patients will be randomized into one of the two groups Group
      (A): sequential therapy containing levofloxacin for 14 days (EAML) D1-D7: (esomeprazole 40mg
      bid + amoxicillin 1gm bid) for 7 days D8-D14: (esomeprazole 40mg bid + levofloxacin 250mg bid
      + metronidazole 500mg bid) for another 7 days

      Group (B): bismuth quadruple therapy for 10 days (BQ) D1-D10: (esomeprazole 40mg bid +
      Dibismuth trioxide 120mg qid + metronidazole 500mg tid + tetracycline 500mg qid) for 10 days

      Third line therapy: patients who fail from second line treatment will be rescue with the
      following treatment Group (A) Patient who fail from levofloxacin sequential therapy will be
      retreated with bismuth quadruple therapy for 10 days D1-D10: (esomeprazole 40mg bid +
      Dibismuth trioxide 120mg qid + metronidazole 500mg tid + tetracycline 500mg qid) for 10 days

      Group (B) Patient who fail from bismuth quadruple therapy will be retreated with levofloxacin
      sequential therapy for 14days D1-D7: (esomeprazole 40mg bid + amoxicillin 1gm bid) for 7 days
      D8-D14: (esomeprazole 40mg bid + levofloxacin 250mg bid + metronidazole 500mg bid) for
      another 7 days

      Outcome Measurement:

      Primary End Point: Eradication rate in the second line according to intention to treat (ITT)
      and per-protocol (PP) analysis in the two treatment groups
