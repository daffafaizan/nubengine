    
      This is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled with 2 study groups
      (vaccine and placebo). Three doses of the study vaccine are given according to a 0, 1, 6
      month schedule. Vaccine efficacy will be assessed by maintaining active surveillance for
      clinical hepatitis every 2 weeks and hospital based surveillance for the full duration of the
      trial. Total planned study population is 2000 eligible subjects (1000 in the vaccine group
      and 1000 in the placebo group). Total vaccinated cohort for the analysis of reactogenicity is
      200 (100 in the vaccine group and 100 in the placebo group).

      Volunteers who enroll will be followed for evidence of symptomatic liver disease for
      approximately 2 years, and those who become ill will be admitted to hospital for care.

      To evaluate safety, a randomly designated subset will be monitored for 7 days after each
      vaccination to solicit specific symptoms at the injection site and generally. Additionally,
      all adverse events will be collected for 30 days after each vaccine dose and all serious
      adverse events will be collected throughout the trial.
