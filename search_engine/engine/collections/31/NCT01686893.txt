      comfortable and uncomplicated alternative to numerous other approaches in non-invasive
      ventilation (NIV). Up to now, NIV therapy could only be applied by masks with the associated
      complications as patients could not tolerate high airflow delivered by a thin nasal cannula
      without humidification and warming, thus causing concomitant negative effects. The new
      therapy TNI shows a high rate of acceptance by children, too.

      At present, there are two different types of devices available for nasal insufflation in
      clinics:

      TNI 20s, an air humidifier for clinical compressed air, and the TNI20 oxy, an air humidifier
      for clinical compressed air, which can be combined with oxygen.

      TNI 20 oxy The system, which is unique throughout the world, is optimized for the application
      of flows of up to 20L/min and fulfils the minimum requirements of the "American Society of
      Testing and Materials" for a high flow air humidifier in the non-invasive application of 10
      mg H2O/L (equivalent to about 60% rel. humidity at an ambient temperature of 22°C) for the
      air humidity. The warming of the air flow by 5-15°C can be adjusted relative to the ambient
      temperature. Condensation is prevented in the nasal applicator by heating the tube as far as
      the nostrils. The device automatically controls humidity and temperature depending on the
      prevailing ambient conditions. The TNI®20s can be attached to the hospital infrastructure by
      means of a standard pressure regulator.
