      affects physically active young adults and adolescents.

      Joint position sense (JPS) is considered as a component of proprioception as it provides the
      clinician with information regarding the accuracy of movement as well as its relationship
      with movement performance and injuries. Therefore researchers use advanced instruments as 3 D
      video systems and isokinetic dynamometer. Since these instruments are less portable and
      expensive, therefore researchers used another method to evaluate JPS using high precision
      software using video analysis and markers in the joints. Unfortunately, video analysis
      requires difficult and time-consuming tasks and that this slow the evaluation process.

      Although immediate feedback could help physiotherapists and athletic trainers to monitor
      athletes and make decisions during the training session and the rehabilitation process, such
      immediacy is not available for proprioceptive tests in field situations. Autocad software is
      available and inexpensive and provides immediate feedback
