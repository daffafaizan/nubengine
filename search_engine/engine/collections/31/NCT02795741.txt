      Assessment of their menopausal symptoms, including documentation of their baseline weight. If
      the assessment indicates that the participant has at least 'moderate' menopausal symptoms,
      then she will then enter the Run-In Period.

      During the two-week Run-In Period, participants will use a Symptom Diary for to document the
      frequency and severity of their menopausal symptoms. At the start of Week 3, participants
      will return their completed Run-In Period Symptom Diary and receive their Cooling Bolero with
      instructions on how to use the product during the Treatment Period.

      During the Treatment Period, participants should use the Cooling Bolero at least two times
      per day (morning and evening) for one hour. As feasible, the participant should start to wear
      the product 30 minutes prior to meal time for these two applications. The participant may
      also wear the product at additional times, as desired. All applications of the Cooling Bolero
      during the four-week Treatment Period are to be documented in the Product/Symptom Diary.
      During the Treatment Period, the participant will also continue to document the frequency and
      severity of their menopausal symptoms in the Product/Symptom Diary.

      At the end of Week 6, the participant will stop using the Cooling Bolero. She will be asked
      to complete a Product Assessment and have her weight documented.

      Participants will be contacted at Week 10 to ask about the status of menopausal symptoms
      after four weeks of not using the Cooling Bolero.
