    
      Randomized, prospective, single-centre (Hospital Francesc de Borja, Gandia, Spain),
      single-blind (analysis), three -way, crossover study on type 1 diabetic subjects (n=12) under
      intensive insulin treatment.

      Aim:

      To assess the effect of mixed meal composition on postprandial glycemic control, in subjects
      with type 1 diabetes:

        1. Combined effect of proteins and fats

        2. Effect of alcohol consumption

      Methods:

      Each subject will undergo three mixed meal test studies (on three different days), with
      identical CHO content: On one occasion a low fat-low protein meal will be given, and on
      another a high fat-high protein one, both consumed with a non-alcoholic drink; on a third
      occasion the same high fat-high protein meal will be consumed, but this time accompanied by
      an equal volume of an alcoholic drink.

      Patients will arrive at the research unit at 8:00 am and their blood glucose will be
      stabilized around 90 mg/dl before each mixed meal test. After the mixed meal, blood will be
      drawn every 5-30 min during a 6 hour post-prandial period to assess plasma glucose, hormones
      and metabolites concentration.
