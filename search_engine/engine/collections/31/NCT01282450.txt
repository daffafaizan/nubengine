    
      Eligible patients (see below) will receive radical radiotherapy to the primary tumor and the
      initially involved mediastinal lymph nodes to an MLD (Mean Lung Dose) of 20 +/- 1Gy,
      irrespective of lung function and/or to all metastatic sites to a minimal biological
      equivalent of 60Gy in 30 daily fractions. This may be delivered with hypofractionated
      stereotactic techniques or with other more protracted fractionation regimen.

      Both the primary tumor, the regional N1 lymph nodes and the oligo-metastatic site(s) may be
      treated with surgery, as long as an R0 resection is deemed possible. Systemic treatment is
      not required, but should be given according to the local extend of the tumor.

      Local radiotherapy will be delivered according to the protocol of MAASTRO clinic for that
      anatomical site.

      Other dose-constraints: spinal cord max: 54Gy, brachial plexus (Dmax): 66Gy The radiation
      doses will be specified according to ICRU 50. Lung density corrections will be applied, as
      well as all standard QA procedures. Technical requirements are the same as in standard
      practice at MAASTRO clinic.
