      not to destroy cancer cells. AMG 319 works by blocking these defence mechanisms in the
      tumour. It targets and blocks an important protein called PI3K delta.

      In the laboratory this leads to removal of a group of inhibitory immune cells. Releasing the
      immune brakes leads to immune attack and destruction of cancer cells.

      AMG 319 looks promising in laboratory studies and in a very early study in a small number of
      patients with leukaemia and we now wish to find out if it will be useful in treating patients
      with head and neck cancer.

      This study is a randomised, doubleblind, placebo controlled Phase II trial looking at the
      effects of giving AMG 319 to patients with either human papilloma virus (HPV) positive or
      negative head and neck cancer squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). We propose to treat patients
      prior to resection surgery so that we can study the effect of AMG 319 on the cancer in fine
      detail.

      Approximately 54 patients with HPV positive or negative HNSCC of the hypopharynx, oropharynx,
      oral cavity, supraglottis or larynx will be entered into the study. Patients will be randomly
      assigned to one of two treatment groups and will receive between 20 and 29 days of oral
      dosing with AMG 319 or placebo immediately before resection surgery.
