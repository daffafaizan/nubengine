    
      The study involves patients aged 65 years or over who have been seen by a neurologist or
      psycho-geriatrician and identified as having features that are atypical for the known types
      of dementia. All patients will be invited to an initial meeting with the research team to
      discuss the study and, if they agree to participate, for clinical assessment and
      epidemiological review. Participants will be asked to donate blood or a buccal sample for
      codon-129 polymorphism genotyping and may be offered a MRI brain scan if no such imaging has
      been previously undertaken. Participants will also be asked to consider if, in the event of
      their death, they would donate samples of brain tissue to the Edinburgh Brain Bank for use in
      this and future research. Telephone follow up will be offered within 1 month of joining the
      study and at 3 monthly intervals thereafter, with further clinical review offered if deemed
      appropriate.
