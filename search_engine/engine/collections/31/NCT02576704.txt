      routine protocols in use in our center. Briefly, at peak stress, patients were injected with
      thallium-201. Five to 10 minutes after stress, a 5-minutes supine acquisition was performed
      followed by a 5-minutes prone acquisition. Subsequently, technetium-99m-sestamibi was
      injected, and 2 minutes later a single 5-minutes rest acquisition was performed. During
      stress acquisition, patients were imaged in supine and prone positions with their arms
      positioned over their head. The rest acquisition was only acquired in supine position. The
      gated SPECT studies were performed at each acquisition. Injected activity (IA) was adjusted
      for patient weight. For weights of <80 kg/ 80-100 kg/>100 kg, thallium-201 IAs were 74/92/111
      MBq and technetium-99m-sestamibi IAs were 300/370/450 MBq, respectively. A uniform imaging
      pre-treatment for the reconstruction of raw myocardial perfusion imaging data was applied,
      and images were reconstructed and reoriented to obtain transaxial sections of the left
      ventricle according to the three standard cardiac planes.

      In this study, we use a new mathematic technique from entropy analysis to provide precise,
      objective, automated quantification of perfusion heterogeneity at stress with camera SPECT.
      This method may be a non-invasive imaging to assess coronary microvascular dysfunction.
