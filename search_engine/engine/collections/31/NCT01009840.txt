      autologous HSCT (greater than one year previously) receiving an IV busulfan-based
      conditioning regimen with the combination of pharmacokinetic (PK)-guided IV busulfan dosing
      and bortezomib, followed by a second autologous HSCT.

      Assessment of the safety profile of this conditioning regimen will also be completed.
