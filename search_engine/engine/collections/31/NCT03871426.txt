      sphincter (UES) and lower esophageal sphincter (LES) during manual cervical traction and
      trunk stabilization maneuvers. 50-55 gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) subjects will
      participate in the study. UES and pressures will first be measured in relaxed supine position
      then, during manual cervical traction and finally, the subjects will undergo manual
      positioning of the trunk into neutral position and LES and UES pressures will be measured
      again.
