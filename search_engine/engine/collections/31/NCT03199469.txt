      Myopathy. Subjects will receive a single dose of AT132 delivered intravenously.

      ASPIRO is being conducted in two parts. Part 1 is a dose escalation phase that is evaluating
      the preliminary safety and efficacy of AT132 at doses of 1x1014 vg/kg and 3x1014 vg/kg. Part
      2 of ASPIRO is a pivotal expansion cohort designed to confirm the safety and efficacy of
      AT132 at a dose of 3x1014 vg/kg. The pivotal expansion cohort will enroll eight subjects,
      consisting of four age-matched pairs (within +/- 6 months of age). One subject from each pair
      will be randomized to receive a single dose of AT132 at 3x1014 vg/kg, and the other will
      serve as a delayed treatment control. Eligible delayed treatment control subjects will be
      administered AT132 after that individual subject has completed the Week 24 visit as a delayed
      treatment control.

      The primary efficacy endpoint measures will be assessed at Week 24. Subjects will be followed
      for a total of 5 years after administration of AT132.

      This study utilizes an independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) that will monitors subject
      safety and provides recommendations to Audentes regarding dose escalation, dose expansion,
      and safety matters.
