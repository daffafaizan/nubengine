      amputation (ULLA) compared to able-bodied individuals, relatively little is known about the
      fundamental mechanisms underlying this condition. This research represents a first step
      toward investigating lower back biomechanics using advanced computational modeling techniques
      to inform the future design of effective interventions for LBP. Specifically, the impact of
      trunk neuromuscular patterns adopted by persons with ULLA while performing activities of
      daily living on spinal loads and the risk of spinal tissue damage will be investigated. This
      will be achieved via secondary biomechanical analyses of a large set of high-quality
      kinematics data obtained from individuals with and without ULLA performing the following
      tasks: 1) walking at self-selected and controlled speeds, 2) sit-to-stand and stand-to-sit,
      and 3) stairs-up and stairs-down. The central hypothesis is that, compared to able-bodied
      individuals, trunk movement strategies adopted by persons with ULLA to cope with physical
      demands of common daily activities are associated with a complex pattern of internal muscle
      forces that result in larger loads on the spine and a higher probability for spinal tissue
      damage. Investigators' dataset draws from the Biomechanics Laboratory at Walter Reed National
      Military Medical Center (WRNMMC) which has unprecedented access to a large population of
      service members with ULLA. Using this unique database, investigators will implement their
      novel finite element modeling approach to estimate the internal muscle forces (i.e., adopted
      neuromuscular patterns) needed to perform daily physical activities on the basis of
      satisfying equilibrium and stability across the entire lumbar spine. Completion of this
      project will enable the investigators to determine differences in muscle recruitment, as well
      as the resultant effects on spinal loads and the risk of spinal tissue damage, between
      persons with and without ULLA. Hence, this pilot project is expected to establish the initial
      groundwork for future research involving the design of highly specific interventions aimed at
      trunk neuromuscular behaviors during post-amputation rehabilitation to lessen adverse effects
      on lower back biomechanics and the potential for LBP.
