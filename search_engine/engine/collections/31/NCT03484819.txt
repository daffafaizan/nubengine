    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To assess overall response rate (ORR) defined as complete response rate (CR) plus partial
      response rate (PR) (ORR = CR + PR) of the combination of copanlisib hydrochloride
      (copanlisib) and nivolumab in patients with relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma
      (DLBCL) and primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety of the combination of nivolumab and copanlisib in patients with
      relapsed/refractory DLBCL and PMBCL.

      II. To determine the progression free survival, duration of response, complete response rate
      and overall survival of the combination of copanlisib and nivolumab in patients with relapsed
      or refractory DLBCL and PMBCL.

      CORRELATIVE STUDY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To characterize the effects of the copanlisib and nivolumab combination regimen on tumor
      cells, tumor microenvironment and the immune response in relapsed/refractory DLBCL and PMBCL.

      II. To assess predictors of response of the combination in relapsed/refractory DLBCL and
      PMBCL.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive copanlisib hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 1, 8 and 15
      of cycles 1-8 and days 1 and 15 of subsequent cycles. Patients also receive nivolumab IV over
      30 minutes on days 1 and 15 of cycles 1-8 and on day 1 of subsequent cycles. Cycles repeat
      every 28 days for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for up to 100 days.
