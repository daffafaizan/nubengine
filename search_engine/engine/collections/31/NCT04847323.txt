      Orthodontics, Bauru Dental School, University of SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil.

      A total of 50 patients completing orthodontic treatment will be recruited. The patients will
      be prospectively and randomly allocated into two groups. The first group will consist of 25
      patients with canine-to-canine V-bend bonded retainers; while the second group will be
      composed of 25 patients with vacuum-formed retainers. In both groups, the same retainers will
      be installed in the maxillary and mandibular arches.

      Patients will be evaluated at deboning (T0), after 3 months (T1), 6 months (T2), and 12
      months (T3). In each appointment, digital models will be obtained and the other clinical
      variables will be evaluated. The primary and secondary outcomes will be compared between
      retainers in the time-points evaluated.
