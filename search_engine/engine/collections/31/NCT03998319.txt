      participate in the study. After angioplasty has been performed, the IMR will be measured in
      the infarct related artery. If the IMR is >32 patients will be randomised to receive
      intracoronary clot dissolving therapy in the form of low, or very low dose tenecteplase (TNK)
      or water as a placebo. Patients who have an IMR â‰¤32 will be followed up in a registry.
      Cardiac enzymes will be measured at baseline and discharge. Randomised participants will
      receive a cardiac MRI at discharge (3-7 days post primary PCI) and at 6 months post PCI. All
      participants will be followed up at 30 days, and 6, 12 and 24 months following discharge.
