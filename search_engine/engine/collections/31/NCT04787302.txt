      the M4 muscarinic receptor subtype (M4 mAChR). CVL-231 is being developed for treatment of
      psychosis in schizophrenia. The aim of this trial is to characterize the relationship between
      the M4 receptor occupancy in different regions of the brain following a single oral doses of
      CVL-231 in healthy adult subjects by positron emission tomography (PET) using the radioligand
      [11C]MK-6884.
