    
      The proposed study is a web-based, prospective, parallel group, Phase IV, 12-month study of
      patients receiving support services provided by MSLL and contracted nursing services.
      Following referral of patients to MSLL, consenting patients will be allocated to one of two
      groups (2:1), based on their geographic area. Group A will be further randomized 1:1 to the
      standard services subgroup (Group A1) or a customized services subgroup (Group A2). The
      standard subgroup will receive phones calls and nurse visits at set intervals. Patients in
      the custom services subgroup will have the option of selecting as many or as few of the
      "standard" services they will receive after the initial injection training. Subjects will
      have the option of receiving educational materials, planning tools, and reminders. Patients
      allocated to Group B will receive a visit for injection training and the follow-up call and
      then MSLL phone calls at set intervals. Over a period of 12 months (each month defined as a
      28-day period), all subjects will receive support services (nurse visit and follow-up phone
      call, etc) and complete online assessments (MSRS-R, PDSS, etc).

      The primary objective of the trial is to determine the impact of two different levels of
      support service, group A1 and A2, provided by MSLL within Group A, on adherence to prescribed
      treatment in newly diagnosed or first-switch relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS)
      subjects.

      Secondary Objective:

      The secondary objectives are:

        -  To use a pair wise comparison to determine the impact on adherence of the two different
           levels of service intervention provided by MSLL not compared in the primary objective
           (Standard services subgroup of Group A (A1) to Group B and Customized service subgroup
           of Group A (A2) to Group B)

        -  To determine the correlation of adherence with subject-reported outcomes and other study
           data;

        -  To examine the changes from baseline in subject-reported outcomes in each service arm;

        -  To examine changes from baseline in risk for non-adherence in each service arm; and

        -  To determine rate of trial dropout between each service arm
