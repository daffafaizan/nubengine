      autonomic sudomotor function and endothelial and neurovascular functions as well as markers
      of inflammation in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The primary objective will
      be changes in peripheral autonomic function using sudorimetry (Sudoscan) after 1 year of
      treatment.

      The secondary objectives include changes on markers of inflammation and oxidative/nitrosative
      stress including C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β), Interleukin 6 (IL6),
      interleukin 12 (IL12), interleukin 10 (IL10), tumor necrosis factor α (TNF α), plasminogen
      activator Inhibitor 1 (PAI-1), superoxide dismutase (SOD), nitrotyrosine,
      carboxymethyl-lysine (CML), thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), and asymmetric
      dimethylarginine (ADMA). Additional objectives include changes in neurovascular and
      endothelial function, measured by continuous Laser Doppler assessment of skin blood flow in
      response to different stimuli; and changes in sensory-motor peripheral nerve function,
      measured by clinical neuropathy scores (NSS & NIS), quantitative sensory testing and nerve
      conduction testing.

      The aim of this study is to capture patients early in the disease process, when autonomic
      dysfunction is still potentially reversible. Several studies have shown the presence of
      autonomic imbalance in the early stages of diabetes and even in the pre-diabetic state
      (impaired glucose tolerance, impaired fasting glucose, and metabolic syndrome). We
      hypothesize that by treating type 2 diabetic patients with Liraglutide early in the disease
      process (<10 years of diagnosis), we will be able to improve peripheral autonomic imbalance,
      endothelial and neurovascular function, and reduce inflammation and oxidative/nitrosative
      stress. This will shed further insight into the mechanisms by which glucagon-like peptide-1
      (GLP-1) exerts a neuroprotective role and improves the inflammatory process. The possibility
      of improving autonomic imbalance, endothelial function and inflammation may have important
      impact in the development of new potential therapeutic strategies to abrogate the
      microvascular complications of diabetes
