      test and other assessments. The first scan is a sonogram of the heart called an
      echocardiogram, and another scan is done using the investigational ARTSENS device that will
      be used to measure stiffness of the walls in the arterial blood vessel for indications of
      inflammation damage. ARTSENS device is not approved for use in the United States. It is
      expected that we will enroll 50 people in this study. The entire study is expected to last 2
      years. Participation will be for approximately 9 months.
