      all patients or their surrogates prior to the procedure of EVLWI measurement and blood
      sampling for molecular measurement including cytokines.

      From July 2011 to June 2014, consecutive septic patients with ARDS in intensive care units
      (ICUs) will be enrolled at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, a university-affiliated hospital in
      Taiwan. EVLWI will be measured by PiCCO monitoring system. Serum cytokine such as
      endothelin-1, TNF-alfa, IL-6, Tie-1, Tie-2, angiopoietin-1, angiopoietin-2,VEGF and
      thrombomodulin will be measured.
