      reliability in assessing growth. The advantages and shortcomings of each index was previously
      examined. This study aims to explore the use of proximal femoral epiphysis, which is in close
      proximity of the radiographic field of the spine, in assessing the growth status of patients
      with idiopathic scoliosis. The stages of the proximal femoral epiphyseal ossification has
      been established with specific definitions. The reliability and reproducibility of using
      these gradings will be examined by orthopaedic surgeons. Subsequently, the assessment of
      different pubertal growth landmarks using these gradings will be validated, and to see
      whether these gradings can provide indications of peak growth and growth cessation. Finally,
      the relationships of such growth assessment using this proximal femoral epiphysis
      ossification (PFEO) system and the curve progression in idiopathic scoliosis will be studied.
