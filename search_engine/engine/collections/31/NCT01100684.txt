      respect to improvement in IBS-related abdominal pain severity and reduction in stool
      frequency. During the 12-week treatment period, daily IBS-related abdominal pain severity
      score and daily frequency of bowel movements will be averaged over each week to determine
      average values for each endpoint. For each subject, weekly response to treatment will be
      based on the following parameters:

        -  Decrease from baseline of at least 30% in the average IBS-related daily abdominal pain
           severity score

        -  Decrease from baseline of at least 25% in the average number of daily bowel movements A
           subject must meet both criteria to be considered a weekly responder. The primary
           efficacy endpoint is based on an "overall study responder," defined as a subject having
           6 or more weeks of weekly response to treatment out of the 12 weeks in the treatment
           period. Overall study responder will be stratified by timing of bowel preparation and
           endoscopy.
