    
      This observational program is aimed at gaining tolerability and safety data with the routine
      use of Caelyx in its labelled indication in ovarian cancer, focusing on infusion reaction and
      PPE.

      Data will be raised about the premedication routinely used for the prevention of side effects
      caused by Caelyx. Premedications for infusion reactions include corticosteroids, serotonin 3
      (5HT3) antagonists, histamine 1 (H1) blockers, and histamine 2 (H2) blockers. Premedications
      for PPE include oral dexamethasone and vitamin B6.

      The management of infusion reactions and PPE will be recorded. A detailed record of the
      medical history may reveal patient groups at a higher risk of experiencing these side
      effects.
