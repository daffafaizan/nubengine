    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or highest dose level, and the dose-limiting
      toxicity (DLT) of vandetanib (a multi-kinase inhibitor of epidermal growth factor receptor
      [EGFR], vascular endothelial growth factor receptor [VEGFR] and ret proto-oncogene [RET]
      inhibitor) when used in combination with everolimus (a mammalian target of rapamycin [mTOR]
      inhibitor) in advanced cancer.

      II. Preliminary descriptive assessment of the anti-tumor efficacy of the combination.

      III. Preliminary optional assessment of the pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic markers of
      target inhibition and correlates of response.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive vandetanib orally (PO) once daily (QD) and everolimus PO QD on days 1-28.
      Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment patients are followed up between 14-28 days at the
      discretion of the treating physician.
