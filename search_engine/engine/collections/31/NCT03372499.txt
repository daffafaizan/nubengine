      cirrhosis and variceal bleeding. The overall incidence of post-TIPS encephalopathy ranges
      between 10% and 50%, and even the percentage of the new or worsened HE was evaluated up to
      13-36%. No approach or medication was evidenced for prophylaxis of post-TIPS encephalopathy,
      including lactulose and rifaximin. Diet management has been used as an important part of the
      prophylaxis and treatment strategy for patients with metabolic diseases like diabetes and
      nephritis, which has drawn increasing interest of clinicians. Nevertheless, there is still no
      standard consensus or even recommendation for patients after TIPS procedure for now, which
      worsened malnutrition and affected survival. Thus, this study is specially designed to
      explore whether diet management strategy, drawn up from the nutritional management consensus
      of hepatic encephalopathy (ISHEN consensus), could decrease incidence of encephalopathy after
      TIPS treatment of the patient with cirrhosis and variceal bleeding.
