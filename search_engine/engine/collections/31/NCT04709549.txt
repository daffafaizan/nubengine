      of health into a weight loss/maintenance study, along with a known behavioral intervention
      will result in improved efficacy than the behavioral intervention by itself. This study will
      examine the role of pyschosocial, clinical and behavioral factors in the context of the
      intervention.

      The entire duration of the study will be 18 months. Study activities will occur virtually or
      at YMCA locations in the city of San Francisco or at other community centers.
