      aged 65 and older experience sleep problems. The prevalence of insomnia and other sleep
      disorders is not a natural part of aging but is high in older adults because of a variety of
      factors common in late life. One of those factors may be a deficient magnesium status. There
      is a close association between sleep architecture, especially slow wave sleep, and activity
      in the glutamatergic and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) system. Because magnesium is a
      natural N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)antagonist and GABA agonist, magnesium apparently plays a
      key role in the regulation of sleep. Such a role is supported by supplementation,
      correlation, and animal studies showing that magnesium intake or status affects sleep
      organization.
