      I. To evaluate the incidence of grade 2 or higher (Gr2+) infusion-related reactions (IRRs)
      with rapid-infusion (RI) isatuximab across 6 doses.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To estimate time savings with RI isatuximab (versus estimated standard of care [SOC]
      isatuximab duration lengths) across 6 doses of isatuximab.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients must have received standard of care isatuximab IV over for at least 2 doses without
      any Gr2+ IRRs reported. Patients will then receive a rapid infusion of isatuximab IV over 30
      minutes. If a >=Grade 2 iRR occurs, then participants will revert to a SOC infusion time and
      be taken off the study. If a Grade 1 or no IRR occurs, then participants will receive another
      rapid infusion of 30 minutes and assessed again for IRRs. Rapid infusions and IRR assessment
      after each RI will continue for up to at least 6 doses or until the patient experiences an
      Grade 2 or higher IRR.
