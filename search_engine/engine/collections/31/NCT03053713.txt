      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), therefore novel diet approaches for the prevention and
      treatment of IBD are urgently needed. The Mediterranean Diet Pattern (MDP) is associated with
      improvements in health status and inflammatory markers in healthy individuals and rodent
      models of colitis. Reductions in inflammatory biomarkers and a "normalization" of the gut
      microbiota have been shown in patients with Crohn's disease following a MDP. To date, no
      studies have examined the effect of MDP on disease activity, inflammatory markers or the
      effects on the microbiome in ulcerative colitis (UC).

      This study will examine the effects of a MDP taken by patients with UC on 1) symptoms,
      clinical and quality of life endpoints and 2) on gut microbiome and fecal immune biomarkers.
      One hundred subjects and two subjects with UC will be randomly allocated to follow a MDP for
      12 weeks or their usual diet (controls). Upon initiation, throughout and completion of each
      diet, symptoms, clinical and quality of life endpoints will be monitored. Fecal samples will
      be collected to assess pH, short-chain fatty acid concentrations, bacterial abundance and
      diversity.
