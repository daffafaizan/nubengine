      induction of different subset of Treg including Foxp3 positive cells, therefore additional
      strategies to enhance this property are highly attractive. Since corticosteroids directly
      induce the development of an IL-10-synthesizing regulatory T-cell population (Tr1) and this
      effect can be greatly increased with vitamin D3 treatment we , we assumed that combine
      allergen immunotherapy with non-specific treatments such as glucocorticosteroids and vitamin
      D3 as well as montelukast sodium treatment might enhanced allergen tolerance induction and
      improved clinical effectiveness of allergen-specific immunotherapy, therefore we conducted
      the stud comparing the effect of glucocorticosteroid, glucocorticosteroid with vitamin D3 or
      montelukast sodium on early immunological and clinical effect of allergen-specific
      immunotherapy in asthmatic children.
