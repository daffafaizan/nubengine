      is their greatest concern.

      After surgery quick mobilization is important to take care of the newborn. When using a
      patient controlled analgesia (PCA) device mobilization is limited and women can not meet
      their expectations to take care of the newborn. Oral analgesia in comparison offers superior
      patient satisfaction.

      This trial was conducted to investigate the effectiveness of both treatment options and
      improve patients pain management and overall content after cesarean.
