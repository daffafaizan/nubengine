    
      The study is a prospective, multi-center, parallel-group RCT designed to collect outcome data
      for the treatment of DFUs. The trial will be single blinded in regard to wound healing
      assessment (confirmation of wound healing will be overseen by an independent wound care
      adjudicator).

      There are two arms in the study, both of which will receive standard of care (SOC):
      offloading of the DFU (CAM boots (Royce walker with diabetic inlay or equivalent) or total
      contact casting [TCC] if compliance issues or the subject's foot is too large for a CAM),
      appropriate sharp or surgical debridement. Patients cannot be on systemic antibiotics prior
      to randomization, infection management during treatment phase can include systemic
      antibiotics only in conjunction with debridement.

      Arm 1 will receive, in addition, a fish skin graft (KerecisTM Omega3 Wound) secured with
      Steristrips, sutures or staples, covered with a nonadherent dressing (Adaptic, Systagenix,
      Yorkshire, UK or equivalent), the product bolstered down to the wound bed with a foam
      dressing (HydraFoam, DermaRite) and hydrogel as needed to retain adequate moisture balance
      and padded with stretch gauze and self adherent wrap as needed.

      Arm 2 will receive a wound care covering comprising collagen alginate Fibracol plus dressing
      followed by a padded dressing comprised of 4x4 gauze pads, stretch gauze and self adherent
      wrap The wound will be dressed by patients or their caregivers at home 3 times a week and by
      the site investigator 1 day a week.

      The study involves two phases: Screening and Treatment
