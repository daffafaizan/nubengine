      the treatment process of cancer perceive and describe their experience of engaging in
      occupational routines? 2. What effect does the treatment process of cancer have on an
      adolescent's ability to participate in life situations such as creating and maintaining
      relationships with family, friends, peers, students, or people with similar backgrounds?

      By doing this study, researchers hope to gain information so that occupational therapists can
      increase the profession's present body of knowledge and better understand these individuals
      at a transitional period in their lives.
