      partial-onset epilepsy with secondary generalization and able to provide informed consent
      will be enrolled. In addition to the diagnosis of medically refractory epilepsy, these
      patients will need to meet protocol specific inclusion and exclusion criteria. These adults
      will be screened from the patients being cared for by the epilepsy program at The Ohio State
      University or referred from elsewhere for enrollment in the study. Initially, 3 participants
      will be enrolled and followed for 3 months to assess the safety of study intervention.
      Pending review by the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC), an additional 7
      participants will be enrolled.

      This pilot study is being conducted to test this feasibility of this device in order to
      confirm the design and operating specifications of the device including the ability to
      identify, and accurately ablate the target focus within the Anterior Nucleus.

      Safety will be assessed by the absence of side effects, e.g. new onset of neurological
      deficits, performance deterioration on neuropsychological testing. Feasibility is defined as
      the ability to create the desired lesion within the anterior nucleus.

      Seizure frequency data will be collected by seizure diary. Quality of life will be measured
      by the Quality of Life in Epilepsy Inventory -31. Imaging analysis will include study of
      changes in resting state functional connectivity (assessed by fMRI), as well as in structural
      (assessed by volumetric T1 and T2 weighted imaging) and microstructural (assessed by
      diffusion tensor imaging) brain anatomy.
