      The purpose of this study is to proof a professional care of overweight patients with
      symptomatic atrial fibrillation, as well as the treatment of the risk factors for atrial
      fibrillation, especially obstructive sleep apnea and hypertension.

      There is a 1:1 randomization. In the intervention group, patients are followed up in a
      6-month intensive care after atrial fibrillation ablation. During the follow up time patients
      will visit the nutritional advice every two weeks for 6 months.

      The Follow-up in the control group is standard of care. At baseline, a screening test for
      obstructive sleep apnea and arterial hypertension will be performed as standard care.

      The documentation of atrial fibrillation after ablation is made possible by the implantation
      of an event recorder before atrial fibrillation ablation.

      Follow up:

      A follow-up will be performed after 3,6 and 12 months in both groups. Patients in the
      intervention group will be followed-up every 2 weeks in the first 6 months.
