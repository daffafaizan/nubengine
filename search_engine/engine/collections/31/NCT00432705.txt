      (CAI). Recently, investigations have focused on assessment of sensorimotor function in those
      who suffer from CAI. These measures have included traditional and functional postural control
      variables, as well as measures of joint position sense, neuromuscular control and
      recruitment, and nerve conduction velocity. This study seeks to modulate sensorimotor
      measures through both short- and long-term reflex training. This information may help to
      better assess sensorimotor deficits associated with CAI, to focus future research, evaluate
      rehabilitation protocols and to improve our understanding of this chronic disability.
