      design with a 4-week single-blind placebo and diet run-in period. Given a ratio of 1:1,
      patient volunteers will be randomized into one of two parallel treatment arms, Nasulin in a
      combination with insulin glargine or placebo in combination with insulin glargine. The
      randomization period will be 6 weeks in length. The total length of individual patient
      volunteer participation, including screening and follow-up will be approximately 13-14 weeks.
