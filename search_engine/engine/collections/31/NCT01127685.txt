    
      Orthopedic surgeons and rehabilitation physicians frequently request limited weight-bearing
      for prolonged periods following certain bony or soft tissue pathologies as well as certain
      lower - limb surgical procedures. Walking, stair climbing, jogging, elliptical training and
      running on treadmill are a common activity that the injured athlete will seek to return to as
      soon as possible following injury or surgery. In order for the physician to be able to advise
      regarding weight-bearing, the Percentage Body-Weight/Weight-Bearing (PBW/WB) values in
      increasing walking, jogging speeds, elliptical training must be known. These parameters as
      well as the gait distribution changes have eluded the rehabilitation community, mainly due to
      the technical inability to measure these paradigms.

      There are no short-term studies quantifying weight-bearing deficits as well as weight-bearing
      gait distribution characteristics following Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction (ACLR).
      Furthermore, there are no published studies that have investigated whether differences exist
      between various surgical procedures and replacement graft choices in the acute- phase (0-3
      weeks) post surgery

      Descriptive clinical trial. During their regular training the participants will use the
      flexible, light weight, force-sensing insole for few minutes to receive the parameters 30
      subjects. The test subjects will be instructed to walk at their normal speed on a solid
      ground surface over a distance of 16 meters.

      The results will be analyzed and a table of normal values will be established including
      average PBW/WB values for the entire, hind and fore-foot as well as gait distribution
      changes.
