      clinical engineer performing the gait analysis will be blind with respect to the prosthetic
      head diameter implanted). Patient recruitment will last 12 months and the Study will have a
      follow-up period of 12 months. A total number of 45 patients will be recruited. Patients will
      be randomly allocated into three groups: the first group will undergo THA with a 28mm
      diameter head (Pinnacle Acetabular System, with a ceramic on ceramic - CoC - bearing), in the
      second group THA will be performed using a 36 mm diameter head (DeltaMotion), finally
      patients in the third group will undergo THA with a 40 mm diameter head (DeltaMotion).
      Patients will be operated by three surgeons of the same hospital according to the same
      surgical procedure and using the same direct lateral approach. All patients will receive a
      Corail stem and will follow the same rehabilitation program.

        -  Primary endpoint: Gait analysis and fluoroscopy will provide quantitative information of
           prosthesis in vivo performance, e.g. what is the arc (degrees) of active or passive
           motion when prosthetic impingement occurs?

        -  Secondary endpoint(s): these analyses will also allow to: 1) assess ROM of the operated
           hip versus contralateral non operated hip and the effect of prosthetic head diameter and
           any correlation to hip functional scores validated and commonly used in the Literature;
           2) set reproducible criteria for in vivo fluoroscopic analysis of ROM in THA patients.
