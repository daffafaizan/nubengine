    
      Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) can be a lifesaving procedure for the sickest
      patients in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) who are at risk of death from severe cardiac and
      respiratory failure. ECMO is a device which pumps blood out of the body and returns it back
      after adding oxygen and removing carbon dioxide. While potentially life-saving, ECMO is
      associated with high use of critical care resources and increased risk of adverse outcomes in
      survivors.

      The BLENDER Trial is a multicentre trial in ECMO patients to determine whether a conservative
      oxygen strategy during ECMO reduces ICU length of stay and improves patient outcomes compared
      to a liberal oxygen strategy. Both strategies are currently standard practice worldwide,
      however, there is no consensus to which strategy is better for our patients. This trial aims
      to utilise an existing intensive care registry and will recruit 300 patients with life
      threatening acute cardiac or respiratory failure. If the BLENDER Trial confirms that one
      oxygen management strategy is more effective than the other, its findings may improve the
      lives of critically ill Australians and inform clinical practice worldwide.
