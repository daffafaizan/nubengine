        -  Contact Lenses

        -  Medical History

        -  Previous chemotherapy

        -  Vital Signs (weight, height, Karnofsky Performance status, heart rate, blood pressure)

        -  Symptom Assessment (Pre-existing skin and/or eye conditions, CEA measurement (CRC only),
           Disease status (TNM Staging))

        -  Planned chemotherapy regimen

        -  Radiotherapy

      Blood Sample: A 2ml blood sample should be collected in ethylenediamine-tetraacetic acid
      (EDTA) containing Vacutainer at any time before or after starting treatment. DNA will be
      extracted from the samples and the 11 SNPs in the region of the EGFR gene encoding domain III
      will be characterized.

      Follow-up Assessment: with every second cycle of Cetuximab- or Panitumumab-containing regimen
      (CRC: every 2. Week; NSCLC: every 3-4 weeks):

        -  Visit Number and Date

        -  Vital Signs (weight, height, Karnofsky Performance status, heart rate, blood pressure)

        -  Symptom Assessment (CEA measurement (CRC only), Disease status (TMN Staging), Skin
           Toxicity (CTCAE) grading)

        -  Current chemotherapy regimen

        -  Radiotherapy

        -  CEA measurement only for CRC (every second cycle/every 4 weeks)

      Long-term follow-up (up to 5 years):

        -  CT restaging (TNM Staging) should be done 3 monthly for as long as the subject is
           receiving Cetuximab- or Panitumumab- containing regimen or if there is suspicion of
           disease progression.
