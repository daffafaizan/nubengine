    
      The co-primary objectives will be to assess the safety and quality of life under treatment.
      Secondary objectives will be evaluations of geriatric data modifications under treatment,
      efficacy (progression-free survival and overall survival), correlation between toxicity and
      efficacy, and comparison of the safety profiles between various immunotherapy regimens.

      Another secondary objective will be the comparison between patients and clinicians symptom
      reporting. The investigators will also perform a pharmacokinetics analysis on PD1-monoclonal
      antibodies to improve the understanding of PD-1 inhibitors pharmacokinetics for the elderly
      population.

      Finally, toxicity and efficacy will be compared to immunological parameters such as the
      description of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, markers of immunosenescence and inflammation.
