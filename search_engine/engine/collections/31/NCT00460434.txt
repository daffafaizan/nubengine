    
      The overall objective of this randomized clinical trial is to determine whether
      symptom-specific treatment of incontinence after prolapse surgery is equally effective to
      prophylactic treatment by adding TVT® at the time of the prolapse surgery among women with
      anterior vaginal prolapse but without pre-operative symptoms of stress urinary incontinence.

      The primary aims are:

      In stress continent women planning vaginal surgery for pelvic organ prolapse:

        1. To determine if the failure rate defined by subsequent treatment for urinary
           incontinence, signs or symptoms of bothersome urinary incontinence [defined as having at
           least moderate bother for any of 4 Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory (PFDI) incontinence
           items] differs between vaginal prolapse repair and vaginal prolapse repair plus TVT®
           during the first 3 months after the index surgery.

        2. To determine if the prevalence of bothersome urinary incontinence at 12 months after the
           index surgery differs between vaginal prolapse repair and vaginal prolapse repair plus
           TVT®, whether or not there was subsequent treatment for symptoms of urinary
           incontinence; i.e., to determine whether symptom-specific treatment of incontinence
           after prolapse surgery is equally effective to prophylactic treatment by adding a TVT®
           at the time of the prolapse surgery.

        3. To measure the total cost of care and relate the difference in cost of care between the
           two groups to differences in health utilities and health-related quality of life, which
           will allow us to examine the cost-effectiveness of prophylactic use of a TVT® at the
           time of prolapse surgery versus symptom-specific treatment of stress incontinence after
           prolapse surgery.
