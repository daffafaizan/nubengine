      to analyze spontaneous language samples, which allos the identification of qualitative and
      quantitative aspects. The analysis involves the MLU-morphemes, MLU-words and words classes.
      All words produced are analyzed, including interjections, adverbs and adjectives.Word classes
      with grammatical characteristics present lower averages, as prepositions and conjunctions.
      Reference parameters are the ones of the spoken language. The objective assessment with
      qualitative and quantitative data may help the speech and language pathologist/therapist to
      determine therapeutic guidelines to each patient.
