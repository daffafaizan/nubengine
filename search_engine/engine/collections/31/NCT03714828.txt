      OncoVEXGM-CSF or IMLYGICÂ®) in people with a healthy immune system with confirmed low-risk
      squamous cell carcinoma. Usually, low-risk SCC is treated with a surgical procedure, but
      surgery can be challenging when patients have: multiple SCCs on their body, when the SCC is
      on a challenging place on the body to remove or when patients are older or have diseases that
      place them at risk for surgery related complications. Immune therapy is a treatment that uses
      certain parts of a person's immune system to fight disease. Immune therapy is a proven
      therapeutic approach in many cancers, including melanoma, another type of skin cancer.

      Talimogene laherparepvec (TVEC) is made from a modified herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1,
      the "cold sore" virus). The virus' genes were modified in a laboratory so that it produces a
      protein called human granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), which
      multiplies and grows in tumor cells. Human GM-CSF is normally produced by various cells
      within the body and is used as a medicine to treat patients with white blood cell counts that
      are too low. This modified HSV-1 produces a protein that acts on tumor cells and stimulates
      the immune system. TVEC is administered by injection with a needle directly into one or more
      tumors and works by directly destroying cancer cells and enhancing immune response to destroy
      cancer cells.
