      enrol 2500 patients with ischemic or dilated cardiomyopathy and primary prophylactic ICD
      indication for reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) according to current
      guidelines. According to the treating physician's decision and preference which is
      independent from study participation, patients are recruited into one of two groups: patients
      directly prior to first ICD implantation (ICD Group), or patients who are not considered for
      prophylactic ICD treatment by the physician or are considered but refuse ICD treatment
      (Control Group). Patients will undergo simple 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) and Holter ECG
      diagnostics at baseline as well as genetic biobanking at entry to the study. All patients
      will be subsequently followed for at least 1 year and up to 4 years. Co-primary endpoints are
      all-cause mortality and appropriate ICD shocks.
