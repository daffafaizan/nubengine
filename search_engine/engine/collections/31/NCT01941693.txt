        1. To assess the effectiveness of a novel stepped care intervention for alcohol dependent
           patients with co-morbid anxiety and/or depression compared to usual treatment for
           alcohol dependence in promoting abstinence from alcohol and increased quality of life
           and in reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression.

        2. To describe important factors relating to the maintenance of alcohol-related psychiatric
           comorbidity.

      Step 1: All subjects will complete 12 weeks of pharmacotherapy (n = 120) on naltexone (50 mg,
      1 tablet daily), acamprosate (333 mg, 2 tablets 3 times daily, reduced to 4/day for women
      <65kg), or a combination of the two. After a 3 week stabilization period, subjects will
      undergo complete formal assessment for anxiety and depression. Those subjects with a
      diagnosis of anxiety or depressive disorder regardless of drinking outcome will be offered
      the next step of care and followed up at 12-16 weeks.

      Step 2: Subjects to undergo the next step of care (n = 30 per group, 60 in total) will be
      randomized by referring to the consecutively assigned subject identification number to a
      matched numbered envelope containing a random assignment card. Randomization will be
      stratified according to concomitant SSRI use. The treatment groups will be:

        1. Intervention for comorbid anxiety or depression, and

        2. Usual counseling care.
