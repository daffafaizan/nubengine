      experimental drug. We want to see their effects on levels of hormones in the blood and
      prostate. In addition, we will be examining the effects of these drugs on the expression of
      genes within the prostate.

      Acyline suppresses LH and FSH, which are hormones made by the pituitary gland, thus blocking
      the signal from the brain that causes the testes to make testosterone. Therefore, Acyline
      blocks testosterone production. In preliminary studies, a single injection of Acyline
      reversibly lowered the FSH, LH and testosterone levels in the blood for approximately 15
      days. Prolonged low levels of LH and FSH cause suppression of sperm production in normal men.
      However, men may experience some side effects from the low levels of testosterone caused by
      acyline, thus exogenous testosterone is required to sustain normal male androgen and organ
      effects without suppressing spermatogenesis. This combination of drugs is a promising male
      contraceptive regimen. In addition, millions of older men are using testosterone replacement
      to treat male "andropause"; low level testosterone associated with aging. However, the effect
      of testosterone on the prostate is unknown. Studies examining the effect of testosterone on
      the prostate are needed.
