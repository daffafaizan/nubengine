      with known or suspected CAD and establish the ability of the CAD-det System to accurately and
      reliably detect them utilizing coronary computed tomography (CCTA) and invasive coronary
      angiography (ICA) as reference standards. In addition, this study will collect clinical and
      acoustic data of other cardiac pathologies to better understand their impact on the acoustic
      signatures associated with CAD.
