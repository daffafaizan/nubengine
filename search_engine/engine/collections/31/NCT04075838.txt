      south of Taiwan. The recovery-oriented program was conducted by a group leader, a senior
      occupational therapist, with one supervisor and one observer. The program was designed based
      on Pathways to Recovery, a self-help book published by University of Kansas. Participants
      attended a 1-hour class per week. The teaching methods included didactic presentation, peer
      exchange, group discussion, and practice. The group leader, supervisor, and observer reviewed
      the content and participants' performance after each class and made content adjustments if
      needed.
