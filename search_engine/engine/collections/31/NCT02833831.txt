    
      This is a two-part Phase 1 study consisting of a dose escalation part (Part 1) and a TQT part
      (Part 2), performed in two separate panels (Panels 1 and 2). Panel 1 will be a double blind
      (neither the researchers nor the participants know what treatment the participant is
      receiving), randomized (study medication assigned to participants by chance), placebo
      controlled dose escalation study in healthy participants to determine the safety,
      tolerability and pharmacokinetics of ALS-008176 after administration of single doses of 1500
      milligrams (mg), 2500 mg and 3000 mg under fasted conditions. The final dose to be used in
      the Panel 2 will be determined based on the results of this dose escalation part. An interim
      analysis will be conducted on Panel 1 to select the dose for Panel 2. Panel 2 will be a
      double blind, double dummy, randomized, 3 period crossover (the same medications provided to
      all participants but in different sequence), placebo and positive controlled study to
      evaluate the effect of ALS-008176 on the QT/QTc interval in healthy participants.
      Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.
