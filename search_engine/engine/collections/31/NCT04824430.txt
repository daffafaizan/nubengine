    
      Prospective single center observational study. Up to 30 subjects will be enrolled (up to 10
      subjects per time point). Patients who sign the Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved
      consent form who have undergone endometrial ablation within the prior 14 months from time of
      consent will be asked to participate in this study. Patients meeting all eligibility criteria
      will undergo either a 3, 6 or 12 month diagnostic second look hysteroscopy (SLH) as assigned
      by the Investigator depending on the duration of time between the ablation and the signature
      date of the informed consent (up to 10 subjects for each time point). A diagnostic SLH will
      be performed for scoring of intrauterine adhesions by the investigator and an independent
      reviewer. The ability to access the uterine cavity (or not) will be documented.
