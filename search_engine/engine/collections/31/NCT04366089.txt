      In particular, 1) the improvement of the release of oxygen in the peripheral tissues, 2) the
      anti-inflammatory action 3) a virucidal activity have been described.

      In view of these properties, a number of international clinical trials on the topic are
      currently ongoing.

      Hospitalization, dietary changes, use of antibiotics and systemic inflammation related to
      COVID-19 are all variables that contribute to changes in the intestinal and lung microbiota
      with significant repercussions on the outcomes of the disease. Furthermore, the use of ozone
      therapy could also lead to a modification of the microbial flora. Probiotic supplementation
      can help to correct these issues.
