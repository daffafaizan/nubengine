      by insulin glargine alone, exenatide (GLP-1 agonist) alone and the combination of insulin
      glargine and exenatide in subjects taking stable dose of metformin and to evaluate their
      efficacy in terms of improvement in glucose exposure, variability, stability, incidence of
      hypoglycemia and weight management.

      An ancillary study was approved as part of this study. The purpose of the ancillary study was
      to use CGM to characterize the glycemic response to a fixed breakfast meal consumed by study
      participants receiving different medications.
