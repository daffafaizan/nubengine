      now taken as a predictor of increased morbidity and mortality. Preliminary data from patients
      investigated in our department indicate a negative correlation between anemia severity and
      6-minute walking distance. Our working hypothesis is that hemoglobin level correction by
      erythropoietin therapy will improve the effort capacity of patients with COPD and anemia. Our
      objective is to conduct a pilot study of the efficacy of darbepoetin alfa.

      The study will include about 15 patients with COPD recruited at three pulmonology centers
      based on two selection criteria: COPD stage II or III or IV according to GOLD criteria and
      hemoglobin level less than 12 g/dL. Effort capacity will be evaluated chiefly by performing a
      6-minute walking test and by measuring VO2 at maximum exertion on a bicycle ergometer with
      increasing loads. Darbepoetin alfa will be given for 2 months. If the hemoglobin increase is
      less than 1 g/dL after 1 month, the dosage will be increased by 25%.

      Effort parameters will be measured at baseline and after 1 and 2 months of treatment. Among
      secondary objectives, we will evaluate functional ergospirometric parameters and laboratory
      tests for inflammation. Total study duration will not exceed 18 months.
