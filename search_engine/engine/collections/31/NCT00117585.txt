    
      This study is a prospective, quasi-experiment conducted in two consecutive phases. During the
      observation phase, eligible patients are identified and followed through their usual course
      of care in the nursing home/rehabilitation unit. During the intervention phase, patients
      enrolled who have OH will receive the intervention. Patients will be enrolled over two
      research phases and the investigators expect to evaluate 459 subjects. This research program
      will occur over a three-year period.

      Methods:

      During Phase I, baseline prevalence and natural history of OH will be determined by:
      enrolling consecutive appropriate subjects (able to stand, not end of life care) from a
      rehabilitation and nursing home unit and measuring OH 3 times weekly over their inpatient
      stay. In addition, chart review of diagnoses, medications, functional status, nutrition, and
      adverse events will be evaluated and correlated with clinical status. During Phase II, the
      investigators will implement a standardized, interdisciplinary (MD/RN/PT/Dietician) treatment
      plan for patients with OH. This will include chart review of diagnoses, medications,
      functional status, nutrition, adverse events, and correlation with clinical status. The goals
      of the interventions are to identify and treat the underlying causes of OH in rehabilitation
      patients. Based upon the comprehensive assessment, intervention participants will receive a
      standardized, interdisciplinary treatment regime.
