      monitoring visits. They will then be contacted by phone or by mail for an appointment with
      their mother for more oral and written information consisting of an information notice and
      informed consent form. The recruitment of Turner syndrome patients will be based on the
      Reference Centre for Rare Endocrine Growth Disorders (AP-HP, Robert Debr√©, Armand Trousseau
      and Necker hospitals).

      The parental origin of the remaining X chromosome will be analyzed using microsatellite
      analysis and comparison of the profile of the patient and her mother.

      Statistical analysis will be conducted under the supervision of Professor C. ALBERTI using
      commonly accepted standards. All tests will be bilateral. Given the exploratory nature of the
      study, a significance threshold of 10% will be used. Statistical analyzes will be performed
      using SAS software V 9.2.
