    
      Following randomization (Day 0), 60 kidney transplant recipients of deceased or live kidneys
      will be randomized 1:2 into control and study- experimental arm. In control arm, named
      Tacrolimus BID arm, tacrolimus will be administered unchanged twice daily, morning and
      evening, while in study--experimental group named Tacrolimus QD- Advagraf, the Advagraf
      tacrolimus formulation will be administered once daily in the morning. In both groups doses
      will be adjusted to maintain tacrolimus trough levels at 10-12 ng/mL (days 1-28), 8-10 ng/mL
      (days 29-168) and 6-8 ng/mL thereafter for both treatment arms.

      Adjunct immunosuppression. Per-protocol rejection prophylaxis: All patients will receive
      Basiliximab induction at 20mg/bw on days 0 and 4. Methylprednisolone will be administered as
      intravenous bolus doses of 500 mg , 250 mg and 125 mg perioperatively, on days 0,1 and 2.
      Thereafter oral prednisone will be given: 20 mg/day (days 2-14), 15 mg/day (days 15-30), 10
      mg/day (days 30-45), 7.5 mg/day (days 45-60) and 5 mg/day thereafter. MMF (2 g BID) will be
      started preoperatively, and reduced to 500 mg three times daily after 14-30 days.

      Rejection treatment: First-line acute rejection (AR) therapy with corticosteroids will be
      administered at the dose of 500 mg/day for 3 days. Mono- and/or polyclonal antibodies could
      be used as therapy for corticosteroid-resistant AR. First-line antibody therapy will be
      permitted only if biopsy indicate a severe vascular rejection (Banff IIB or III).

      Prophylactic treatment:

      Prophylactic antiviral treatment with oral ganciclovir 450 mg/day, and PCP prevention with
      400 mg Sulfamethoxazole and 80 mg of Trimethoprim/day will be given to all patients on days
      1-90.

      Endpoints.

      The primary endpoint:

      • adherence to the Tacrolimus administration defined as self-reported number of missed drug
      ingestions scored in Morisky Medical Adherence Assessment questionnaire

      Secondary endpoints:

      • efficacy failure defined as biopsy proven rejection, renal function, incidence of adverse
      events (AEs) and graft loss or death at the end of the analysis period

      Statistical analysis The data collected will be analyzed with Fisher's exact test, Wilcoxon'
      matched pair test and Kaplan-Meier's test
