        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of topotecan when administered with cisplatin in
           patients with advanced cervical cancer.

        -  Identify any unique toxicities associated with administering radiotherapy along with
           adjuvant cisplatin and topotecan in patients with cervical cancer.

        -  Determine the feasibility of administering continuous infusion topotecan chemotherapy
           together with radiation therapy.

        -  Assess the quality of life of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of topotecan.

      Patients undergo radiotherapy once daily on days 1-5, 8-12, 15-19, 22-26, 29-33, and 36. Some
      patients may also undergo brachytherapy. Patients also receive cisplatin intravenously (IV)
      over 1 hour on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, and 36 and topotecan IV continuously on days 1-5, 8-12,
      15-19, 22-26, 29-33, and 36. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of topotecan until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline and at 4 and 14 weeks after completion of study
      treatment.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.
