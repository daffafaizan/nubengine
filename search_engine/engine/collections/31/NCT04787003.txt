    
      Phase Ia:

      This is a prospective, multicenter, open-label, single-arm investigator-initiated clinical
      study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intratumoral injection of OVV-01 injection in
      patients with advanced solid tumors.

      This study plans to enroll in 1 ~ 3 study sites nationwide about 9 ~ 18 patients with
      advanced solid tumors for whom the standard treatment failed and currently no standard
      treatment is available or standard treatment is not suitable due to medical reasons, to
      conduct a phase Ia study, i.e., the First in Human (FIH) trial of OVV-01 injection, using the
      traditional "3 + 3" approach for dose gradient exploration.

      Phase Ib:

      This is a prospective, multi-center, open-label, single-arm investigator-initiated clinical
      study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intratumoral injection of OVV-01 injection
      combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors in patients with advanced solid tumors.

      This study plans to enroll in 1 ~ 3 study sites nationwide about 12 ~ 24 patients with
      advanced solid tumors for whom the standard treatment failed and currently no standard
      treatment is available or standard treatment is not suitable due to medical reasons, to
      conduct a phase Ib study, using the traditional "3 + 3" approach and based on the phase Ia
      results, 2 dose gradients of OVV-01 are used in combination with pembrolizumab and
      atezolizumab, respectively, to explore the efficacy and safety.

      Phase Ic:

      This is a prospective, multi-center, open-label, single-arm investigator-initiated clinical
      study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intratumoral injection of OVV-01 injection
      combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors in patients with advanced solid tumors.

      This study plans to enroll in 1 ~ 3 study sites nationwide about 15 ~ 20 patients with
      advanced solid tumors for whom the standard treatment failed and currently no standard
      treatment is available or standard treatment is not suitable due to medical reasons, to
      conduct a phase Ic study.
