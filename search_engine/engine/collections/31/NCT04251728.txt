      stages. As consequence, patients may experience orthostatic hypotension and/or arterial
      hypertension in the supine posture, especially at night. Thus, the management of dysautonomia
      in patients with PD is challenging.

      Automated mechanical peripheral stimulation (AMPS) has been recently proposed as therapy for
      motor and cardiovascular improvements in patients with PD. On the other hand, physical
      exercise has been recommended for patients with PD showing to be effective in improving
      physical conditioning and cognitive function.

      However, the combined effects of AMPS and exercise on cardiovascular variables and functional
      capacity of patients with PD are still unknown.

      Therefore, volunteers will be randomly allocated into two groups: 1) exercise group: will be
      submitted to a program of 24 exercise sessions, along with 2 weekly sessions of SHAM AMPS for
      12 weeks. 2) AMPS groups: will be submitted to the program of 24 exercise sessions, along
      with 2 weekly sessions of AMPS during the same period.

      AMPS sessions will be held prior to exercise sessions. Before and after the 12-week program,
      all volunteers will be submitted to assessments of cardiac autonomic control, timed up and
      go, and cardiopulmonary exercise testing to assess aerobic functional capacity.

      The hypothesis is that the exercise program combined with AMPS therapy will provide greater
      improvement on the cardiovascular function and aerobic functional capacity in patients with
      PD, than the exercise program alone.
