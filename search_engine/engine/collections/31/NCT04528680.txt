      initial low dose of paclitaxel will be given following sonication. In select patients, the
      sonication procedure will occur immediately after the test dose of chemotherapy is
      administered.The sonication device will be implanted at the end of the procedure. About two
      weeks after surgery, patients will undergo sonication and albumin-bound paclitaxel
      administration with MRI to quantify extent of blood brain barrier opening. Sonication and
      administration of albumin-bound paclitaxel will continue every 3 weeks until disease
      progression. The planned ABX starting dose is 40 mg/m2 of ABX, to be escalated in the absence
      of significant toxicity up to 260 mg/m2. Blood samples for circulating tumor DNA will also be
      collected before and after each sonication.
