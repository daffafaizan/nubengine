    
      1. Visual field testing will be performed.

        2. Structural analysis of the retinal nerve fiber layer (through confocal microscopy)will
           be performed.

        3. Color Doppler Imaging of the retrobulbar vessels will be performed. Peak and end
           diastolic velocities, resistivity index will be calculated from the Doppler waveform.

        4. B-scan ultrasound of the optic nerve sheath diameter will be performed. the measure will
           take place at 3mm behind the globe.
