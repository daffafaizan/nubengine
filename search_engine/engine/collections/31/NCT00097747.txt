      stimulating agent, with approximately 7 treatment cohorts and 7 healthy volunteer
      participants per cohort. In each cohort of 7 participants, a ratio of 5:2 participants was
      randomly assigned to receive a single dose of peginesatide or placebo, respectively,
      administered as an intravenous infusion. Planned peginesatide dose levels were to escalate by
      cohort. The study was conducted at a single clinical center.
