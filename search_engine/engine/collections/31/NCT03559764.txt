    
      Multiple myeloma（MM） is one of the most common malignant diseases in the blood system.There
      is still no cure for the disease which only control the development of the disease in various
      ways.CAR - T cells was taken in the form of genetic modification, and specific identified
      target antigen monoclonal antibody of single variable region (scFv) expression in T cell
      surface, and coupled with the activation of intracellular proliferation signal domain. The
      study will follow a 3 + 3 design of dose-escalating cohorts. After a patient
      enrolls,leukapheresis will be performed to obtain peripheral blood mononuclear cells which
      will be sent to a manufacturing site to produce anti- BCMA CAR T cells. The cells will then
      be returned to the investigational site and, after a standard chemotherapy based conditioning
      regimen, will be administered to the patient. Treated patients will undergo serial
      measurements of safety, tolerability and response.

      In order to lay a foundation for the application of relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma
      patients with CAR-T therapy，objects are refractory/ relapsed patients with multiple
      myeloma,and plans to into the group of the number of cases in 20 cases.
