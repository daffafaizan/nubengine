      intensity determined by Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing (CPET) and its role on the
      functional status in ALS patients versus standard care. Additionally, the investigators
      explored the performance of CPET variables - oxygen uptake (VO2) expressed in L/min, in
      percentage of predicted or in metabolic equivalents (METs) at peak effort, at anaerobic
      threshold (AT), the respiratory compensation point (RCP) when achieved, Dioxide Carbon output
      in L/min (VCO2) and the minute ventilation in L/min (VE) throughout the study.

      Assessments:(diagnostic visit - T0), at study entry (T1) and 6 months after (T2) using:

      Functional status by Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale-Revised
      (ALSFRS-R), Respiratory function tests (RFT): Forced Vital Capacity predicted (%FVC) and
      Oxygen saturation provided by pulse oximetry.

      CPET was performed in both groups at study entry and 6 months later (T1 and T2), using a
      treadmill (WOODWAY®) coupled with a gas exchange analyzer (METALYZER® 3B) with
      ergo-spirometry system using a breath-by-breath technology developed by CORTEX® systems.

      Intervention:

      G1(Interventional group) performed moderate exercise protocol two times/week in a treadmill
      in the lower range of the training zone determined by CPET + standard care (range of motion
      exercise, gait and balance training under continuous pulse oximetry observation).

      G2 (control group) performed a standard care exercise program at home or at other
      rehabilitation units without pulse oximetry observation.
