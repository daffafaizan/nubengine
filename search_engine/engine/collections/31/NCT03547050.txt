      types of epilepsy, some common, some rare. Most epilepsies arise in childhood and have a
      genetic cause. Approximately 25% of child patients have "Rolandic Epilepsy" or RE, also known
      as Benign Epilepsy with Centrotemporal Spikes (BECTS). RE has a complex genetic basis,
      probably made up of combinations of susceptibility variants in different genes. Children with
      RE quite often have other symptoms that affect their speech, attention, reading ability or
      coordination. The goal of this study is to find the genetic basis for susceptibility to
      seizures and associated comorbidities for RE using genomewide association approaches.

      We know that RE has a genetic basis and we recently discovered the genetic cause of the EEG
      pattern seen in RE. The goal of REGAIN is to now find the genetic basis for susceptibility to
      seizures and the associated symptoms above. Our hope is to be able to improve diagnosis and
      understand why each child with RE is different, and perhaps point us towards new treatments
      that are more effective and have fewer side effects.

      We will compare the genetic code of 3,000 children with RE against a similar number of people
      not affected by epilepsy. With the proposed large sample of participants, we will be able to
      pinpoint the exact changes that might lead to seizures or attention problems for example.
      Learning the genetic basis for these problems will deepen our understanding of the mechanisms
      and lead to new treatments or cures.
