        -  Determine the objective response rate and toxicity in patients with androgen-independent
           metastatic prostate cancer treated with gemcitabine hydrochloride and docetaxel.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.

      Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8 followed by
      docetaxel IV over 60 minutes on day 8. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to 6 courses in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for at least 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 36 patients will be accrued for this study.
