    
      Principal Objective : To evaluate the complete molecular remission persistence after stopping
      imatinib during six months as measured by RT-PCR negative for bcr-abl transcripts in patients
      with Chronic Myeloid Leukemia .

      Secondary Objective :

        -  To determine clinicals factors associated with complete molecular remission before and
           after stopping imatinib in patients with Chronic Myeloid Leukemia.

        -  To determine the biologics factors (immunologic and molecular) associated with complete
           molecular remission before and after stopping imatinib in patients with Chronic Myeloid
           Leukaemia.

        -  To determine the molecular relapse level after more than six month of persistent
           complete molecular remission without imatinib.

        -  To determine the complete molecular remission length.

        -  To evaluate medical and economical impact of stopping imatinib treatment.
