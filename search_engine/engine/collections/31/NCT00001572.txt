      marker, and a previous pilot study in lymphoma patients has demonstrated that autologous Id
      protein can be formulated into an immunogenic, tumor specific antigen by conjugation to a
      carrier protein (KLH) and administration with an emulsion-based adjuvant.

      The objectives of this study are: 1) to evaluate feasibility and toxicity of new vaccine
      formulations, and 2) to evaluate cellular and humoral immune responses against the unique
      idiotype of the patient's lymphoma.

      The goal of this study is to treat patients with follicular lymphomas to complete remission
      or minimal residual disease with chemotherapy. Six to twelve months after completion of
      chemotherapy, in an effort to reduce the relapse rate (by eradicating microscopic disease
      resistant to chemotherapy), patients will receive one of two new formulations of an
      autologous Id vaccine.
