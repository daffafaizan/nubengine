      times a day for four days, CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE via the central venous line once a day for two
      days, and MELPHALAN via the central venous line for one day. Busulfan, cyclophosphamide, and
      melphalan are given to destroy the subject's leukemia. As well, these drugs will destroy the
      subject's own immune system to help ensure the new bone marrow takes and grows after
      transplantation.

      On the day of transplantation, bone marrow or umbilical cord blood from the donor will arrive
      to the bone marrow transplant unit and be transfused via venous line. These new cells will
      replace the subject's bone marrow.
