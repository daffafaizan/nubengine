      commonly is expressed as either meningococcal meningitis, an inflammation of the membranes
      surrounding the brain and spinal cord, or meningococcemia, the presence of bacteria in the
      blood. The most common symptoms include high fever, headache, neck stiffness, confusion,
      nausea, vomiting, lethargy, and rash. If not treated the disease can progress rapidly and can
      lead to shock and death, often within hours of the onset of symptoms. Neisseria meningitidis
      capsular polysaccharides are poor immunogens. However, conjugation of bacterial
      polysaccharides to immunogenic carrier proteins generally results in conjugates that induce
      strong anti-polysaccharide T-helper cell dependent immune responses, creating a
      longer-lasting immune response and thus protection against meningococcal infection. This
      study compares safety and antibody production induced by one intramuscular injection of
      either NmVac4-A/C/Y/W-135-DT or a licensed meningococcal A/C/Y/W-135-DT conjugate vaccine.
      Participants will attend a screening visit up to 4 weeks prior to Day 0, then will attend
      study visits for 8 weeks. There will be a study phone call at Days 2-3, then a post-study
      telephone call to subjects to assess safety at 26 weeks.
