      straining during defecation, bloating, abdominal discomfort, and sensation of incomplete
      evacuation.

      Constipation has been reported as a common complication of diabetic neuropathy. A new
      medication, called linaclotide, was studied on many patients, and it is approved to be on a
      market for constipated patients. Unfortunately diabetics were not included in these previous
      studies; hence we designed the project which is going to address the possible benefit of this
      drug in diabetic population.
