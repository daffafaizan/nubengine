      toxicity of levobupivacaine and ropivacaine at the same anesthetic potency. The are actually
      no studies in humans confronting levobupivacaine and ropivacaine under the aspect of efficacy
      and toxicity.The aim of the study is the assessment of the systemic absorption of local
      anesthetics during continuous epidural infusion for postoperative pain control.

      Primary outcome:

      Assessment of the plasmatic equimolar concentrations of levobupivacaine and ropivacaine
      during continuous epidural infusion

      Secondary outcome:

      Assessment of the safety level of the local anesthetic (major difference between haematic
      concentration of the local anesthetic and neuro-cardiotoxic dose).

      Difference of the analgesic efficacy between levobupivacaine and ropivacaine. Differences in
      collateral effects due to the local anesthetic: hypotension and sensitive block.
