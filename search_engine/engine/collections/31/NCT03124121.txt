    
      The study will involve two study groups designed to offer insights into the pharmacokinetics
      of golimumab during induction and maintenance therapy:

      Cohort 1: Patients commencing golimumab induction therapy will be included in a prospective,
      observational study.

      Cohort 2: Patients receiving golimumab maintenance therapy will be included in a
      cross-sectional, observational study.

      Primary objective: To define a week 6 serum golimumab concentration that predicts response at
      week 14.

      Secondary objective: To define serum golimumab concentrations at weeks 6, 10 and 14 that
      predict response at each time point, respectively and at week 14.

      Exploratory objectives:

      Correlations between serum golimumab concentrations and novel disease activity indices
      (PRO2), biochemical markers of disease activity (CRP, faecal calprotectin) and quality of
      life indices (IBD-Q and IBD-Control).

      Correlations between the presence of anti-golimumab antibodies, serum golimumab
      concentrations and UC disease activity.

      This study will also generate data that can be used to validate a commercially available
      golimumab assay as well as a novel patient reported outcome (PRO) assessment of clinical UC
      disease activity.
