      Due to the degeneration of basal ganglia, patients with Parkinson's disease also demonstrate
      internal rhythm dysfunction, thus will lead to difficulty in rhythmic movements such as
      ambulation. To improve the rhythmic movement problems, auditory cues are often used in
      clinical setting and have been revealed providing benefits in ambulation and freezing
      problems for PD subjects. Besides, treadmill training is another common intervention to
      improve gait performance for PD. However, lack studies investigate the effects of auditory
      cues with locomotion training on brain neurophysiology and scarcer studies investigate the
      different effects of auditory cues between the freezers and non-freezers.

      Objective: To investigate the effects of auditory-cued training on cortical excitability and
      motor performances in patients with PD. To investigate whether different effects of auditory
      cues on cortical excitability and motor performance between the freezers and non-freezers.

      Methods: We will recruit 17 freezers, 17 non-freezers and 17 healthy elderly. Each
      participants will receive the trainings under two conditions in random order. There is one
      week wash-out period between two-trainings. Two-training are (1) treadmill training with
      concurrent auditory cues: participants should walk on the treadmill according to the rhythmic
      auditory cues (110% step frequency) for 30 min. (2) treadmill training without any auditory
      cues: participants should walk in comfortable speed on the treadmill for 30 min. Assessments
      consist of cortical excitability through transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS),
      stepping-in-place test, and walking test, and they will be done before and after training.
