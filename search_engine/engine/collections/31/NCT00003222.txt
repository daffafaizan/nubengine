      pulsed on autologous dendritic cells versus vaccination with synthetic melanoma peptides plus
      sargramostim (GM-CSF) in decreasing tumor burden in patients with high risk melanoma (pulsed
      autologous dendritic cell arm closed 1/8/2001). II. Determine whether these regimens result
      in increased tumor specific immune responses as measured in vitro and in vivo. III. Determine
      whether these regimens stimulate T-cell responses in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open label study. Patients are included in treatment arm II only (arm I
      closed 1/8/2001): Arm I: Patients undergo leukapheresis to collect dendritic cells. Patients
      receive a mixture of synthetic melanoma peptides (gp100 antigen, tyrosinase, and tetanus
      peptides) pulsed on autologous dendritic cells IV and subcutaneously (SC). Arm II: Patients
      receive a mixture of synthetic melanoma peptides (gp100 antigen, tyrosinase, and tetanus
      peptides) and sargramostim (GM-CSF) emulsified in Montanide ISA-51 SC and intradermally.
      Patients receive vaccination during weeks 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 for a total of 6 doses and
      interleukin-2 SC daily on days 7-49. Patients receive 3 additional vaccinations at different
      sites not involved with the tumor concurrently with the first 3 vaccinations. Patients are
      evaluated at 8 weeks, 12 weeks, 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 27-54 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
