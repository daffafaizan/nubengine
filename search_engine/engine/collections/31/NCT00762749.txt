      treatment or group. Twenty-four (24) children, ages 2 to < 12 years, and 12 adolescents, ages
      12 to < 18 years, with symptoms due to hay fever or other upper respiratory allergies will
      complete the study. To ensure that younger children are represented, at least 35% (8) of the
      children enrolled will range from 2 to < 6 years of age.
