      regenerate the endometrium in patients with Asherman's Syndrome, Endometrial Atrophy or any
      condition that produce a destruction of the endometrium or its de novo creation in a
      bioengineered uterus.

      It requires a previous mobilization in the peripheral blood of CD133+ autologous bone marrow
      stem cells, subsequent apheresis and transplant of the same cells in the spiral arterioles of
      the uterus with the aim to regenerate de novo the endometrium. This technique represents a
      new therapeutical approach for the treatment of endometrial regeneration problems such
      Asherman Syndrome and the endometrial atrophy since currently no specific treatment for these
      endometrial pathologies exist.

      A prospective experimental non controlled study has been designed in order to assess the
      effectiveness of these technique as a new tool for treat Asherman's Syndrome and Endometrial
      Atrophy.
