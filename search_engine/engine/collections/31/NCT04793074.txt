      Egypt. The study protocol was approved by the local ethical committee and all patients gave
      informed consent before enrollment.

      The study included 60 patients with CVU. Patients were diagnosed on the basis of clinical
      findings and vascular Doppler ultrasonography. Exclusion criteria were associated infection
      and associated ulcers of other etiologies. Patients randomization was achieved using computer
      generated numbers and sealed envelope technique. Randomization and patients' allocation to
      the study interventions was performed by an independent researcher who wasn't aware of the
      study interventions and outcome.

      Upon recruitment, patients were subjected to careful history taking, thorough clinical
      examination, standard laboratory investigations and vascular ultrasound examination. The
      recorded parameters included demographic data (age, sex and body mass index), associated
      morbidities, duration and size of CVU and history of previous interventions.

      After randomization, patients in the treatment group (n=30) had transforming nanoparticle
      dressing while the control group (n=30) received conventional compression dressing. Before
      applications of both dressings, the wound area was thoroughly cleaned. In the treatment
      group, the dressing powder was applied as a thin layer to the ulcer surface. Any excess
      powder surrounding the ulcer area was removed. In both groups, a secondary protective gauze
      dressing was applied. Patients were follow up at weekly intervals until complete healing
      occurs.

      The primary end-point in the present study is the time to complete healing. The secondary
      end-point the rate of healing (percent of reduction in ulcer area).
