      enter Phase A, the 20 week open acute treatment phase that uses a flexible dose regimen of
      haloperidol 1-5 mg daily. Haloperidol is started at an oral dose of 1 mg daily, with
      subsequent dose titration in 1 mg increments until the optimal dose is reached, i.e., optimal
      trade-off between efficacy and side effects. At the end of Phase A, patients who do not meet
      criteria for clinical response exit the protocol and is treated openly with alternative
      medications.

      Phase A responders enter Phase B, a 24-week random assignment, placebo-controlled,
      continuation trial. Randomization is stratified by the severity of dementia and by the
      presence of psychosis. Half the patients are randomized to haloperidol (continuing at the
      same dose as at the end of Phase A), and the other half are randomized to placebo. Patients
      who relapse during Phase B exit the protocol and receive open treatment.

      In Phase A, patients are followed at 0, 2, 4 weeks and every 4 weeks thereafter until 20
      weeks. In the discontinuation trial, Phase B, patients are followed at 0, 1, 2, 4, week time
      points and every 4 weeks thereafter until 24 weeks. If a patient shows signs of relapse, the
      patient is brought in for more frequent visits, regardless of the stage of the protocol.
