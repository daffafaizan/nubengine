    
      The study design is randomized stratified, double blind, placebo-controlled.

      A group of children and adolescents with DD will be selected and randomly assigned to three
      different conditions: 1. tRNS over bilateral DLPFC + cognitive training (Brainstim DLPFC); 2.
      tRNS over bilateral PPC (Brainstim PPC) + cognitive training; 3. sham tRNS (bilateral
      DLPFC/bilateral PPC; Brainstim Sham) + cognitive training.

      In this project, the investigators will work to understand whether a brain-based
      intervention, with the use of tRNS, combined to a usual treatment can improve the outcome of
      individual with DD.

      The protocol will allow the investigators to:

        1. testing the critical role of two brain regions (DLPFC or PPC) usually involved in
           numerical abilities and disrupted in individuals with DD;

        2. examining the neural changes (using EEG recordings) due to cognitive training without
           tRNS (Brainstim Sham) and with tRNS (Brainstim DLPFC; Brainstim PPC);

        3. predicting training outcomes based on math-related skills;

        4. testing the critical role of neural markers at developmental ages using a closed-loop
           tRNS to improve learning and cognitive outcomes from the training;

        5. investigating the safety and tolerability of tRNS.

      The investigator's overarching goal is to provide a scientific foundation for devising new
      rehabilitation strategies in DD.
