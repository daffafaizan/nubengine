      University, (the date and protocol number assigned by this ethics committee were March 4,
      2008 and 5/30, respectively),written informed consent was obtained from patients undergoing
      elective scheduled operations involving craniotomy during anaesthesia consultations. Ninety
      American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Physical Status classification system I or II
      patients of either sex between 18-85 years of age were allocated to this randomised,
      prospective, placebo-controlled, double-blind study. The patients were randomly divided into
      three groups using a sealed-enveloped technique to receive either 20 ml of 0.5% bupivacaine
      (Group B (n=30)), 20 ml of 0.5% levobupivacaine (Group L (n=30)) or saline as a placebo
      (Group C (n=30)). Twenty-millilitre syringes for the block were prepared and numbered by a
      blinded assistant.
