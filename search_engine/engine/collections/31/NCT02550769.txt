      recovery with less morbidity and shorter hospital stay compared with open surgery. However in
      laparoscopic low rectal surgery, overall conversion to open surgery is around 20%. Transanal
      TME (T-TME) combined with laparoscopy, called hybrid-NOTES, is a less invasive procedure that
      responds to some of the limitations of the rectal laparoscopic approach.

      MAIN OBJECTIVE: To analyze that the T-TME gets a faster recovery due to a lower conversion
      rate to open surgery than laparoscopic low anterior resection (L-LAR) in rectal cancer with
      the same pathological, functional and oncologic results.

      METHODOLOGY: A prospective multicenter randomized controlled study of patients diagnosed with
      adenocarcinoma of the rectum that after inclusion and exclusion criteria, were randomized in
      the T-TME- and L-LAR group. The main variables are: general morbidity, anastomotic
      dehiscence, conversion rate to open surgery and hospital stay. The other variables studied
      were: demographic, surgical, pathological, 30-day morbidity and mortality, quality of life
      and oncologic results. The sample calculation is 53 patients per group. With an estimated
      loss of 10%, the final number will be 116 patients.
