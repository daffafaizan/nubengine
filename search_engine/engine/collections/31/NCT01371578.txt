    
      In September 2011, the FDA requested that Gilead make several major changes to this study
      because of side effects experienced by two patients in other Gilead studies.

      In 2 HCV-infected people that were given tegobuvir with another experimental medication plus
      interferon and ribavirin, big reductions in the number of white blood cells, red blood cells
      and platelets were seen. Because these cases might have been related to tegobuvir when given
      with interferon, ribavirin and another direct antiviral agent, tegobuvir is no longer being
      given to people with these other medications in this study.

      As a result, the study is now open label which means both you and your study doctor will know
      the medication you will be receiving and Arms 1 and 3 have been discontinued from the study.

      All subjects enrolled in the study as of September 2nd 2011 will receive Response Guided
      Therapy (RGT) with both GS-5885 and GS-9451 plus PEG and RBV.
