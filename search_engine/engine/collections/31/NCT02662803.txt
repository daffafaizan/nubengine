    
      Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a prevalent psychiatric condition and characterized by
      worrying of several topics of the daily life as well as stress-induced somatic symptoms (e.g.
      headache or musculoskeletal pain). Disturbed monoaminergic neurotransmission, changes in
      central information processing and altered levels of stress markers were reported as to be
      biological correlates of GAD or other stress-related disorders. Cognitive behavioral therapy
      is the first-line treatment in GAD, but it seems to be less effective than in other anxiety
      disorders. There is, however, some evidence for an anxiolytic activity of aerobe exercise. In
      this context, different forms of aerobe training were found to be associated with significant
      reduction of clinical symptoms in panic disorder, agoraphobia or social phobia as well as a
      normalisation of some of its pathophysiological markers.

      In this study, 20 patients with GAD will receive a high-intensive aerobe training (HIT, 6
      HIT-sessions of 20 minutes within a period of 12 days). Additionally, 20 GAD-patients will
      undergo a less intense aerobe training matched regarding frequency and duration of sessions.
      Prior to the first training session, after completing the training (day 12) and 30 days after
      baseline, symptoms of anxiety and somatisation will assessed by using established
      questionnaires. Moreover, saliva samples and electroencephalogram (EEG) will performed at the
      same times of assessment in order to evaluating changes of cortisol, alpha amylase, "mismatch
      negativity" and loudness dependence auditory evoked potentials.

      We hypothesize, that GAD-patients which undergo HIT, will show a stronger and more sustained
      improvement of both, clinical symptoms and formally altered electrophysiological and
      endocrinological parameters.
