      each should play in health care contexts are associated with greater patient satisfaction,
      greater trust in the provider, and greater treatment adherence. Extending this work by
      examining the effect of patient-provider attitudinal similarity on patients' diabetic and
      blood pressure control over an 18 month period is important because management of patients
      with co-morbid hypertension (HTN) and diabetes (DM) is a costly and clinically challenging
      task within the VA health system. Self-report questionnaires will be used to assess VA
      providers' beliefs about their own preferences for patient-provider role orientation in care,
      whereas interviews will be used to measure veterans' beliefs about their preferences for
      patient-provider role orientation in their care, satisfaction with their care, and
      self-reported treatment adherence. Data regarding health services use, prescription refills
      (a measure of adherence), and 18-month means of blood pressure and hemoglobin A1c will be
      collected from veterans' medical records. The study represents a critical step toward
      understanding how patient and provider attitudes toward care might be explicitly assessed and
      incorporated into the evidence-based health care delivery process to enhance the management
      of chronic illnesses and overall health among veterans.
