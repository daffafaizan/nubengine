      cardiogenic pulmonary edema. The appropriate interface is necessary to provide comfort and
      lead to the success of NIV.

      NIV delivered via facemask had been used widely. However, it was associated with leaks and
      discomfort to the patient.

      Helmet continuous positive airway pressure (hCPAP) is an NIV interface that allows the
      provision of high airway pressures with a minimal leak.
