      healthcare facilities and account for approximately 40% of the nosocomial infections. This
      investigation is a multi-center, blinded, prospective, randomized, controlled, parallel
      comparison of the intervention catheter (Tyco Healthcare DOVER Silver Foley catheter) to a
      usual care catheter and another commercially available silver-coated catheter. 1000 subjects
      total will be randomized at the multiple study centers.
