      to meet their high energy requirement and avoid aspiration of nutrition due to their immature
      suck/swallow reflex. When providing nutrition via an NG or OG tube, there are two basic
      safety issues; accurate placement, determined by the end of the tube reaching the mid
      abdominal area, and verification methods to assure placement is optimal. Based on a review of
      relevant literature, a potentially more accurate method of tube placement is available than
      the method used in current practice. We hypothesize the graph method will result in a more
      accurate and less variable placement of the NG tube into the mid-stomach of preterm infants
      than the current standard using the NEM method.
