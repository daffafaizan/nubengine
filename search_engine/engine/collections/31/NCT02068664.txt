      neglect may affect stroke recovery. One example of this heterogeneous condition: Individuals
      with spatial neglect often pay more attention to one side of what they are looking at, even
      though they have no difficulty seeing. The study investigators would like to screen stroke
      survivors with aphasia because they may also have spatial neglect (right neglect after left
      hemisphere stroke), which is said by the literature to occur in 25% of cases. If it is
      identified, a treatment approach will be offered, to attempt to remediate the condition using
      prism goggles, following a prism treatment protocol based on previous studies.
