    
      This is a prospective, controlled, multi-centered, 12 months post-implantation study. A
      maximum of 15 sites will enroll a total of 136 patients.

      All study participants will have the study device surgically implanted. After implant
      surgery, study participants will return to the clinic for evaluation 30 days after surgery,
      three months after surgery, six months after surgery and twelve months after surgery. At the
      baseline, three, six and twelve month visits the patient's Parkinson's symptoms and ability
      to perform daily activities will be evaluated using a number of accepted assessment tools
      including a Dyskinesia diary, evaluation of PD symptoms, quality of life scoring and patient
      extension study to monitor the safety and efficacy of the ANS Libra/Libra Deep Brain
      Stimulation System.

      After the 1 year study, patients may enter another protocol (C-06-04) to continue to monitor
      the safety and efficacy of the Libra Deep Brain Stimulation System. Patients may be followed
      for an additional 4 years.

      If necessary, patients may continue to have access to the investigational device under
      protocol (C-13-02) which allows for compassionate use access to it.
