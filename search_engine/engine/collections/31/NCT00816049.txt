      with ALL in comparison with the ALL-2000 protocol and previous NOPHO protocols.

      The specific and primary objectives of the randomised study is:

      To increase the fraction of patients, who become MRD-negative during consolidation for the
      non-HR ALL group through individualised intensification of the 6MP-dosage days 30-85. We will
      additionally measure EFS and toxicity as secondary end points of effect.
