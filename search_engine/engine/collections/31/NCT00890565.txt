    
      Granisetron is a well tested and established 5-HT3 receptor antagonist used in both oral and
      intravenous (IV) forms. A transdermal form of granisetron (SancusoÂ®) was approved by the
      United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in September 2008.

      Many of the 5-HT3 antagonists were developed and approved before the adoption of the
      International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) E14 standard on QTc and cardiac testing. The
      association of non-cardiac medicinal products with the potential to prolong the QT interval
      and induce torsades des pointes (TdP) has significant implications for the future development
      of medicinal products.
