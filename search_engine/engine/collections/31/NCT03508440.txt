      practice guidelines for treatment of facial nerve paralysis recommend a 10 day course of oral
      steroids +/- oral acyclovir. Treatment should begin within 72 hours of symptom onset. In
      patients with complete facial paralysis, electrodiagnostic testing should be offered to the
      patient (1-2). In patients with 90% degeneration on electroneuronography (ENoG) testing,
      facial nerve decompression may be considered but is not a current recommendation.

      In 1973, Bryant reported on ten cases where intratympanic steroid injection was used for the
      treatment of Bell's palsy (3). All but one of these patients had complete recovery of their
      facial nerve function. The remaining patient had 75% recovery. None of these patients
      suffered complications from the injections. The next study published on intratympanic steroid
      injection for Bell's palsy was not published until 2014 (4). It was a randomized control
      trial that divided patients into standard treatment (oral steroids and acyclovir) versus
      standard treatment with intratympanic steroid injection. There was not a statistically
      significant difference between the complete recovery rate of the control group and of the
      intratympanic steroid group; however, the time to recovery was significantly shorter in the
      intratympanic steroid injection group as compared to the control group. Limitations of this
      study include small sample size and high attrition rate.

      There have not been any other studies published in the literature looking at improving facial
      nerve recovery in idiopathic facial nerve paralysis with the use of intratympanic steroid
      injections.
