      the leading causes of disability worldwide. Effective psychological interventions for OCD
      exist, but the prevailing option (Exposure and Response Prevention; ERP) has changed very
      little since it was established in the 1960's; moreover, it is associated with unacceptably
      high numbers of individuals who drop out from, or refuse the treatment altogether. This is
      largely because ERP is a difficult treatment, wherein individuals face their fears with
      increasing difficulty over time. Just as with the development from early chemotherapy and HIV
      agents, which were effective, but associated with serious and often severe side effects, it
      is now time to enhance the acceptability of psychological treatments for OCD.

      A novel cognitive therapy (CT) approach is likely to be just as effective as ERP, but
      markedly more acceptable to those who need it. Although CT for OCD is as effective as ERP,
      previously tested CTs have failed to incorporate recent experimental research, novel
      cognitive targets or enhancements to acceptability. Indeed, the investigators recent work on
      treatment acceptability promises to increase the number of individuals who can fully and
      successfully engage with the treatment.

      The purpose of this research is to enhance the acceptability of cognitive-behavioural
      treatments for OCD; the investigators aim to accomplish this via a randomized controlled
      trial comparing traditional ERP against the investigators' novel CT approach. Although the
      investigators expect both treatments to be effective, the primary hypothesis is that CT will
      be significantly more acceptable to participants than ERP; this will be assessed by the
      relative numbers of treatment refusers and dropouts, as well as by participant ratings of
      treatment acceptability.
