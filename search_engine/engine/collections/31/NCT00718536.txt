      attempt to promote treatment adherence by the patients, once daily (QD) regimens are
      preferred rather than twice daily (BID) regimens.

      The dose of 400 mg BID of raltegravir has been recently licensed for the treatment of human
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection in treatment-experienced adult patients.

      Raltegravir is eliminated mainly by metabolism via uridine diphosphate glucuronyl transferase
      (UGT1A1)-mediated glucuronidation pathway. Thus, co-administration of raltegravir with
      medicinal products that are known to be potent UGT1A1 inhibitors, such as atazanavir, may
      increase plasma levels of raltegravir.

      Based on these data, it could be hypothesized that once daily raltegravir (800 mg QD) could
      be an appropriate therapeutic option in HIV-infected patients also receiving
      atazanavir-containing antiretroviral regimens. However, pharmacokinetic data supporting this
      hypothesis are lacking.
