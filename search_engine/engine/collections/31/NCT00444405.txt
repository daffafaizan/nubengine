      However, some patients develop recurrent herniations at the same level. Controversy exists as
      to why reherniated discs occur. Moreover, existing research does not settle the issue of
      whether a second decompression/discectomy or a repeat decompression/discectomy with pedicle
      screw fusion is the more successful treatment. This study is designed to compare differences
      in patient-reported pain, physical function, and satisfaction between the two types of
      surgery patients.
