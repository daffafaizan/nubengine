      Primary

        -  Assess the safety of vaccination comprising E1M184V peptide with incomplete Freund's
           adjuvant in combination with sargramostim (GM-CSF) in patients with HIV who are HLA-A2
           positive.

        -  Assess, preliminarily, the ability of E1M184V peptide vaccine to induce a cytotoxic
           T-cell response, defined by ELISPOT assay, in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Explore, preliminarily, the effect of this regimen on HIV viral load and CD4 count in
           these patients.

        -  Explore, preliminarily, the development of lamivudine or emtricitabine resistance in
           patients who subsequently receive lamivudine or emtricitabine.

        -  Explore, preliminarily, the ability of E1M184V peptide vaccine to induce a cytotoxic
           T-cell response as assessed by HLA-A2 class I tetramers and intracellular interferon
           gamma production after stimulation with E1M184V.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot study.

      Patients receive vaccination comprising E1M184V peptide and incomplete Freund's adjuvant
      subcutaneously (SC) on day 1 in weeks 0, 4, 8, 12, and 16. Patients also receive sargramostim
      (GM-CSF) SC immediately after vaccination and once daily on days 1-4. Some patients do not
      receive GM-CSF after the first 2 doses of vaccine. Treatment continues in the absence of
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients undergo blood collection at baseline and at 4, 12, 20, 36, and 52 weeks for
      biomarker/laboratory analysis. Assays may include immunoenzyme techniques and viral
      genotyping.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study.
