      (with positive vs. negative images and statements) to determine if either approach has more
      effect on women's alcohol consumption.

      Pregnant and non-pregnant childbearing age women will be recruited at women's clinics and
      randomly assigned to participate in one of three groups: (1) participants will review the
      brochures that present information on FAS and alcohol use in pregnancy with positive images,
      (2) participants will review the brochures that that present information on FAS and alcohol
      use in pregnancy with negative, vivid images, and (3) participants will receive a general
      health information material that is available at their local clinics.

      All study participants will complete a baseline survey assessing their attitudes toward
      drinking during pregnancy, knowledge of FAS, and current alcohol use. After that, the
      intervention will be conducted. The women in the two experimental groups will receive a
      brochure with either positive (IGP) or negative (IGN) images. The women will be asked to read
      one of two brochures in the presence of the data collector. If the participants ask
      questions, the data collector will redirect the participants to material in the brochure.
      Following the intervention, the women in the experimental groups will complete a brief
      questionnaire to assess their emotional responses to the materials and perceived effects. The
      women assigned to the control group (CG) will be asked to read a brochure on general aspects
      of women's' health. At a one-month follow-up, women in all three groups will complete a
      post-test of self-reported alcohol consumption, knowledge about prenatal effects of alcohol
      and FAS, and attitudes to drinking during pregnancy.
