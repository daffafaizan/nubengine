      Primary

        -  Determine the complete pathologic response (complete response [CR]) rate in patients
           with stage II-IVA esophageal cancer treated with neoadjuvant oxaliplatin, capecitabine,
           and radiotherapy.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the clinical efficacy and toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the quality of life of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Identify basal expression and changes in gene expression that relate to CR, relapse, and
           survival of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE:

        -  Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy: Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on days 1,
           15, and 29 (weeks 1, 3, and 5). Patients also undergo radiotherapy on days 1-5, 8-12,
           15-19, 22-26, 29-33, and 36-38 and receive oral or enteral capecitabine twice daily on
           the same days they undergo radiotherapy.

        -  Surgery: At 4-6 weeks after completion of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, patients who
           are eligible undergo esophagectomy.

        -  Adjuvant chemotherapy: Beginning 4-6 weeks after surgery, patients receive oxaliplatin
           IV over 2 hours on days 1, 15, and 29 and oral or enteral capecitabine twice daily on
           days 1-5, 8-12, 15-19, 22-26, and 29. Treatment repeats approximately every 14 days for
           up to 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients undergo tumor biopsies periodically. Collected samples are analyzed by gene
      expression studies, microarray analysis, and real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR
      to identify basal expression and changes in gene expression.

      Quality of life is assessed periodically.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 36 patients will be accrued for this study.
