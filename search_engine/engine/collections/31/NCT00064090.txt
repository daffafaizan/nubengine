        -  Determine the feasibility, tolerability, and toxic effects of 3-AP in combination with
           cytarabine in patients with hematologic malignancies.

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose and phase II dose of cytarabine in this regimen in
           these patients.

        -  Determine the biological effects of 3-AP and its interaction with cytarabine in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot, dose-escalation study of cytarabine.

      Patients receive 3-AP IV over 6 hours followed by cytarabine IV over 18 hours on days 1-5.
      Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving a response may receive an additional course as
      consolidation therapy.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of cytarabine until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, an additional 10
      patients receive treatment at that dose.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 20-25 patients will be accrued for this study.
