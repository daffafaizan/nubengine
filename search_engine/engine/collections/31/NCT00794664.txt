      Elevated LDL is a major risk factor for coronary heart disease (CHD).

      Mipomersen is an antisense drug that reduces a protein in the liver cells called
      apolipoprotein B (Apo-B). Apo-B plays a role in producing low density lipoprotein cholesterol
      (LDL-C) (the "bad" cholesterol) and moving it from the liver to one's bloodstream. High LDL-C
      is an independent risk factor for the development of coronary heart disease (CHD) or other
      diseases of blood vessels. It has been shown that lowering LDL-C reduces the risk of heart
      attacks and other major adverse cardiovascular events. The purpose of this study is to
      determine whether mipomersen safely and effectively lowers LDL-C in severely
      hypercholesterolemic patients who are on a maximally tolerated lipid-lowering regimen and who
      are not on apheresis.
