      process of assisted reproductive technologies and oocyte banking. The perioperative pain
      control is achieved with multidrug regimen including intraoperative opioid medication and
      perioperative administration of oral or intravenous acetaminophen. This medication is more
      commonly known as Tylenol. Intravenous formulation of this medication is several fold more
      expensive and the data for perioperative pain control is mixed on the equivalence of pain
      control with intravenous versus oral acetaminophen in other fields. Currently there is no
      accepted standard of care and the two formulations are used interchangeably depending on
      primary physician's preference. We are conducting an equivalence placebo controlled
      randomized clinical trial to assess the difference in efficacy of these two formulations
