      least equivalent in terms of exacerbation prevention to fluticasone dipropionate / salmeterol
      (FP/SAL; Seretide®) in matched asthma patients switching to BDP/FOR following treatment with
      FP/SAL in normal clinical practice compared with patients not switched. To evaluate
      respiratory outcomes for Fostair in comparison to Seretide using a UK primary care database
      (in patients switched for cost rather than clinical reasons).
