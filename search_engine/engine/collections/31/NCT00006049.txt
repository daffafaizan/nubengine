      symptoms, and progression free survival in chemotherapy naive patients with stage IIIB or IV
      non-small cell lung cancer treated with one of two doses of ZD 1839 or placebo combined with
      paclitaxel and carboplatin. II. Compare the quality of life of patients treated with these
      three regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, multicenter study. Patients
      are randomized to one of three treatment arms. All patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3
      hours followed by carboplatin IV over 15-30 minutes on day 1. Patients receive lower dose
      oral ZD 1839 (arm I), higher dose oral ZD 1839 (arm II), or placebo (arm III) twice on day 1,
      and then once daily thereafter. Chemotherapy repeats every 3 weeks for a maximum of 6
      courses. ZD 1839 or placebo continues daily in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Quality of life is assessed prior to study, then every 3 weeks until
      completion of chemotherapy, then every 4 weeks until completion of oral ZD 1839 or placebo,
      and then every 8 weeks thereafter. Patients are followed every 8 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 1,029 patients will be accrued for this study.
