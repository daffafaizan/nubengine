    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To assess the safety of a modified peripheral blood (PB) graft for haploidentical
      transplantation, obtained by using depletion of naive, cluster of differentiation (CD)45RA+ T
      cells.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the proportion of patients with engraftment/graft failure. II. To determine
      the day 100 and 6 month non-relapse mortality (NRM). III. To estimate the cumulative
      incidence of grade 2-4 and 3-4 acute graft versus (vs.) host disease (aGVHD).

      IV. To assess the rate of chronic GVHD within the first year post transplantation.

      V. To assess immune reconstitution and the incidence of infectious episodes. VI. To assess
      disease response, disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) after
      transplantation.

      VII. To compare results with a retrospective cohort of patients treated with bone marrow
      graft on protocol 2009-0266.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive melphalan intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day -6 and fludarabine
      phosphate IV over 1 hour on days -6 to -3. Patients undergo total-body irradiation (TBI) on
      day -2 and CD45RA depleted peripheral blood stem cell transplantation on day 0. Patients also
      receive cyclophosphamide IV over 3 hours on days 3-4. Beginning on day 5, patients receive
      tacrolimus IV for 2 weeks and orally (PO) for at least 4 months. Beginning on day 7, patients
      receive filgrastim subcutaneously (SC) daily. Patients with CD20 positive lymphoma may
      receive rituximab IV on days -13, -6, 1, and 8.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.
