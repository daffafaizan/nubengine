      (Online EmReg) provided online to individuals with TBI with emotion regulation difficulties.
      Specifically, this study seeks to accomplish three aims: 1) Evaluate the efficacy of the
      Online EmReg intervention immediately post-intervention and at a 12-week follow-up
      assessment; 2) Identify factors that optimize the effectiveness of the Online EmReg
      intervention; 3) Explore the impact of Online EmReg on positive and negative affect, life
      satisfaction, and executive functioning. The study design is a randomized control trial with
      a waitlist control group whereby the participants in the control group undergo the training
      after a 12 week waiting period. 104 subjects with TBI and self-reported deficits in emotion
      regulation will be enrolled.

      The intervention protocol calls for 24, 60-minute emotion regulation sessions twice a week
      for 12 weeks, delivered online via Zoom by post-doctoral level therapists with specialty
      training in rehabilitation neuropsychology. Study participation will last approximately 28
      weeks for participants in the immediate intervention arm (4 weeks preparation, 12 weeks
      intervention, 12 weeks follow-up) and 40 weeks for participants in the waitlist arm (4 weeks
      preparation, 12 weeks waitlist, 12 weeks intervention, and 12 weeks follow-up). Core
      assessments will be conducted at each major time point: T1 (baseline), T2 (immediate
      intervention end/waitlist baseline), T3 (immediate intervention follow-up/end of waitlist
      intervention), and T4 (waitlist follow-up). A subset of the measures will be administered
      every 4 weeks between each major time point for the duration of the study.
