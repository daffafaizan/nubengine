      one year or more at any point prior to fracture and have sustained an atypical
      subtrochanteric or diaphyseal fracture will be enrolled. Subjects randomized to the two
      intervention arms will self-administer a daily SQ injection of the study medication for 12
      months. The primary objective is to demonstrate greater radiologic evidence of healing at 10
      weeks in patients on immediate teriparatide compared to those on delayed teriparatide who
      receive therapy six months after fracture. Secondary end points include (1) radiologic
      healing at 2, 6, 24, and 46 weeks; (2) increased bone density at 6 and 12 months as assessed
      by dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) at the spine, contralateral hip, and femoral neck; (3)
      quality of life improvements at 10 weeks and 6 months as assessed by quality of life
      questionnaire and pain score; and (4) differences in biochemical markers of bone turnover in
      patient with upfront therapy compared to patients with delayed therapy and patients who
      refuse therapy or for whom teriparatide is contraindicated.
