      mindfulness-based intervention for Chinese family caregivers in Hong Kong. Effects of the
      intervention will be compared with those of an evidence-based psychoeducation program, and
      treatment-as-usual. 240 caregivers of frail elderly with moderate to severe levels of
      frailty, will be recruited and randomly assigned to mindfulness-based intervention,
      psychoeducation, and treatment-as-usual experimental conditions. Overall program
      effectiveness will be analyzed on measures of caregiver burden, depression, anxiety, positive
      caregiving experience, spirituality, family conflict, and the biomarker of heart rate
      variability. Measures on coping styles, experiential avoidance, and self-efficacy will be
      explored to see if they mediate the changes to participant improvements in outcomes. 6-month
      follow-up will be included to investigate the maintenance effects.
