      Qualified subjects will be enrolled and randomized to either one of the two study groups
      based on their initial Plaque and Gingivitis scores. Subjects will be instructed to use the
      products according to the instructions provided. Subjects will return to the dental office
      for evaluation after three and six months of product use. All subjects will be followed for
      adverse events throughout the study.
