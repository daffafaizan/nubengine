      than 3 weeks after the first clinical manifestations of an SARS-COV2 infection. These
      manifestations may be related to thromboembolic or inflammatory complications,
      superinfections, or other mechanisms not yet well understood, including potentially related
      to the persistence of SARS-COV2. The identification of the observed clinical manifestations
      and their clinical and paraclinical description are essential to better understand the
      natural evolution of COVID-19, to clarify the pathophysiological mechanism of these possible
      late manifestations, and to identify potential management options for patients.

      Since this type of event is infrequent, a large-scale national multicenter cohort study
      focusing on symptomatic patients is needed. In parallel, the prevalence of the main symptoms
      observed more than 3 weeks after the onset of a COVID-19 will be estimated through
      partnerships with existing cohort studies in the general population or in the population
      followed for COVID-19, still symptomatic or not at 3 weeks of infection.

      Longitudinal implementation of bio-libraries will allow this cohort to also constitute a
      bridge between clinicians and researchers.
