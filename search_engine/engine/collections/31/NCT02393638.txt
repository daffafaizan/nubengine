      used as a surrogate for trainees' experience. At least 180 cases are required to achieve ERCP
      competence. A major limitation is lack of suitable patients. Alternative supplemental
      training includes simulator practice using computer simulators, live animal models, and
      ex-vivo porcine organ. Our previous study has showed that the mechanical simulator training
      improves trainees' clinical performance in terms of success of deep CBD cannulation. In this
      study, we aim to evaluate the usefulness of ERCP mechanical simulator for training endoscopic
      sphincterotomy.
