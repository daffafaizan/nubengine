      I. To assess the feasibility of a novel combination conditioning therapy with
      busulfan/melphalan and topotecan followed by autologous hematopoietic stem cell
      transplantation (HSCT) in patients with relapsed, refractory and/or poor risk pediatric solid
      tumors.

      II. To determine within the confines of this pilot study, myeloid and platelet engraftment,
      overall survival and disease-free survival in patients with relapsed, refractory pediatric
      solid tumors and in patients who have solid tumors with poor risk factors at the time of
      diagnosis.

      III. To determine the pharmacokinetics of topotecan.

      OUTLINE:

      AUTOLOGOUS HEMATOPOIETIC STEM CELL OR AUTOLOGOUS BONE MARROW COLLECTION: Patients undergo
      stem cell mobilization per institutional guidelines with G-CSF IV or subcutaneously,
      continuing until the completion of leukapheresis. Patients undergo apheresis after
      mobilization and continue until a minimum of 2.0 x 10^6 CD34 cells/kg or more are collected.
      Cells are processed and cryopreserved following institutional guidelines. Patients who
      collect > 2.0 x 10^6 CD34+ cells/kg may proceed to high-dose chemotherapy.

      HIGH-DOSE CHEMOTHERAPY: Patients receive topotecan hydrochloride IV continuously over 24
      hours on days -8 to -4, busulfan IV every 6 hours on days -8 to -4, and melphalan IV over 30
      minutes on days -3 and -2.

      AUTOLOGOUS HEMATOPOIETIC STEM CELL OR AUTOLOGOUS BONE MARROW REINFUSION: Patients undergo
      autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation or autologous bone marrow transplantation
      on day 0. Patients also receive G-CSF IV daily beginning on day +5 and continuing until blood
      counts recover.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then
      annually thereafter.
