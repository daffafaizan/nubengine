      death of at least 1.9 million individuals and numbers continue to climb exponentially.
      Despite these staggering numbers, there are currently very few effective treatments for
      COVID-19. The immune response to COVID-19 virus appears to follow 2 phases. During the
      incubation and early disease, interferon (ex. INF-Î±) signaling and adaptive immunity preclude
      the disease from progressing. If, and when, this immune response is impaired, the virus may
      cause pathologic inflammation leading to massive organ dysfunction leading to acute
      respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

      Omalizumab is a humanized anti-IgE antibody approved by Health Canada for the treatment of
      moderate-severe asthma and chronic spontaneous urticaria. Omalizumab has been shown to
      exhibit antiviral and anti-inflammatory effects in virally exacerbated asthma cases that may
      be relevant to the treatment of COVID-19.

      This is a double blind randomized placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of a
      single dose of omalizumab in reducing all cause mortality at day 29 in severe hospitalized
      COVID-19 cases. Moreover, time to improvement/hospital discharge, incidence and duration of
      mechanical ventilation and safety will be assessed.
