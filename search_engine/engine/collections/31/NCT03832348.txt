    
      Immunotherapy with anti-PD1 antibody, such as Pembrolizumab, is widely used in the treatment
      of stage III/IV non small cell lung cancer. In order to refine treatments and patients'
      prognosis, early assessment of tumour response is needed.

      The aim of this study is to describe the early tumour metabolic changes in non smal cell lung
      cancer during first line treatment with pembrolizumab, and to evaluate whether or not they
      differ according to treatment response.

      Eligible patients with stage III/IV, PDL1>50% NSCLC will receive pembrolizumab treatment as
      per standard of care.

      Tumour metabolism will be assessed by 18-FDG PETscan before each of the 3 first pembrolizumab
      infusions. Treatment response will be determined by RECIST, irRC and mCHOI criteria at 3
      months.

      Prognostic and predictive value of baseline and dynamic metabolic parameters will be
      assessed.
