      without vit D. The results showed a significant elevation in vit D levels during the time
      period, and significant reduction on HCV RNA from the 12th wk to reach zero level in 24th wk.
      Interleukin 6 (IL-6), visfatin and hyaluronic acid levels were reduced significantly to reach
      normal values. These concentrations reduction by the effect of vit D on HCV indicated the
      reduction in inflammation, infection and liver cirrhosis and nearly amelioration HCV.
