      and to compare two techniques of ankle mobility. It will include 102 lower limbs that present
      deficit of ankle dorsiflexion and dynamic knee valgus in the same lower limb.

      Participants will be divided into two groups, one for ankle mobilization with movement aided
      by the therapist and another for self mobilization of the ankle. The two intervention groups
      will do the same protocol, same number of sets, repetitions and rest time.There will be
      randomisation allocation of individuals in the groups and because of the nature of the
      interventions only the evaluator may be blind.

      The Kolmogorov - Smirnov test is used to verify the data distribution normality. The
      characterization of the participants is performed by means of descriptive statistical
      analysis. Parametric or non-parametric tests will be used according to the data distribution
      normality for comparison between groups at baseline. The evaluator blinding will be tested
      using the chi -square test by comparing the randomization code with the evaluator opinion.
      The difference between the groups and their respective confidence intervals will be
      calculated by linear mixed models using interaction term of "time versus group."
