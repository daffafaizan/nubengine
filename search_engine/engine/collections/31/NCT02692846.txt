      genes, including the elastin gene, located on chromosome 7q11.23. Cardiovascular disease in
      WS, including obstructive vascular disease and hypertension, and relatively mild skin changes
      are caused by the elastin gene deletion. Even though all WS subjects are missing one copy of
      this gene, the expression of cardiovascular problems is highly variable, ranging from no
      significant disease to severe generalized arteriopathy leading to infant death. The causes of
      vascular variability are currently unknown, and male gender is the only disease modifier
      described to date. Clinically, skin is described as abnormally soft, smooth and easily
      mobilized , while ultrastructurally the elastic fibers are abnormal with reduced amorphous
      elastin.

      The overall objective of this study is to establish quantitative norms that can be used to
      determine the severity of vascular disease in elastin insufficiency and then to identify risk
      factors that contribute to that variability. It is also important to determine how
      stable/variable these findings are over time.
