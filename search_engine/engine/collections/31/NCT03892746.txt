      study, 18 cervical spinal patients with upper limb impairments will receive non-invasive
      brain stimulation tDCS (Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation) to the area in the brain
      controlling the weaker muscle of the weakest upper limb while receiving training for 5 days a
      weeks for 3 weeks. The primary outcome will be motor limb impairment, and secondary outcomes
      will be tests of functional ability, spinal excitability, and strength and dexterity. Safety
      and feasibility of pairing tDCS with rehabilitation will also be explored and include adverse
      effects, subject/investigator blinding, and attrition to 3 month follow-up.
