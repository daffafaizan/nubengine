      thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) and autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA). French patients from
      the 30 hematologic pediatric centers are from 2004 included in a prospective national
      OBS'CEREVANCE cohort.

      A first pilot study revealed a monogenic cause in 7/18 patients (40%) with mutations in the
      CTLA-4, LRBA, STAT3 GOF, and KRAS. TNGS or exome studies were performed between 2015 and 2018
      inn 80 patients with pSE from the OBS'CEREVANCE cohort. This approach, combined with by
      immunophenotyping lymphocyte, identified a genetic cause of the disease in 26 patients (32%)
      (TNFRSF6, CTLA4, LRBA, STAT3 GOF, PIK3CD, RAG1, KRAS) and potential causal mutations in 18
      other patients (22%), bringing the proportion of potential single gene cause to 76%.

      The central hypothesis of this study is that most, if not all, cases of pSE are related to a
      monogenic or digenic cause, possibly with the intervention of genetic modifiers such as
      somatic mutations.
