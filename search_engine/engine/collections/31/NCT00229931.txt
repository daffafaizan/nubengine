    
      Protocol Summary:

      This is a randomized, prospective study comparing diabetic patients with pre-operative
      macular edema undergoing cataract surgery treated with either 4 mg of intravitreal
      triamcinolone at the time of cataract surgery or focal laser treatment 1 month following
      cataract surgery.

      Disease State:

      The conventional treatment for clinically significant macular edema is focal laser
      photocoagulation. In some diabetic patients however, the cataract often impedes fundus
      visualization for optimal laser treatment. In these patients focal laser treatment is
      deferred until after cataract surgery.

      Study aim:

      The purpose of this study is to determine if intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide (IVTA)
      injection at the time of cataract surgery will improve visual acuity and decrease
      post-operative macular edema in diabetic patients with pre-operative macular edema requiring
      cataract extraction as compared to the conventional treatment of focal laser photocoagulation
      following cataract surgery.

      Hypothesis:

      We propose that by injecting triamcinolone intravitreally at the time of cataract surgery in
      patients who have pre-operative macular edema, we will not only reduce the risk of
      exacerbating macular edema but also possibly improve the final visual outcome.

      Study Procedures:

      After informed consent is obtained each patient will be placed, based on a randomization
      scheme, into either the control group receiving the conventional focal laser treatment one
      month following cataract extraction or into the study group receiving the IVTA injection at
      the time of surgery.
