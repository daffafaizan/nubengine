      care units (ICUs). However, survival is lower among those who develop ICU delirium, and the
      quality of life among survivors may be affected by post-ICU long-term cognitive impairment
      (CI) that lasts months to years. Long-term CI has been studied predominantly following
      cardiopulmonary bypass. In the much larger group of medical and general surgical ICU
      patients, the extent of this problem and its relationship to health-related quality of life
      is poorly characterized. Evidence from 6 pilot cohorts (including the investigators')
      totaling ~300 patients suggests that an astonishing 30% to 80% of ICU survivors experience
      long-term CI functionally equivalent to mild/moderate dementia although it may not be
      progressive (and thus will be referred to as long-term CI). Interestingly, this cognitive
      impairment arises independent of severity of illness, and older patients appear particularly
      prone. The investigators' work and the work of others have shown that delirium is a major
      independent risk factor for impaired cognitive function at hospital discharge and increased
      mortality at 6 months. While it is not clear whether delirium itself is injurious to the
      brain or is simply a marker of brain injury, it is clear that the onset of delirium in the
      ICU should not be considered innocuous; rather, it may be a determinant of long-term CI and
      health-related quality of life. Having spent the last 8 years studying delirium and drug
      exposure during acute phases of critical illness and long-term CI after hospitalization, the
      investigators are thoroughly prepared to continue the next phases of investigation in VA
      (Department of Veterans Affairs) patients, many of whom are older and disproportionately at
      risk for adverse outcomes following ICU care.
