        1. The 6-minute walk test (6MWT) is widely used in the clinic to measure treatment efficacy
           and disease progression in patients with neuromuscular diseases and is found valid and
           reliable to measure decrease in walking speed.

        2. Rhythmic auditory stimulation has repeatedly been shown to improve gait parameters in
           individuals with neurologic impairment.

      The aim of this study is to investigate if rhythmic auditory stimulation can influence
      walking speed, during a 6MWT in patients with myasthenia gravis.

      Patients with MG are asked to complete two 6MWTs separated by minimum 30 minutes of rest.
      Before the 6MWTs patient is instructed to walk 60 m as fast as possible, and their steps per
      minute (SPM) is recorded. When completing the 6MWTs, one of the tests is accompanied by music
      (m6MWT) with a beat per minute (BPM) corresponding to patients' SPM. The order of the 6MWTs
      is randomly decided by pre-ordered sealed envelopes.
