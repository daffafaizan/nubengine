      This study will assess the benefit-risk balance of the therapy through a randomized
      double-blind cross over clinical trial.

      This multi-center study will be conducted in rheumatology departments of 17 public hospitals
      in France.

      A transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulator Tens Eco 2 SCHWA MEDICOâ„¢ France will be used in this
      study. Before the beginning of the study, a VNS practical training seminar will be organized
      in order for all future investigators.

      All patients eligible for this study must have been previously treated according to national
      and international guidelines for patients with axial SpA. Adult patients with axial SpA
      diagnosed and followed for at least one year, insufficiently relieved despite optimal drug
      management, including at least two lines of biotherapies tested for at least 6 months, will
      be enrolled in this study.

      The duration of participation (treatment + follow-up) for each patient: 7 months.
