    
      Forty patients of American Society of Anesthesiologist physical status Ⅰor Ⅱ undergoing total
      knee arthroplasty under spinal anesthesia would be enrolled and randomly divided into two
      groups (R, "3-in-1" using a 30 ml of ropivacaine 0.375% and a continuous 3-in-1 with a
      ropivacaine 0.2%(8mL/h) for 48 h after operation, RF: Fifty ug of fentanyl will be added to a
      bolus(30ml ropivacaine 0.375%) and 1ug/ml of fentanyl will be mixed to a continuous
      infusion(8mg/h, ropivacaine 0.2%). Spinal anesthesia will be done after the insertion of
      femoral catheter. IV PCA with hydromorphone(0.15mg/ml, 0-1-10), will be used for rescue
      analgesics. Visual analgesia scale, hydromorphone consumption, side effects until 48h after
      operation and satisfaction will be compared.
