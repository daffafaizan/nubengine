        -  Determine the antitumor activity of docetaxel in patients with recurrent or persistent
           endometrial carcinoma.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 19-51 patients will be accrued for this study within 10-18
      months.
