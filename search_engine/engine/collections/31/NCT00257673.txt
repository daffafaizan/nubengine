      the aging population. It is a chronic brain disease that involves gradual memory loss,
      decline in the ability to perform routine tasks, disorientation, difficulty in learning, loss
      of language skills, impairment of judgment, and personality changes in affected individuals.
      The neurodegenerative nature of the disease eventually leads to the failure of other organ
      systems and death.

      Perturbations in calcium homeostasis in the central nervous system, such as those associated
      with Alzheimer's disease and aging as well as stroke and head trauma can result in an
      increase in intracellular levels of calcium (Ca2+). Increased levels of Ca2+ may lead to
      cellular dysregulation and cell death. The role of calcium in these neurodegenerative
      processes led to the hypothesis that controlling calcium levels may be beneficial,
      particularly where progressive neuronal damage results in cognitive dysfunction and memory
      loss.

      MEM 1003 is the (+)-enantiomer of a dihydropyridine that has been optimized for central
      nervous system activity. It inhibits L-type Ca2+ channels and within the anticipated human
      dosing range has more benign cardiovascular effects than other DHP L-Type calcium channel
      modulators.
