      lamivudine with FTC while continuing on current background regimen. Arm 2: Continue on
      current lamivudine-containing regimen. Patients are further stratified based upon screening
      plasma HIV-1 RNA and background therapy. Stratum 1: Less than 50 copies/ml; PI (protease
      inhibitor) in treatment regimen. Stratum 2: Less than 50 copies/ml; NNRTI (nonnucleoside
      reverse transcriptase inhibitor) in treatment regimen. Stratum 3: 50-400 copies/ml; PI in
      treatment regimen. Stratum 4: 50-400 copies/ml; NNRTI in treatment regimen. Clinic visits
      occur at regular intervals throughout the 48-week study period to determine viral load.
