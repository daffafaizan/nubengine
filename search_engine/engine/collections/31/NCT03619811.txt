      gastro-esophago-pharyngeal reflux contributes to chronic laryngeal symptoms such as throat
      clearing, sore throat and dysphonia. Over the past 25 years, Reflux associated laryngeal
      symptoms has been increasingly, and often incorrectly, diagnosed and has emerged as a point
      of controversy and confusion.
