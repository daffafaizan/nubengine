      I. To test the impact of providing the essential elements of survivorship care on
      survivorship outcomes as indicated by reduction in symptoms (pain, fatigue, sleep
      disturbance, depression, distress) in young adult cancer survivors diagnosed with cancer
      between the ages of 18 and 39 years when compared with usual care.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To improve confidence in survivorship knowledge and promote healthy lifestyle behaviors.

      II. To provide evidence on barriers, needs and care preferences that will support long term
      follow-up recommendations for this population.

      OUTLINE: Participants categorized as high-need are randomized to 1 of 2 arms. Participants
      categorized as low-need are assigned to Arm I.

      ARM I: Participants receive usual care. After 12 months, participants may receive a
      survivorship clinic visit and boosters as in Arm II.

      ARM II: Participants attend a survivorship clinic visit that includes care plans, screening
      recommendations, physician coordination, health promotion education, symptom management and
      palliative care, late effects education, psychosocial and medical assessments, and referrals
      for services and care as appropriate. Participants also receive phone-based survivorship
      boosters over approximately 15-30 minutes at 4-8 weeks and 12-16 weeks after the initial
      clinic visit.

      After completion of study, participants are followed up at 6 and 12 months.
