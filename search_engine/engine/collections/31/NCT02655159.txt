    
      This is a national, multicenter, retrospective, observational post-authorization study
      (EPA-OD) study. Investigators will include all consecutive adult patients diagnosed with
      HER2-negative MBC who have started treatment with nab-paclitaxel monotherapy no further than
      the third line of chemotherapy for metastatic disease during the past 3 years (2012-2014).
      These patients must meet all the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria
      established in this protocol.

      The primary objective is to describe the effectiveness of nab-paclitaxel in terms of response
      in early lines of chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer in routine clinical practice.

      This study plans to collect data retrospectively, provided they are available in the
      patient's medical record and according to routine clinical practice.
