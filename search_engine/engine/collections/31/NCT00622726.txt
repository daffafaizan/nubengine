      as determined by regression of neovascular vessels of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), in
      neonates with acute stage 3 ROP in zone I or posterior zone II with plus disease. This study
      enrolled 150 confirmed cases of vision threatening ROP which have definite plus disease
      [ranging from Early Treatment for Retinopathy of Prematurity, to Cryotherapy for Retinopathy
      of Prematurity . This was done because of the controversy regarding determining plus disease
      and the increasing concern that many infants are being treated whose ROP would spontaneously
      regress. Bevacizumab will be administered intravitreally using 0.625 mg (0.025 ml) injections
      into each eye. There was no intent to give additional doses unless there was a recurrence of
      vision threatening stage 3 ROP with plus disease since the disease is self limited by
      completion of vascularization. Clinical response and any evidence of ocular toxicities were
      documented by retinal imaging system (manufactured by Clarity Medical Systems, Inc.) taken
      pre-injection, one week and one month post injection, and at 6 months of age (54 weeks
      postmenstrual age)(window of 50 to 70 weeks PMA)(primary outcome) and at 12 months of age (80
      weeks postmenstrual age)(window of 75 to 100 weeks PMA)(structural documentation). Using the
      same retinal imaging system, fluorescein angiograms have been taken when possible to document
      structural outcomes in greater detail. No evidence of systemic toxicities were documented by
      appropriate clinical and laboratory tests.
