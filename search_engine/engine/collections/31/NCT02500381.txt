    
      This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center study to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of SRP-4045 and SRP-4053. Eligible patients with out-of-frame deletion mutations
      amenable to exon 45 or 53 skipping will be randomized to receive once weekly intravenous (IV)
      infusions of 30 mg/kg SRP-4045 or 30 mg/kg SRP-4053 respectively (combined-active group) or
      placebo for up to 96 weeks (the placebo-controlled period of the trial). This will be
      followed by an open label extension period in which all patients will receive open-label
      active treatment for 48 weeks (up to Week 144 of study).

      The study will enroll approximately 222 patients, with a planned minimum target of 111
      patients amenable to exon 45 skipping and 111 patients amenable to exon 53 skipping.

      Approximately 148 patients will be randomized to receive active treatment with either
      SRP-4045 or SRP-4053 (depending on deletion mutation), and 74 patients will be randomized to
      receive placebo. Twice as many patients will receive active treatment as will receive placebo
      (2:1 randomization).

      Clinical efficacy will be assessed at regularly scheduled study visits, including functional
      tests such as the six-minute walk test (6MWT). All patients will undergo a muscle biopsy at
      baseline and a second muscle biopsy either at Week 48 or Week 96.

      Safety will be assessed through the collection of adverse events (AEs), laboratory tests,
      electrocardiograms (ECGs), echocardiograms (ECHOs), vital signs, and physical examinations
      throughout the study.

      Blood samples will be taken periodically throughout the study to assess the pharmacokinetics
      of both drugs.
