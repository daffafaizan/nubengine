      significant psychosocial distress including decreased appetite, reduced self-hygiene, and
      mood disturbances.

      This study aims to study the efficacy of smell training for patients with olfactory
      dysfunction following a viral upper respiratory tract infection. Eligible participants will
      complete a 30-day course of budesonide nasal saline irrigation. Participants who do not show
      improvement in their olfaction based on composite smell and taste tests will be eligible to
      receive a baseline resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) and complete a 12-week smell training
      intervention program. Smell training involves participants smelling 4 odors (phenyl ethyl
      alcohol, eucalyptus, lemon, and eugenol) twice a day for 12 weeks. Following completion of
      smell training, participants will undergo repeat smell and taste tests as well as rs-fMRI to
      ascertain the efficacy of smell training.
