      diagnosis, generally 3 months of follow up has been recommended before surgical tympanostomy
      tube insertion. If the physician can estimate the status of the middle ear or fluid type
      better with a non-invasive method, we can suggest an early operation to these patients or
      decide to follow up more with no intervention. The purpose of the study is to compare the
      surgically confirmed middle ear effusions with wideband absorbance values and to
      differentiate them noninvasively before the operation.

      Methods: A total of 123 children that were followed 3 months and treated surgically with the
      diagnosis of OME were included. Eighty-two sex, age-matched children were tested as control
      with wideband tympanometry. Ears were divided into four groups according to findings in the
      operation: serous, mucoid, adhesive, empty. Resonance frequency, 226 Hz, 1000 Hz compliance,
      Wideband Peak pressure, Absorbance measurements used for comparison.
