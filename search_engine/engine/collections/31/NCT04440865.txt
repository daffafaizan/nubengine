    
      Any patient seen by gastroenterologists working in the endoscopy unit and meeting the
      inclusion criteria may be recruited.

      The patient will be offered to participate in the study. The information form as well as the
      consent, will be given to the patient for a good understanding of the study and the
      investigator in charge of the patient gives all the additional explanations necessary for
      this good understanding (but of the study, the course, risks and benefits).

      A period of reflection will be left to the patient or his family to make a free decision
      whether or not to participate in the study.

      After the consent to participate will be signed by the gastroenterologist and the patient,
      the patient will be randomized. The use of the Genius® system will depend on the
      randomization that will be performed at the start of the colonoscopy.

      This randomization will be done in the computer examination room using the randomization
      software.

      The patient will therefore be randomized into 2 groups:

      Arm 1- Standard colonoscopy Arm 2- Colonoscopy assisted by Genius® system

      A comparison of the two groups standard colonoscopy vs colonoscopy assisted by Genius® system
      will be made as following:

      A-Main criterion:

      - Adenoma detection rate (ADR)

      B-Secondary criteria:

      Polyps detection rate (PDR) Proximal serrated polyps detection rate (PSPDR) Neoplasia
      detection rate (NDR) Mean number of polyps (MNP) Mean number of adenomas (MNA) Factors
      associated with ADR
