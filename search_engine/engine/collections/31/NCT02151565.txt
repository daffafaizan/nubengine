      included into this randomized controlled cross-over trial. Each intervention was administered
      for a period of 45 min 5 times within 10 days, with a 3-day wash-out period before
      cross-over. Health impairments had been assessed using the visual analog scales (VAS) for
      radicular pain before and after intervention and differences in radicular pain between groups
      were analysed with the Mann-Whitney test.
