      randomized controlled clinical trial designed to study the effects of aerobic exercise
      training regimens differing in intensity (relative to peak fitness) on insulin sensitivity in
      overweight youth. Additionally, this trial will explore the biologic mechanisms through which
      chronic physical activity alters lipid metabolism to result in improvements in insulin
      sensitivity.

      We will recruit 90 eligible adolescents and randomly assign them to one of two six-month
      intervention arms that differ by intensity but elicit similar amounts of energy expenditure:
      (1) a low intensity continuous activity arm (40-55% of peak oxygen uptake for 60 min); (2)
      vigorous intensity intermittent activity arm (70-85% of peak oxygen uptake for 30 min) or a
      sedentary control group. The primary outcome measure of this trial will be insulin
      sensitivity, measured directly from Bergman's frequently sampled intravenous glucose
      tolerance test.
