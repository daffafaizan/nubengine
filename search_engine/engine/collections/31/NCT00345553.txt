      disease progression. A variety of genetic, autoimmune and environmental influences have been
      hypothesized to be important. Most studies to date have focused on the neonate and young
      child with BA, yet the older surviving child with BA can provide important information about
      genetics, as well as, natural history.

      The purpose of this study is to collect the pertinent clinical information, genetic material
      and body fluid samples to enable investigators to address the following hypotheses:

      Hypothesis 1: A genetic defect is a likely causative factor for BA among children with BA and
      multiple congenital anomalies.

      Hypothesis 2: Autoimmune factors are likely to contribute to disease progression or
      acquisition and can be identified by correlating HLA among children with BA to healthy
      controls and by comparison of those who develop early complications including, variceal
      bleed, ascites, and growth failure compared to those who do not.

      Hypothesis 3a: Sentinel events such as variceal bleeding, ascites and growth failure are
      earlier predictors of death or need for liver transplantation than the pediatric end-stage
      liver disease score (PELD).

      Hypothesis 3b: Health related quality of life will be impaired compared to healthy age
      matched children and relate to severity of illness.

      Hypothesis 3c: Growth failure as measured by anthropometrics and nutritional supplementation
      will be predictive of onset of sentinel events (ascites, variceal bleed, death, and
      transplant) in the following 24 months.

      This study will be performed by the Childhood Liver Disease Research Network (ChiLDReN), a
      National Institute of Diabetes & Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) funded network.
