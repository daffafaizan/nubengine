      neck fractures in elderly patients. In the last decade, so called minimal-invasive surgery
      (MIS) for the implantation of total hip arthroplasty (THA) has become popular and studies
      have demonstrated that MIS is as safe as conventional approaches. Our hypothesis is that
      femoral neck fracture patients may especially benefit from MIS. To date, no published data
      exist comparing a Hueter minimal-invasive anterior (AMIS) with a conventional trans-gluteal
      Hardinge approach (CLAS) for HA.

      Geriatric patients presenting at the University hospital Basel (UHBS) with a femoral neck
      fracture eligible for HA are randomly assigned to the minimal-invasive or conventional group.
      In both groups HA will be performed using the same implants. Postoperatively patients will be
      followed-up continuously until discharge from our hospital (with 7 days as expected average
      duration of postoperative hospital stay) with a first functional status assessment on day 5.
      Further follow-up is planned at week 3 and 6, 3 months and one year postoperatively.
