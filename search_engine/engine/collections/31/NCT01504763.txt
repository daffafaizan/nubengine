      rehabilitation/ fibromyalgia units each have varying causes of stress as both are intensely
      demanding environments. The physical and psychosocial demands of these stress-loaded work
      environments place a significant amount of strain on the physiological well-being of the
      employee.

      Nurses in these settings are considered healthy employees and able to participate in the
      workforce, although symptoms such as headaches, shoulder tension, insomnia, fatigue, and
      muscle and joint pain are often a part of their work day. As these stress related symptoms
      become more chronic, they lead to days missed and become pre-cursors to physiological
      illnesses so warrant further search for prevention tactics.

      Massage therapy has been noted to decrease levels of anxiety and fatigue which is essential
      to maintaining employee's efficient care in a dynamic environment. This study will provide
      massage in the workplace utilizing chair massage as it is easy to set up, does not need a
      great deal of space, and can be provided in semi-private areas, as the participant remains
      clothed. A 2006 report on a small study indicated chair massage can be effective in reducing
      stress perception in nurses within a hospital setting, at least in the short-term. Another
      study reported some short-term positive effects on stress related symptoms; and came to the
      conclusion that further studies are indicated to examine the efficacy of workplace-based
      massage therapy programs.
