      efficacy in the adjuvant treatment of elderly patients with early breast cancer, and the
      paucity of data for early cardiac toxicities with anthracycline-based adjuvant therapy
      compared to non-anthracycline regimen, this is the first randomized study to evaluate early
      cardiac signs based on doppler myocardial imaging (DMI). The results of this study could
      improve the monitoring of the cardiac function of elderly patients candidates to receive
      adjuvant chemotherapy for early breast cancer.
