      as foreign, such as bacteria and viruses. The body can also see cancer cells as foreign. When
      the body sees a foreign invader, it sends out antibodies that tag the invader. Once this
      happens, the immune system can work to destroy whatever is that the antibody has tagged.

      Monoclonal antibodies are ones that can be made in the lab. They tag a portion of a cancer
      cell. Early monoclonal antibodies were made from antibodies grown in mice. They caused an
      antibody response in humans after one dose. Now they are more like human antibodies, and
      thus, do not produce the same reactions on repeated doses. These are called chimeric
      antibodies. The antibody we will use in this study is called chimeric G250 (cG250).

      Recent research has shown that some antibodies can attach themselves to cancer cells, and
      that they bind to very few normal cells. This could help cancer treatment in two ways. One is
      that the body's own immune system might work to destroy tagged cancer cells. The other is
      that we can attach chemotherapy drugs or radioactive chemicals to the antibodies. These can
      then deliver treatment when the antibodies attach to the cancer cells.

      This study is being done to test the tagging ability of cG250 to cancer cells. After you
      receive cG250, you will have a scan. The picture the scan produces will show where the
      antibody has collected inside the body. From this, it is possible to measure how well cG250
      can detect kidney cancer. This is NOT a treatment for renal cancer. After your surgery, we
      will examine the tumor and other tissue to see how much of the antibody has attached to the
      tumor.

      Fifty four patients are expected to be treated in this study.
