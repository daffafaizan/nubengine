      platelet function. In this study, we investigate platelet function (fundamental research)
      according to the delay since last aspirin intake (12 vs 24 hours)in a population of diabetic
      patients with previous Coronary Artery Disease routinely treated with aspirin. In order to
      eliminate any variation linked to a cumulative dose effect of aspirn, platelet function is
      assessed 24 hours after a single 150 mg aspirin intake or 12 hours after a 75 mg aspirin
      intake given twice per day (corresponding to the same total dose of 150 mg /day). Light
      transmission aggregometry triggered by arachidonic acid 0.5mg/mL (LTA-AA) is the main
      endpoint of the study (intensity and velocity of agregation following exposure to arachidonic
      acid 0.5 mg/ml).
