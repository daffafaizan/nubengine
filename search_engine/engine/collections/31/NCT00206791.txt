      prevent losses of osseous that are envisaged and so prejudicial.

      Synthetic calcium phosphate ceramics (particularly granulated forms) already has shown their
      osteoconduction potential in human at different sites. But it is difficult to put these
      granules in very little place.

      The injectable form of calcium phosphate granules "ready to use" is easier to be used and
      allow a diminution of the risk of infection during surgery, and permit homogeneity of the
      biomaterial.

      Injectable form of calcium phosphate granules did already has shown his biocompatibility and
      biofunctionality in animals.

      The purpose of this study is to study the biocompatibility and biofunctionality of this
      biomaterial in his injectable form in fillings of little losses of osseous substance from
      various origins were no charge will act to the biomaterial.
