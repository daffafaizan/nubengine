      outcomes will be analyzed in two groups of patients (case and control group): women with
      diagnosis of endometriosis histologically confirmed and women without endometriosis. Women
      with endometriosis will be matched to controls by age. A database with general medical and
      gynecological history, pregnancy course, delivery mode and newborn conditions will be
      analyzed.
