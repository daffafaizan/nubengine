      tendinopathy, a painful chronic degeneration of the tendons in the shoulder. However, the
      effect of CSI in comparison with placebo is disputed in the scientific literature, with most
      studies only showing mild short-term effect (less than six weeks) on pain compared to placebo
      injections.

      Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive technique allowing to
      stimulate areas of the brain in order to change the excitability of the neurons. When the
      negative electrode is applied on the motor cortex of the brain, it increases the excitability
      of the neurons in that area, which in turns inhibits the activity of the thalamus, an area of
      the brain linked with the perception of pain. Some studies have shown that tDCS can improve
      chronic pain of different origins, such as lower back pain, fibromyalgia, stroke,
      osteoarthritis, and post-operative pain.

      We tested whether applying tDCS following a CSI would have more effect on patient's pain,
      function, and activity, than CSI alone.
