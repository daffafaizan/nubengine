      Unwinding Anxiety or to wait-list control (50/50 chance). The active intervention period will
      last 2 months, with an optional 2-month follow-up period in which the intervention remains
      available. Changes in mindfulness, emotional reactivity, cognition and sleep behavior at
      specified time points will be measured. The primary engagement targets will be non-reactivity
      and worry. The primary behavioral outcome target will be sleep.
