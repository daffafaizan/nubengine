      osteoporosis, coronary heard disease, diabetes) and a decline in neuromuscular function
      impacting independence of the subject. Osteoporosis, diabetes type II and arteriosclerosis
      are diseases known to correlate with age. Participating in regular sport activities elicits
      numerous favorable effects that contribute to "healthy aging". Unfortunately all existing
      studies which focus on specific diseases or conditions favour dedicated exercise regimes.
      However, the complex risk factor scenario of older adults requires multi-purpose exercise
      programs with impact on all relevant risks. Furthermore so far no exercise study
      longitudinally determines the effect of an ambulatory exercise program on health cost
      considering the specific health policy framework of Germany. We hypothesize that regular
      exercise

        1. significantly impact relevant osteoporosis, cardiovascular diseases and diabetes risk
           factors in elderly subjects

        2. significantly reduces health costs in elderly community living women
