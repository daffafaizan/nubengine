      I. To determine the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of concurrently administered everolimus
      and gemcitabine (gemcitabine hydrochloride) in patients with advanced, refractory solid
      tumors (two-agent MTD).

      II. To determine the maximally tolerated dose of concurrently administered everolimus,
      gemcitabine and cisplatin in patients with advanced, refractory solid tumors (three-agent
      MTD).

      III. To describe the toxicity of the two treatment combinations. IV. To describe any evidence
      of the antitumor activity of the two treatment combinations.

      V. To obtain pilot data on toxicity and efficacy outcome of everolimus, gemcitabine and
      cisplatin in patients with cholangiocarcinoma or gallbladder carcinoma. (Cohort III)

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of gemcitabine hydrochloride and everolimus.

      COHORT I: Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on
      days 1 and 8 and everolimus orally (PO) once daily or 3 times weekly.

      COHORT II: Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes and cisplatin IV
      over 1 hour on days 1 and 8 and everolimus PO once daily or 3 times weekly.

      COHORT III: Patients receive treatment as in cohort II.

      Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3 months.
