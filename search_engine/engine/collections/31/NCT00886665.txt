      of Taichung Veterans General Hospital and Chinese Medical University Hospital . Subjects were
      randomly distributed into a double-blind, 12 weeks, placebo-controlled procedure. Subjects
      were measured by MNSI, SF-BPI, SF-36, SF -MCQ, NCV, AC sugar, HbA1c, lipid profiles, liver
      and kidney functions.

      Safety evaluations including GPT and creatinine revealed no deterioration after treatment.
      Several domains in MNSI, SF-BPI, SF-36, SF -MPQ questionnaires revealed significant
      improvements. F-wave in peroneal, tibial nerves and distal latency in tibial nerve in
      objective nerve conduction studies revealed significant improvements.
