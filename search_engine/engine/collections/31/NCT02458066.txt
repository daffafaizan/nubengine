      developed by Bayer AG, was used for the IRS program in Bioko Island, Equatorial Guinea, for
      the first time. This change coincided with a marked increase in parasite prevalence in 2-14
      year olds as measured in the Annual Malaria Indicator Survey (14% to 28%, respectively). In
      order to determine whether the change in insecticide caused the increase in prevalence, a
      cluster randomized control trial was designed.

      Twenty-four (24) clusters, each containing between 250-300 houses were selected throughout
      Bioko Island. Clusters were chosen with an attempt to maximize the geographical space between
      clusters (to minimize possible residual effects from insecticides), while ensuring that areas
      with historically higher acceptance rates for Indoor Residual Spraying (IRS) were selected.
      Each cluster had a buffer zone of 300m (or halfway between clusters less than 600m apart).

      A team of 10 local surveyors conducted a baseline survey in each cluster area, measuring
      prevalence through malaria Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT) positivity, net ownership, spray
      coverage, and hemoglobin levels. Approximately 100 children in each cluster were tested.
      These data were then used for a restricted randomization. Each cluster was then sprayed with
      either deltamethrin or bendiocarb, depending on randomization. The IRS team put equal amount
      of effort into each cluster, as determined by number of sprayers/house/day in an attempt to
      minimize bias.

      An end-line survey was conducted using an ODK Collect application in the same cluster areas.
      Prevalence was measured by RDT, and hemoglobin data was gathered. In addition, the head of
      household was asked about the acceptability to IRS and their willingness to receive the
      insecticide in a future round.
