    
      This is a cross-sectional study where two groups of premenopausal women (ages 18-50 y) will
      be enrolled in a parallel arm study:

        -  Arm 1 (Surgical Menopause): up to 6 women undergoing laparoscopic, elective bilateral
           oophorectomy [Site: Pennington Biomedical Research Center].

        -  Arm 2 (Pharmacology-Induced Menopause): up to 6 women undergoing gonadal suppression via
           leuprolide acetate (Lupron [AbbVie Inc.]) [Site: UC-Denver].

      We will compare each arm of women to non-oophorectomized, premenopausal women (controls) with
      normal menstrual cycles (Apple&Pear study; NCT01748994; PI: Ravussin) selectively matched
      (1:2) for age and BMI. The Apple&Pear study uses the same in vivo adipogenesis labeling
      protocol, with similar age and BMI criteria, as the proposed study.
