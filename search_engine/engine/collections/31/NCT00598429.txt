    
      Hypoxemic respiratory failure (HRF), frequently associated with persistent pulmonary
      hypertension of the newborn (PPHN), is a rare, but life-threatening condition affecting
      approximately 2 to 9 percent of infants admitted to neonatal intensive care units and results
      in significant morbidity and mortality. It occurs more often in full- or post-term babies
      whose circulatory systems do not adapt well to breathing outside the womb. HRF may result
      from congenital hernia of the diaphragm, group B streptococcal infection, inhaling meconium
      in the womb, or respiratory distress syndrome.

      Medical treatments, such as high frequency ventilation, inhaled nitric oxide, and
      Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO, a heart and lung support machine), have
      significantly increased survival of children with HRF. These therapies, while successful,
      however, have a variety of side effects and potential long-term disabilities.

      This feasibility trial was designed to test the safety of using the intravenous form of
      Prostaglandin E1 in an inhaled form (iPGE1) on infants born at 34 0/7ths weeks gestational
      age or greater diagnosed with hypoxemic respiratory failure and on assisted ventilation. The
      intravenous form of PGE1 was to be aerosolized and administered via a nebulizer attached to
      the infant's ventilator. The goal was to enroll 50 subjects within 6-9 months, in preparation
      for a larger, multi-center randomized control trial; however, the study was withdrawn for
      lack of recruitment.
