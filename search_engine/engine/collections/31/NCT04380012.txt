    
      This study is an investigator-initiated, open-label, two-cohort phase II trial, assessing the
      objective response rate (ORR) of pyrotinib monotherapy (Cohort 1) or in combination with
      trastuzumab (Cohort 2), in HER2-positive advanced colorectal cancer.

      HER2 positivity is centrally established by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and silver in situ
      hybridization (SISH). To be HER2 eligible the original tumor, or the biopsied metastasis
      (whichever is last available), must be IHC 3+ or 2+ in more than 50% of cells, confirmed by
      SISH or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with a HER2:CEP17 ratio â‰¥ 2.0. For IHC a
      positive staining (3+) is defined as an intense membrane staining which can be
      circumferential, basolateral, or lateral of the tumor cells.
