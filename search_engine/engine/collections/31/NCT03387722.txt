    
      The primary objective of this study is to describe the treatments patterns of severe
      asthmatic patients across four Gulf countries during the past year.

      Secondary Objectives

        1. To determine the current level of asthma control in these patients. In addition, a
           comparison of uncontrolled asthma between those with a eosinophilic count ≥ 300 cell/μl
           and those with an elevated eosinophilic count less than that.

        2. To determine the current and past year levels of blood eosinophils, and the percentage
           of patients with elevated eosinophilic level ≥ 150 cells/μL and ≥ 300 cells/μL

        3. To describe the frequency of exacerbations during the past year.

        4. To assess the current quality of life (QoL) of these patients.

        5. To determine the past year levels of serum IgE.

        6. Exploratory objective: To determine the past year levels of other inflammatory
           biomarkers like periostin and fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO).
