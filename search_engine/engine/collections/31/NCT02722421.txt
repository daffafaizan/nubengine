      based antiretroviral therapy (ART), the only preferred first-line ART regimen in low and
      middle income countries, with a levonorgestrel (LNG)-releasing implant for one year reduced
      LNG plasma concentrations by approximately 50% compared to women not on ART. Importantly, the
      investigators also observed three unintended pregnancies (15%) in the investigators study
      group of women on EFV-based ART plus the LNG implant, in contrast to the <1% expected failure
      rate of the implant for women without drug interactions.

      This study will determine if increasing the dose of the LNG-releasing subdermal implant
      effectively overcomes the known pharmacokinetic interaction with EFV- based ART. LNG
      pharmacokinetic results from the participants enrolled in this dose escalation study (n=28)
      will be compared to HIV-infected Ugandan women on standard dose LNG without concomitant
      EFV-based ART.
