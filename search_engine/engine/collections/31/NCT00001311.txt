      intraocular lens to reduce the incidence and severity of post-operative inflammation in
      patients with uveitis undergoing extracapsular cataract surgery. Patients who have a history
      of uveitis and have been in remission on steroids and/or cyclosporine or cytotoxic agents for
      at least three months will be considered for this study. They will be randomized in a masked
      fashion to either a surface-modified lens or to a non-modified lens of similar design. The
      intraocular inflammation will be assessed using standardized clinical criteria, and by a
      laser cell flare meter at those sites using this equipment. The presence of inflammatory
      cells on the lens surface will be assessed using specular micrography. In an initial period,
      the study will only be carried out in the Clinical Center of the National Eye Institute (NEI)
      at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). However, in order to complete the study in a
      reasonable period of time, it may be expanded to include several outside centers.
