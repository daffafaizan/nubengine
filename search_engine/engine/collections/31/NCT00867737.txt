    
      Eligibility criteria include age 12-45 years, with current treatment of asthma with as-needed
      SABA only; and manifesting an acute response to SABA at screening of 40% or greater
      improvement in IOS low frequency reactance. After inclusion in the protocol, all subjects
      will receive active treatment, either with Advair or with Symbicort. Outcome measures will
      include large and small airway resistance and integrated low-frequency reactance calculated
      directly from IOS measures, and in addition, Large Airway Resistance, Small Airway Resistance
      and Small Airway Compliance derived from an electrical equivalent respiratory system model.
      Analysis of IOS data will be done post-testing by a respiratory physiologist, experienced
      with use of IOS and its analysis and interpretation, blinded to which treatment each
      individual received. Electrical-equivalent respiratory system model analyses will be done by
      a biomedical engineer, blinded to which treatment each individual received.
