      lung transplant patients. The plan is to accomplish this objective in 2 phases:

      Phase 1 - patients immediately post transplant will have a variety of physiologic
      measurements performed while breathing 0, 10, and 20 ppm inhaled NO. For the next 24 hours
      they will be kept on a mixture providing the best oxygen delivery and pulmonary artery
      pressure. Our specific aims in this phase are to characterize physiologic responses to
      inhaled NO and determine the incidence of IRLI in these patients over 24 hours.

      Phase 2 - patients immediately post transplant will be randomized to either INO or placebo
      gas and followed for 24 hours. Our specific aim in this phase is to compare the rate of
      development of IRLI in the two groups.
