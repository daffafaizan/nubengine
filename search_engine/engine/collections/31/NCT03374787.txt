      conduction. The sound processor picks up sound and converts it into vibrations that are
      transferred through the skull bone to the inner ear (cochlea). Thus, for patients with
      conductive or mixed hearing losses, patients with lasting hearing loss following a middle ear
      disease or malformations (such as microtia), the vibrations are bypassing the conductive
      problem in the ear canal or middle ear. Bone conduction devices currently on the market are
      divided into three types; transcutaneous direct drive, percutaneous (skin penetrating) direct
      drive and transcutaneous skin drive bone conduction devices. This evaluation focus on a sound
      processor used for a transcutaneous system.
