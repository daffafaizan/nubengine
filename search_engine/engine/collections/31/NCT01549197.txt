      in intensive care units (ICU). In France, no studies have evaluated the quality of the
      end-of-life process from both the professional and the lay perspective.

      The CAESAR scale has been developed from literature reviews and qualitative interviews with
      relatives, physicians and nurse to assess quality of dying in ICU. Our hypothesis is that
      perception of the quality of dying may impact on relatives' experience of bereavement
      (anxiety, depression, complicated grief, PTSD).
