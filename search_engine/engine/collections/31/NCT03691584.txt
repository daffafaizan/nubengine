    
      This is a Phase 1, open-label, randomized, PK and safety study in a maximum of 25 healthy
      subjects who have provided a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) sample. The dose planned to be
      administered in this study is an iv infusion of 30 mg TP 6076 q24h for 4 consecutive days
      (starting on Day 1 and ending on Day 4).

      Subjects will be randomized to undergo a BAL at a single time point: either 2, 4, 8, or 24
      hours after the start of the final TP-6076 iv infusion on Day 4. The BAL will be conducted in
      5 different subjects at each of the 4 time points, adding up to a total of 20 subjects.
