      ICU admission of patient, specifically symptoms of PTSD as the primary outcome, and symptoms
      of depression and anxiety as secondary outcomes. The study hypothesizes prevalence will be
      higher than seen in other studies.

      An additional aim is to identify predisposing or mitigating exposures for PICS-F. The study
      hypothesizes that increased psychological symptoms will be associated less exposure to
      virtual patient visits (tablet/video conferencing), higher number of patient comorbidities
      (using the Charleston comorbidity index), preexisting family member psychological conditions.

      The study also plans to evaluate the association between family perception of quality of
      communication or decision-making using items from the validated Family Satisfaction in the
      ICU (FS-ICU) and psychological symptoms. The study hypothesizes that the quality of
      communication and decision-making will be associated with lower psychological symptoms.

      Finally, the plan is to, using qualitative methods, explore and describe family members'
      stress, experiences with communication with healthcare providers and their satisfaction with
      ICU care while being physically distant from their loved ones. The aim is to use qualitative
      findings about family members' experiences to contextualize and explain results differences
      in stress, satisfaction and communication quality between low vs high PICS-F scores.
