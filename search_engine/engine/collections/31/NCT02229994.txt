      According to the ATS dyspnea is the term used to characterize a subjective experience of
      breathing discomfort, covering qualitatively distinct sensations of varying intensity.

      The subjective nature of dyspnea and the high complexity of its determinants explain the
      often moderate correlations obtained with physiological data. Dyspnea must therefore be
      measured specifically.

      The aim of this study is the cross-sectional and longitudinal psychometric validation of a
      self-administered dyspnea questionnaire (assessing the impact of dyspnea on activities
      restriction), usable in clinical practice in order to assess dyspnea and its alterations in
      adult patients with chronic respiratory diseases.

      (COPD, diffuse interstitial lung diseases, Pulmonary arterial hypertension, Cystic fibrosis)

      Like any psychometric instrument, an efficient evaluation of dyspnea scale should ideally
      satisfy all the following required features: evaluative, discriminant, good reproducibility,
      and high sensitivity to change.

      The desired features apart from content validity are reproducibility and especially a high
      sensitivity to change, particularly following pulmonary rehabilitation.

      Thus, this questionnaire should precisely enable to assess the benefit of rehabilitation and
      it's sustainment in maintenance phase.
