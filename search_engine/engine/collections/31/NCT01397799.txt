    
      KX2-391 has been evaluated in a Phase 1 dose escalation study in patients with solid tumors
      using twice-daily dosing. This study will employ the Storer's two-stage design to determine
      the maximum tolerated dose of KX2-391 mono-therapy,given as a once-daily oral dose,in elderly
      patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) who are refractory to or have declined
      standard induction therapy. The safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and activity of
      KX2-391 will be evaluated.
