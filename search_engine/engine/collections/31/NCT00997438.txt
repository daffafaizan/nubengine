    
      Subjects (healthy control, relapsing remitting MS and secondary progressive MS) will be
      recruited through patients of investigators at Portland VA Medical Center (PVAMC), Oregon
      Health & Science University (OHSU), and the community using flyers and word of mouth.

      The following will occur during screening:

        -  Medical History Questionnaire to include questions about drug and alcohol use

        -  Self Administered Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) Questionnaire (MS participants
           only)

        -  Vital Signs (heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure) will be measured and recorded

        -  Physical Exam (MS participants only unless necessary, based on the Medical History
           Questionnaire or vital signs, to ensure participant safety)

        -  Neurological Exam (MS participants only unless necessary, based on the Medical History
           Questionnaire or vital signs, to ensure participant safety)

        -  Weight

        -  Urine pregnancy test, if applicable

        -  Anemia testing by finger stick (approximately 1 drop)

      The rest of the study involves

        -  Blood draws before lipoic acid is given, 1 hour, 2 hours, 3 hours, 4 hours, 24 and 48
           hours after LA is given (3 Â½ tablespoons)

        -  Subjects will receive breakfast before they take LA

        -  Subjects will take 4 - 300 mg capsules of lipoic acid (LA) for a total of 1200mg with
           about 1 cup of water

      Blood will be processed to obtain plasma (from which lipoic acid concentrations will be
      measured) and PBMCs (from which cAMP and cytokines/chemokines will be measured).
