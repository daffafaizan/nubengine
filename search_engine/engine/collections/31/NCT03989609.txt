      µg.kg.hr-1. Each patient will receive the study drug within 6 hours after ICU admission.
      Depth of sedation will be assessed using Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale (RASS) scores
      (6), which range from -5 (unarousable) to +4 (combative). Study treatments will be infused
      without loading dose. Group I patients will have dexmedetomidine (4 µg.mL-1) and group II
      patients will have midazolam (0.33 mg.mL-1). Both drugs will be prepared in 0.9% sodium
      chloride in 50-mL syringe. Both the agents will be titrated to maintain the RASS in a range
      of -3 to -1. Dexmedetomidine infusion will be started at 0.1 µg.kg-1.hr-1 and will be
      adjusted by 0.1 µg.kg-1.h-1 to a maximum of 0.5 µg/kg/h, while midazolam will be started at 1
      mg.h-1 (3 mL.hr-1) and adjusted by 1 mg.h-1 to a maximum of 5 mg.h-1 (15 mL.h-1). All
      infusions will be adjusted by increments of 3 mL/hr-1. Patients in either group not
      adequately sedated by study drug titration will receive a bolus dose of fentanyl 0.5-1 µg.kg.
      Assessment of RASS score will be performed every 2 hours and prior to any dose of rescue
      therapy. The study drugs will be infused for 24 hours and after that the choice of sedation
      will be determined according to preference of attending physician.
