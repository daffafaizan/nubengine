      Group A will receive one rifaximin 550 mg tablet three times a day (1650 mg/day) for 14 days,
      and after a 4-week washout period, receive one placebo tablet three times a day for 14 days.

      Group B will receive placebo first, and then rifaximin with the same dosage schedule to Group
      A.
