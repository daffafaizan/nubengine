      randomized into two groups in the third month post transplant, they will be in use of
      tacrolimus, corticosteroids and Mycophenolate sodium. The group 1 will undergo a conversion
      from calcineurin inhibitor to Everolimus within 1 day (overnight), group 2 will be maintained
      with the initial immunosuppression. We will start Everolimus at 1 mg 2x/day and three days
      after the beginning we will adjust the dose by the serum levels, which will be kept in 6 to
      10ng/dL. The doses of corticosteroids and Mycophenolate sodium will be retained. There will
      be performed renal biopsies at randomization and after 12 months. The glomerular filtration
      rate will be calculated monthly using the MDRD.
