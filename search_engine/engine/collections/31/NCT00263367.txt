      will be inserted in to a vein and converted to a heparin lock indwelling port for the next
      blood draw. The child (ages 5-12 years) will then undergo 1 hour of compression at 1.3
      atmospheric pressure (4 psi above room air pressure). Supplemental oxygen will be provided to
      the child.

      A second blood draw from the catheter site will be accomplished immediately after the child
      comes out of the HBT chamber.

      These will be sent to the laboratories for evaluation of changes in reduced glutathione and
      lipid peroxides.
