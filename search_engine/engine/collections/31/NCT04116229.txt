      that assesses medical history. Obtainment of informed consent and further screening occurs on
      the day of the study visit. Participants then undergo a 2 hour oral glucose tolerance test
      (OGTT) including blood draws for metabolic and inflammatory marker levels in plasma. Lunch is
      then provided. Participants are then administered 30 minute computer-based cognitive testing
      from the NIH Toolbox Cognition Battery. After cognitive testing, participants undergo 1.5
      hour magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that includes structural, diffusion tensor, and
      functional MR imaging.
