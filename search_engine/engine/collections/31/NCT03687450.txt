      investigate the impact of the 6-week RISE program on psychological health in Longwood medical
      area residents. The RISE program is an existing standardized yoga program at Kripalu that
      will be adapted for residents in a 60-90-minute, once-weekly class for six weeks.
      Participants will be randomized to either the RISE yoga program or a no-treatment control
      group. Participants randomized to the RISE program will also be instructed to maintain a
      short 10-15-minute daily home yoga practice. Sessions will be lead by experienced instructors
      from Kripalu and will be held in the Longwood medical area. Self-report outcomes will be
      assessed at baseline, at program completion (post-program), at 2-month follow-up, and at
      6-month follow-up.

      Participants will include resident physicians at Longwood medical area hospitals. The only
      exclusion criterion is having practiced yoga, meditation, tai chi, qigong, or another
      mind-body practice at least 25 hours or more in the past 6 months. Participants must be
      willing not to practice mind-body programs other than the treatment protocol during the
      intervention. We plan to enroll up to 200 participants with a goal of at least 60
      participants with a 2:1 ratio of participants randomized to yoga to participants randomized
      to control. The control group will receive one session of RISE after their participation in
      the trial is complete.
