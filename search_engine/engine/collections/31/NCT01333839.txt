    
      90 subjects undergoing elective CABG surgery will be included. These subjects are free from
      orthopedic limitations, will have no severe complications during surgery, and are willing to
      participate in a 12-week exercise training intervention.

      At baseline (before surgery), following parameters will be assessed: blood parameters
      (glycemic control, lipid profile, anabolic/catabolic hormones, inflammatory markers), body
      composition (by dual x-ray absorptiometry), handgrip strength, and general subject features
      (medication, gender, age, etc.).

      The first three days after surgery, blood samples will be collected for the analysis of
      glycemic control, lipid profile, anabolic/catabolic hormones, inflammatory markers.

      Next, at the start of exercise intervention, after 6 and 12 weeks of exercise training, and
      after a 12-month follow-up, following parameters will be assessed: blood parameters (glycemic
      control, lipid profile, anabolic/catabolic hormones, inflammatory markers), body composition
      (by dual x-ray absorptiometry), handgrip strength, maximal exercise capacity (by
      ergospirometry testing), physical activity (by questionnaire), and quality of life ( by
      questionnaire).

      At 12 months of follow-up, cardiovascular mortality and morbidity (re-occurrence of angina,
      acute myocardial infarction, need for surgery, death) will be assessed.

      When initiating exercise intervention, subjects will randomly (n=30 in each group) be
      assigned to 12 weeks of standard exercise intervention (endurance exercise training),
      modified exercise intervention (endurance exercise training + strength training), or modified
      exercise intervention (endurance exercise training + strength training + oral protein
      supplements).

      This will be a cluster randomized clinical trial. Investigators executing the measurements
      will be blinded for treatment allocation.
