    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To investigate (in two stages) which proteins are overexpressed in association with
      12q13-q14 amplification by applying fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and
      immunohistochemical (IHC) assays to a panel of alveolar rhabdomyosarcomas (ARMS) cases
      organized into tissue microarrays.

      OUTLINE:

      Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue samples are analyzed for 12q13-q14 frequency and
      protein overexpression by FISH and IHC.
