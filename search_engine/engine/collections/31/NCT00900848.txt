    
      Patients were selected on the basis of the following: (1) closed injuries to the lower
      abdomen and/or pelvis; (2) serious hemorrhagic shock; (3) loss of blood supply to the
      ipsilateral lower extremity; (4) high-risk emergency artery reconstruction.

      The instruments used to measure sensibility of the foot were the Semmes-Weinstein (SW)
      monofilament test 24 and the static two-point discrimination (2PD) test 25. The
      weight-bearing area of the first metatarsal head and the dorsum of the first metatarsal head
      were assessed. Active range of motion (ROM) of the hip, knee, and ankle joints was measured
      with a goniometer. The muscle strength was test using Medical Research Council (MRC) Scale.
      The cold intolerance of the leg was measured using the self-administered Cold Intolerance
      Severity Score (CISS) questionnaire 26. The maximum score is 100 and is grouped into 4 ranges
      (0-25, 26-50, 51-75, and 76-100) corresponding to mild, moderate, severe, and extreme
      severity, respectively.
