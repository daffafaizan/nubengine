      early stages. Mammography is the key component to early detection, yet it remains
      underutilized due to cost, access, and factors such as fear of pain.

      Multiple studies have shown that most women find mammography uncomfortable, even painful.
      Yet, little research has been done to find methods to reduce mammography-related discomfort.
      In an unpublished Master's thesis, this investigator found that women who expected discomfort
      > 40 on a visual analog scale (VAS) who were pre-medicated with 1000 mg of acetaminophen
      reported lower discomfort scores than those pre-medicated with placebo, but the sample size
      was too small to reach statistical significance. Further study on the effects of
      pre-medication is needed.

      Pain should not be associated with a potentially lifesaving procedure. A more comfortable and
      positive experience with mammography may increase the number of women who participate in
      regular mammography screening, and, thereby, increase early detection and reduce the
      mortality rate, costs, and emotional trauma associated with breast cancer.
