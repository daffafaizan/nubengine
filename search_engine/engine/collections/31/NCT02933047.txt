      often benign. The women are healthy and young with a median age below 50 years. In Denmark,
      hysterectomy is performed as an inpatient procedure with a median hospitalization of 1 day.
      Hysterectomies in Denmark are distributed by 45% abdominal hysterectomies (AH), 35% vaginal
      hysterectomies (VH) and 20% laparoscopic hysterectomies (LH). There is no final consensus
      whether VH or LH should be recommended as first choice but LH is gaining more and more
      acceptance. Increasing evidence indicates that LH may be suitable for an outpatient setting.
      Data seem to assure that outpatient LH is feasible but patient's satisfaction in this setting
      remains an open question. A detailed analysis of data from a Norwegian study indicates that
      patients reporting dissatisfaction with the early discharge amounts to 25-38%. Such a
      decrease in patient's satisfaction would present a significant problem, and a randomized
      controlled study of sufficient size with focus on this aspect is therefore needed.

      Recommendations on postoperative sick leave vary considerably, due to lack of evidence-based
      guidelines and no firm data are available on the relation between outpatient treatment and
      sick leave in gynecology.

      This randomized controlled study attempt to examine outpatient LH and patient satisfaction
      and related subject as readmissions and complications, time to return to work, physical
      activity in the recuperation period and an overall socioeconomic calculation of the costs of
      LH in an in- and outpatient setting.
