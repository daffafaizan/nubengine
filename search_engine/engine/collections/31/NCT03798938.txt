      criteria for PAD included an ankle brachial index (ABI) of 0.90 or less at baseline. Those
      with an ABI greater than 0.90 at baseline were eligible if a non-invasive vascular ultrasound
      demonstrated PAD, lower extremity angiography showed arterial stenosis of 70% or greater, or
      medical records documented prior revascularization of lower extremities.9 Additionally,
      subjects must be willing and able to maintain an on-line food journal using smartphone-based
      dietary apps. Once enrolled, all participants underwent baseline evaluation, after which they
      were enrolled in either dietary advice for plant-based diet (PBD group) or no specific
      dietary advice (control group). The dietary intervention was continued for four months, at
      the end of which a follow up evaluation was performed.
