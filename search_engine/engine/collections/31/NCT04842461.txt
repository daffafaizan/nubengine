      a healthy lifestyle; cooperation to achieve common goals, and justice, rejecting unjustified
      advantages in competition. The concept of fair play is on which the development of those
      values pivots. From a holistic perspective, it is possible to define fair play, not only as a
      way to participate but also as a way of projecting people in life with values, assuming a set
      of behaviors that enhance a healthy and respectful sporting experience with opponents, the
      companions, the spectators, the referees and all the agents that take part in the sport
      practice.

      Since 2018, joint actions have been carried out with the Villarreal de FÃºtbol Club, within
      the framework of the ENDAVANT agreement. Within these actions, it is proposed to develop
      different lines of research on sport and health. Within these lines, one of special relevance
      is that related to the risk of consumption of illicit substances and / or behavioral
      addictions, in elite athletes, since they are subjected to intense training days and stress
      situations derived from the demands of performance of professional competitive activity. On
      the other hand, recently published behavioral studies show that athletes who practice
      non-contact sports have a greater capacity to identify and assess emotions than athletes who
      practice contact sports and than those who practice contact sports show higher levels of
      physical aggression or verbal, and hostility or anger, than athletes who practice individual
      and non-contact sports.
