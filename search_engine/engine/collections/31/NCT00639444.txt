      timing of gluten exposure in at-risk infants. Infants at family risk for CD (at least one
      first-degree relative affected) are enrolled in this prospective, multicentre, intervention
      study conducted in Italy. Infants are randomly assigned to introduce gluten at either 4-6 or
      12 months (groups A and B, respectively) and then enter a follow-up period of 5 years.
      Duration of breastfeeding and types of formulas, adherence to the dietary plan, amount of
      gluten administered, and clinical data are collected by phone or direct interview at 4, 7, 9,
      and 12 months of age. HLA (Human Leucocyte Antigene) status and CD serology
      (anti-transglutaminase and other autoantibodies) are tested at 15, 24, 36 and 60 months of
      age.
