      will consist of 2 periods that taken together, will last up to a maximum of 21 days: a
      Screening Period and a Baseline Period. The Randomization Phase will comprise 4 treatment
      periods (Treatment 1, Treatment 2, Treatment 3, Treatment 4) with intervening washout periods
      between treatment periods (Washout 1, Washout 2, Washout 3). A single dose of study drug will
      be administered in a randomized, 3-way double-blind crossover manner at Treatment Periods
      1-3; flurazepam 30 mg will be administered in an open-label manner at Treatment Period 4.
