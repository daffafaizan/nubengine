      learn they are infected, it is not known if treatment for recently infected patients results
      in slower progression of HIV disease. This study will compare the virologic outcomes of
      recently infected adults who receive highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) with those
      who receive no treatment. This study will also compare the effects of treatment on patients
      who enroll within 3 months of seroconversion (acute seroconverters) with patients who enroll
      within 3 to 12 months of seroconversion (early seroconverters).

      This study will last at least 3 years. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two
      groups. Group 1 will receive HAART for 1 year; Group 2 will receive no treatment. There will
      be at least 20 study visits over the 3-year study period. Blood collection will occur at all
      study visits. A physical exam, medical and medication history, and risk behavior assessment
      will occur at most visits; participants will also be asked to complete an adherence
      questionnaire at most visits.
