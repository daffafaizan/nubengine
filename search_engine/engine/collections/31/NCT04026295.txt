    
      In a randomized clinical trial, 72 ambulatory children with spastic CP (6-10 yrs.) will
      receive either SBLTT or an equivalent dosage of TLTT for 40 sessions, 5x/week for 8 weeks in
      a massed practice format. The only difference between training protocols will be the variable
      training (interval fast versus steady state walking speeds). Thus, the key ingredient will be
      the intensity of the interval training delivered in a serial blocked practice schedule.
      Outcomes will be collected at baseline, 4 and 8 weeks to assess dosage, and 24 weeks post
      training for long term retention with the primary endpoint at 8 weeks.
