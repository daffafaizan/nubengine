    
      E2083, or LUSEDRAÂ® (fospropofol disodium) Injection, is an intravenous (IV) sedative-hypnotic
      agent indicated for monitored anesthesia care (MAC) sedation in adult patients undergoing
      diagnostic or therapeutic procedures.1 It is a water-soluble, phosphono-O-methyl prodrug of
      propofol. Upon IV injection, the inactive fospropofol undergoes metabolism, most notably by
      alkaline phosphatase enzymes, to yield the active metabolite (propofol), phosphate, and
      formaldehyde. Formaldehyde is quickly converted to formate in vivo, and formate is further
      metabolized by a folate-dependent mechanism.
