      eligibility criteria. Subject medical background and underlying disease requiring
      intervention will be taken at screening. Procedure will be scheduled. Subjects that will
      eventually, for any reason, will not be operated with the TroClose1200™, will be considered
      as "screen failures". The use of the TroClose1200™ will be done in at least one 12mm planned
      access port per the TroClose1200™ Instruction for Use. The procedure will be performed
      routinely. Duration of use of the TroClose1200™ each time it is used will be measured, as
      well as the entire procedure duration, and the type of procedure. Adverse Events and device
      malfunctions, if any, will be recorded. The video seen in the monitors during the procedure
      will be kept as source data for any further analysis. The location of the TroClose1200™ used,
      as well as the other trocars used location, will be drawn on a special chart. Subjects will
      be hospitalized in accordance with the hospital guidance. All subjects will be followed at 2
      weeks (+/- 4 days), at 6 weeks (+/- 1 week), at 12 months (+/- 1 month) and at 24 months (+/-
      2 months) in which healing, signs of hernia and adverse events will be recorded. In the 12
      and 24 months visit, the hernia signs will be evaluated by ultrasound.
