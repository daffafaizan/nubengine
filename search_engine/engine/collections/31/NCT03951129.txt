      dialysis, or hemodialysis, and the majority of these patients live on hemodialysis dependent.
      The venous access route required for hemodialysis is provided by dialysis catheters until
      arterio-venous shunts are performed. The aim of this study was to determine the difference
      between verbal or video-related anxiety levels of patients with hemodialysis and determine
      which one is better before the hemodialysis procedure is performed.
