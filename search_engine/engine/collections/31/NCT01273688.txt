      Thera-Band Flex-Bar device. Supination and pronation are performed with each position on hold
      for 2s with 15 repetitions. This is repeated in three sets of 15 repetitions each twice
      daily. In other words, 6x15 repetitions of supination and pronation per day are suggested in
      the eccentric training using the Thera-Band Flex-Bar.

      The combination group performs the same eccentric training. In addition, patients wear a
      orthopedic elbow brace (Epi-Hit) in order to overcome the elbow pain.

      This is a clinical trial, thus pain reduction on a visual analogue scale is the primary
      outcome parameter. Evaluation will be performed after 12 weeks of intervention.
