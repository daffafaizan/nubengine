    
      This is a multi-center study to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of
      belimumab intravenous (IV) in pediatric patients 5 to 17 years of age with active systemic
      lupus erythematosus (SELENA SLEDAI score â‰¥ 6). The study will consist of three phases: a
      52-week randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind phase; a long term open label
      continuation phase; and a long term safety follow up phase. The long term open label
      continuation and safety follow up periods will continue for at least 5 years and possibly up
      to 10 years from a subject's initial treatment with belimumab. Enrolment will be staggered by
      age cohorts to allow safety and PK interim analyses. Subjects will be randomized to belimumab
      10mg/kg or placebo IV monthly dosing while continuing to receive background standard therapy
      throughout the study. An independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) will monitor the study
      as it progresses.
