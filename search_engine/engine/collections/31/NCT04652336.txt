    
      Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy (LSG) is now the most commonly performed bariatric surgery
      world wide. The results of LSG on outcomes of GERD are conflicting. It has been reported to
      increase the severity of pre existing GERD and also to cause new onset GERD in considerable
      number of patients.

      In this study the effect of adding a novel procedure i.e. ligamentum teres cardiopexy,(LTC)
      to regular LSG on occurence of de Novo GERD will be investigated. de Novo GERD has been found
      to occur in 20% of cases post LSG.

      This study is a randomized, prospective, parallel group, controlled trial to compare the
      effect of LSG versus LSG with LTC on occurence of de Novo GERD.

      This is a single center based trial, being conducted in GEM hospital and research center,
      Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, India. The trial has been approved by GEM research ethics committee.

      Investigators are planning to enroll patients who are not having any objective or subjective
      evidence of GERD. The participants will be optimized as per institutional bariatric surgery
      protocol. After complete evaluation and optimization, participants will be randomized by
      computer generated random numbers into either LSG or LSG with LTC group.

      The demographic data, preoperative GERD - Q scores, 24 hour pH study, intra operative details
      will be recorded. Post operative details during each follow up will be recorded, which will
      include excess weight loss, GERD - Q scores. At 6 months follow up repeat 24 hour pH study
      will be done to assess the status of GERD objectively.

      The trial duration is expected to be of 1 year where in investigators will be recruiting
      patients for 6 months.
