      blind randomised clinical trial. Consecutive participants were recruited from the outpatient
      Physiotherapy clinic of the Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital, Kano, Nigeria and were randomly
      assigned to one of two exercise groups: Lumbar Stabilisation Group (LSG; n = 27) or Treadmill
      Walk Group (TWG; n = 26). However, 50 participants, (LSG: n = 25; and TWG: n = 25) completed
      the eight week study. Participants in the LSG had lumbar stabilisation exercises using McGill
      protocol while those in the TWG had walking exercise on a treadmill using the Bruce protocol.
      Treatment was applied three times weekly for eight weeks. Outcomes assessed at baseline and
      end of eighth week of study were: Pain Intensity (PI) using Visual Analogue scale, Functional
      Disability (FD) using Oswestry Disability Index Questionnaire; and Multifidus Muscle
      Activation (MMA) level using a surface electromyography machine. Data were analysed using
      descriptive statistics, paired and independent t-tests at Î±0.05.
