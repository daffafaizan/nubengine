      among three dose regimens in children with stage IV neuroblastoma. II. Determine the highest
      tolerated level if a sustained increase in NK-cell number is observed. III. Determine the
      type, duration, and reversibility of side effects at the three dose levels. IV. Confirm the
      chosen dose level.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, parallel, open label, multicenter study. Part I: Patients
      receive one of three doses of interleukin-2 (IL-2) subcutaneously beginning 20 to 40 days
      following autologous stem cell reinfusion. IL-2 is administered for 5 consecutive days every
      14 days for up to 3 months, for a total of 6 courses. Cohorts of 5 patients are entered at
      each dose level of IL-2 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is
      defined as the dose at which 3 or more patients experience dose limiting toxicity. Part II:
      Additional patients receive IL-2 at the dose level below the MTD. These patients are
      stratified according to prior therapy (melphalan plus megatherapy vs total body irradiation
      or meta-iodobenzylguanidine scan plus melphalan vs busulfan containing regimens). Patients
      are followed at 1 week.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 25 patients will be accrued for this study.
