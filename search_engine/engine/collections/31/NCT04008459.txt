      a degenerative spinal condition and measure them longitudinally. The investigators will
      measure spinal alignment, walking capacity and pattern, dynamic balance, and back muscle
      strength along with self-reported measures that reflect the person's functional
      self-efficacy, quality of life, and general health. Physical and self-reported outcome
      measures will be assessed at baseline before the physiotherapy-led exercise class commences,
      after completion at 6 weeks, and 6 months post baseline.
