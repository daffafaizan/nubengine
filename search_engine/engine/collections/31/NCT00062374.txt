    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the correlation of fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography
      (PET)/computed tomography (CT) imaging early in the preoperative treatment program of locally
      advanced gastric cancer with histologic response assessment and patient outcome, defined as
      overall and progression-free survival.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of preoperative chemotherapy with irinotecan and
      cisplatin in the treatment of locally advanced gastric cancer.

      II. To examine the biology of locally advanced gastric cancer and the response to
      chemotherapy by DNA microarray technology and by histopathology.

      III. To obtain preliminary data on biodistribution, dosimetry and explore the potential
      clinical usefulness of fluorodeoxythymidine (FLT) PET in patients with locally advanced
      gastric cancer undergoing a novel combination neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, nonrandomized, multicenter study.

      Neoadjuvant chemotherapy: Patients receive cisplatin intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes
      followed by irinotecan IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, 22, and 29. Treatment repeats every 6
      weeks for 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Surgery: Within 4 weeks after completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, patients undergo
      radical subtotal or total gastrectomy with lymph node dissection.

      Patients undergo fluorodeoxyglucose FDG-PET/CT at baseline. Some patients undergo additional
      FDG-PET/CT scans in weeks 3 and 6. Approximately 5 patients undergo fluorothymidine
      FLT-PET/CT at baseline, during week 3, and/or before surgical resection.

      Patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 2 years, and then
      annually thereafter.
