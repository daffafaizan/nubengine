      in lowering access site complications, as well as increased patient comfort, has been proven
      unequivocally. One of the complications of transradial access is radial artery occlusion
      (RAO) that occurs with a variable incidence. It is population specific, with a higher
      prevalence in subsets, such as women, and patient's with small radial arteries. RAO is also
      known to be higher at hospital discharge and radial recanalization may spontaneously occur at
      later times. It is usually asymptomatic. Its main adverse impact is by limiting future
      transradial access from that radial artery. Since most of the patient's with atherosclerotic
      vascular disease may undergo several invasive procedures during their lifetime, prevention of
      RAO is of paramount importance.

      Heparinization, during the procedure, has been shown to be of benefit in lowering the
      incidence of RAO. Maintaining patency of the radial artery during hemostasis, has also been
      shown to be effective in prevention of RAO following transradial access. As maintenance of
      flow has potent antithrombotic effect, it is unclear whether systemic anticoagulation is
      still required in all cases.

      In some cases, it would be preferable to avoid heparin administration prior to coronary
      angiography. It is currently unknown whether it would be safe to refrain from heparin
      administration in case of transradial catheterization and patent hemostasis technique.
