      metabolism in patients with prediabetes and eventually reduce the incidence of PTDM in renal
      transplant. The main objective of the study is to induce the reversibility of prediabetes by
      means of exercise. Additionally, the secondary objectives are: (a) to evaluate the compliance
      of exercise (b) improvements in metabolic risk factors profile: obesity, triglycerides, blood
      pressure and HDL cholesterol.
