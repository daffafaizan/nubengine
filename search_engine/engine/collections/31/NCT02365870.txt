      peoples thoughts, feelings, and ability to function normally. Anxiety can affect anyone, but
      people with Parkinson's appear to be at a much higher risk with an estimated 40% or more
      suffering from anxiety. Parkinson's is a neurological disorder that causes tremor and other
      problems with normal movements. The disease symptoms are believed to be caused in large part
      by the loss of dopamine producing cells in the midbrain. Anxiety in Parkinson's may be
      associated with the loss of dopamine caused by the disease and therefore may respond to
      dopamine based treatments. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of the rotigotine
      transdermal patch, a dopamine replacement medication, in reducing symptoms of anxiety in
      people with Parkinson's disease.

      Participants in this double-blind study will be randomly assigned to receive either
      rotigotine or a placebo patch for 8-weeks. All participants will be evaluated at the study
      site at baseline and weeks 2, 4, and 8. Psychiatric, cognitive, and movement assessments will
      be performed along with a review of anxiety symptoms. All participants will be offered
      continued routine psychiatric care with the study physician upon completion of the study.
