    
      The purpose of this study is to compare the bioequivalence of a test formulation of primidone
      tablets to an equivalent oral dose of the commercially available Mysoline® (primidone
      tablets) in adult subjects under fasting conditions.

      Twenty-two healthy, non-smoking, non-obese male and female volunteers at least 18 years of
      age will be randomly assigned in a crossover fashion to receive each of two primidone dosing
      regimens in sequence with a 14 day washout period between dosing periods. On the morning of
      Day 1, after an overnight fast of at least 10 hours, subjects will receive either a single
      oral dose of the test formulation, primidone (1 x 50 mg tablet) or a single oral dose of the
      reference formulation, Mysoline® (1 x 50 mg tablet). After a 14 day washout period, on the
      morning of Day 15 after an overnight fast, subjects will receive the alternate regimen. Blood
      samples will be drawn from all participants before dosing and for 72 hours post dose at times
      sufficient to adequately define the pharmacokinetics of primidone. A further goal of this
      study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of this regimen in healthy volunteers.
      Subjects will be monitored throughout the confinement portion of the study for adverse
      reactions to the study drugs and/or procedures. Blood pressure and heart rate will be
      obtained prior to dosing and at 3, 4, 6, 24 and 72 hours post-dose. All adverse events
      whether elicited by query, spontaneously reported or observed by clinic staff will be
      evaluated by the investigator and reported in the subject's case report form.
