    
      All general surgery interns and PGY-2's AND PGY 3's will be enrolled in a laparoscopic
      surgery training curriculum that includes practicing surgical skills on a laparoscopic
      simulator. The PI has constructed an examination on the simulator that will document a
      significant level of laparoscopic skill. Each general surgery intern, second, AND THIRD year
      general surgery resident will be required to pass this examination on the simulator prior to
      being given more responsibility during cases of laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Specifically,
      interns, second, AND THIRD year residents must pass the examination on the simulator before
      they are allowed to function as primary surgeon in a supervised setting during laparoscopic
      cholecystectomy. These interns, PGY-2's, AND PGY 3'S would then be allowed to function as
      primary surgeon under the supervision of an attending surgery for laparoscopic
      cholecystectomy cases. The outcomes of these cases would be compared to a matched group of
      laparoscopic cholecystectomy cases performed by second year general surgery residents in the
      same supervised environment (but without having trained on the simulator) one year prior.
