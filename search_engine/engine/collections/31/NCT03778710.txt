    
      A retrospective chart review was made of all patients who presented with gastric cancer after
      curative surgery resection from January 1, 1995 to December 31, 2016 in Ramathibodi
      Hospital.Data of metastasis node by lymph node ratio (LNR) were evaluated. The total of lymph
      node less than 15 and more than 15 were evaluated. The Kaplan-Meier curve estimates
      recurrence survival (Log-rank test). The p-value < 0.05 is statistically significant.

      OBJECTIVE :

      The outcome of this study was evaluated lymph node ratio (LNR) status that determined by the
      ratio of total lymph node metastasis and the total lymph node which retrieved after performed
      the curative surgery and lymphadenectomy of gastric cancer. The correlation of LNR and
      prognosis of recurrence and survival of gastric cancer patients were evaluated and reported
      in this study.
