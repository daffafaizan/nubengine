    
      Comparing beginners pre-training (less than 1 hour of slackline training) to post-training (9
      times 30 minutes of individual, controlled training) to investigate the effects of balance
      training on a slackline.

      Comparing beginners (less than 1 hour of slackline training) to professionals (more than 100
      hours of slackline training) to investigate differences in balance strategies.

      Comparing professionals during slacklining under two different conditions of their visual
      anchor: fix vs. moving. This to investigate the role of the visual system during balance
      reactions.

      Comparing slackline training versus a demanding training standing-on-1-leg. We do compare
      Y-balance-performance, performance on the MFT challenge disc, each compared with
      simultanousely recording body Sway (lower trunk) with SwayStar.

      Muscle activity will be investigated by absolute amplitude (mV) and frequency to get an idea
      of which muscle fibers are acting during the task and how the activation pattern may change
      through motor learning.

      Body kinematics should show movement strategies especially differences in roll and pitch
      control of the body.
