      study. A nasoduodenal tube will be sited under fluoroscopic guidance the day prior to the
      study.In study A they will receive intraduodenal intralipid (20% at 60 ml/hour) alongside 60
      ml/hour of 20% dextrose or fructose for 15 hours starting at 4am. In study B they will
      receive 60 ml/hour of intraduodenal intralipid with 60ml/hour of normal saline for 15 hours
      from 4am. A pancreatic clamp (octreotide with replacement glucose, insulin, glucagon and
      growth hormone) will be started at 7am. From 9am an iv bolus of deuterated-glycerol
      (d5-glycerol) along with a regular infusion of deuterated leucine (L-[5,5,5-2H3]. Regular
      blood samples will be drawn to assess lipoprotein kinetics.
