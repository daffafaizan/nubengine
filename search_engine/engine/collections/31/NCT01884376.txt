    
      The Neuromaix nerve guide is an absorbable implant composed of porcine collagen, used to
      bridge a peripheral nerve discontinuity, and to create a conduit for axonal growth across the
      nerve gap. Neuromaix provides a protective environment for peripheral nerve regeneration
      after injury. Neuromaix connects the proximal and distal ends of a transected nerve, allowing
      regenerating axons to grow through the scaffold, into the distal nerve tissue towards the
      target muscle or skin.

      Neuromaix is composed of two parts. The Epimaix part provides the structural characteristics
      needed to suture the nerve guide in place and to prevent ingrowth of scar tissue. The
      Perimaix part provides a structure that mimics endoneurial tubes, providing guidance for the
      regenerating axons while bridging the nerve gap.
