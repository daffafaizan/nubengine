      gestational age of 28 to 36 weeks who are stable on CPAP pressure of 5 cmH2O and with oxygen
      concentrations (FiO2) <0.30, keeping these infants on CPAP or changing them to NC flow of 1-2
      L/min will not make any difference in length of hospitalization, length of respiratory
      support and incidence of complications.
