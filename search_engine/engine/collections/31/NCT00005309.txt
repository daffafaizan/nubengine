      In the late 1980s, hemophiliacs were transfused with a variety of blood products, including
      large amounts of cryoprecipitate. In comparison to other cohorts, hemophiliacs are CMV(-),
      resulting in a comparison group for the study of this virus as a potential cofactor. In
      contrast, non A, non-B hepatitis is common in comparison to other cohorts, and preliminary
      data prior to 1990 suggested that this chronic disease predisposes to more rapid progression
      of HIV infection.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      Disease-free survival rates were determined in HIV-infected hemophiliacs. The effects of
      co-factors such as intensive transfusion, concomitant cytomegalovirus or chronic NANB
      hepatitis infection were ascertained. Host-virus interaction was assessed through the use of
      plasma cultures, specific antibody titers, and markers of immune changes detected by flow
      cytometry and immune function assays. The immunology of asymptomatic stable infection was
      investigated. The safety of volunteer donor blood products was determined in seronegative
      patients exposed to over 50,000 donors yearly and the risk of sexual transmission of HIV to
      spouses of seropositive patients was monitored.
