    
      Herpes simplex labialis is a common, worldwide affliction for which neither public health
      procedures, vaccines, nor antiviral chemotherapy have had a major impact. The present study
      has been proposed because it has become clear there are marked limitations to the benefit of
      antiviral therapy in herpes labialis. Recently, a pilot trial of the combination of
      famciclovir and topical 0.05% fluocinonide vs famciclovir alone showed that the addition of
      corticosteroids to the antiviral drug treatment caused a marked and statistically significant
      reduction in lesion size and a trend to more aborted lesions.

      This study is designed as a randomized, placebo-controlled, , patient-initiated study. The
      objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of oral valacyclovir 2grams
      BID for one day and topical temovate 0.05% gel BID for three days compared to placebo
      capsules and placebo gel in the episodic treatment of a single episode of recurrent herpes
      labialis in immunologically normal patients.

      Subjects will be screened, randomized to study drug and instructed to start using study drug
      within one hour of the first sign or symptom of their next episode of herpes labialis. Data
      on the treated lesion will be collected by clinic visits and a patient diary card.
