      direct current stimulation (tDCS) have provided novel and low risk options to rehabilitate
      the impaired ability of the central nervous system (CNS) to process sensorimotor information.
      Furthermore, tDCS appears to enhance CNS connectivity and there is preliminary evidence
      indicating that patients with Parkinson's Disease (PD) may experience improvement in working
      memory, the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, simple reaction time and the Purdue
      Pegboard test. tDCS is inexpensive, portable and available for repeated home use. It may
      provide long-lasting enhancement of cortical activity in part because tDCS is easy to
      administer frequently and to combine it with other rehabilitation approaches including
      posture and gait training. However to date, no study has examined quantitatively the effects
      of tDCS on posture control and walking ability in patients with PD. As a first step we plan
      to identify the immediate effects of tDCS, as well as the added value of tDCS to treadmill
      exercise training, to improve posture and gait of individuals with PD.
