      Primary

        -  Determine the ability of octreotide to prevent the incidence of moderate, severe, or
           life-threatening chemoradiotherapy-induced diarrhea (grades 2-4) in patients with anal
           or rectal cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Compare the quality of life of patients treated with this drug vs placebo.

        -  Compare the number of hospitalizations and use of antidiarrheal agents (e.g., Imodium®)
           related to diarrhea (or its complications) in patients treated with these drugs.

        -  Compare treatment delays and/or dose reductions (chemotherapy and radiotherapy) in
           patients treated with these drugs.

      OUTLINE: This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, multicenter study. Patients
      are stratified according to radiotherapy dose (< 50 Gy vs ≥ 50 Gy), chemotherapy dose (bolus
      vs continuous), and gender. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive octreotide* intramuscularly (IM) 4-7 days before the start of
           chemoradiotherapy and on day 22 (± 3 days) during chemoradiotherapy.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive placebo* IM 4-7 days before the start of chemoradiotherapy and
           on day 22 (± 3 days) during chemoradiotherapy.

      NOTE: *Patients receive a total of 2 injections of octreotide or placebo

      In both arms, treatment continues in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, at the completion of chemoradiotherapy, and at 3, 6,
      9, and 15 months from the start of chemoradiotherapy.

      Patients are followed at 3, 6, 9, and 15 months from the start of chemoradiotherapy.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 226 patients (113 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 2 years.
