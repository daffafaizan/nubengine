      therapy. The study target population consists of females, aged 18 to 85 years of age with a
      clinical diagnosis of IC/BPS and symptoms of chronic urinary frequency, pelvic
      pain/discomfort, and/or urinary urgency. The approximate number of subjects that will be
      enrolled in the study is 128, 64 women in each treatment group. Women who satisfy all of the
      eligibility criteria will be enrolled in the study and randomized to receive bladder
      treatments (instillation of medications into the bladder) or pelvic floor physical therapy.

      Outcome measures will include validated questionnaires, voiding diaries, and Global Response
      Assessment (GRA). The investigators also will evaluate changes in pelvic floor muscle tone
      and discomfort pre and post treatment, and their relationship to symptom changes. Finally,
      the investigators will utilize their well-established urine and serum biomarkers evaluations
      pre and post treatment to determine if they correlate with symptom change.
