      rituximab or tocilizumab, in patients who develop side effects while on treatment with
      immunotherapy requiring prolonged steroids. Immune-related side effects are caused by
      activation of the immune system from treatment with immunotherapy. Both rituximab and
      tocilizumab have been given to patients with autoimmune diseases (diseases where the immune
      system is activated against normal organs). Immune-related side effects appear to closely
      mirror these autoimmune conditions.

      Participants in this study have developed an immune-related adverse event while on
      immunotherapy and require a long course of steroids to manage this side effect. Steroids can
      cause many side effects with prolonged use including problems with sleep, weight gain,
      diabetes, muscle loss, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, bone loss, and mood
      disturbances. Drugs such as rituximab and tocilizumab have been shown to be effective in
      other diseases involving immune system activation. This study is evaluating the effectiveness
      of these drugs in patients who have immune-related side effects by their ability to help
      patients discontinue steroids.
