      Fluvoxamine is a serotonin reuptake inhibitor that is FDA-approved for the treatment of
      obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in adults and children. Anxiety disorders other than OCD
      are very common in youth and are not always responsive to psychosocial therapies. Fluvoxamine
      is an alternative treatment.

      After a 3-week period of evaluation, patients meeting study entry criteria are randomized to
      receive either fluvoxamine or placebo for 8 weeks. After this double-blind phase, patients
      can enter a 4-month open-label extension.
