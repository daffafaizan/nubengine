    
      PROACTIVE-19 is a pragmatic, randomized controlled clinical trial with adaptive "sample size
      re-estimation" design. Volunteers will be randomized into two groups: (A) generalized health
      education; (B) personalized health education. Participants will go through phone questioning
      and recommendation in 5 fields: (1) mental health (2) smoking habits, (3) physical activity,
      (4) dietary habits, (5) alcohol consumption. Both groups A and B will receive the same line
      of questioning to assess habits concerning these topics. In Group A: questioning will be done
      in sequence followed by a shared minimal intervention aimed towards improvement of these
      factors but without any personalized recommendation. In Group B: each assessment will be
      followed by specific and personalized recommendations. Assessment will be done weekly during
      the first month, every second week in the second month, then monthly. Considering one interim
      analysis for efficacy the estimated sample size is 3788 (rounded up to 3800) subject per
      study arm. The planned duration of the follow up is a minimum of one year.
