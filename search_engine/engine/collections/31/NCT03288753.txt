      sensorineural hearing loss. Oticon Medical recently developed a new cochlear implant system,
      including a new implantable internal part (Neuro Zti) and a new speech processor (Neuro 1).
      This new speech processor automatically detects and adapts to the sound environment,
      increasing the ease of listening in all situations. A second version of this speech processor
      has very recently been developed, called the Neuro 2. The Neuro 1 and 2 share the same signal
      processing characteristics and the "sound" delivered to the patient is similar. However, the
      Neuro 2 offers better ergonomics (smaller size and weight, rechargeable batteriesâ€¦). Some
      improvements available on the Neuro 2 may be particularly interesting for children.

      The aim of the present study is twofold: 1. Compare the satisfaction of adult and pediatric
      users for the speech processor Neuro 1 with their satisfaction for the Neuro 2, and 2. Show
      that audiological outcomes are at least as good for the Neuro 2 than for the Neuro 1.

      The participants come at the hospital for three visits. The Neuro 1 is evaluated during the
      first visit (V1). Evaluation of the Neuro 2 takes place during the second (V2, 15 days after
      V1) and the third (V3, 3 months after V2).
