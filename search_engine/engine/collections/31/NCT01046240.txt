      are administered either intravenously or orally. Nevertheless sometimes neither
      administration route is feasible, such as in patients unable to admit oral intake managed in
      an outpatient setting. Our objective is to evaluate the bioavailability of subcutaneous
      palonosetron.Patients receiving platinum-based chemotherapy will be randomized to receive
      palonosetron 3 mg either subcutaneously or intravenously in a crossover manner during two
      cycles. Blood and urine samples will be collected after each cycle. Pharmacokinetics of
      subcutaneous and IV palonosetron will be prospectively compared.
