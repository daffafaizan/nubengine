      disease). Patients with secondary HPT often have enlarged parathyroid glands in the neck and
      as a result often have elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels . Patients with secondary
      HPT may have bone disease (osteodystrophy). Cinacalcet has been used to decrease PTH levels
      in patients with secondary HPT. Patients with secondary HPT may have bone disease
      (osteodystrophy). This bone disease may cause bone pain, fractures, and poor formation of red
      blood cells. The purpose of this study is to evaluate effects of cinacalcet on markers of
      bone turnover in patients with kidney disease who are receiving dialysis.
