      partial recovery. International classification of lower extremity chronic venous disorders
      СЕАР was used as a clinical classification of chronic venous insufficiency (CVI).

      Depending on the applied treatment method, patients were divided into 2 groups:

        1. (n=34) Conventional treatment

        2. (n=34) Conventional treatment + combined LLLT, including external exposure with 635nm
           wavelength + intravenous laser blood illumination (ILBI) with 365-405nm (UV-spectrum)
           and 520-525nm (green spectrum) wavelength alternately, according to the special scheme
