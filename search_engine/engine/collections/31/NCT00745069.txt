      million people or 1 in 6). Osteoarthritis of the knee is a very common and a major cause of
      disability. Pharmacological treatment includes the following analgesics: non-steroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), cyclo-oxygenase II (COX-II) inhibitors, acetaminophen and
      opioids. Despite the numerous available analgesic medications, 60% to 80% of patients
      suffering from chronic pain are currently treated inadequately. Opioid analgesics have been
      shown to be efficacious in chronic non-malignant pain and can be an important therapeutic
      asset. The study was a 4-week randomized multicenter double-blind, placebo- and
      active-controlled, parallel-group, forced-titration phase 2B study of efficacy and safety
      with tapentadol extended release (ER) to 233 mg BID and oxycodone PR to 20 mg BID vs placebo
      in subjects with moderate to severe chronic pain of knee osteoarthritis. Primary efficacy
      outcome was the average pain intensity 24 hours before the last evaluation time or 29 days.
      Safety was evaluated by reporting of adverse events, laboratory tests, vital sign measures,
      ECGs. This study hypothesis was that tapentadol extended release was effective in relieving
      chronic moderate to severe pain from knee osteoarthritis compared to treatment with placebo
      using 2 dosing regimens for tapentadol.

      tapentadol extended release white, fim-coated tablet taken orally twice a day during a 4-week
      period at a dose that steadily increased up to 100 mg or 200 mg; placebo tablets; or
      oxycodone extended release tablet, 20 mg.
