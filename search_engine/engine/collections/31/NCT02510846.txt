      communication and socialization.

      Our hypothesis is that an intensive multimodal educative program of 5 hours a week during 12
      months compared to the usual practice of 1 hour a week conducts to the reduction of
      behavioral disorders and improves the quality of life and feelings of caregivers.

      This study is multicenter, controlled, randomized in two parallel groups and open-labelled
      comparing usual practice of educative program and intensive educative program during 12
      months.

      The evolution of predominant behavioral disorder and quality of life and feelings of
      caregivers is evaluated at inclusion (M0), six months after (M6) and twelve months after
      (M12).
