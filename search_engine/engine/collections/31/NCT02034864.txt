      pain (LBP) is frequent, disabling and costly. The effectiveness of usual treatments
      (including pain killers, anti-inflammatory drugs, spinal injections, physiotherapy, spinal
      traction, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, etc) may be not sufficient, and many
      patients resort to alternative therapies. Manipulative treatments represent en emerging
      therapy in this area, although studies assessing their effectiveness are limited and often
      biased. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of two manual therapies on
      improving functional recovery in sub-acute and chronic non-specific low back pain at 3
      months. A standardised osteopathic manipulative treatment is compare to a placebo of
      osteopathic manipulative treatment.
