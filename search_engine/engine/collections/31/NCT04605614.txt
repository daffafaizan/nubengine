    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To assess safety and tolerability of unlabeled pembrolizumab followed by 64Cu-tetraxetan
      (DOTA)-pembrolizumab positron emission tomography, at each dose level, by evaluation of
      toxicities including: type, frequency, severity, attribution, time course and duration.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Generate initial estimates of the biodistribution of the 64Cu-DOTA-pembrolizumab and the
      preferred dose of cold antibody.

      II. Determine the dose of pre-administered unlabeled pembrolizumab that improves image
      quality by qualitative assessment by the radiologist of 64Cu-DOTA-pembrolizumab.

      III. Evaluate the performance of 64Cu-DOTA-pembrolizumab in detecting tumor lesions.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of 64Cu-DOTA-pembrolizumab.

      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes, and within 6 hours also
      receive 64Cu-DOTA-pembrolizumab via slow IV push over > 1 minute on day 0. Patients then
      undergo PET over 60 minutes on day 1.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 3 days.
