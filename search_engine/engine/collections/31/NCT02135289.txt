      factor alpha (anti-TNF)-Î± is effective and increasingly being used for the treatment of
      patients with refractory disease and complicated disease behaviour. The reactivation of
      latent tuberculosis (TB) is a well-recognised complication associated with the use of
      anti-TNF therapy, and most cases occurred in endemic regions. Hong Kong is a region of
      intermediate TB burden, and the reactivation of latent TB in IMID patients treated with
      anti-TNF can be a serious problem. Screening has been shown to reduce the incidence of TB,
      but it remains unclear whether monitoring during anti-TNF therapy is effective. Despite
      reported efficacy with the current screening strategy, active TB developed in up to 11.4% of
      patients receiving anti-TNF therapy. There is therefore an urgent need for better disease
      monitoring and prevention, particularly in regions where TB is endemic.

      Part I of this study aims to investigate the role of IGRA in screening for latent TB in IBD
      patients and control subjects. Part II of this study is a prospective study of serial
      interferon-gamma release assays (IGRA) for the diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB) infection in
      patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMID) treated with biologics
