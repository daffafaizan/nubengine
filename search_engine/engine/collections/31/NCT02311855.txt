        -  Evaluate the strength and duration of immune response after influenza vaccination in
           patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) receiving treatment with biological agents.

        -  Evaluate for predictors of immune response such as age, gender, disease duration, type
           of the biological agent(s) used, duration of the treatment, and type of treatment in the
           past.

        -  Assess the efficacy of vaccine response in this population by recording proportion of
           patients who contracted influenza illness despite vaccination. The result of the study
           may provide more information regarding which situations inadequate immune response by
           strength or duration would most likely to be expected. This may help lay some groundwork
           for future studies looking at the use of booster vaccinations in this population
