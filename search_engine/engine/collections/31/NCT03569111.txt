    
      The primary objective of this prospective, single-arm, multicenter, non-randomized study is
      to characterize the safety of the Emprint™ Ablation Catheter Kit with Thermosphere™
      Technology device in subjects undergoing lung ablation procedures.

      The primary endpoint is the composite rate of adverse events related to the Emprint™ Ablation
      Catheter Kit with Thermosphere™ Technology through 1-month follow-up.

      The following secondary endpoints will be evaluated:

        -  Composite rate of serious adverse events related to the Emprint™ Ablation Catheter Kit
           with Thermosphere™ Technology through 1-month follow-up.

        -  Composite rate of all adverse events related to the procedure or study devices through
           1-month follow-up.

        -  Composite rate of all serious adverse events related to the procedure or study devices
           through 1-month follow-up.

        -  Patient satisfaction and pain (Bronchoscopic Ablation Patient Pain and Satisfaction
           Survey)

        -  Quality of life (EQ-5D Scale)

        -  Technical success

        -  Technique efficacy
