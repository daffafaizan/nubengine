    
      This is a double-blind randomized controlled trial of rTMS for outpatients in the depressive
      phase of BD-II. Participants will be evaluated at UT Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas.
      Forty eligible subjects will be randomized to either active treatment (n=20) or sham (no
      stimulation, n=20). Each subject will receive treatment 5 days per week for a total of 6
      weeks. At the end of the 6 weeks, those who remain depressed will have the option of
      receiving 6 additional weeks of open rTMS treatment. We require these participants to meet
      the same eligibility criteria in the open phase (i.e. MADRS â‰¥15, YMRS <12) as in the initial
      double blind phase. At the completion of treatment, a follow-up appointment will be scheduled
      with a study physician to ensure that the participant is properly transitioning to clinical
      care and is not having a significant change in clinical status. Those who do not already have
      a treating physician will be referred to a new provider.
