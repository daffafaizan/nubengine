    
      This is a prospective phase I study of the safety, pharmacokinetics, and optimal dose of
      intravenously administered L-citrulline in premature infants born at 24 to 29 weeks estimated
      gestational age (EGA) and who are at risk for bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). This is a
      classic dose escalation using initial doses of 10 mg/kg of intravenous citrulline and
      advancing the dose by 10 mg/kg every 3 patients for a target peak plasma citrulline
      concentration of 100 umol/L. These infants will undergo intense hemodynamic monitoring and
      have intermittent blood sampling to determine levels of amino acids and nitric oxide
      metabolites. From this, we will determine citrulline pharmacokinetics including half life,
      clearance, and volume of distribution. Intravenous L-citrulline will be provided by Asklepion
      Pharmaceuticals and mixed by the Investigational Drug Service of the Vanderbilt Hospital
      Clinical Pharmacy. The study will be monitored closely by a data safety monitoring board
      (DSMB) consisting of clinicians not involved with this study.
