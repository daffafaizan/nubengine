      image processing system for generation of composite images from pain diagrams drawn by
      patients with pain, and for calculation of related quantitative variables. The system was
      tested in a pharmaceutical company-sponsored US study in over 500 chronic pain patients seen
      by primary care practitioners, and then seen by pain specialists. The hypothesis was that
      pain location would correlate with the pain type and the underlying cause of the pain. TMT's
      analysis established correlations between the pain diagram information and the underlying
      diagnosis and pain type (e.g., nociceptive or neuropathic) reported by the pain specialists.
      The present study extends these observations in a web-based setting, with particular emphasis
      on automated computer-generated visual pain patterns as diagnostic predictors.
