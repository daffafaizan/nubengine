      database available to national health service (NHS) health boards in Scotland, on all
      prescriptions dispensed by community pharmacists which include the unique patient identifier
      for Scotland (CHI).

      The design is a two parallel arm cluster randomised trial with general practices as the unit
      of randomisation to whom the feedback intervention is directed, and outcomes measured at
      patient level. Both arms receive the same active interventions but focused on different
      topics, with each acting as control to the other.

      The primary outcome in the asthma arm is a composite of measure of potentially high-risk
      asthma prescribing (multiple short acting beta-agonists or single agent long acting
      beta-agonists both in the absence of inhaled corticosteroid therapy).

      The primary outcome in the urinary tract infection antibiotic arm is a measure of repeated
      use of single (likely long-term prevention) or multiple (repeated treatment courses) urinary
      tract infection antibiotics.

      Within the feedback, alongside the patient-level analysis, there will be action-orientated
      messages to guide the GP practice.

      GP practices will get the reports three times at six-monthly intervals.
