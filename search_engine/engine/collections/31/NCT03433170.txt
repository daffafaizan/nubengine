      42. This includes source data verification.

      Simple size calculations estimating a difference of 50% in strength improvement between both
      groups at the six months follow-up visit. 80% power and 5% alpha error.

      Strength measured with dynamometer, laxity with ACL laxity tester and function with 3 scores:
      IKDC, Tegner-Lysholm and KOOS.

      Missing data will be minimized by double checking when registering data. It might be
      necessary to increase sample size to 50 patients of intermediate analysis show it is
      necessary to find an statistically significant difference.

      Trial could be stopped early if one intervention shows to be better in the intermediate
      analysis. These analysis will be conducted after the first 16 and 32 participants have been
      included.
