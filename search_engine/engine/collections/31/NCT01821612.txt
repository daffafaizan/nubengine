    
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate a new treatment program for patients with borderline
      resectable pancreas cancer in order to determine what effects, good and bad, chemotherapy and
      chemoradiation have on your cancer and to see if it allows safe surgery.

      Primary Objectives:

        -  To assess the accrual rate of this study.

        -  To assess the rate of treatment-related toxicity and treatment delay during preoperative
           therapy.

        -  To assess the rate of completion of all preoperative and operative therapy.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To assess the macroscopic (R0/R1) resection rate.

        -  To estimate the rate of radiographic and histopathologic response to preoperative
           therapy.

        -  To estimate the time to locoregional and distant recurrence.

        -  To assess overall survival (OS).

        -  To retrieve nucleic acids from pretreatment pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma biopsies
           and to assess the quality of these nucleic acids using a sequencing-based assessment of
           tumor DNA.
