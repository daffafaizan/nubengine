      VcR-CAP and R-CHOP is being tested to treat people who had mantle cell lymphoma (MCL).

      The study enrolled 487 patients. Participants were randomly assigned (by chance, like
      flipping a coin) to one of the two treatment groups in a 1:1 ratio:

      Treatment Group A (VcR-CAP) Treatment Group B (R-CHOP)

      The study included a screening phase, a treatment phase, a short-term follow-up phase, and a
      long-term follow-up phase. The screening phase was up to 28 days (56 days for bone marrow
      evaluation) prior to randomization.

      This multi-center trial was conducted worldwide. The total study duration from randomization
      of the first patient until the last progression-free survival (PFS) event required for the
      final analysis was expected to be approximately 42 months (24 months for enrollment and 18
      months for follow-up) and survival follow-up every 12 weeks until death.
