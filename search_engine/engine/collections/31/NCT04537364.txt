      with a morbidity of 6â€°. The delayed diagnosis, due to its demanding diagnostic technique, may
      leads to long-term severe renal damage. This project is a prospective, continuous
      double-blind designed diagnostic accuracy study. The clinical diagnosis of CAKUT relies on a
      panel of radiological examinations most of which are invasive and risk of radiation harm for
      children. To establish the non-invasive and safe diagnosis detections of renal damage of
      CAKUT in children, a combination of MRI/DWI with urinary detection through Immunomagnetic
      beads isolation technique is to carried out to evaluate the renal deficiency in CAKUT
      comparing the dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan as the golden standard of renal parenchymal
      damage. Analysis of sensitivity and specificity is to evaluate the accuracy of the combined
      diagnostic protocol. Furthermore the clinical information of pregnancy and phenotypes of the
      patients with CAKUT is to be collected with all the genetic information constructing the full
      phenotype- genotype spectrum for big data analysis and predictive model for early detection
      of renal damage in CAKUT.
