      natural and stimulated cycles have been compared, no differences have been observed in terms
      of embryo cleavage capacity, oocyte and embryo aneuploidy rate or incidence of aneuploidy in
      aborted foetuses. When mild and conventional doses of gonadotropins have been compared, a
      higher proportion of good morphological quality embryos are observed in the former. On the
      contrary, we showed that ovarian stimulation does not increase significantly the embryo
      aneuploidy rate in IVF derived human embryos when unstimulated and stimulated cycles were
      compared in oocyte donors. In this study, we want to compare the embryo aneuploidy rate
      between unstimulated and stimulated cycles in infertile patients, subjected to both IVF
      cycles with blastocyst biopsy and NGS-PGS. A comparison of the morphokinetics will also be
      performed.
