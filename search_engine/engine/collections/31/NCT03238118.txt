      faces. Computerized training programs have showed to be able to successfully modify these
      biases in children with mood and anxiety disorders. Of particular importance, a study
      examined the effects of attention training towards positive stimuli on attention biases and
      anxiety symptoms in pediatric anxiety disorders. In the attention-towards-positive condition,
      children searched picture arrays for a happy face amongst angry faces. In the
      attention-training control condition, children searched for a bird amongst flowers. This
      study showed significantly greater reductions in clinician-rated diagnostic severity and
      number of diagnoses of anxiety with that training. However, no study has investigated the
      role of these training in children and adolescents with high levels of irritability The
      present project, aims to examine the effects of the attention bias modification training and
      compare to attention-training control condition and psychoeducation in children with high
      levels of irritability.
