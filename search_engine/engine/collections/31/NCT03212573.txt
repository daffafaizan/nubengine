    
      A prospective randomized study of patients undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass will be
      randomized in 2 groups: those following an Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) program and
      those ones following a standard protocol. The ERAS program implies early liquids oral intake,
      early deambulation and multimodal analgesia (port sites infiltration with Bupivacain 0.5%
      associated with intravenous analgesia).

      Postoperative pain 24 hours after surgery, as measured by Visual Analogic Scale, and hospital
      stay will be assessed.
