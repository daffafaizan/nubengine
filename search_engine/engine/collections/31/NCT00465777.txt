      in 1998/1999 the hospital case fatality (CF) decreased by more than 40%, increasing again
      after the the war. This was attributed to the available free drugs from the humanitarian aid
      and food incentives to the personnel. Free emergency kits for treatment of severe malaria was
      introduced, however the CF did not decline. Therefore, the ward was split into two groups of
      rooms: intervention and control. All the staff of the ward was trained in the use of a
      standardised guideline for treatment of severe malaria and randomly assigned to one of the
      groups. All children hospitalised for malaria received the drug emergency kits. The only
      difference in the intervention group were the small financial incentives and supervision for
      strict adherence to the guidelines procedures.
