    
      Hypothesis:

      The investigators hypothesize that, continued breastfeeding, adequate complimentary feeding
      and supplementation with homemade yogurt have the potential to reduce stunting.

      Primary objective:

      The present study is aimed to assess the impact of low-cost nutritional strategies to prevent
      childhood malnutrition in Bangladesh.

      Specific objectives:

        1. To compare differences in growth pattern (length-for-age z-score, weight-for age
           z-score, head circumference) of children at risk of stunting age 6-months between
           infants receiving educational program only, infants receiving education plus homemade
           yogurt supplementation and those receiving the "usual-care" (control).

        2. To evaluate whether amount of gut microbiota necessary to improve gut health was
           associated with weight gain and growth in these children to support the casual mechanism
           behind this approach.
