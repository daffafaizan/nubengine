      to severe pain, despite treatment with ibuprofen or opioids. In 2018 National Academies of
      Sciences, Engineering and Medicine (NASEM) recommended research to improve pain relief.
      Limited data indicate that acupuncture is valuable for dysmenorrhea and for labor pain,
      conditions in which pain may be similar to that experienced during medication abortion. This
      randomized trial will recruit women seeking medication abortion after they have completed
      their routine clinical assessment and after they have received mifepristone. This study will
      evaluate two types of auriculotherapy applied to selected acupoints on the external ear. The
      study treatments are acupuncture using Pyonex needles and acupressure using gold pellets;
      both are applied to the ear using adhesive disks. A control group will receive the adhesive
      disks alone. All participants will receive usual medication abortion care, including taking
      misoprostol 1-3 days after mifepristone and ibuprofen for pain management. The investigators
      will query the participants regarding pain and anxiety. Follow-up will end at the time of the
      usual clinical follow-up about one week after mifepristone administration.
