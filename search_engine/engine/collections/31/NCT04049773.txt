      (HD) patients, its relation to haemodialysis treatment and the association with other factors
      such as mood, activities, location and social context will be evaluated during 7 consecutive
      days by using an ecological momentary assessment (EMA) procedure, incorporated into a
      webapplication. Using an EMA procedure will more accurately represent fatigue symptoms and
      its relation to other factors in the daily life of chronic HD patients compared to
      conventional measurement instruments (i.e. questionnaires evaluating fatigue over a period of
      a week or more, which are therefore liable to a recall bias).
