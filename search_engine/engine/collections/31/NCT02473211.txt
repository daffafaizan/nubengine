      with 12 weeks sofosbuvir 400 mg daily plus daclatasvir 60 mg daily. At baseline, liver
      stiffness measurement (LSM) using transient elastography (FibroScan®) is used to assess liver
      fibrosis and the single nucleotide polymorphism ofinterferon-λ 3 (IL-28, rs12979860, C or T)
      and IFLN4 (ss469415590, TT or ΔG) is determined. Serial measurement of plasma HCV RNA levels
      are performed with the use of the COBAS TaqMan real-time assay (Roche version 2.0), at
      baseline, Day 2,4 and 7, week 2,4 and 12, post-treatment week 12. The primary efficacy end
      point is a sustained virologic response 12 weeks after the end of treatment (SVR12).
