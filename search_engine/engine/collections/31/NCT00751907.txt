      to a 73% reduction in the prevalence of AD, suggesting a potentially promising role for
      statins in the prevention of AD. In order to better understand the mechanisms through which
      statins may possibly modify blood AD risk, this study evaluated whether administration of
      atorvastatin favorably altered blood flow in the brain (measured by magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI)) and blood vessel function (measured by ultrasound).

      Participants attended 3 visits over the course of the 4-month study. At the initial visit,
      participants completed a short questionnaire about their past medical history and medication
      history. At the baseline visit, participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive
      atorvastatin 40 mg nightly vs. matching placebo. At baseline and follow-up visits,
      participants provided an update on medical problems and medications, reviewed any potential
      side effects, and had fasting blood tests collected for safety monitoring, including liver
      and muscle enzyme monitoring. In addition, all participants had MRI and ultrasound measures
      collected.
