      designed to examine improvements in chemoradiation compliance, body composition,
      strength/endurance, quality of life, nutrition status, and mucositis symptoms by
      supplementing beetroot juice over a period of 12 weeks. The Investigators plan to recruit 50
      individuals with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck who are planning to undergo
      chemoradiation/intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). All subjects will be over 18
      years of age. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status should be less
      than or equal to 2, which is necessary to ensure the patient can adequately participate in
      the supplementation and planned test procedures. All eligible participants will have a life
      expectancy greater than or equal to 3 months and normal organ and marrow function at the time
      of enrollment.
