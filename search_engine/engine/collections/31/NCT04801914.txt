      peripheral blood samples before and one month after percutaneous biliary drainage for further
      molecular biochemical analysis (measurement of serum matrix metalloproteinase activity).
      Biochemical analyzes are preceded by the entry of data relevant to the research (demographic,
      anamnestic, clinical and biochemical).
