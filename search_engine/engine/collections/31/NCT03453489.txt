      I. To evaluate the effect of telotristat etiprate (telotristat ethyl) treatment in patients
      with advanced neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) using carbon C 11 alpha-methyltryptophan
      (alpha-[11C]methyl-?L-?tryptophan) (AMT)-?positron emission tomography (PET) as measured by
      changes in tumor maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Show that NETs will have increased AMT uptake on PET, as compared to surrounding non-tumor
      tissue at baseline.

      II. Use compartmental modeling (in tumors with the left ventricle of the heart in the
      field-of-view) to measure change in AMT retention.

      III. Measure change in AMT retention as mean standardized uptake value (SUVmean).

      OUTLINE:

      Participants undergo AMT-PET within 7 days prior to, and 9-14 days after start of telotristat
      etiprate treatment. Participants receive telotristat etiprate orally (PO) three times a day
      (TID) for 9-14 days.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up for 3 months.
