    
      This is an open-label, fixed-sequence, ascending-dose, first-in-human study to evaluate the
      effect of a highly targeted rhGAA (ATB200) co-administered with a chaperone (AT2221).

      The study aims to evaluate safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics (PD), and immunogenicity of
      ATB200 co-administered with AT2221. The study will be conducted in 3 stages.

      In Stage 1, safety, tolerability, and PK will be evaluated following sequential single
      ascending doses of intravenously infused ATB200.

      In Stage 2, safety, tolerability, and PK will be evaluated following single- and
      multiple-ascending dose combinations of ATB200 and AT2221.

      In Stage 3, long term safety and efficacy will be assessed following 24 month treatment of
      ATB200 co-administered with AT2221 (Miglustat)

      In Stage 4, treatment period will begin at the end of Stage 3 and will continue as open label
      extension until commercialization, study discontinuation or subject withdrawal, with
      functional assessments every 6 months

      No Muscle biopsies will be performed in this study.
