      living with HIV/AIDS, the prospect of maintaining patients long term on ART can be severely
      restricted by the development of serious long term effects in their metabolism. These
      abnormalities include dyslipidemia, lipodystrophy and disorders of glucose metabolism with
      insulin resistance believed to be the underlying pathophysiological mechanism.

      Spirulina, has recently drawn attention on its cholesterol and blood pressure lowering
      effects, including improvement of glycaemic control in diabetics subjects, suggesting it can
      have some effects on insulin sensitivity.

      The aim of this three month, experimental, prospective, randomised trial was to evaluate the
      effect of Spirulina on HIV/HAART-associated insulin resistance on 33 subjects. Primary
      outcome was change in insulin sensitivity during the trial, over two time periods; t=0 and
      t=12 weeks. The second objective was to compare between the two groups, the percentage of
      subjects who improved insulin sensitivity by the end of the study.

      Recruitment started in October 2008 and the trial ended in February 2009.
