      suspected or certain residual disease at the level of the right diaphragmatic peritoneum, at
      intra-operative evaluation have been collected. Diaphragmatic peritoneum was classified as
      negative, not-surely pathologic and certainly pathologic by the surgeon, and based on the
      surgeon's opinion, a diaphragmatic biopsy or peritonectomy was then performed. The definition
      of not-surely pathologic diaphragmatic peritoneum was given in association with the presence
      of flat dyschromic areas, while the definition of certainly pathological diaphragmatic
      peritoneum was given when isolated or confluent thick nodules were visualized at the
      intra-operative inspection. Residual disease was indicated at the end of each intervention
      and classified as no residual disease (RD=0, complete cytoreduction), less than 1 centimeter
      (RD </= 1 cm, optimal cytoreduction) or more than 1 cm (RD > 1 cm, sub-optimal
      cytoreduction).

      Pathological specimens' results were also divided in negative (no evidence of disease),
      microscopic evidence of residual disease (</= 3 mm) or macroscopic signs of residual disease
      (> 3 mm). Microscopic and macroscopic disease were both considered as positive for residual
      disease.

      General early post-operative complications (arising within 30 days from surgery), and
      complications related to diaphragmatic peritonectomy, as post-operative pleural effusion,
      were classified using the extended Clavien-Dindo classification of surgical complications.

      The primary end-point of the study was to evaluate the accuracy, sensitivity and specificity
      of the visual inspection compared to histopathological examination, at the level of the right
      diaphragmatic peritoneum, in patients subjected to IDS.

      The secondary endpoints were to evaluate the rate of early postoperative complications
      related to diaphragmatic peritonectomy and assess whether this procedure may delay the
      re-start of post-operative chemotherapy.
