      approximately 10 hours. The subject will be asked to arrive in the fasted state on all study
      days. Fasting prior to screening is not required. On the screening day, body weight and
      height will be measured and Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) will be performed to
      measure body composition. After 4 hours subjects received a continuous intravenous infusion
      with OP in a dosage of 1 g /h. Next to the stable tracers provided to determine OP
      metabolism, stable tracers of phenylalanine (PHE) and tyrosine (TYR) may be provided to
      determine the effect of OP on protein metabolism at plasma and muscle tissue level. This
      required 2 muscle biopsies and on 2 study days 1 set of stable tracer pulses.
