      that are pragmatic, graduated in the level of resource intensity, and have demonstrated
      efficacy and feasibility for real world adoption. Low-risk (non-cardiac) chest pain patients
      with anxiety will be recruited to participate in the study using the SBIRT (screening, brief
      intervention, and referral to treatment) model and enrolled participants will be randomly
      assigned to one of three treatment arms: 1) referral to primary care with enhanced care
      coordinated (low intensity); 2) online CBT with support from a certified peer recovery
      specialist (medium intensity); and 3) therapist-led CBT via tele-health (high intensity). We
      expect improved symptoms and functional capacity, reduced ED return visits, and heterogenous
      treatment effects.
