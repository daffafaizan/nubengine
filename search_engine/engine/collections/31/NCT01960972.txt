      intake decreases blood pressure. Also, the increase of potassium ingestion in minimal doses
      has been found in systematic reviews to produce a small reduction in blood pressure levels.

      The proposed intervention is a community-wide mass-strategy in which direct delivery of a
      salt substitute to households is accompanied by wide social marketing campaigns, both before
      and during the intervention period. With this experimental stepped wedge trial design, we
      will estimate the impact of a reduced-sodium salt substitution program on blood pressure at
      the population level.

      We propose the following specific aims:

      Specific Aim 1: To implement and assess the impact of an intervention using a salt substitute
      on blood pressure at the population level using a stepped wedge trial design.

      Specific Aim 2: To determine costs and efficacy of this implementation strategy using
      cost-effectiveness analysis.
