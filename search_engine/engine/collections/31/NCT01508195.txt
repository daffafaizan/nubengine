    
      This is an open-label (identity of study drug will be known to volunteer and study staff),
      single-center study to evaluate the bioequivalence (to see if blood levels of one drug are
      equivalent to blood levels of another drug) of canagliflozin and metformin IR when
      administered orally (by mouth) as individual components (ie, separate tablets of
      canagliflozin and metformin IR) (Treatment A) and when administered as FDC tablets (ie,
      canagliflozin and metformin IR contained in the same tablet) (Treatment B). Healthy
      volunteers participating in the study will be randomly (by chance) assigned to receive a
      single dose of Treatment A followed by a single dose of Treatment B or Treatment B followed
      by Treatment A with a washout period of approximately 15 days between treatments. The total
      duration of the study will be approximately 51 days.
