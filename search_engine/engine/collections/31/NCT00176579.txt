        -  Determine bone mineral density (BMD) in patients with clinically significant early stage
           prostate cancer.

        -  Determine whether patients who have a higher level of BMD and have had a radical
           prostatectomy for cure are less likely to have an early relapse (i.e., less than 3
           years) than those patients with a low level of BMD.

      OUTLINE: This is a case-controlled study followed by a prospective, longitudinal, cohort
      study.

      Patients undergo bone mineral density (BMD) measurements by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry
      with a densitometer. Posteroanterior measurements of the total hip are also recorded.

      Patients also undergo blood collection to examine markers that provide evidence of systemic
      disease.

      Patients are followed every 6 months for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study.
