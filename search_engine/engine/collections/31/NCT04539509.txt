    
      435 people will participate in this study.

      A physician will review a participant's medical history to determine if physical activity is
      appropriate for them. They will then be randomly assigned to 1 of 3 study groups:

        1. Monitoring- participants will be given a heart rate monitor to wear on their wrist for
           the duration of the study (until "recovered", or until 8 weeks post-concussion, whatever
           comes first).

        2. Monitoring + Treadmill Testing- in addition to wearing the heart rate monitor, they will
           undergo a treadmill test at each appointment.

        3. Monitoring + Treadmill Testing + Specific Exercise Prescription- in addition to wearing
           the heart rate monitor, and treadmill test, they will receive an exercise prescription
           based on the results of the treadmill test.

      The randomization is by chance. Participants have a 40/20/40% respective chance of being
      assigned to the study groups above. This means that out of every 5 people: 2 people will be
      assigned to the group 1, 1 will be assigned to the group 2, and 2 will be assigned to the
      group 3. Both participants and the study doctor will be aware which group participants are
      in.

      Regardless of the group assigned, participants will receive an exercise prescription form at
      each appointment, as per usual care. The prescription will be based on the physician's
      judgement. If a participant is in group 3, their prescription will also take into account the
      results of the treadmill test.

      Recovery will be determined using a 3-step approach:

        1. Self-reported symptoms,

        2. Clinic physician's opinion,

        3. Treadmill test results (if applicable).
