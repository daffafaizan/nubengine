      beneficial effect of supplemental oxygen. Therefore, both the British Thoracic Society and
      the American Thoracic Society guidelines recommend supplemental oxygen to patients who
      desaturate >4% and to below 88-90%. However, long-term studies have not been able to support
      this intervention. In this study of COPD patients, who desaturate and participate in a 7-week
      pulmonary rehabilitation programme, we examine the effect of supplemental oxygen. Using a
      randomised design, patients trained either with room air (control) or with 2 litres oxygen
      per minute from a portable oxygen concentrator. All patients were asked to exercise every day
      for 30 minutes.

      Primary effect parameters:

      endurance shuttle walk time at baseline, 7 weeks (after intensive supervised rehabilitation),
      3 months (after maintenance training twice a month), and after 6 months.

      Secondary effect parameters:

      St. George Respiratory Questionnaire (health status); usage of oxygen, exacerbations
      requiring medical treatment, hospitalisation and mortality in the same periods.
