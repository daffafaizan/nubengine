      cytokines and chemokines interleukin 1β (IL-1β), interferon-γ (IFN-γ), interferon-inducible
      protein 10 (IP-10), monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) and interleukin-4 (IL-4).
      Consequently, treatments that reduce cytokine/chemokine production that result in a less
      severe course of disease could be potentially beneficial. Melatonin, a pineal hormone, has
      been shown to have anti-inflammation, anti-oxidation and immune enhancing features. In
      multiple animal models of lung injury, Melatonin supplementation has been shown to decrease
      the number of inflammatory cells, reduce the levels of the cytokines IL-4, IL-5, IL-13 and
      TNF-a and reduce nitric oxide and hydroxyl radical concentrations. We propose a dose ranging
      pilot study to assess the safety and efficacy of melatonin in reducing hospitalization in
      COVID-19 patients with mild-moderate disease. A total of 50 participants will be randomized
      to the intervention arm (melatonin: 3 mg, or 30 mg three times a day for 14 days) or control
      arm (placebo) in a 2:2:1 fashion using a permuted block randomization scheme. Analyses will
      be performed with a focus on estimation of specific clinically important parameters,
      including safety and preliminary evidence of activity, for planning of a subsequent
      definitive comparative trial designed to fully assess efficacy.
