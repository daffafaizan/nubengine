      I. To determine engraftment and dose limiting toxicity (DLT) of bendamustine in patients with
      lymphoid malignancies undergoing non-myeloablative allogeneic hematopoietic transplantation.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To monitor the risk of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and clinical responses.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of bendamustine.

      Participants receive rituximab intravenously (IV) over 5-7 hours on days -13 and -6,
      fludarabine IV over 1 hour and bendamustine IV over 1 hour on days -5 to -3, and tacrolimus
      IV starting on day -2 and orally (PO) after hospital discharge for 6 to 8 months.
      Participants with matched unrelated donor (MUD) receive thymoglobulin on days -2 and -1.
      Participants undergo allogenic stem cell transplant over 30-45 minutes on day 0. Participants
      receive rituximab IV over 5-7 hours on days 1 and 8 and methotrexate IV over 30 minutes on
      days 1, 3, and 6. Participants with MUD also receive methotrexate IV on day 11. Participants
      receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) once daily starting on day 7 until white blood
      cell counts recover.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up every 3 months during year
      1 and every 6 months for up to 3 years.
