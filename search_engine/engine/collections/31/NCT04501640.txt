    
      The study will follow an open-label, randomized, 2-period, single oral dose crossover design
      at 2 dose levels in healthy Chinese male and female participants. Each participant will take
      part in 2 periods separated by a washout of at least 10 days between investigational product
      (IP) administrations in each period.

      Participants will be screened for up to 21 days prior to IP administration on day 1 of period
      1. Participants who are eligible will be admitted to the clinical unit on day -1 of each
      period and will be confined until the last pharmacokinetic sample has been drawn within each
      period. Pharmacokinetic (PK) samples will be collected predose on day 1 of each period and at
      multiple time points following each dose. The study will be completed with an end-of-study
      visit (ESV), to take place 5 to 9 days after the last PK sample is collected or at early
      discontinuation from the study.
