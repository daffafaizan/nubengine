      arm. This strategy consists of at least 12 hours of controlled mechanical ventilation
      following prespecified PEEP and FiO2 combinations chosen dynamically targeting oxygenation.
      Tidal volume is set at 4-6 mL/Kg of predicted body weight (PBW) and plateau pressure is kept
      below 30 centimeters of water (cmH2O). Respiratory rate can be as high as 35 breaths per
      minute titrated to a potential of hydrogen (pH) 7.30-7.45. As oxygenation improves, patients
      are transitioned to assisted ventilation and then to pressure support ventilation until they
      are ready to be liberated from the ventilator. During this phase, no attempt is made to
      control plateau pressures or tidal volumes. In the intervention arm, we will focus on
      minimizing tidal lung strain by keeping driving pressure below 16 cmH2O throughout the
      mechanical ventilation period. The controlled phase will last at least 48 hours. PEEP will be
      selected according to a PEEP titration maneuver with EIT at the start of the intervention.
      This PEEP level will be kept until extubation. Respiratory rate can be as high as 50 breaths
      per minute targeting a pH of 7.15-7.45.
