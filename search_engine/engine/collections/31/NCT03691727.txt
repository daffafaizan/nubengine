      alone to standard care with Aggrastat in patients diagnosed with aneurysmal subarachnoid
      hemorrhage. The investigational plan is to explore the safety profile of Aggrastat
      administered continuously over 7 days, beginning at least 12 hours after a clinically
      indicated Endovascular Coil Embolization procedure.

      As a part of the study, qualifying subjects will undergo two MRI scans, one at baseline and
      again prior to discharge. A neurological exam and vital signs will be administered at
      baseline, daily during drug administration, and at follow-up visits. Additional assessments
      include administration of the following questionnaires: mRS score, IADL, and QOLIBRI-OS.
