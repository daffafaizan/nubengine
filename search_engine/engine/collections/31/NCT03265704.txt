      an onset after 20 weeks of pregnancy. Although the exact etiology of PIH and preE remains
      unknown, two interconnected mechanisms have been identified to play an important role in the
      pathogenesis: dysfunction of the placental trophoblast and endothelial dysfunction within the
      maternal systemic vasculature. The endothelium has been identified as the target tissue of
      the disease. Endothelial alterations ultimately manifest as placental hypoxia and hypoplasia.
      The neonatal thrombocytopenia and neutropenia after pregnancy-induced hypertension is a
      result of inhibition of fetal bone marrow production of the myeloid lineage due to
      intrauterine hypoxic environment. This study aims to investigate the hematological profile in
      term and preterm infants born to mothers with preeclampsia. The current retrospective
      observational study was conducted at the Clinic of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Neonatology of
      the Emergency County Hospital, Timisoara over a period of three years, from January 2014 to
      December 2016. All inborn patient files were analyzed as anonymised limited data sets from
      archived records of the Neonatology Department.
