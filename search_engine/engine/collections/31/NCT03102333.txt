    
      In the case of the existing iv-pca, the analgesic drug was injected into the patient at a
      constant rate (ex. 1 ml / hr) and additional pain was controlled through the bolus dose (1
      ml).

      As a result, the analgesic effect was insufficient, or the effect was excessive, causing side
      effects (nausea, vomiting, sedation, dizziness). Especially In spinal surgery, the degree of
      pain sharply decreases from day 1 to day 2. Classic iv-pca with constant infusion rate can
      not reflect this result. But in the case of the newlys developed PCA, the infusion rate is
      increased according to the patient's need for bolus button, so that the pain can be
      controlled more efficiently. If the bolus button is not pressed for a certain period of time,
      it is expected that the injection rate will be reduced and the side effect caused by the
      analgesic agent will be decreased.
