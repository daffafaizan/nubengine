      longevity of implants used for treatment of osteoarthritis. Bone loss leads to implant
      destabilization. Bisphosphonates, given for approximately 6 months after THA man prevent this
      bone loss and lead to longer implant fixation and lower incidence of aseptic prosthesis
      loosening. We perform a clinical trial with risedronate to investigate if we can influence
      periprosthetic bone loss around a uncemented femoral stem.
