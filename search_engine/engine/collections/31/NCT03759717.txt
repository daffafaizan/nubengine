      define tumor subtypes that are clinically actionable, may drive important changes in patient
      management, and/or elucidate novel chemotherapeutic options. Skull base tumors are currently
      diagnosed based on histopathologic criteria, on which post-operative management is based.
      However, the investigators hypothesize that each tumor type (eg. chordoma or chondrosarcoma)
      will have molecular and/or cellular subcategories that will redefine how to categorize and
      diagnose patients, predict clinical outcome, and optimally design a patient-specific
      management strategy. In addition, we aim to catalogue changes that occur after treatment
      after surgical resection, chemotherapy, and/or radiation by comparing primary and recurrent
      tumors.
