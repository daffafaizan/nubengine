        1. Build a baseline database of the rare type of pulmonary hypertension. Collect general
           information, on-set symptoms and time, laboratory examination, imaging results, right
           heart catheterization and treatment information.

        2. Follow up recruited patients at regular intervalsï¼ˆ6m~1y). Collect information on change
           in patients condition, laboratory test and treatment.

        3. Conduct genetic testing for gene mutation related or hereditary pulmonary hypertension.
           Link the clinical database to genetic database.

        4. Establish bio-bank for serum/plasma, urine, stool, tissues or cells.

        5. Establish prognostic study based on the clinical follow-up and genetic database.

        6. Draw diagnostic and treatment algorithm for the rare type of pulmonary hypertension.

      Controls subjects: blood sample and medical data collected once.
