      evaluate the effects of a cadexomer iodine gel on the prevention of recurrent keloid
      formation in patients undergoing keloid scar revision. Adults 18 years and older with an
      established diagnosis of keloid scar formation, scheduled to undergo keloid scar revision
      surgery, and who meet the protocol's inclusion and exclusion criteria are eligible for this
      study. There will be a minimum of 20 completed subjects with up to 30 enrolled. After keloid
      revision surgery, subjects will apply product every other day for one month. There will be a
      total of 5 study visits: Visit 0 (Revision Surgery Date and Start of Treatment); Visit 1 (1
      Week Post-Revision); Visit 2 (4 Weeks Post-Revision); Visit 3 (12 Weeks Post Revision); and
      Visit 4 (24 Weeks Post-Revision and Study Exit). Imaging, Patient and Observer Scar
      Assessment Scale questionnaires, and Dermatological Life Quality Index Questions will be
      collected. It is hypothesized that there will be a measurable reduction in the amount
      (number, size) of keloid formation and/or recurrence at 4, 12, and 24 weeks post revision
      surgery time points. The change in subjects' quality of life as measured by the the
      Dermatology Quality of Life Index will also be assessed.
