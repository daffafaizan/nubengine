      concentrations of 30 nM) which increases susceptibility to epidermal growth factor inhibitors
      in case of non-small-cell lung cancer and stops proliferation of paclitaxel-resistant cells.
      Thus, besides its own efficacy, which can potentially lead to better results of
      polychemotherapy and increase the mean time to progression, it may be demonstrated that
      Quisinostat leads to sustained tumor sensitivity to platinum drugs and possibly to
      resensitiztion in case of acquired or primary resistance.

      The main objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of Quisinostat in
      multiple ascending doses and establish its maximum tolerated dose (MTD), administered in
      combination with standard backbone chemotherapy, as follows: Gemcitabine + Cisplatin in
      patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (second line) and Paclitaxel + Carboplatin in
      patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (second line) and in patients with ovarian cancer
      (second and subsequent lines). MTD is defined as maximum dose at which DLT occurs in no more
      than 1 patient of 6.

      Secondary objectives are:

      â€¢ Study of pharmacokinetics (PK) of multiple dosing of Quisinostat administered in
      combination with chemotherapy, as follows: Gemcitabine + Cisplatin in patients with
      non-small-cell lung cancer (second line) and Paclitaxel + Carboplatin in patients with
      non-small-cell lung cancer (second line) and in patients with ovarian cancer (second and
      subsequent lines) Preliminary estimation of possible effect of the drug, added to
      chemotherapy, on tumor growth.
