    
      This study is a transition of existing ongoing pregnancy registries for Fluarix/
      FluLaval/Fluarix Quadrivalent/ FluLaval Quadrivalent into one post-authorization safety study
      (PASS).

      Pregnancy outcome data will be collected using questionnaires within 2 months of the
      estimated date of delivery (EDD) and approximately 6 months and 12 months after the EDD (for
      all live births) to ascertain the presence of birth defects not diagnosed before, from Q2
      2014 to Q2 2019.

      The intent of the Registry is to prospectively collect data such as vaccination with GSK
      sIIVs during pregnancy or within 28 days preceding conception, potential confounding factors
      (such as exposure to other medications) and information related to the outcome of the
      pregnancy.
