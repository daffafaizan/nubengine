      morbidity and mortality. Hemorrhage is compounded by trauma induced coagulopathy of which
      hypo/dysfibrinogenemia and hypoperfusion play a significant role. There is a good evidence to
      suggest that hypofibrinogenemia in trauma is associated with worse outcomes and it is
      postulated that early replacement of fibrinogen and red blood cells packages may reduce
      hemorrhage and improve outcomes even in the pre-hospital phase of care. In this pilot study,
      the investigators will try to prove the feasibility and efficacy of managing the severe
      traumatic patient with red blood cells transfusion, tranexamic acid (TXA) and fibrinogen
      concentrate compared to standard treatment based on crystalloid fluid and TXA in the
      pre-hospital phase of care.

      Early administration at pre-hospital phase of care of RBC, FC and TXA is feasible , secure
      and can help controlling trauma induced coagulopathy. Better outcomes in terms of mortality,
      less transfusion requirements and less crystalloid administration is expected
