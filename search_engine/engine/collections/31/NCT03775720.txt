      intake is less than optimal. Research suggests genetics-based personalised nutrition can
      positively impact health behaviours aiding in the prevention of chronic disease development.
      However, the effects of communicating such information are unclear. The aims of this study
      will be to analyse the impact of communicating genetic susceptibility to salt sensitivity on
      salt intake by assessing dietary salt intake before and after disclosure of genetic risk for
      hypertension according to the polymorphism in the SLC4A5. Participants will be normotensive,
      aged 18-35 years. All individuals will receive genetics-based personalised nutritional
      information. Participants displaying the risk genotype (AA + AC) will be advised to decrease
      salt intake to less than 4g/d and non-risk will be advised to adhere to government
      recommendations (6g/d). Dietary recall (24hrs) and 24-hour urine collection will be collected
      at baseline and four-weeks post-intervention to assess salt intake and excretion.
