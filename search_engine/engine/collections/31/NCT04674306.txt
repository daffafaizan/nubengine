      believes will work by stimulating the immune system to fight the participant's cancer, in a
      way similar to the way the immune system fights off an infection after a vaccination for that
      infection. Î±-lactalbumin Vaccine is experimental because it is not approved by the Food and
      Drug Administration (FDA).
