      management of breast cancer at the University of California Davis. All patients will be
      staged according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer Seventh edition. Primary disease
      treatment information including surgical approach and utilization of adjuvant chemotherapy
      will be evaluated.

      All patients will have a validated quality of life assessment (FACIT-TS-PS) completed at
      three time points during their radiation therapy process. The patients will be randomized at
      the time of completion of radiation plan approval by the treating radiation oncologist in a
      one to one fashion to either proceed with standard education or more extensive plan review.
      The radiation oncology quality assurance (QA) process will be blinded to the randomization of
      the patient.
