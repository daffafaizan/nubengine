      albuterol or salbutamol (Ventolin). Racemic albuterol is a mixture of two forms of albuterol
      which are mirror images of each other i.e. R-and S- isomers. The investigational treatments
      are R-albuterol and S-albuterol .

      R-albuterol ( levalbuterol) relieves the narrowing of the bronchial air passages in the lungs
      and has been approved by the U.S. FDA, but is not currently licensed for use in Canada. We
      have obtained approval from Health Canada to use these isomers for the purpose of this study.
      R-albuterol has been shown to have a slightly better bronchodilator effect as compared to the
      racemic albuterol and is well- tolerated in patients, with only a few mild to moderate side
      effects (such as palpitations, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, bodyache, leg cramps and headache).
      However it is still not clear whether the S-isomer has no effect or has a harmful effect on
      the airways.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of this drug, levalbuterol, on the
      allergen-induced inflammatory response in adult subjects with asthma. Specifically, we want
      to look for changes in airway eosinophils by examining sputum samples and to compare the
      effects of the R- and S- isomers on airway inflammation. This will help us to understand
      whether the racemic albuterol could worsen inflammation because of the presence of the
      S-isomer, and this will give us a better idea as to whether the routine use of levalbuterol
      is superior to racemic albuterol.
