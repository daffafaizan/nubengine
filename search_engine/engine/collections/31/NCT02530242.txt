      output-to-CO (carbon monoxide) concentration correlation of the CO sensor is dependent on
      temperature. The new algorithm will be a different approach because the current algorithm is
      at the limits of its capability. We will establish the new specifications by determining
      performance in a bench model under simulated temperature conditions. We will then determine
      the ability of the modified device to distinguish between SCD and healthy controls. During
      this initial testing, we will examine the validity of ETCO measurements under regulated room
      temperature in the hospital setting. We will enroll 20 subjects, 10 each in the SCD arm and
      control arm to determine the mean and variance of the ETCO values.
