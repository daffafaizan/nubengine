      (CIS) patients age 18-50 will be treated with ocrelizumab within 90 days of first clinical
      MS/CIS presentation and re-dosed as maintenance therapy every 6 months for 3 years to see if
      treatment favorably alters CSF markers of chronic inflammation

      Investigators hope data that will provide a foundation for further studies that treating
      relapsing MS patients at clinical onset (using a B-cell depleting therapy) may improve
      longer-term outcomes.
