      Technologies, China) adds a remote control workstation and a audio-visual exchange system to
      the original well-establish MCE system, which consists of a robotic magnetic arm, a
      workstation (now bypassed) and a capsule endoscope, and boasts a 90% sensitivity and 94%
      specificity for diagnosing gastric focal lesions. This feasibility study aims to evaluate the
      technical success, clinical success and adverse events of the first clinical application of
      non-contact MCE system.
