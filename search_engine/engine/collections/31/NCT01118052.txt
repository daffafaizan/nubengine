      I. To estimate the proportion of patients who survive progression-free for at least 6 months
      and the proportion of patients who have objective tumor response (complete or partial) in
      patients with persistent or recurrent ovarian epithelial, fallopian tube, or primary
      peritoneal carcinoma.

      II. To determine the frequency and severity of adverse events as assessed by the National
      Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the duration of progression-free survival and overall survival.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To collect blood and peritoneal lavage fluid from patients that will be stored for future
      research.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive intraperitoneal EGEN-001 on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Courses repeat every 4
      weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for 3 years.
