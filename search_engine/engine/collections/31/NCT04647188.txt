      of care data relating to surgeon's performance during live surgery. This is a multi-centre
      prospective cohort study involving patients undergoing robotic assisted surgery for prostate,
      colorectal, lung, gynaecological, hepatobiliary, and ear, nose & throat tumours. In this
      study, automated digital point of care data relating to the surgeons' performance will be
      collected via the Intuitive Data Recorder (IDR) device (Intuitive Surgical Inc, USA). Data
      collection will also encompass surgeon characteristics, patient characteristics, 30-day
      clinical outcomes including surgical complications, reoperation, length of stay and hospital
      readmission. This will also include collection of baseline, 30- and 90-day patient reported
      outcomes data.

      MASTERY is the first study of the RCS Robotics Working Group and aims to initially recruit
      500 patients across 10 centres in United Kingdom from January 2021.
