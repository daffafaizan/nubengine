    
      This is a single-institution, prospective, phase I dose escalation trial of lonsurf combined
      with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel using the 3+3 design. This study will enroll 18 patients
      over 12-15 months.

      Primary Objective To determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of the combination of
      lonsurf, gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel

      Secondary Objectives

        1. Examine safety and toxicity of the combination

        2. Estimate response rate to the combination

        3. Estimate median overall survival (mOS) of the treated population

        4. Estimate median progression free survival (mPFS) of the treated population

        5. Estimate disease control rate (DCR) at 8 weeks

        6. Evaluate quality of life while receiving the combination therapy
