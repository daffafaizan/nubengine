      and inflammation. Hyperuricemic HF patients are characterized by worsening of renal function
      and fragile volume state, both of which restrict the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
      drugs (NSAIDs) when treating concurrent inflammatory diseases. Recent small studies suggest
      that steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, prednisone, may have renal protective, UA lowering,
      and potentiating diuretic effects in hyperuricemic HF patients. However, general acceptance
      of prednisone as a treatment option for anti-inflammation therapy in patients with
      hyperuricemic HF requires more safety data. We therefore designed a randomized study to
      compare the safety and renal protective effects of short-term use of prednisone with
      allopurinol, a widely used xanthine oxidase inhibitor with a well-established safety profile
      in HF, in hyperuricemic HF patients.
