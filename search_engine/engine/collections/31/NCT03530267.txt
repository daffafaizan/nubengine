      patients with mCRC including 5-FU - better tolerated than capecitabine in the FOCUS2 study -
      in conjunction with aflibercept, a broad active anti-angiogenic drug within a randomized
      phase-II setting. Patients will be randomized using a 1:1 randomization between 5-FU /
      aflibercept and 5-FU / oxaliplatin using the oxaliplatin-based regimen established in FOCUS2
      trial. Main goal is to estimate the 6-months PFS rate with 5-FU / Aflibercept and the safety
      of this regimen. The decision to use a randomized phase-II design using the "FOCUS2- FOLFOX"
      is based on two assumptions; (i) Bias can be better controlled by using a randomized phase-II
      design (ii) A clear standard regimen in frail elderly cannot be defined, but FOLFOX was
      superior to 5-FU alone in FOCUS2 and the patient population included in the FOCUS2 study
      represents the patient population scheduled to be included in the current trial.

      Provided the randomized phase-II study shows adequate efficacy of 5-FU / aflibercept and a
      tolerable safety profile, the study will be carried on to the phase-III part of the trial.
      Description of the terms and conditions to expand the current trial are not part of this
      protocol. Briefly, a potential phase-III study should aim at showing non-inferiority of 5-FU
      / aflibercept regarding 6-months PFS rate as primary endpoint. This would allow to include
      all patients from the phase-II part in the phase-III study in order to save time and
      patients.
