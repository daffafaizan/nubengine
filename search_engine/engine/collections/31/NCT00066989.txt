    
      Survival of Very-Low-Birth-Weight (VLBW) infants (<1500g at birth) has improved dramatically,
      but these patients remain subject to significant morbidity and mortality due to
      Staphylococcus aureus infection. S. aureus infection is a relatively common event in VLBW
      neonates, occurring in approximately 3.4% of very low birth weight neonates and accounting
      for 15-20% of all infections in this patient population. This controlled study will assess
      the safety, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of Altastaph in LBW neonates. The
      study will be stratified by birth weight and include up to 200 LBW neonates, 3 to 7 days of
      age.
