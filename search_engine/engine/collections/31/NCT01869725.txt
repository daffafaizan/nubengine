    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare efficacy of [68Ga]-DOTA-tyr3-Octreotide (68Ga-DOTATOC) (gallium Ga
      68-edotreotide) PET/CT with Octreoscan (indium In 111 pentetreotide) + high-resolution,
      contrast-enhanced CT for diagnosis and staging in patients with somatostatin receptor
      expressing tumors.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive gallium Ga 68-edotreotide intravenously (IV) and undergo PET/CT scan. Within
      120 days, patients undergo standard indium In 111 pentetreotide contrast-enhanced CT or MRI
      scan. Patients may also undergo a second gallium Ga 68-edotreotide PET/CT scan within 3-6
      months if the lesions of the first scan cannot be confirmed.
