      Many cardiac problems were previously reported including left ventricular hypertrophy, right
      and left ventricular systolic dysfunction etc. Diastolic cardiac dysfunction can be found in
      normal left ventricular systolic function and can lead to diastolic heart failure
      postoperatively.

      Preoperative screening by transthoracic echocardiogram is difficult due to anatomical
      challenge (thick chest wall, narrowing of inter-rib space), therefore the prevalence of this
      problem may be underestimated. Transesophageal echocardiogram provides better cardiac view,
      but requires sedation during procedure. So, it is not practical for out-patient setting. The
      investigator would like to perform transesophageal echocardiogram in this group of patients
      after anesthesia induction to demonstrate the true prevalence of this syndrome.
