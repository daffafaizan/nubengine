      identical or 1 antigen mismatched related donor. PBSC are selected for CD34+ cells and T
      cells are depleted.

      Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 2 hours on days -6 to -3 and anti-thymocyte
      globulin IV with methylprednisolone IV over 10-12 hours on days -5 to -3. T-cell depleted
      PBSC and bone marrow are infused on day 0. Patients receive cyclosporine IV over 12-24 hours
      on days -1 to 120 followed by a taper and methylprednisolone IV on days 7-64 for
      graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis.

      Patients are followed every 30 days for 1 year, every 60 days for 2 years, and then as needed
      for a minimum of 3 years.
