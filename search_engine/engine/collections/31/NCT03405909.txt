      hyperenhancement, followed by contrast washout in the portal venous or late phase. We would
      like to investigate the following points:

        1. whether arterial hyperenhancement alone is sufficient for the definite diagnosis of HCC
           in cirrhosis with CEUS

        2. whether a further clearly-defined point of assessment in the late phase after 4-6
           minutes is of additional diagnostic value in focal liver lesions showing no contrast
           washout after 3 minutes

        3. diagnostic value of CEUS-based standardised diagnostic algorithms (ESCULAP = Erlanger
           Synopsis of Contrast Enhanced Ultrasound for Liver lesion Assessment in Patients at
           risk; CEUS LI-RADS = Contrast Enhanced Ultrasound Liver Imaging Reporting and Data
           System) for non-invasive diagnosis of HCC in high-risk patients (diagnostic accuracy,
           interobserver-variability, feasability in clinical Routine).
