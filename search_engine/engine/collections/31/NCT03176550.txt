      will receive a single two-hour session of SES using transcutaneous electrical nerve
      stimulation. Pre- and post-intervention assessments consist of the Action Research Arm Test
      (ARAT), finger fractionation, pinch force, and the modified Ashworth scale (MAS), along with
      resting-state EEG monitoring. We will assess for any association between SES and changes in
      motor outcome as measured using the ARAT, MAS and finger fractionation. In addition, EEG
      power analyses will be performed to determine if there are any differences between SES
      responders vs. non-responders.
