      there is an intermediate state between the primary tumor and distant metastases called
      oligometastasis. Current research indicates that good local control of oligometastasis can be
      obtained with Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) Can not prolong the long-term survival of
      patients. Researchers believe that after SBRT treatment of patients with oligometacosis in
      breast cancer. So, through the detection of microRNA in the primary lesion of breast cancer
      patients with oligometastasis to screen the patients with oligomerization and potential
      multiple metastases; explore the existing medical treatment, based on the control of local
      lesions by SBRT, the use of apatinib anti-angiogenic targeted maintenance therapy, with a
      view to reducing the incidence of new lesions, thereby prolonging the patient's survival.
