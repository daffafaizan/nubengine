      told which treatments the participants are receiving, "unblinded"), multi-center (when more
      than 1 hospital or medical school team work on a medical research study), randomized (study
      medication assigned by chance), stepwise, bolus plus intravenous infusion, fixed-flexible
      (arbitrary dose titration [slow increase in drug dosage, guided by participant's responses])
      study. The study consists of 3 periods: Observation period (from the time of obtaining
      consent to the start of study treatment), Treatment period, and Follow-up period (from 24
      hours after the initiation of study treatment [discontinuation] to 30 days after the
      initiation of study treatment). The participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of the
      following 3 treatment groups: 2+0.005 group, 1+0.01 group and 2+0.01 group. The treatment
      period consists of treatment with bolus injection (over 1 minute) followed by intravenous
      infusion (over 24 hours: Period 1 [fixed-dose period] of 3 hours and Period 2 [flexible-dose
      period] of 21 hours).The study will be conducted stepwise and hence, initially participants
      will be randomly assigned to 1 of the following 2 groups: 1+0.01 group and 2+0.005 group.
      Participants will receive nesiritide at an initial dose of 0.005 or 0.01 microgram per
      kilogram per minute (mcg/kg/min), and the dose escalation of 0.005 mcg/kg/min per dose will
      be conducted every 3 hours up to maximum of 0.03 mcg/kg/min in Period 2. Safety data of at
      least 5 participants will be assessed for each group, and after confirming the safety of 2
      groups, the participants will be assigned to third group of nesiritide 2 microgram per
      kilogram (mcg/kg) +0.01 mcg/kg/min. Then participants will be followed up to a maximum of 30
      days after the initiation of study treatment, in follow-up period. Participants will
      primarily be evaluated for the effect of nesiritide on hemodynamic parameters such as
      pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP), or if it is unmeasurable then it will be
      complemented with pulmonary arterial diastolic pressure (PADP). Participants' safety will
      also be monitored throughout the study.
