      together with performance evaluation data will be used to support CE marking under Directive
      98/79/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 October 1998 on in vitro
      diagnostic medical devices 3, using ISO 13612:2002 - Performance Evaluation of In Vitro
      Diagnostic Medical Devices as the standard. The investigative devices are the LumiraDx
      Platform D Dimer Test and the LumiraDx Platform CRP Test. The LumiraDx Platform employs a
      portable diagnostic instrument used with single use D Dimer or CRP Assay Test Strips.

      Agreement of the different sample types to the reference method will be demonstrated across a
      patient population representative of the indication for use of the products. Operators will
      be trained clinical site staff who are representative of the intended users of the product,
      i.e. health care professionals at the point of care such as nurses, technicians, doctors,
      etc. A panel of whole blood and plasma samples will be obtained from each patient in order to
      assess the accuracy of the investigative device across all sample types.
