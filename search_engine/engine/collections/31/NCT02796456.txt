      Apelin and its receptor APJ have been implicated in pathologies including cardiovascular
      disease, diabetes and obesity.

      Little is known about the function of the apelinergic system during gestation.

      In a previous study, investigators evaluated in mice this system at the feto-maternal
      interface in insulin-resistant obese female (HF) mice. Maternal apelinemia was decreased at
      term and fetal apelinemia was sixfold higher than maternal level. Ex-vivo, the placenta
      releases high amount of apelin at E12.5 and E18.5. In HF pregnant mice at term, apelinemia as
      well as placental apelin and APJ mRNA levels were increased whereas placental release of
      apelin was drastically reduced.
