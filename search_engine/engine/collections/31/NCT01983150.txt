      effectiveness of a smartphone delivered app for young adult smokers on smoking cessation at
      six months using a randomized controlled trial. Secondary aims of this study include
      examining: 1) proximal outcome measures of cessation behaviour; 2) satisfaction, extent of
      app use and use of NRT and other cessation services; 3) mediators of cessation outcomes
      between conditions; and 4) the incremental cost-effectiveness.
