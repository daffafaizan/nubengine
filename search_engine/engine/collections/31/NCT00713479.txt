      Study participants are those who meet criteria for MA dependence, who are not seeking
      treatment, and who also meet criteria for nicotine dependence. Participants will be asked to
      wear a telemetry device during screening and throughout the study that records heart rate and
      body temperature. Participants will be required to refrain from smoking at certain times,
      illicit and prescription drug use for the duration of the study and this will be confirmed
      with daily urine testing.

      The study consists of 30 days or less of outpatient screening. The 2-component inpatient
      portion of the study lasts a total of 18 days. Participants will be admitted to the GCRC at
      UCLA for Days 1-10. After the first study day, participants will be randomized to varenicline
      or matched placebo for 9-days and then discharged from the GCRC. Then, after 2-4 weeks, the
      same subjects return to the GCRC to be switched to the alternate condition (placebo or
      varenicline) for the second component of the study, which lasts another 8-days. Each subject
      is randomized to both varenicline and placebo, so total time commitment is 18 inpatient study
      days. One follow-up visit is scheduled 2 weeks after completion of both study phases for
      assessment of delayed adverse events and for final payment.

      On the first day of the inpatient procedure, subjects received 10 3mg infusions of
      methamphetamine over 2.5 hours for assessment of drug tolerability. On day 9 of the first
      component and day 7 of the second component, subjects received either 10 3mg infusions of
      saline OR methamphetamine over 2.5 hours. In the afternoon, the infusion was the opposite of
      the morning condition.
