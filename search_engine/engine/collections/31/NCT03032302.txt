      required by the brain for normal functioning and, with few exceptions, can only be obtained
      through dietary sources. Research into degenerative diseases of aging have linked
      mitochondrial aging and DNA damage caused by micronutrient deficiency to greater incidence of
      cognitive decline and stroke, among other diseases, in the general population, particularly
      in those consuming food rich in fats and carbohydrates but poor in micronutrient content.
      Other research focusing on cognition, behaviour and mood state has associated micronutrient
      deficiencies with a wide range of neurological conditions including Alzheimer's Disease,
      Parkinson's Disease, multiple sclerosis, autism spectrum disorders, depression, fatigue and
      schizophrenia. There have however been very few studies using micronutrient interventions in
      post-acute human TBI. In a study with thirty retired American Football players an
      intervention including supplementation with a broad-spectrum multivitamin, omega-3 fish oils
      and a number of other substances resulted in significant percentile score improvements in
      almost half of the participants (n=100) across a broad range of cognitive measures. Findings
      demonstrated that micronutrient intervention can result in significant measurable
      improvements in those with TBI many years following the initial insult. A normative study
      will be conducted with three groups assigned to Vit D, Vit C and multivitamin arms (N = 60)
      tested at baseline on cognitive function and post-intervention. The TBI study will recruit
      three groups of individuals with post-acute traumatic brain injuries and measure whether
      there is improved cognitive outcomes (measured by test-retest on a cognitive battery)
      associated with the supplements shown to be most effective in the pilot study.
