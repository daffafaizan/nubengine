    
      OUTLINE: This is a multi-center study.

      PHASE I:

        -  UGT1A1 *28 7/7 genotype IS NOT present

        -  Cetuximab 250 mg/m2 IV days 1, 8, and 15

        -  Irinotecan 125 mg/m2 IV days 1 and 8

        -  RAD001 PO QD (dose determined at the time of registration; subjects will remain at this
           dose level until treatment discontinuation)

      PHASE II:

        -  Randomization based on UGT1A1 *28 7/7 Genotype or Prior Irinotecan Exposure

      ARM A:

        -  Cetuximab 250 mg/m2 IV days 1, 8, and 15

        -  Irinotecan 125 mg/m2 IV days 1 and 8

      AT TIME OF PROGRESSIVE DISEASE, ARM A TREATMENT WILL CROSSOVER:

        -  Cetuximab 250 mg/m2 IV days 1, 8, and 15

        -  Irinotecan 125 mg/m2 IV days 1 and 8

        -  RAD001 PO QD (maximum tolerated dose)

      ARM B:

        -  Cetuximab 250 mg/m2 IV days 1, 8, and 15

        -  Irinotecan 125 mg/m2 IV days 1 and 8

        -  RAD001 PO QD (maximum tolerated dose)

      AT TIME OF PROGRESSIVE DISEASE, ARM B TREATMENT WILL BE DISCONTINUED

      ECOG performance status 0-2

      Life Expectancy: Not specified

      Hematopoietic:

        -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1,500 mm3

        -  Platelets ≥ 100,000 mm3

        -  Hemoglobin (Hgb) ≥ 9 g/dL

        -  White blood cell count (WBC) ≥ 2,000 mm3

        -  INR < 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) if not on anticoagulation (if on anticoagulation
           must have an in-range INR (usually between 2 and 3) on a stable dose of warfarin)

        -  PTT < 1.5 x ULN

      Hepatic:

        -  Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN

        -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST, SGOT) ≤ 2.5 x ULN

        -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT, SGPT) ≤ 2.5 x ULN

        -  Albumin ≥ 3.0 g/dL

      Renal:

        -  Calculated creatinine clearance of ≥ 60 cc/min using the Cockcroft-Gault formula

      Cardiovascular:

        -  No uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia requiring medication, transient ischemic attack
           (TIA), or cerebrovascular accident (CVA) within 6 months prior to being registered for
           protocol therapy

        -  No uncontrolled congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, or unstable angina
           within 6 months prior to being registered for protocol therapy

      Pulmonary:

        -  No severely impaired lung function as demonstrated by pulse O2 saturation ≤ 90% at rest
           on room air, or pulmonary function test FEV1 ≤ 2L

        -  No history of prior chronic lung infection such as tuberculosis, atypical tuberculosis,
           or histoplasmosis as evidenced by a chest CT or x-ray within 21 days prior to being
           registered for protocol therapy
