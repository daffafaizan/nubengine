      malignant CD4+ T-cells that infiltrate the skin. While most cases are confined to skin, CTCL
      is also capable of affecting the blood, lymph nodes, and visceral organs. SÃ©zary Syndrome
      (SS) is a leukemic variant of the disease with a poor prognosis and can arise with or without
      cutaneous involvement. The pathogenesis of CTCL is poorly understood, but chronic antigen
      stimulation possibly due to a bacterial or viral infection or colonization of the skin may
      lead to malignant transformation of the skin resident T cells. Colonization of the skin of
      CTCL patients with Staphylococcus aureus is common and can lead to the clonal expansion of
      malignant T cells in the skin. However, its role as an etiological agent is unlikely,
      considering commonality of S.aureus and rarity of the skin T-cell lymphomas. Mounting
      evidence suggests that oncogenic viral pathogen may play a role, but all efforts to implicate
      certain viruses, such as retroviruses or herpesviruses have yielded inconsistent results.
      This study will use the most sensitive method to date, a novel viral detection technique
      capable of detecting every known vertebrate virus in tissue samples, called "Virome Capture
      Sequencing Platform for Vertebrate Viruses (VirCapSeq-VERT)." This allows it to detect
      previously undiscovered viruses that diverge from known sequences by as much as 40%.
