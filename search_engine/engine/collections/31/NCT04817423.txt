      Errors of ICD codes may result in claim denials and missed revenue. However, ICD coding
      process is complex, time-consuming and error-prone. More experienced coders are in need, but
      there is an increasing lack of supply. Automated ICD coding has potential to facilitate
      clinical coders for improved efficiency and quality. Model performance of related studies is
      still far below coders and both the accuracy and interpretability need to be improved in
      great demand. Besides, studies in Chinese corpus are not sufficient.

      In this study, the investigators will implement automated ICD coding study based on
      inpatient' data collected from electronic medical records from Fuwai Hospital, the world's
      largest medical center for cardiovascular disease. Feature engineering and machine learning
      methods will be used to develop classification models with good performance, interpretability
      and practicability for ICD codes of primary diagnosis.
