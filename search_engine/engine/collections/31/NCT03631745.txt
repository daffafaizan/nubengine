      Los Angeles and Riverside Counties. This study aims to leverage the collective resources of
      Latino religious congregations and the National Alliance on Mental Illness to test the
      effectiveness of a multi-component intervention directed at reducing stigma, increasing
      mental health literacy, and improving access to mental health services. A total of 12
      churches (6 intervention and 6 wait-list control) will be enrolled in the study. Churches
      within each study site, the Riverside County parishes and the Archdiocese of Los Angeles,
      will be matched in pairs based on size and geography. Three matched pairs from each study
      site will be randomly selected and then randomly assigned within each pair to intervention or
      control. The planned study will involve 2400 participants (1200 intervention and 1200
      control) who will be part of congregations that are randomly assigned to receive the
      church-based intervention immediately or a wait list control condition. Participants will be
      assessed at baseline, 6-month follow-up, and 12-month follow-up to evaluate intervention
      effects on mental health service use and potential mediators (i.e., mental health literacy,
      stigma).
