    
      Objective(s): The primary objective is to determine whether 12 weeks of treatment with
      Lysulin, compared to placebo, causes a reduction from baseline in the plasma levels of
      glucose, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and Advanced Glycation Endproducts (AGEs) in patients with
      inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus. Secondary objectives include determining
      whether 12 weeks of treatment with Lysulin increases beta-cell function as measured by plasma
      C-peptide levels.

      Research Plan: A randomized, prospective, double-blind study with randomization to lysulin
      and placebo in a 1:1 fashion. The study will enroll 60 patients with inadequately controlled
      type 2 diabetes.

      Methods: The study will be performed as outpatient study at Phoenix VA Clinical Research
      Center. The study will include 3-4 visits. At the initial visit, participants will complete
      informed consent proc HbA1c ≥ 7.5 % and < 10%ess and undergo screening examination. Inclusion
      criteria will be age 21-75 years, HbA1c ≥ 7.5 % and < 10%, and stable dose of insulin 6 weeks
      prior to enrollment. Qualified participants will be randomized to 3,330 mg/day Lysulin (1,110
      mg tbl, TID) as add-on supplement therapy for 12 weeks. Follow-up visits will be at weeks 6
      and week 12 (end of study). Baseline and follow-up visits will include physical examination,
      patient history and blood draw. The primary study outcome measure will be fasting plasma
      glucose and HbA1c. Secondary outcome measures will include fasting plasma C-peptide and AGE
      concentrations. A linear mixed effects model will be used to evaluate treatment-induced
      endpoints. The models will be fit for sequential values of the response variable (including
      the baseline measurement).
