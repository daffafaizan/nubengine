      finish surgery smoothly by reducing patients' anxiety and fear who undergo regional and local
      anesthesia.

      If adequate sedation is not maintained during regional anesthesia, surgery may be disturbed
      by patient's movement. This can cause the patient to be physically and mentally stressed with
      discomfort.

      Commonly used measurement to determine the adequate sedation level relies on subjective
      physician's assessment such as scoring for response to talk, shake and pain. This measurement
      is unreliable and not continuous.

      Recently, BIS is used to guide sedation during spinal anesthesia as an objective monitoring
      method in many studies. but previous studies result contrasting in the correlation between
      BIS and sedation levels with lack in evaluation between sedative drugs.

      In this study, the investigators will investigate the usefullness of BIS monitoring during
      regional anesthesia with sedation and evaluate the suitability of correlation BIS and OAA/S
      between drugs (midazolam, propofol and dexmedetomidine). The anesthetic and sedation protocol
      will be standardized.
