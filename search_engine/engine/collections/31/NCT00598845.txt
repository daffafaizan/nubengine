      markers in endometrial cancer for lymph node metastasis, prognosis and treatment. For the
      previously studied tumor markers p53, p16, ER, PR and HER2neu, we want to investigate the
      expression in curettage material in relation to lymph node metastasis and prognosis among
      endometrial carcinoma patients. We also want to investigate the distribution of genetic
      alterations in fresh frozen tumor tissue in order to design prospective randomized treatment
      trials of metastatic endometrial cancer based on molecular profile. There will be a special
      emphasis on disturbances in the pathways influenced by new targeted therapy, such as
      inhibitors of Her2/NEU, EGFR, receptor tyrosine kinase, mTOR, PTEN and hormone receptor
      pathways.
