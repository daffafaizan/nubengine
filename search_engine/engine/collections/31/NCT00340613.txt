      importance of intensified diabetes control in helping reduce complications associated with
      poorly controlled diabetes. However, adolescents with T1DM continue to be a high-risk
      population due to the difficulties in coping with the physical, emotional, and social demands
      associated with managing diabetes themselves.

      We propose to use the school nurse to help with lunchtime blood sugar monitoring (BSM) and
      with a lunchtime insulin injection. We want to see if this will improve blood sugar control,
      improve school grades, and decrease absences from school in adolescents with poorly
      controlled diabetes. Subjects will receive 12 weeks of this treatment to see if they will
      have improved glucose control. We hope to improve blood sugar control, school grades and
      decrease absences from school in teens with poorly controlled diabetes.
