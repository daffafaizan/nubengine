      Primary

        -  Investigate the feasibility of centrally collecting and processing high-quality
           cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from pediatric patients with newly diagnosed central
           nervous system tumors for proteomic studies.

        -  Identify protein markers that might indicate the presence of a brain tumor using CSF
           samples collected from these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients undergo cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collection from any or all of the following 5
      sites: lumbar, cervical, ommaya, intra-operative (ventricular, cisternal), and/or external
      ventricular drain. CSF is obtained within 8 weeks of diagnosis but prior to (or concurrent
      with) the initiation of any post-operative therapy (excluding corticosteroids).

      CSF samples are examined for proteomic biomarkers by 2D gel electrophoresis, low-mass
      fingerprinting, and stable isotope labeling.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 99 patients will be accrued for this study.
