      proposal to address a key gap in our understanding of the mechanism of non-verbal
      clinician-patient communication on physiology and behavior. Social neuroscience is a rapidly
      growing area of research that offers unique opportunities to better understand the mechanisms
      underlying common observations about clinician-patient interactions.The purpose of this study
      is to better understand the CNS mechanisms underlying the observed changes in self-reported
      well-being and ANS activity by evaluating resting fMRI activity under controlled conditions.
      The specific aims are to compare resting fMRI activity in the mirror neuron system (MNS) and
      resting state networks (RSN), reflected specifically in the Insula, Anterior Cingulate Cortex
      (ACC), Precuneus, Posterior Cingulate Cortex (PCC), Amygdala, Bilateral Inferior Parietal
      Cortex, Primary Motor-Visual System, and Dorsal Medulla while viewing touch with
      lovingkindness meditation lovingkindness meditation vs no lovingkindness meditation,
      receiving touch with lovingkindness meditation vs no lovingkindness meditation and both
      viewing and receiving touch with lovingkindness meditation vs no lovingkindness meditation.
      This is a descriptive study to generate sample size estimates for an NIH RO1 proposal.
