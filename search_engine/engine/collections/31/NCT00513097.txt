      spit tobacco (ST) prevention and cessation in-class curriculum for rural teens. Supplemented
      by "cyber-support" (chat room and bulletin board), the intervention program also will make
      use of a human social support environment (via trained school personnel, chat rooms, bulletin
      boards). The study will use a nested cohort design in which high schools are the unit of
      design, allocation, and analysis. Tenth-grade students (ages 14-16) within each intervention
      school will receive a 7-week interactive, Internet-based tobacco prevention and cessation
      curriculum. Using computerized surveys, study participants will be evaluated at baseline,
      6-month, 12-month, and 18-month follow-ups. The study has been designed to permit analyses
      sensitive enough to detect differences for the two primary hypotheses: reductions in smoking
      initiation and smoking cessation. Trends in ST use after exposure to the intervention program
      will also be assessed. The design will also permit analysis of stage-of-change dynamics and
      mediators for both acquisition and cessation of both forms of tobacco.
