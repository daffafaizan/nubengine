      a mixed patient population. Participants were treated for one week and randomly assigned to
      the novel analgesic, pregabalin, or placebo. Pain will be characterized before and at the end
      of this period. This trial required the participants to stay at the investigational site for
      14 consecutive days.

      The enrollment visit took place Day -28 to Day -16. Participants tapered down their existing
      medication from Visit 2 (Day -17 to Day -5) to Visit 3 and were given rescue medication
      (paracetamol/acetaminophen). At Visit 3 participants were hospitalized (Day -4). The baseline
      evaluation period took place from Day -3 to Day -1. Randomization to one of the three
      treatment arms was possible after the last assessment on Day - 1 alternatively randomization
      took place on Day 1. This was followed by the double-blind treatment period (Day 1 to Day 7).
      The participants were follow-up thereafter up to day 36 (Day 34 to 38). Participants were
      permitted to resume their previous medication.
