      for use in genetic research.

      If you are unable to provide a blood sample, researchers will collect leftover tissue samples
      from your previously collected tumor tissue (from the time of the breast cancer diagnosis).
      The tumor samples will be used for genetic research.

      After the blood draw or tissue collection, your participation in this study will be over.

      The blood samples for the genetic research will be stored at Myriad Laboratories. Before your
      blood and/or tissue is sent to Myriad Laboratories for banking, your name and any personal
      identifying information will be coded to protect your privacy. M. D. Anderson will not have
      oversight of any leftover tissue and/or blood that will be banked by Myriad Laboratories for
      additional research.

      This is an investigational study. Up to 210 patients will take part in this study. All will
      be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.
