      therapies among COPD patients new to the ICS/LABA combination therapies in the US, comparing
      those who are adherent to the index medication and those who are non-adherent. Adherence will
      be measured using the proportion of days covered with the index medication. Medical and
      pharmacy claims data will be used as the data source.
