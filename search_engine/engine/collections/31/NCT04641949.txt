      saline) on the hemodynamic response to hypovolemia in healty volunteers. Hypovolemia will be
      induced in the "lower body negative pressure" model. XX healthy volunteers will be exposed to
      inhaled methoxyflurane, 3 ml or intravenous fentanyl, XX mg or placebo in a randomized order
      (cross-over) at least 3 days apart.
