      period" in an effort to improve on both local tumor response as well as distant disease
      control. First, the duration from completion of chemoradiotherapy would increase from 6-8
      weeks to 9-11 weeks. As noted above, this may allow for further cell death with resultant
      pathologic downstaging. Secondly, the protocol calls for continued systemic therapy during
      the 9-11 week period, thus allowing continuation of therapies directed towards both the
      primary as well as distant sites of disease. The primary aim of this pilot study would be to
      establish the feasibility of this intensified neoadjuvant approach, especially with respect
      to tolerability of the subsequent pelvic surgery. A subsequent phase II portion will evaluate
      the efficacy of this treatment approach.
