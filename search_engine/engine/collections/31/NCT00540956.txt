      Primary

        -  Determine the evolution of functional receptors of natural killer (NK) cells after
           completion of chemotherapy in elderly patients with acute myeloid leukemia in first
           remission.

      Secondary

        -  Measure the kinetics of cytotoxic functional recovery of NK cells.

        -  Determine activation markers of NK cells.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive 1 course of consolidation therapy comprising an anthracycline and cytarabine
      to induce first remission.

      Blood is collected on day 0 of the consolidation course and then every 2 weeks for 8 weeks.
