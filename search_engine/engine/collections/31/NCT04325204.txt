      Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) and will account for 20% of persons living
      with dementia (PLWD) by 2050. PLWD experience progressive distress and confusion, which
      decreases their quality of life and also contributes to the emotional strain, burden, social
      isolation, and depression experienced by caregivers. Research indicates that religiosity (the
      inner commitment to one's faith through integration of religious beliefs and practices into
      one's life) can serve as a protective factor against the stressors associated with caregiving
      and living with ADRD.

      The goal of this clinical feasibility trial and NIH stage 1 intervention development project
      is to go beyond the four walls of the church to find ways to meet the spiritual needs of
      persons living with moderate and severe ADRD "where they are" in order to help them remain
      religiously and spiritually engaged. This study is premised on the notion that
      religious/spiritual engagement is possible and beneficial for PLWD and that this beneficial
      effect will extend to their caregivers.

      The purpose of this project is to design and test the feasibility of employing components of
      a Faith-based Home Activity Toolbox (Faith-HAT) and create intervention tools for a
      full-scale randomized controlled trial (RCT) to test the efficacy-effectiveness of
      faith-based programs on patient and caregiver outcomes.

      Thirty dyads of people with dementia and their caregivers will be enrolled in a 12 week
      program to test the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of using Faith-HAT.
