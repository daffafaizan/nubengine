      Patients who complete all the study treatment or who withdraw consent or experience
      intolerable toxicity will undergo surgery according to local practices.

      administration or the date of the definitive surgery, whichever comes last.

      The maximum follow up for each individual patient will be until death or 5 years after the
      definitive surgery date whatever happens first.
