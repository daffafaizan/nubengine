      following EMR, occurring in up to 12% of patients. The purpose of the study is to prevent
      such bleeding with the use of a technique known as: "coagulation therapy." This therapy
      involves using a small dose of heat energy that results in clotting(coagulation) of a blood
      vessel. It is already used widely in the stomach and we intend using this on a lower setting
      to blood vessels that are exposed after the resection.
