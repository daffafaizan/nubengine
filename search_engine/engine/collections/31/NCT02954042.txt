      crossover trial. Subjects will be allocated in a 1:1 ratio (60 per arm) to either the control
      arm (PFMT) or the treatment arm (PFMT in conjunction with the Pelvital therapy). Subjects
      will conduct their respective therapy five minutes a day over the course of six weeks. At
      weeks two, four and six, the subjects will conduct bi-weekly check-ups. After six weeks, all
      patients in the control arm will have the option to cross over into the treatment arm if no
      improvement in symptoms has been shown.
