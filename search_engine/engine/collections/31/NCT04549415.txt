    
      This is a single centre trial designed to investigate the benefit, if any, of 12-month
      metformin 2000 mg/day treatment on clinical course of chronic heart failure in 78 patients
      with coronary artery disease and impaired glucose tolerance.

      Participants will be seen in three occasions: screening, baseline randomization, 6 month,
      final 12 month, during which clinical and laboratory indicators will be assessed. There will
      also be three telephone visits at: month 1, month 3, month 9.

      At a screening visit an initial history will be performed during following informed consent.
      Participants will undergo a laboratory, clinical and instrumental screening in Chronic Heart
      Failure department of National Centre of cardiology and Internal Medicine named after
      academician M.Mirrakhimov. Among with anthropologic and clinical data, prior to metformin
      administration, blood samples were evaluated.

      Participants who meet all inclusion criteria will return for the randomization during
      hospitalization to either Metformin or Lifestyle modification alone.

      After 6 months of observation safety indicators will be evaluated, as well as fasting and
      postprandial glucose, creatinine, ECG.

      In the active arm, therapy will be metformin in an initial dose of 1000 mg/day (metformin 500
      mg Ñ…2/day). Participants will continue on Metformin 500 mg x2/day for 2 weeks, following
      safety blood checks this dose will be increased to 2000 mg/day. If the higher dose cannot be
      tolerated it will be reduced to 1000 mg/day (or stopped if not tolerated).

      The target dose of Metformin at 2000 mg/day was chosen based on previous study of metformin
      in nondiabetic heart failure patients with IR
