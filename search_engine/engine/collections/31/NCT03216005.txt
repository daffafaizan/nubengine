    
      Prospective, non-randomized, multicenter pre-market feasibility study to evaluate subjects
      treated with the BlueLeaf System for the treatment of symptomatic CVI of the lower extremity.
      The BlueLeaf System is designed to form autogenous tissue leaflets from vein walls in the
      femoral and popliteal veins without the use of a permanent vascular implant for the treatment
      of CVI. Subjects meeting eligibility criteria will be enrolled and may be followed through 5
      years post treatment.
