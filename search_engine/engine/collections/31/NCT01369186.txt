      paracetamol. Because morphine is often injected to relieve pain in patients with myocardial
      infarction, it is of particular interest if morphine may decrease the rate of absorption of
      antiplatelet drugs. Results of this study will provide essential information for the use of
      morphine and antiplatelet drugs in clinical practice, in particular in myocardial infarction.
