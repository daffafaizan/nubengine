    
      Patients with first-diagnosed STEMI were randomly assigned to distal protection and thrombus
      aspiration (DP-TA) pretreatment during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or
      conventional PCI (c-PCI).

      The primary endpoint was the remodeling index (RI), measured by cardiac magnetic resonance
      imaging (CMR) post-PCI and 6 months after PCI.

      Secondary endpoints, determined by CMR within 3 to 5 days after PCI, included the infarct
      ratio (infarct size to entire left ventricular [LV] size ) by delayed-enhancement (DE), area
      at risk (AAR) ratio (AAR to LV size) by T2 high-signal intensity , microvascular occlusion
      index (MVO) ratio (MVO to LV size) by DE, and myocardial salvage index (MSI, [AAR-infarct
      size] x 100/AAR).
