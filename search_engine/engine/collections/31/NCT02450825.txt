      ventilation and follow-up of diverse lung pathologies. Computed tomographic scan is the gold
      standard method of lung aeration measurement but is rarely used because it requires transport
      of critically ill patients end exposes them to radiations. For these reasons, lung ultrasound
      would be an attractive alternative. Variants of different ultrasound-based aeration scores
      have been validated in different specific populations, but there is no comparison study that
      defines the more accurate score that should be used in a population with different
      pathologies.

      Methods: Patients undergoing a computed tomographic scan for dyspnea or hypoxemia will have a
      standardized lung ultrasound examination on Day 1. For mechanically ventilated patients only,
      a lung ultrasound examination will be repeated on Day 2 to 4. End expiratory lung volume will
      also be measured in mechanically ventilated patients on Day 1 and Day 2 to 4. Lung ultrasound
      images will be interpreted blindly. Correlation of ultrasound-based aeration scores will be
      done with lung aeration measured by computed tomographic images.
