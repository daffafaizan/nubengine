    
      All patients who underwent a EUS guided drainage of post-operative collection between 2002
      and 2011 in the endoscopy unit of Erasme hospital will be included for analysis. The study
      will focus on retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data. The technique is the
      same as the one used for pancreatic pseudocysts drainage. The technical success is defined as
      the ability to access and drain the collection by placement of transmural drain and/or
      stents. Treatment success (regression of collection) is defined as the resolution of the
      collection as shown on abdominal imaging (CT or MRI) in association with clinical resolution
      of symptoms at 8 weeks of follow-up.
