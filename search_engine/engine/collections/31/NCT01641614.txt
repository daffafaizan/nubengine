      arrest are essential for myocardial protection. Beating heart surgery on normothermic bypass
      simulates physiologic cardiac status and is good method for myocardial protection. A
      comparison of both available techniques for valve replacement arrested heart versus on-pump
      empty beating heart of the clinical and ultramicroscopic myocardial alterations will allowed
      to better understand myocardial protection because eliminated the use of cardioplegia and the
      corollary risk of ischemic reperfusion injury.
