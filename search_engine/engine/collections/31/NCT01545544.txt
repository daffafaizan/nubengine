        -  Description of the clinical and histological characteristics, treatment and evolution of
           these NHL.

        -  Study their physiopathology by immunological, virologic and molecular studies.

      The study included prospective or retrospective patients with B- Cell Non-Hodgkin lymphomas
      (NHL) associated with chronic hepatitis C. The patients are diagnosed or in remission of
      lymphoma, in relapse or failure of treatments.

      The enrolment period is 6 years and the total study lasts 8 years.

        -  "Prospective patients" are followed every 6 months during one year, and all the years
           during 2 or 5 years.

        -  "Retropective patients" are followed all the years during 2 or 5 years. At each
           follow-up, a blood sample of 50ml is withdrawn allowing ancillary studies.

      The enrollment is estimated at 140 patients.
