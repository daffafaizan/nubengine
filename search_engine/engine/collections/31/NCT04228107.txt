      using an electronic medication monitoring platform, for the period of one year. Participants
      will be enrolled in a medication monitoring platform, and their asthma care provider will
      have access to medication usage information. The study team will collect data on medication
      use patterns in a real world setting for 12 months per participant. Additionally, healthcare
      providers will be enrolled in focus groups to determine barriers and facilitators to optimal
      medication use for their patients.
