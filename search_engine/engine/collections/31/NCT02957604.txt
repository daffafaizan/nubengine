      Organization of Teratology Information Specialists (OTIS) which is a network of university
      and health department based telephone information centers serving pregnant women and
      healthcare providers throughout North America. Participants will be enrolled on an ongoing
      basis through year 10 of the study and each will be followed from the time they enroll,
      through the 5-year postnatal follow up period for an overall study period of 15 years.
      Participants are recruited concurrently from callers to OTIS centers, from healthcare
      providers and through direct to consumer marketing efforts.
