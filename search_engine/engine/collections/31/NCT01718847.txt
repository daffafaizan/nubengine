      practice. To evaluate the efficacy of NOV120101 (Poziotinib) as a second-line monotherapeutic
      agent, patients with acquired resistance to gefitinib or erlotinib will be enrolled in this
      study. Subjects will receive NOV120101 (Poziotinib) 16 mg PO once daily until disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity development. Progression free survival (PFS) will be
      analyzed as the primary endpoint in this trial. Secondary endpoints including PFS rate at 16
      weeks, ORR and DCR will also be analyzed.
