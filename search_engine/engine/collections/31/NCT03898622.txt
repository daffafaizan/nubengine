      is an easy medication to acquire and of little cost compared to the other options,
      levothyroxine would provide benefits already known in patients with CKD and also a
      proteinuria effect (knowing each other). as a factor of progression of the CKD a health
      problem worldwide) being a potentially useful treatment and a dose that the risk is minimal.
      The study consists of 3 phases, the first phase consists of capturing patients from the renal
      health clinic, having baseline measurement of the variables. Then, the second phase consists
      of both groups treating them with medication (levothyroxine with a safe dose for the
      investigator's population with high cardiovascular risk of 0.25mcg so that the patient's
      weight range between 50-80kg maintains a dosage of 0.3-0.5mcg / kg / day that the thyroid
      axis is not affected) of fasting levothyroxine (in the case of taking a drug that interacts
      with absorption changes its use according to the specified hours, see Table 2) or placebo
      according to the randomization 1: 1 for three months and that have treatment with ACEI or
      ARA-2 (specifying which and the dose thereof), with follow-up every 4 weeks (Monitoring
      thyroid function). The third phase consists of a comparison of the variables studied.

      The primary objective is to evaluate the effect of the use of levothyroxine on the levels of
      proteinuria measured on the test strip of the general urine and protein examination in
      24-hour urine patients with chronic kidney disease without renal support therapy with
      proteinuria, who already receive the standard antiproteinuric treatment with an ACE inhibitor
      or ARA-2 against placebo and the secondary objectives are to evaluate the changes in
      proteinuria, according to TSH levels in 2.5-9.9 Î¼iml /L, with the levels of T4L in levels
      0.8-1.8mcg / ml), analyze improvement in glomerular filtration rate in patients receiving
      levothyroxine and at the end of the study and evaluate Tolerability and safety of
      levothyroxine as antiproteinuric treatment in chronic kidney disease without renal support
      therapy, and as secondary objectives improvement in cholesterol, triglycerides blood
      pressure. Any adverse event will be recorded in the adverse event reporting forms.
