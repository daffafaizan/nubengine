    
      This is a trial designed to test if a treatment, losartan, may decrease the progression of
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). Losartan is an angiotensin receptor blocking
      agent, commonly used as an antihypertensive agent, which has been shown to alter cardiac
      remodeling after myocardial infarction and renovascular remodeling in diabetes-mellitus. In
      this trial participants with mild to severe COPD, with Computed Tomography (CT) evidence of
      emphysema (5-35% of voxels with < -950 Hounsfield Units), will be randomly assigned to
      receive 100mg/day of losartan or placebo for 48 weeks. The primary outcome measure will be
      the rate of progression of emphysema, quantified as the percent of lung voxels with a density
      less than -950 HU as measured by High Resolution CT (HRCT, from baseline to 48 weeks.
