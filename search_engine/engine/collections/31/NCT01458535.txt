    
      This was a 2 sequential arm, combination treatment study where each arm contained 3 cohorts:
      one each for HCV genotype 1, 2, and 3. The study consisted of 2 phases, a treatment phase and
      a post-treatment phase. The treatment phase was designed to explore the antiviral activity,
      safety and pharmacokinetics of ABT-450/r dosed in combination with ABT-267 with and without
      RBV for up to 12 weeks. The post-treatment phase was designed to monitor and evaluate
      Sustained Virologic Response (SVR) 12, SVR 24, and the evolution and persistence of viral
      resistance to ABT-267 and ABT-450 in HCV genotype 1-, 2-, and 3-infected participants who
      have been exposed to ABT-267 and ABT-450/r. Arms 1 and 2 were enrolled sequentially.
