      assessments before and at various time points up to approximately 90 minutes after the i.v.
      administration of 1 mg flumazenil and placebo in Parkinson disease subjects. Thirty Parkinson
      disease subjects with disease severity (Hoehn and Yahr) stages 2-4 will be recruited.
      Baseline [11C]FMZ and vesicular monoamine transporter type 2 (VMAT2) [11C]DTBZ brain PET
      imaging will be performed prior to drug administration to assess for GABA-A receptor
      availability and the integrity of nigrostriatal dopaminergic nerve terminals, respectively.
