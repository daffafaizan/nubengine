      recruited. Eligible patients will be randomised to receive cediranib (30 mg daily po) or
      placebo (30 mg daily po) in a 2:1 ratio. At 24 weeks post randomisation, treatment will be
      unblinded after which time all patients on placebo and those who have not progressed on
      active treatment will be given cediranib. Treatment will then continue until objective
      disease progression or death.
