      males worldwide, with about 60-80% of newly diagnosed patients having non-muscle-invasive
      bladder cancer (NMIBC). NMIBC management consist in transurethral resection of bladder tumor
      (TURBT) followed by adjuvant intravesical treatment with the chemotherapeutic agent Mitomycin
      C (MMC) or the immunotherapy bacillus Calmette-Gu√©rin. These therapies result in low
      progression rates, but are not efficacious in all patients, leading to high tumor recurrence.
      Immunogenic cell death (ICD) may be one of the mechanisms of action of MMC intravesical
      therapy in bladder cancer.

      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate whether MMC is able to trigger ICD in
      patient-derived neoplastic tissues. As secondary targets we aim to:

        1. identify an expression profile that is common to all tumors that undergo ICD upon MMC
           treatment ('ICD signature'),

        2. asses the genetic and environmental factors- urinary microbiome composition- responsible
           for MMC treatment efficacy,

        3. evaluate whether ICD induction correlates with clinical staging and response (clinical
           endpoints for MMC-treated patients are recurrence at three month and one year after
           enrollment).
