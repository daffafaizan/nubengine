    
      The PROVENT study is a randomised, double blind, placebo controlled feasibility study to
      examine the clinical effectiveness of aspirin and/or Vitamin D3 to prevent disease
      progression in men on Active Surveillance for prostate cancer

      The main outcome measure of the trial is the rate of patient recruitment to a randomised
      chemoprevention study in men enrolled on an Active Surveillance programme for prostate cancer

      Secondary outcomes include the response to treatment as determined by serial multi-parametric
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the prostate, biochemical disease progression and
      histological disease progression after 12 months of therapy and finally toxicity and/or
      allergy to both aspirin and Vitamin D3.
