      resuscitation we pretend to detect a 10% relative reduction in mortality. In addition, we
      pretend to observe an improvement on the length of resuscitation time, mechanical ventilation
      and vasopressor support-free days, ICU and hospital length of stay, organ failure and renal
      function.
