      elevations in patients presenting in emergency department (ED) with atrial fibrillation (AF)
      diagnosis , and the possible implications it has on the patients prognosis. Data on 3394
      patients from the Turku university hospital catchment area with diagnosis of AF on admission
      to ED and minor troponin-T elevation were analyzed. Patients were classified into three
      groups according to the troponin-T value: troponin <15ng/l, 15-50ng/l and 51-100ng/l.
      Individual patient records were reviewed.
