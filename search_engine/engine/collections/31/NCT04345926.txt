      Clinical Hospital of the University of Chile. In total 15 patients will be recruited, in who
      a frontal electroencephalographic signal will be recorded using a SedLine® monitor, and
      propofol concentration will be estimated using the Marsh model. First, the concentration of
      propofol at the loss of consciousness (LOS) will be recorded in the presence of remifentanil
      (7.5 ng/mL). Then, patients will be intubated and remifentanil will be decreased to 4 ng/mL.
      After that, the concentration of propofol that caused the LOS will be maintained for 20
      minutes. Finally, propofol will be increased in steps of 0.3 mcg/mL for 7 min, until an
      episode of burst suppression will be observed. In the complete protocol, EEG activity will be
      acquired using a SedLine® monitor.
