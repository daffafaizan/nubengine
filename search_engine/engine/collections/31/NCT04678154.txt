    
      Specific Aim 1: To compare the surgical site infection (SSI) rates of the current severe open
      fracture antibiotic strategy to a revised SEXTANT treatment strategy designed to address the
      modern wound bioburden at the time of wound closure or coverage.

      Specific Aim 2: To compare the terminal bioburden of the wounds at the time of definitive
      closure or coverage as sampled by standard tissue microbiology.

      Specific Aim 3: To compare rates of antibiotic-related serious adverse events (SAEs) of the
      two treatment groups.

      Exploratory Aim 4: To pilot the use of available and emerging rapid PCR platforms for wound
      pathogen identification in a sub-cohort of patients.
