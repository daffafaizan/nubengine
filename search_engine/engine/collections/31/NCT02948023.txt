      scars, ulcers and burns will undergo a surgical procedure. Limbal ring from a cadaveric donor
      tissue, which is therapeutically accepted and serologically tested, is collected. This tissue
      will then be cultivated in the stem cell biology laboratory using standardized culture
      technique. Briefly the limbal tissue will be cut up into small pieces and digested overnight
      using an enzyme (Collagenase L). The cells obtained from the digest will be cultured on a
      petri-dish using 2% serum and growth factors. The cultured cells will be passaged three times
      to remove all epithelial cells from the culture. In the second procedure, the central corneal
      epithelium will be removed using a surgical sponge. 0.1ml of stromal cells in a concentration
      of 5x10^3 cells/uL diluted in the thrombin component of fibrin glue (TISEEL, Baxter) will be
      applied to the debrided corneal stroma. A soft bandage contact lens will be placed over the
      cornea at the end of the procedure. The patient will receive topical antibiotic and steroid
      eye drops in the post-operative period. Periodic comprehensive ophthalmic evaluation along
      with anterior segment optical coherence tomography (ASOCT) scanning and slit-lamp photography
      will be done at day 1, day 7, day 45 and day 90.
