    
      The PERCY Quattro trial has been designed to evaluate the survival benefit of Interleukin-2
      (IL2) and/or alpha interferon (IFN) for patients with intermediate chance of response in
      metastatic renal cell carcinoma.

      The primary objective is overall survival, and secondary objectives are progression-free
      survival, response rate, toxicity, and quality of life assessed before and after induction
      treatment (week 10).

      Patients above 18 years of age are eligible if they have histologically confirmed, clearly
      progressive metastatic renal carcinoma, more than one metastatic organ and good performance
      status (Karnofsky score ≥80%), or one metastatic organ with Karnofsky score 80%, normal blood
      and liver functions with creatinine level <= 160 µmol/L.

      Eligible patients will be randomly assigned in a two-by-two factorial design to either
      medroxyprogesterone (MPA), subcutaneous IFN, subcutaneous IL2, or a combination of IFN and
      IL2. The planned sample size is 456 patients (114 in each of the four arms). MPA is given
      orally as 200 mg daily. IFN is given subcutaneously as 9 million IU three times a week. IL2
      is given subcutaneously on a four-week schedule: 9 million IU twice daily for five days
      followed by a two-day rest, then, on the following three weeks, 9 million IU twice daily for
      two days then 9 million IU once daily on the following three days; after a week of rest, an
      identical 4-week cycle is administered. IFN and IL2 combination is given using identical
      routes, schedules and doses except for a reduction of IFN dose to 6 million IU per injection.
