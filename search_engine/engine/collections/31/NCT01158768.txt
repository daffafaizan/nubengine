      experience with mistreats. Scores for each dominium were then compared to groups of patients
      previously defined.We employed statistic tests for two independent samples (Mann-Whitney).
      For all the tests we fixed in 0,05 or 5% the level of rejection of the null hypothesis. In
      order to characterize the study sample, patients were defined according to characteristics
      including anthropometric, climacteric and lifestyle features. Quantitative variables were
      described according to the average and the respective patter deviation, median and minimum
      and maximum values. Qualitative variables were described by simple percentages.
