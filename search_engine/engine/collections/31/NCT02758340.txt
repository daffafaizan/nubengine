      employed to initiate labor pains. Labor pains are more successful in culminating into vaginal
      delivery if the neck of womb that is the cervix is soft (ripe). This is usually achieved by
      ripening agents. They include drugs and devices that help soften the cervix. Misoprostol and
      foley's balloon catheter both are used to soften the cervix so that vaginal delivery is
      possible. Both work on different aspects of the softening of cervix.

      Misoprostol acts on shortening the cervix and making it more pliable Foley's balloon helps to
      open up the cervix that is it aids in dilating the cervical canal.
