      group - a total of 100 subjects. The first group was comprised of 50 individuals, who visited
      the otorhinolaryngologist at Lithuanian University of Health Sciences hospital, regarding
      dysphagia, and were diagnosed with LTH during endoscopy. The second group consisted of 50
      healthy individuals without dysphagia, who did not have enlarged lingual tonsils during
      assessment using videolaryngoscopy. All subjects filled out the questionnaires, composed of
      RSI (Reflux Symptom Index) and DSQ (Dysphagia Screening Questionnaire) questionnaires,
      validated and verified for use in Lithuania, together with a questionnaire created
      specifically for this research for gathering sociodemographic data.

      The LTH grade of all subjects was determined using DelGaudio and Friedman grading systems.
