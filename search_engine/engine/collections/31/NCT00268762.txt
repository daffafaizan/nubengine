      and who have an occluded middle cerebral artery documented on TCD, receive standard dose IV
      rt-PA and a bolus and 48 hour infusion of argatroban aimed at prolonging the aPTT 1.75 X
      baseline. Follow up CT scanning and TCD every 30 minutes for 2 hours and then daily will
      determine the incidence of hemorrhage, recanalization and reocclusion, and serial
      neurological exam will determine the clinical outcome. For patients without temporal windows,
      a baseline CT-Angiogram (CTA) demonstrating arterial occlusion can also be enrolled. In those
      patients, a follow-up CTA (24-36 hours) will be performed.
