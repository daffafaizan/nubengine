      flow from splanchnic organs to working muscles. With prolonged duration and / or intensity,
      the splanchnic blood flow can be reduced by 80% or more. A severely reduced of splanchnic
      blood flow can frequently cause gastrointestinal ischemia. This ischemia associated with
      reduced vagal activity probably results in changes in motility and absorption.

      High symptoms are reported in 40% of runners with reflux and heartburn in 15-20% of runners.
      The low symptoms have an incidence of about 70% in the long runs type ultra-trail.

      Biological markers such as I-FABP have been shown to be useful in the diagnosis of mesenteric
      ischemia.
