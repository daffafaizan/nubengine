      concurrent chemoradiotherapy in patients with resected gastric cancer.But 33 percent of those
      in the chemoradiotherapy group had distant relapses. Docetaxel plus cisplatin regimen as
      adjuvant chemotherapy for gastric cancer has been proofed Safe and Effective in many clinical
      trials about gastric cancer. The purpose of this study is to evaluate efficacy and safety of
      docetaxel plus cisplatin regimen as adjuvant chemotherapy and concurrent chemoradiotherapy
      regimen compared with classical FOLFOX6 regimen as adjuvant chemotherapy and 5-FU/CF as
      chemoradiotherapy in patients of locally advanced gastric cancer after D2 radical surgery.
      The investigators hope the new interventions can reduce the rate of distant metastasis and
      have more clinical benefit.
