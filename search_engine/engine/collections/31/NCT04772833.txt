      COVID-19 disease, that will allow us to improve the design of clinical and therapeutic
      strategies against the disease. This is the tool to improve the prognosis of patients with
      COVID-19.

      The performance of systematic and regulated autopsies can help to manage it. However, despite
      the need to generate this knowledge and the strong impact on mortality caused by the COVID-19
      pandemic, the evidence from post-mortem studies is very limited.
