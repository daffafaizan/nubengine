    
      This is a Phase 2a/b randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to investigate the
      efficacy, safety, tolerability, PK and immunogenicity of Vixarelimab administered
      subcutaneously (SC) in subjects with prurigo nodularis experiencing pruritus.

      Phase 2a portion (completed):

      Forty-nine subjects with moderate to severe PN experiencing moderate to severe pruritus were
      treated in the Phase 2a portion of the study. At Baseline, subjects were randomized 1:1 to
      receive double-blind Vixarelimab or placebo: Vixarelimab 720 mg loading dose followed by 360
      mg every week; Placebo loading dose followed by placebo every week. The treatment Period was
      8 weeks or 16 weeks (treatment duration was reduced from 16 weeks to 8 weeks in a protocol
      amendment [Protocol Version 3]).

      Phase 2b portion (enrolling):

      The Phase 2b study (Figure 1) will consist of a 4-week Screening Period and a 16-week
      Double-Blind Period, followed by a 36-week Open-Label-Extension (OLE) Period. Approximately
      180 subjects with moderate to severe PN, experiencing severe pruritus, will be randomized (at
      1:1:1:1 ratio) into one of 4 arms (3 active arms and one placebo arm). A total of 4 doses of
      study drug will be administered during the Double-Blind Period to measure the efficacy,
      safety, and PK of Vixarelimab. After the Double-Blind Period, all subjects will have the
      option to receive Vixarelimab during the OLE Period to evaluate the long-term safety and PK.
