      subcutaneous tumor on the head, neck, or upper extremities. The clinical diagnosis is often
      made by the firm, sometimes rock hard texture of the skin. The diagnosis can be confirmed by
      a skin biopsy and/or excision of the lesion. We have recently noted that pilomatricomas
      appear as a black mass in the skin when the lesion is transilluminated by placing the light
      of a fiberoptic otoscope adjacent to the skin lesion. We would like to confirm our impression
      by a prospective study using transillumination to examine subcutaneous tumors in the skin.
      Pilomatricoma is also known as a benign calcifying or calcified epithelioma, pilomatrixoma,
      or a calcifying epithelioma of Malherbe.
