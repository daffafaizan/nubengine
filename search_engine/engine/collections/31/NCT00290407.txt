    
      Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most common form of leukemia in adults. CLL is a
      cancer of the B-lymphocytes, which make antibodies that help protect the body against harmful
      foreign substances, such as bacteria and viruses. Similar to CLL, small lymphocytic lymphoma
      (SLL) is a less-common cancer of the B-lymphocytes. In SLL, the abnormal lymphocytes mainly
      affect the lymph nodes; in CLL, the abnormal lymphocytes mainly affect the blood and bone
      marrow.

      Current drug therapies for CLL/SLL are known to increase the severity of pre-existing low
      blood cell counts, which in turn increase the risk of infections in patients. Research to
      improve the safety and effectiveness of CLL/SLL therapy is currently ongoing. One such
      therapy being investigated is Rituximab.

      Rituximab is a type of drug known as a therapeutic antibody. Therapeutic antibodies are
      laboratory-created substances that attach onto a protein on the surface of a cell. After
      binding to the cell, the therapeutic antibody can block the growth of the tumor and/or
      trigger the body's immune system to attack the target, and can also sensitize a cancer cell
      to chemotherapy. Rituximab is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the
      treatment of CLL/SLL.

      Beta-Glucan (Imucell WGP) is an over-the-counter dietary supplement that enhances the body's
      immune system. ImucellTM WGP is extracted from food-grade baker's yeast, which is permitted
      for use in food by the FDA. Animal studies have shown that Imucell WGP helps trigger the
      white blood cells to destroy cancer cells. Other animal studies combining Rituximab with
      Imucell WGP have shown greater tumor regression and tumor-free survival.
