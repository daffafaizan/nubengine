      (ventriculitis) will be eligible for the study. A total of twelve eligible patients will be
      included in the study. Eligible study subjects would be patients who have undergone VPS
      removal and placement of EVD tubing and are being treated with standard IV antibiotics for
      ventriculitis. CSF cultures are obtained before antibiotics treatment is initiated. Standard
      initial antibiotics regimen is usually IV ceftriaxone and vancomycin. The antibiotics regimen
      is subsequently adjusted based on the pathogen recovered from the CSF culture. Total IV
      antibiotic treatment is usually 14 days. Following clearance of the infection the patient
      undergoes new VPS insertion by neurosurgery service.
