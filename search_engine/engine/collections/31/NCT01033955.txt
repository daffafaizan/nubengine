    
      Primary Objective: The primary objective of the CHAT Pilot Trial is to assess our ability to
      recruit the desired patient population (i.e., the proportion of eligible patients enrolled in
      the trial), and to conduct a scientifically rigorous international RCT under pandemic
      circumstances.

      Secondary Objectives: To evaluate (i) adherence to the medication administration regimen.
      (ii) the ability for research staff to collect the required primary and secondary endpoints
      for the planned full CHAT trial, (iii) the number of study withdrawals due to administration
      of open-label statins and withdrawals of consent and (iv) the impact of the approved consent
      model on recruitment rates.

      Study Methods (Overview): Using a web-based randomization system patients, research
      coordinators will assign critically ill adults treated with antiviral medication for < or
      equal to 72 hours and requiring mechanical ventilation to one of two treatment strategies
      (rosuvastatin or placebo) for 14 days. Given the need to recruit patients into the CHAT Trial
      under pandemic conditions, when family members may not be present to provide written informed
      consent, we will request either a waiver of consent or deferred consent from Research Ethics
      Boards (REBs) at participating centres. The Keenan Research Centre/Li Ka Shing Knowledge
      Institute (St Michael's Hospital, Toronto, Ontario) will be the study Methods Centre.
