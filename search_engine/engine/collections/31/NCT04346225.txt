      prospectively determined by the Principal Investigator. Both cohorts will receive up to two
      13C pyruvate (C-1 and C-2 labeled 13C pyruvate) injections on the day of imaging (2nd
      injection is optional) and may choose to undergo optional MR- or CT- guided tumor biopsies at
      baseline and at the time of disease progression following completion of HP C-13 MRI at the
      corresponding time point. When receiving two HP 13C pyruvate injections, the injections will
      be separated by a period of 15-60 minutes.

      Participants in cohort A will undergo MR imaging with hyperpolarized 13C pyruvate of a
      pre-selected target lesion at a single time point. Participants in cohort B will undergo
      hyperpolarized 13C pyruvate MRI at baseline and 8 weeks (+/- 4 weeks) following initiation of
      a line of systemic therapy for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer and may undergo an
      additional optional MR scan at the time of disease progression as defined by the Prostate
      Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group 3 (PCWG3). The same sequence of injections will be used
      for all time points in cohort B.
