    
      This is a randomized controlled study of electronic quitline referral compared to standard
      practice. Parent enrollment in the quitline will be reported to the study team by the state
      tobacco quitline, managed by the Pennsylvania Department of Health.

      This is a single site study at one large outpatient pediatric practice. Eligible study
      participants are parents/caregivers (hereafter referred to as "parents"), 18 years of age or
      older, who are present for the child's healthcare (both well-child and acute) visit, who
      smoke, and who are interested in receiving treatment through the tobacco quitline.

      The intervention is electronic referral to the tobacco quitline for parent smokers. The
      referral process will be embedded in a tobacco treatment clinical decision support (CDS)
      tool, created to help pediatricians provide counseling and treatment to parent smokers. The
      primary outcome of interest is smoker enrollment in the quitline, defined as the proportion
      of parent smokers identified in the clinic that enroll in quitline treatment compared across
      the intervention (electronic referral) and control (standard practice) approaches. Secondary
      outcomes include patient and parent demographic and behavioral factors associated with
      successful enrollment.
