      One cohort will consist of two hundred newborns with no known conditions whose parents will
      be recruited during the mother's pregnancy. The second cohort will include two hundred
      infants and children up to the age of five years with diagnosed conditions including
      conditions detected through standard newborn screening such as phenylketonuria and other
      inborn errors of metabolism, hearing loss and other rare conditions that may fit criteria for
      newborn screening in the future.

      Parents will be introduced to the study by their clinician or a study recruiter. Those who
      agree to enroll in Phase I will review an online decision guide and be offered a study visit
      conducted by a genetic counselor to obtain informed consent for genomic sequencing of their
      child. Parents consenting to have their child's genome sequenced will be seen after the
      child's birth or at a convenient pre-arranged time and duplicate saliva samples will be
      collected from the children and one sample will be sent to the BioSpecimen Processing (BSP)
      Facility and to Dr. Jonathan Berg's laboratory for sequencing and the other sent to the
      Molecular Genetics Laboratory (MGL) for DNA extraction and storage until needed for clinical
      confirmation. Results will be returned for diagnostic (in the Diagnosed cohort) and medically
      actionable disorders of childhood (both cohorts). Two-thirds of parents who consent to
      sequencing will be randomly assigned to be eligible to request additional findings and use a
      supplement of the online decision aid. All results will be reported to parents by trained
      genetic professionals (genetic counselors and clinical geneticists)
