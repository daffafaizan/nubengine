      Primary

        -  To compare the amount of substance P in serum samples from patients with cancer treated
           with busulfan/cyclophosphamide or cyclophosphamide/total body irradiation conditioning
           regimens prior to undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

      Secondary

        -  To assess the changes in substance P over time to see if there is an optimal time shown
           by this physiologic correlate to discontinue substance P blockade after the chemotherapy
           regimen is completed in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Previously collected serum samples are analyzed by enzyme immunoassay for changes in
      substance P levels.

      Patients' medical records are reviewed for demographic information, past history, and course
      of treatment.
