    
      To reach the first remission, the patients receive one cycle of FLAG-IDA combination, that
      include: Fludarabine 30 mg/m 2 /d Days 1 to 4 in IV perfusion during 30 minutes; Cytarabine 2
      g/m 2/d, days 1 to 4 in IV perfusion during 4 hours glycosylate G-CSF 300 µg/m 2/d, days -1
      to 5 SC; lenograstim 263 µg/d f, days 11 until absolute neutrophil count >1x10 9 /L SC;
      Idarubicin 10 mg/m2/d, days 1 to 3 IV bolus (15 minutes)

      Patients who don't reach complete remission (CR) are considered as a failure and must go out
      of study.

      The participating centres should decide if the patients under 35 years in CR and with
      unrelated donor, are excluded to be treated with allogenic transplantation or they continue
      in the study.

      The patients who reach CR will receive one consolidation cycle with IDA-ARAC + G-CSF
      combination:

      Idarubicin 10 mg/m2/d, days 1 to 3 IV bolus (15 minutes); Cytarabine 200 mg/m 2/d days 1 to 5
      IV in 24 hours continuous perfusion; glycosylate G-CSF(lenograstim) 263 µg, days 12 until
      absolute neutrophil count >1x10 9 /L SC

      The patients younger than 65 years that is possible, will done an autologous transplantation
      with peripheral stem blood cells or combined with peripheral stem blood cells and bone marrow
      stem cells. The preparative regimen recommended are BuCy2 (busulfan-cyclophosphamide) and
      ICT-Cy (irradiation corporal total-cyclophosphamide).

      The patients older than 65 years will receive one intensification cycle with carboplatin and
      G-CSF.

      The peripheral blood stem cells collection should be done during the recuperation period
      after consolidation chemotherapy in patients under 65 years. The leucapheresis procedure
      could be determinate for in each center participating.

      The patients with no sufficient collection of stem cells during the regeneration period
      post-chemotherapy of consolidation, will receive glycosylate G-CSF (lenograstim,
      Granocyte®)10 µg/kg/d SC during 5 days, doing the collection cells on days 5 and 6. In the
      situations that the peripheral blood stem cells are non satisfactory, will realize a
      collection of bone marrow stem cells.

      The realization of Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation or combined, depends the number
      of cells obtained in the collection procedures.In the situations that didn't reach sufficient
      number of cells (peripheral blood and bone marrow), should be administered one chemotherapy
      intensification cycle.

      The preparative regimen is established by each participating center, but is recommended one
      of next:

        1. BuCy2 (busulfan 16 mg/kg follow by cyclophosphamide 120 mg/kg),

        2. Total-body irradiation 12 Gy and cyclophosphamide 120 mg/kg.

      Intensification treatment:

      Patients older than 65 years and younger than 65 who the collection cells for transplantation
      is not enough, will receive one cycle of intensification chemotherapy with carboplatin and
      glycosylate G-CSF:

      Carboplatin 300 mg/m2/d days 1 to 4 IV in 24 hours continuous perfusion glycosylate G-CSF
      (lenograstim)263 µg f days 11 until absolute neutrophil count >1x10 9 /L, SC
