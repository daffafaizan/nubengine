      I. To compare overall survival (OS) and recurrence free survival (RFS) as co-primary
      endpoints across the two arms.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate adverse events. II. To evaluate distant metastasis free survival (DMFS). III.
      To evaluate the impact of radiation on clinical outcomes (OS, RFS, DMFS).

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM A: Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment
      repeats every 21 days for up to 17 cycles in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients may also undergo standard of care radiation therapy within 14
      days of day 1, cycle 1.

      ARM B: Patients receive standard of care observation every 3 months for 1 year, and then
      every 6 months for 5 years. Patients may also undergo standard of care radiation therapy
      within 14 days of day 1, cycle 1.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for 5 years.
