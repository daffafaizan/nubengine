      study. Such studies have corroborated the MPL of healthy donor (HD) RBCs to be approximately
      115 days while RBCs from subjects with sickle cell disease (SCD) have a much more variable
      but consistently shorter MPL of approximately 32 days. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell
      transplant (HSCT) is utilized as a curative therapy for the treatment of severe SCD resulting
      in, among other pathophysiological advantages, restoration of a HD RBC phenotype. This study
      will evaluate the population methodology (biotin-labeled RBCs) to determine MPL in subjects
      with SCD compared to patients who have successfully undergone allogeneic BMT, subjects with
      sickle cell trait, and healthy donors without SCD. Data generated will be used to determine
      the utility of performing a population study of RBC lifespan in gene therapy treated patients
      to ultimately target the percentage of transferred globin gene needed to reverse SCD.
