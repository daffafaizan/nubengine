      suggest that people enrolled in Weight Watchers lose approximately 3-5 kg in 6 months of
      treatment. These outcomes are substantially lower than average weight losses achieved in 6
      months if university/hospital-based standard behavioral treatment (approximately 10 kg).
      However, standard behavioral weight loss programs are expensive and have limited
      accessibility to most people seeking weight loss. Therefore, the purpose of the current study
      is to investigate whether enhancing Weight Watchers by adding an 8-week group-based
      behavioral weight loss program prior to participation in Weight Watchers will improve weight
      loss outcomes at 6 months.

      Comparison: 6 months of Weight Watchers vs. combination treatment (2 months of standard
      behavioral weight loss treatment followed by 4 months of Weight Watchers) vs. 2 months of
      standard behavioral treatment.
