    
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, proof of concept trial
      to evaluate the efficacy of EPX-100 (clemizole hydrochloride) in children with Dravet
      Syndrome. The 20-week study begins with a 4-week Observational Phase which will establish
      seizure frequency and eligibility for treatment, followed by a 4-week Titration Phase to
      identify the maximum tolerated dose in each patient. Thereafter, the patient will enter into
      a 12-week Maintenance Phase. A battery of chemistries, hematology, urinalysis,
      pharmacokinetics, and ECG's will be monitored throughout the 20-week study. The patient will
      have the opportunity to enter a 52-week Open-Label Extension phase at the end of the
      Maintenance Phase. The primary endpoint is the percent change in the 28-day seizure frequency
      in the final 4-weeks of the 12-week Maintenance Phase relative to the 4-week Observational
      Phase in the modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population between active and placebo (3:1)
      therapy.
