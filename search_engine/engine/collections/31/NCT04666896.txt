    
      The main purpose of this study was to evaluate the value of two telerehabilitation exercise
      programs for treating multidirectional shoulder instability (MDI) in patients diagnosed with
      the hypermobile type of The Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hEDS) or Hypermobility Spectrum Disorders
      (HSD). Patients were randomly assigned to either the control group (B: evidence-based
      tailored care) or the experimental group (A: evidence-based standard care). Both groups
      received a home-based exercise program of 24 weeks. The primary outcome measure was the
      Western Ontario Shoulder Index (WOSI). Secondary outcomes included the Disabilities of the
      Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH), Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia (TSK), Patient-Specific
      Functional Scale (PSFS), Global Rating of Change (GROC), and pain pressure thresholds (PPTs).
      Outcomes were assessed at baseline, after 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and at the end of the study (24
      weeks).
