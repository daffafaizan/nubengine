    
      The primary purpose of this study is to demonstrate that treatment with ABT-450/ritonavir
      (r)/ABT-267 and ABT-333 administered with or without ribavirin (RBV) has non-inferior
      efficacy compared to treatment with telaprevir and pegylated interferon alpha-2a (pegIFN) and
      RBV and to compare the safety of these regimens in treatment-naive hepatitis C virus (HCV)
      genotype (GT) 1a- and 1b-infected adults.
