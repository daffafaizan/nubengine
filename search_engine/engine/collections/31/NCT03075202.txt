    
      This is a prospective 3 month pilot study to observe cigarette use behavior among people with
      a schizophrenia spectrum disorder diagnosis who smoke conventional tobacco cigarettes, do not
      intend to reduce or quit smoking, and are invited to use an e-cigarette. The investigators
      are interested to know if e-cigarette use is associated with cigarette smoking displacement.
      Displacement is defined as switching from conventional tobacco cigarettes to e-cigarettes.
      The investigators will also monitor for physical and mental health, including blood pressure,
      weight, and scores from the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS) and the
      Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms (SAPS) as well as any reported adverse events
      participants' feel are attributed to e-cigarette use and participants' perceptions of the
      sensory experience associated with e-cigarette use.
