    
      Objective:

      This study is designed to test the safety and efficacy of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG)
      for the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) symptoms in children with PANDAS
      (pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorder associated with streptococcal infection).

      Study Population:

      Thirty-two male and female children with severe obsessive-compulsive symptoms related to a
      new onset or first recurrence of symptoms consistent with the PANDAS subtype of OCD.

      Design:

      his is a multi-site double-blind placebo-controlled trial. Potential subjects will be
      screened in person at NIMH, and there will be remote video corroboration by a team of
      collaborators at Yale University. Eligible subjects will be admitted to the 1NW pediatrics
      inpatient unit at the Clinical Center for further assessment, randomization, and study drug
      administration according to protocol. Subjects who fail to improve 6 weeks after blinded
      IVIG/placebo administration (1.0 gm/kg/day of IVIG on two consecutive days; total dose 2.0
      gm/kg) will be eligible to receive open-label IVIG.

      Outcome Measures:

        -  Primary: Improvement in obsessions, compulsions, and other neuropsychiatric symptoms.

        -  Exploratory:

             -  Reduction of titers of cross-reactive antibodies (Abs)

             -  Resolution of basal ganglia inflammation (as measured by pre-/post-changes in MRI
                volumetric scans and inflammatory sequences)

             -  Normalization of selected serum and CSF cytokines
