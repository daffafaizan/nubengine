      quadriceps versus diaphragm subjects on mechanical ventilation (MV). Subjects in MV will be
      included, divided into 3 groups: (a) Control Group (CG), (b) Stimulation of Quadriceps
      (Quadriceps Group - QG), (c) Stimulation of Diaphragm (Diaphragm Group - DG). The QG and DG
      patients will receive consecutive daily electrical stimulation sessions at specific points
      from the first day of randomization until ICU discharge. Respiratory and peripheral muscle
      strength, MV time, length of hospitalization and functional independence score (the
      Functional Status Score-ICU) will be recorded.
