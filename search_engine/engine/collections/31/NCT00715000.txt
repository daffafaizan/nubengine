      enteral nutrition with milk must be complemented by an additional fluid supply, commonly
      administered intravenously. We propose to perform a prospective randomised multi-centric
      study comparing administration of a hypo-osmolar oral hydration solution with the classical
      hydration via IV (intravenous) infusion in premature infants of more than 30 weeks GA
      (gestational age).

      We define success as a weight loss inferior to 15 % of birth weight and a weight at day 15
      superior to birth weight. Failure was defined hence as a weight loss superior to 15% of birth
      weight or a weight at day 15 inferior to birth weight or a severe complication or death.
      Major violations of the protocol in the study group will be counted as failures. The other
      objectives were to determine whether oral hydration demonstrates practical advantages: less
      complications in initial management, more comfort for the baby and less technical challenges
      for the nurses/doctors in charge. Furthermore to evaluate the clinical tolerance of oral
      hydration from a nutritional point of view and to examine it's effects on intestinal function
      (defecation, gastric residues), signs of intestinal inflammation and GI flora.
