      The study will be conducted at 20-30 centers primarily in Europe. The study will be conducted
      at least in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, The Netherlands, and the Czech Republic. Study
      centers from Canada may also participate, depending on the timelines for regulatory approval
      and commercial release of the RevealÂ® XT in this region.

      It is expected that between 140 and 200 patients will be enrolled to ensure that at least 47
      patients are included to assess the first primary objective and at least 60 patients to
      assess the second primary objective.

      The primary objective is to quantify the AF detection performance of the device.

      The patient population will be assessed in two separate cohorts. The first primary objective
      is to quantify the 24-hour AF burden accuracy in patients with more than 1% AF burden.

      The second primary objective is to quantify the detection accuracy of non-arrhythmia in
      patients with 1% or less AF burden.
