      predict which patients are most likely to be helped by the study drugs, durvalumab and
      tremelimumab. This is done by starting at a dose lower than the one that does not cause side
      effects in animals. Participants are given durvalumab alone or durvalumab together with
      tremelimumab and are watched very closely to see what side effects they have and to make sure
      the side effects are not severe. If the side effects are not severe, then new participants
      will be given a higher dose of durvalumab together with tremelimumab. Participants joining
      this study later on will get higher doses of durvalumab together with tremelimumab than
      participants who join earlier. This will continue until a dose is found that causes severe
      but temporary side effects. Doses higher than that will not be given.

      The second purpose is to see if there are any differences in the side effects and the way
      durvalumab and tremelimumab are handled in your body when durvalumab is given together at the
      same time with tremelimumab compared to when durvalumab is given after tremelimumab. This is
      called dose level five.
