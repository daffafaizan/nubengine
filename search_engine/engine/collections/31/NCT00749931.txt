      effectiveness of the device in adjunctive use for locating the tissue for additional excision
      following primary specimen excision. One arm is a "Standard of Care" (SOC) Control group and
      the other arm a "Device+SOC" group.In the "Device +SOC" group the surgeon will use the
      MarginProbe device on the tissue specimen removed during the surgical procedure.The surgeon
      will use the results derived from the device and other routine assessments to decide if it is
      necessary to remove some additional breast tissue.
