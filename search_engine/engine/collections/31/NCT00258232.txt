      Primary

        -  Determine the objective response rate in patients with locally recurrent or metastatic
           colorectal cancer treated with celecoxib, capecitabine, and irinotecan.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the time to progression in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the time to treatment failure in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral celecoxib twice daily on days -7 to 21 during course 1 and on days 1-21
      in all subsequent courses. Patients also receive oral capecitabine twice daily on days 1-14
      and irinotecan IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8. Courses repeat every 21 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving a complete or
      partial response after 4 courses may temporarily discontinue treatment for no more than 4
      weeks.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 6 months for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 21-44 patients will be accrued for this study within 7-18
      months.
