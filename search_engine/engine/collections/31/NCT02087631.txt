      Multiple sclerosis causes episodes of inflammation that injure or kill nerve cells and the
      cells that coat them with myelin. These episodes of inflammation may cause a relapse (attack)
      or the inflammation may only be detectable with brain MRI. Inflammatory episodes are the main
      feature of relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). Most relapses can be prevented by current
      treatments for RRMS. This remains important because dead nerve cells cannot be replaced.

      Fortunately, there are also repair processes that can rescue injured nerve and myelin cells.
      An important aspect of repair is regeneration of the myelin forming cells. If the myelin can
      be protected or even replaced the nerves have a better chance of survival. However if injured
      myelin is not repaired or replaced the nerve cell is not protected and will likely later also
      die; this may be the underlying process that causes the progression. The investigators
      obviously need therapies in MS that do more than just reduce the frequency of relapses and
      the silent episodes of inflammation. The investigators need treatments that help repair.

      Quetiapine is a medication which has been shown to stimulate the myelin forming cells (called
      oligodendrocytes) to improve myelin repair in mice. It therefore may also improve myelin
      repair in people with MS. However, before testing the effects of quetiapine on myelin repair,
      the investigators must first determine if the medication is safe and if the dose is tolerated
      in people with MS in short-term treatment trials.

      Quetiapine is currently approved in Canada to treat several psychiatric conditions including
      depression and psychosis. It has also been shown to be useful to treat anxiety and insomnia.
      Quetiapine is available as an extended release pill that can be taken once daily. Doses up to
      800 mg per day may be used to treat some of these conditions but the investigators estimate
      that a dose of only 300 mg daily will be needed to stimulate myelin repair. It is not clear
      if the dose of 300 mg will be well tolerated by people with MS who may not need a medication
      to treat these conditions.

      Visit schedule:

      Screen period, baseline, week 1 [telephone], week 2 [telephone], week 3 [telephone], week 4,
      and week 8. Treatment with quetiapine XR will last for 4 weeks or until day 28. On day 29,
      the dose of quetiapine will be tapered by 50 mg every two days to avoid development of
      withdrawal syndrome and insomnia.

      Measures:

        1. Determination of dose-limiting toxicity Dose-limiting toxicity for any patient in this
           study is defined as early discontinuation of quetiapine XR due to an AE that is
           possibly, probably or definitely due to use of study drug. Patients who discontinue
           medication due to an AE will still be kept in the trial for safety assessment at weeks 4
           and 8. Because of the small number of treated participants anyone who discontinues study
           drug for a reason or adverse event unrelated to use of the study drug will be excluded
           from the analysis and replaced. The dose-limiting toxicity will be determined for each
           group of patients: RRMS and progressive MS. The maximally tolerated dose and dose
           escalation schedule for future trials is the dose where fewer than 33% of participants
           reached dose-limiting toxicity. This will differ for each group of patients, RRMS and
           progressive MS.
