        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of exatecan mesylate (DX-8951f) with and without
           filgrastim (G-CSF) in pediatric patients with advanced solid tumors or lymphomas.

        -  Determine the toxic effects, including dose-limiting toxicity, of exatecan mesylate in
           these patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of exatecan mesylate in these patients.

        -  Determine the recommended dose of exatecan mesylate for phase II study.

        -  Determine the antitumor activity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of exatecan mesylate (DX-8951f). Patients are
      stratified according to prior treatment (minimally treated vs heavily treated).

      Patients receive exatecan mesylate IV over 30 minutes daily for 5 days. Patients in dose
      levels 5 and above also receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously beginning on day 6 and
      continuing for at least 7 days or until blood counts recover. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 1-6 patients receive escalating doses of exatecan mesylate with and without G-CSF
      until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose
      preceding that at which at least 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 45 patients will be accrued for this study.
