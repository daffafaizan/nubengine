      administered after initial treatment received by a patient. Durvalumab has been tested in
      many different types of cancers. Durvalumab works by allowing the immune system to detect
      cancer and reactivate the immune response. This may help to slow down the growth of cancer or
      may cause cancer cells to die. It is unclear if the addition of durvalumab is beneficial in
      patients with bladder cancer who have completed surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy.
