    
      -  Because no one knows which of the study options is best, participant's will be
           randomized into one of the study groups. Participants with mild lymphedema will be
           randomized into either Group 1A or Group 1B. Participants with moderate lymphedema will
           be randomized into either Group 2A or Group 2B.

        -  All study participants will meet with a lymphedema physical therapist to review daily
           shoulder range of motion exercises to help minimize their arm swelling. They will be
           asked to record their range of motion exercises and activities in a study treatment
           journal. Participants will bring their journal to each study visit (every 4 weeks).

        -  Group 1A will only be required to meet with the lymphedema physical therapist as
           described above.

        -  Group 1B and Group 2A will be fitted with a compression sleeve at their first lymphedema
           physical therapy visit. They will wear the sleeve for a minimum of 12 hours per day.

        -  Group 2B will also be fitted with a compression sleeve at their first lymphedema
           physical therapy visit and will wear the sleeve for a minimum of 12 hours per day. They
           will also be instructed to wear a short-stretch compression bandage that goes from the
           top of the hand to the armpit. They will be asked to wear this compression bandage
           during the night. The overnight compression bandage should be worn for at least 5 nights
           out of the week.

        -  Participants will come to the clinic every 4 weeks. The following tests and procedures
           will be performed: height and weight measurements; review of any side effects; arm
           volume measurements for both arms; questionnaire.
