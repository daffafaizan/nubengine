      manually scored events on PSG. The PAP device was modified to produce a square wave voltage
      output identifying when apneas, hypopneas, and snoring events were detected. Recording this
      event signal on the PSG performed with the patient using the PAP device allowed an
      event-by-event comparison between manually scored PSG events and AED events. In addition, the
      AHI, AI, and HI derived from the manually scored PSG were compared with the respective
      measures reported by the PAP device used during the PSG.

      Study Objectives: Compare automatic event detection (AED) of respiratory events using a
      positive airway pressure (PAP) device with manual scoring of polysomnography (PSG) during PAP
      treatment of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).

      Design: Prospective PSGs of patients using a PAP device.

      Setting: Six academic and private sleep disorders centers.

      Interventions: A signal generated by the PAP device identifying the AED of respiratory events
      based on airflow was recorded during PSG.
