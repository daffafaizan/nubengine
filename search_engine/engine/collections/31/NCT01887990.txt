      we are studying the effect of a medication called ketamine to quickly treat suicidal thoughts
      and depression. Patients will be asked to participate in a research study to study how the
      use of a medication, ketamine, decreases your suicidal thoughts and improves their symptoms
      of depression. Ketamine is approved by FDA for use at higher doses in anesthesia, and recent
      clinical research suggests that it might benefit patients with major depressive disorder and
      suicidal thoughts. During clinical trials with over 10,000 patients, ketamine was proved to
      be safe as an anesthetic and studies with hundreds of patients with depression have
      demonstrated safety and lack of lasting side effects. This is a pilot study to test a new use
      of ketamine: treatment of suicidal thoughts. The study medication will be given in addition
      to usual psychiatric care.
