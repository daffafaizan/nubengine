    
      This is an active observational Cohort Study of malaria epidemiology with a nested two arm,
      randomized, open label Treatment Study comparing the efficacy, safety, tolerability and
      pharmacokinetics of a two versus three day course of Dihydroartemisinin-Piperaquine (DP) for
      those developing uncomplicated malaria. At the conclusion of the Cohort Study, a subset of
      volunteers with documented exposure to Plasmodium vivax during the study will be treated with
      primaquine as presumptive anti-relapse therapy directed against the exoerythrocytic malaria
      stages of P. vivax, and followed passively for an additional 6 months.
