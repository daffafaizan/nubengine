      function, of which unexplained cardiomyopathy was most worried by cardiologists. Since the
      etiology confirmation sometimes still lacks of effective tools, therefore it can not be
      treated against etiology and may gradually developing to systolic or diastolic heart failure.
      The development of heart failure can be in different speeds, varying degrees, inconsistent in
      reversibility, and distinct response to treatment of heart failure.

      In "real-world", ECG , cardiac ultrasound and myocardial enzymology can not be the whole to
      indicate the etiology of heart failure, so a strong clinical tool in the existing auxiliary
      examination is urgently needed and help to assess the risk of potential heart failure,
      therefore a reasonable treatment time window can be proposed.

      The investigators aimed to use CMR technique in helping diagnose the etiology of unknown
      cardiomyopathy. Try to make a risk stratification of susceptible heart failure based on the
      extent of myocardial impairment.
