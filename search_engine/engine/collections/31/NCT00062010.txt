        -  Determine the frequency and duration of response in patients with recurrent small cell
           lung cancer treated with interferon alfa, isotretinoin, and paclitaxel.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the duration of survival in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Correlate the levels of bcl-2 in peripheral blood monocytes with response and survival
           in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive interferon alfa subcutaneously and oral isotretinoin on days 1 and 2 and
      paclitaxel IV over 1 hour on day 2 of weeks 1-6. Courses repeat every 8 weeks in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 37-83 patients will be accrued for this study.
