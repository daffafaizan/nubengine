      by S/F ratio: SpO2/ FiO2, as well as prevent deterioration in physical function (frailty) and
      hyper-inflammation, other measures of oxygenation status (progression to supplemental oxygen
      requirement, assisted breathing/ ventilation), and progression from mild/ moderate to severe/
      critical proven SARS-CoV-2 infection in hospitalized patients and to evaluate the safety and
      tolerability of Fisetin in this patient population.
