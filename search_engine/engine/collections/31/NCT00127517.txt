      advanced cancers like loss of appetite, decreased strength, fatigue, and change in mood. A
      Phase II, double blind study comparing treatment with AVR118 to placebo, followed by an open
      label phase treating all patients with AVR118, will enable the Sponsor to gather data on
      safety and efficacy of AVR118 in this patient population. Patients aged 18-80 with advanced
      cancers (excluding central nervous system [CNS] cancers) who are not receiving chemotherapy,
      or who are receiving single agent, third line (or beyond) chemotherapy, may be eligible to
      participate.
