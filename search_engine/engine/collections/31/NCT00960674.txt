      described. A pilot study indicated an effect by tactile massage, a Swedish form of gentle
      massage given in sessions of around one hours and including treatment of the whole body in
      general, on metabolic control measured as HbA1c and on plasma corticosteroids.

      The present study aimed at studying the effects in a randomized controlled study, with
      patients provided with a relaxation cd available at pharmacies in Sweden. Power calculations
      found that 20-25 subjects in each group would be sufficient to show effect on HbA1c (0.8% vs
      0.3%), but that 45-50 subjects would be needed to show clinical relevant effect on quality of
      life.

      Patients aged 35-75 years with type 2 diabetes and BMI 25-30 and HbA1c 6-8%-units (Swedish
      standard, corresponding to 7-9%-units in DCCT standard) from primary health care centres in
      Stockholm County were invited to participate, and was randomly assigned to tactile massage or
      relaxation groups.

      Exclusion criteria was heart or renal failure, treatment with insulin, problems with Swedish
      language. Besides, only subjects of Swedish ethnicity were included in this first study, in
      order to refine results and avoid confusional results.

      Examination with laboratory tests, body examination and questionnaire, including SF-36 and
      questions on smoking, dietary and physical activity habits, was performed before
      intervention, after the 10 weeks examination and after yet another 12 weeks. Urine sampling
      on catecholamines and corticosteroids was performed, and blood tests on HbA1c, fasting
      glucose, insulin, CRP, cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-6), adiponectin, leptin, ghrelin.
