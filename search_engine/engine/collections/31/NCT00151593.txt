      survival. Graft viability is based on hypothermia, the organ being stored in a cold
      preservation solution.

      Celsior® has been shown effective for cold preservation of heart and lung and, in laboratory
      studies, for liver, kidney and pancreas. The aim of the study is to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of Celsior® in liver transplant preservation. Celsior® will be considered effective if
      the failure rate one year after transplantation is not significantly superior to 20% (rate
      observed in the European transplantation register between 1997 and 2001).
