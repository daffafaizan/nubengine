      patients with low socioeconomic status (SES). Yet, widespread use of CHWs has been hampered
      by lack of standardized, scalable and evidence-based models. Our community-academic-health
      system team used participatory action research with low-SES patients to design IMPaCT
      (Individualized Management for Patient-Centered Targets). A randomized controlled trial (RCT)
      of 446 hospitalized patients with varied diseases demonstrated that a 2-week dose of IMPaCT
      improved access to care, mental health, activation, and quality of communication, while
      reducing recurrent hospital readmissions. We have adapted IMPaCT for use among low-SES
      primary care patients with multiple chronic conditions.

      This RCT is designed to evaluate the newly adapted IMPaCT model in 3 primary care settings -
      academic, federally qualified health center, and VA. Upon enrollment in the trial, patients
      will collaboratively set a chronic disease management goal with their primary care provider.
      Patients will then be randomized to collaborative goal-setting versus goal-setting augmented
      by 6 months of support from an IMPaCT CHW. Follow-up will be conducted at 6- and 9- months
      post-enrollment.

      The study design is a single-blinded, 2- armed, multi-site randomized controlled trial
      involving three clinic sites and 444 patients.
