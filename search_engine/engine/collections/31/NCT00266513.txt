    
      This protocol is designed to study the genetics and pathophysiology of Hyper-IgM syndrome,
      NEMO associated immune deficiency, patients with related primary immune deficiency disorders,
      and the blood relatives of immunodeficient patients. Patients will undergo evaluations that
      include history/physical, blood sampling, genetic testing, and possible tissue sampling.
      Among the aims of this protocol are to better understand genetic factors that lead to defects
      in host defense, and to use modern and evolving methods in molecular and cellular biology to
      elucidate the pathogenesis of these diseases. A better understanding of primary
      immunodeficiency could allow for the rational development of novel therapies for such
      diseases and to benefit future patients, but it might not benefit current patients directly.
      Routine follow-up may occur every six months - with evaluation and blood sampling. Under some
      circumstances, we may provide treatment that relates to the immune deficiency. These
      treatments will follow standard medical practice.
