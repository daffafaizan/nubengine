      characterized by tissue infiltration by IgG4-positive plasma cells, tissue fibrosclerosis and
      elevated serum IgG4 concentration. The most important feature of IgG4-RD is chronic
      inflammation with multiple organ involvement. However, some organ involvements are difficult
      to find by ultrasound, CT or MRI.

      18F-FDG PET/CT is a sensitive imaging tool for inflammation. In this study, PET/CT were
      performed in patients with IgG4-RD both before and after glucocorticoid treatment by a single
      dose of 18F-FDG. Visual and semiquantitative method will be employed to assess the PET/CT
      images. The PET/CT image data will be used to establish a diagnostic model as well as
      assessment criteria for response evaluation of IgG4-RD treatments.
