      Mental illness has an estimated financial burden on the Danish economy of 3.4 % of Gross
      National Product every year due to lost productivity, social benefits and healthcare costs
      and approximately 50 % of people receiving long-term sickness benefits have a common mental
      illness. Furthermore, a significant treatment gap exists where less than 30% were treated for
      their mental illness.

      Objective:

      The primary objective of the randomized trial is to examine whether people on sick leave with
      a diagnosis of anxiety, depression, stress, personality disorders or functional disorders,
      return to work faster and have a higher job retention if they receive an integrated and
      optimized vocational rehabilitation and mental health care intervention, compared to people
      who receive the standard mental health care and vocational rehabilitation service.

      Method:

      The trial is designed as an randomized, two-group parallel, assessor-blinded, multisite
      trial. A total of 800 participants with a common mental illness will randomly be assigned
      into two groups 1) IBBIS II, consisting of an integrated mental health care and vocational
      rehabilitation; or 2) Service as usual, at two sites in Denmark. The primary outcome is
      difference between the two groups in time to return to work at 12 months.

      Results/discussion:

      This study will contribute with new knowledge on vocational recovery and integrated
      vocational and health care interventions in a Scandinavian context.
