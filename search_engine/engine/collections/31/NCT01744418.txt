      other natural extra-cellular matrix proteins. Upon implantation, it is anticipated (based on
      pre-clinical studies) that the collagen-based matrix comprising the graft will be infiltrated
      with host cells and re-modeled by the host. This will result in a vascular structure more
      similar to the histological composition of the native vascular tissue that may improve graft
      longevity and be less likely to become infected.
