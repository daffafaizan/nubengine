      cancer treatment, as well as some parents. Participants will be recruited from one centre,
      the Cambridge Teenage and Young Adult cancer Principal Treatment Centre. The three phases
      will involve a) participants being interviewed individually and attending a focus group, b)
      patients receiving the prototype co-designed intervention, and c) participants being
      interviewed after the intervention to provide feedback to allow further refinement of the
      intervention. The intervention will be delivered by an Allied Health Professional in the
      setting that participants have chosen. It is likely to involve, at a minimum, education about
      fatigue and support with increasing activity. It will not include administration of any
      medication.
