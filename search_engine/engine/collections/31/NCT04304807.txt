      intensive care units. All enrolled neonates were suffering from feeding intolerance in the
      form of abdominal distension, gastric residuals or bloody stools. The first group of forty
      five infants were given melatonin in addition to traditional antibiotic treatment. The second
      group of forty five infants were given traditional antibiotic treatment only. Both groups
      were followed up clinically as regards improvement of clinical signs of feeding intolerance
      and laboratory results till they reached full enteral intake. Both groups were compared as
      regards incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis and level of tumor necrosis factor-alpha after
      72 hours of starting treatment as a marker of oxidative stress.
