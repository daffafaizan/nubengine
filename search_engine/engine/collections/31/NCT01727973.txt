      by fibrosis. Surgery to correct eyelid swelling, proptosis, and diplopia is effective, but
      can not be done until the inflammatory phase has passed. To arrest the inflammatory phase,
      several types of immunosuppressive treatments have been investigated. Corticosteroids are the
      first-choice immunosuppressive treatment, but they often cause severe side-effects.

      Subantimicrobial dose doxycycline posses known anti-inflammatory effects that are separate
      from their antibacterial mode of action. This mode of action has lead to the routine use of
      subantimicrobial dose doxycycline for rosacea, periodontitis and multiple sclerosis.

      We propose to test the effect of subantimicrobial dose doxycycline for non-sight threatening,
      moderate-severe, inflammatory GO.
