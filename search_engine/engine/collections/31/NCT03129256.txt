      growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR-2). The anti-angiogenesis effect of apatinib has been proved
      in preclinical tests. Phase II study has showed an improvement of progression free survival
      in pretreated patients. S-1, an oral fluoropyrimidine has considerable effectiveness with
      mild side effect in patients failed to standard treatments. The purpose of this study is to
      evaluate the potential efficacy and safety of low-dose Apatinib combined with S-1 in heavily
      pretreated patients with advanced lung cancer. And to explore the biomarkers of
      antiangiogenesis therapy and the possible mechanisms of treatment resistance on the basis of
      next generation sequencing.
