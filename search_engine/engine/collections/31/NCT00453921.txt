      What is known: There are two interventions of promising efficacy in ameliorating deficits in
      attention and memory after mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI): (i) memory and attention
      training/rehabilitation, and (ii) catecholaminergic augmentation (particularly with
      methylphenidate - which augments both dopaminergic and adrenergic systems). fMRI and other
      functional imaging strategies are providing valuable insights into the underlying neural
      mechanisms of the cognitive enhancing effects of methylphenidate in some neuropsychiatric
      populations (individuals with ADHD), and the effects of cognitive rehabilitation efforts in
      some domains (e.g. speech and language in individuals after stroke).

      What is not known: To date there are no studies that apply a psychopharmacological strategy
      of augmenting neurotransmitter systems known to modulate memory/attention (dopaminergic and
      adrenergic systems) in combination with a cognitive rehabilitation intervention known to
      improve memory/attention (memory/attention training) in individuals with MTBI. We are aware
      of no published studies that use fMRI to assess the neural mechanisms of memory/attention
      improvement from the use of catecholaminergic agents or memory/attention training in
      individuals with MTBI. It is important to determine the efficacy of combined memory/attention
      training and methylphenidate. It is equally important to begin to understand the neural
      mechanisms underlying effective treatment as it may help to inform the development of the
      next generation of interventions and perhaps lead to individually tailored treatment
      interventions. This proposal will start to address these gaps in our knowledge.
