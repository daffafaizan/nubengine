      cerebral artery territory, and NIH Stroke Scale motor arm score 1-2 with recordable active
      motor thresholds (aMT) of the extensor carpi radialis (ECR) between 2-4 weeks after the
      stroke onset, are randomized into two groups to receive either iTBS1200 or sham stimulation
      over the ipsilesional M1 hand region for 10 daily sessions in 2 weeks. All have standardized
      medical and intensive rehabilitation treatments. The outcome measures included Action
      Research Arm test (ARAT), Fugl-Meyer test (FMT), aMT and motor evoked potentials (MEPs) of
      ECR.
