      glucuronide (C-gluc) and curcumin sulfate (C-SO4) metabolites. Traditionally bioavailability
      studies have performed an enzymatic hydrolysis pre-treatment of serum samples with both a
      glucuronidase and a sulfatase enzyme in order to produce free curcumin for analysis via HPLC.
      In subsequent years, standards have become available for the metabolites (C-gluc & C-SO4)
      that make it possible to determine these compound levels directly in serum samples using
      HPLC-MS-MS. Initial pilot work had indicated that enzymatic hydrolysis was producing falsely
      elevated results for bioavailability. We wanted to evaluate this in a more formal setting.
