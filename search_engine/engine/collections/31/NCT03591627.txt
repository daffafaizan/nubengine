    
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) and atrial flutter (AFI) increase the risk of thromboembolic events
      by promoting clot formation in the left atrium (LA). Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE)
      is routinely used to exclude the presence of an LA thrombus before AF/AFI ablation or
      cardioversion. So far, it has not been established what is the optimal combination of
      noninvasive parameters for thromboembolic risk stratification in this setting. The present
      study is aimed to compare the prevalence of LA thrombus in patients on different
      anticoagulant regimens, identify predictors of LA thrombus and validate the newly developed
      CHA2DS2-VASc-AF-GFR score (and to compare its predictive value in LA thrombus identification
      with those of the CHA2DS2-VASc and the CHADS2 scores).

      The study protocol all patients with AF or AFl in whom TEE will be performed (to assess their
      eligibility for cardioversion or ablation), hospitalized in a participating center during
      study period.
