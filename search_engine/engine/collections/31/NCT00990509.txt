      (or cytoprotective) agent for the treatment of acute primary supratentorial ICH. Albumin
      therapy has been shown to be cytoprotective in animal studies of both ischemic stroke and
      intracerebral hemorrhage, and in a phase II human study in ischemic stroke.

      To date no acute intervention (beyond supportive medical care) has been identified to improve
      outcomes in patients with primary ICH. Neuronal injury from a primary ICH is due not only to
      the space occupying effects of the hemorrhage but also due to the development of edema and
      toxicity from blood breakdown products in the subacute phase. Cytoprotective strategies
      targeted to limit blood brain barrier (BBB) breakdown and edema formation hold promise as
      treatment strategies to limit this injury.

      A number of MR imaging outcome markers demonstrating a potential neuroprotective effect
      include measures of hematoma volume, perihematomal edema, and blood brain barrier disruption.
      The term "hyperintense acute injury marker" (HARM) has been proposed to describe the
      radiologic finding of hyperintense signal within the cerebrospinal fluid spaces visualized on
      post-contrast fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) MRI in patients with acute ischemic
      stroke. HARM has the potential to serve as a marker of blood brain barrier disruption in
      patients with primary ICH. The current study will involve serial MR imaging in ICH patients
      randomized to placebo vs. albumin to assess whether there are differences in the frequency of
      HARM and perihematomal edema in the albumin treated patients.
