      manufacturers), will supply information which will allow to develop future devices. Some of
      these sensors will then be selected to integrate them.

      The tests will be made according to the therapeutic area of the concerned device(plan). There
      are 5 therapeutic areas:

      Cardiovascular (Cardioskin device), neurology ( Neuronaute device), urology ( Uronaute
      device), obstetrics ( Toconaute device), somnologie (Somnonaute device).

      One subject would likely test either one sensor of a device or multiple sensors, either an
      entire device.
