      mechanic joints, or have micro-processor-controlled damping. The prototype tested in this
      study is equipped with a motor that can actively move the knee joint. Therefore, movements
      like, for example, alternating stair climbing, are possible that cannot be realized with pure
      mechanical and actively damped prostheses. During level-ground walking, it is hypothesized
      that less compensatory movements are needed. We have developed an actuated prototypical
      prosthesis and new control strategies which should facilitate both level-ground walking and
      stair climbing. Parts of the control strategies have been tested in able-bodied subjects [1].
      This control strategy has been extended such that only biological stiffness modulation can be
      rendered [2].

      Hypothesis: Subjects can use our transfemoral prosthesis to walk on level-ground, to climb
      several steps and to overcome small obstacles without prior training. The user-cooperative
      control is intuitive and easily learnable.

      Objective of the study: This pilot study is meant to investigate the general feasibility of
      novel control strategies for actuated transfemoral prostheses. Parameters of a standard gait
      analysis, like ground reaction forces and kinematics (using a motion capture system), will be
      recorded. From this data, gait symmetry, step length, walking speed, and other measures can
      be calculated. The subjective impression of the user will be evaluated with a questionnaire.
