      controlled trial with two arms.

      Intervention: Participants will perform an outdoor walking exercise program together with one
      strength exercise for 12 weeks. The intensity and frequency of the training will
      progressively increase. Participants are supposed to walk and perform strength training 5-7
      days/week.

      Methods: Clinical assessments, questionnaires and medical records used for documentation of
      age, sex, comorbidity, blood pressure, medications and previous education.

      Assessment of motor function, cognition, level of physical activity, food intake and
      perceived stress are performed at screening as baseline measurements. Walking capacity
      (primary outcome measure), mobility, handgrip strength, body composition and cardiovascular
      risk markers will be assessed at baseline and after 12 week of training. At one year after
      training health-related quality of life, another cardiovascular incidence and mortality will
      be evaluated.

      Power analysis is performed. The investigators will analyze the data using an intention-to
      -treat analysis. Participants should have participated in at least 50% of the training
      sessions
