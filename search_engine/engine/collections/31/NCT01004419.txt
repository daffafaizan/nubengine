      median survival of 8-12 months. Second-line therapy options include cytotoxic agents or
      molecularly-targeted agents such as erlotinib. Nevertheless, only 7-9% of patients will
      respond to standard second-line treatment. Treatment-related side effects from cytotoxic
      drugs and declining performance status in patients with progressing disease are significant
      issues in this patient population. Novel approaches with molecularly-targeted agents are
      clearly needed.

      The combination of vandetanib and fulvestrant addresses the potential to interfere with
      multiple interdependent growth-stimulatory pathways simultaneously. Recent work has revealed
      cross-talk between epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and estrogen receptor (ER)
      pathways. This clinical trial will evaluate the clinical interaction of the EGFR inhibitor,
      vandetanib, in combination with the ER down-regulator, fulvestrant.
