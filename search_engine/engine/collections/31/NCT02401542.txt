      multicenter, efficacy and safety study of vofatamab alone or in combination with docetaxel,
      or versus docetaxel in FGFR3 mutant/fusion subjects with Stage IV, locally advanced or
      metastatic UCC who have relapsed after, or are refractory to at least one prior line of
      chemotherapy. Vofatamab is a novel monoclonal antibody specific for fibroblast growth factor
      receptor 3 (FGFR3) that is being developed to target FGFR3-positive tumors.

      This study is divided into 3 phases: Phase 1b (Cohort 1), Phase 2 (Cohorts 2 and 3), and
      Phase 2b (Monotherapy Expansion Phase and Randomized Phase).
