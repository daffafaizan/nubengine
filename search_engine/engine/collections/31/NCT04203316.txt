    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety of treatment with enasidenib mesylate (enasidenib) administered at
      continuous daily oral dosing for a 28-day cycle up to 12 cycles in pediatric patients with
      IDH2-mutant relapsed/refractory (R/R)-acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

      II. To characterize the plasma pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of enasidenib in pediatric
      patients with IDH2-mutant R/R-AML.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To investigate the pharmacodynamic (PD) relationship of oncogenic metabolite
      2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) to enasidenib treatment in pediatric patients with IDH2-mutant
      R/R-AML.

      II. To describe the clinical activity of enasidenib in pediatric patients with IDH2-mutant
      R/R-AML.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive enasidenib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every
      28 days for up to 12 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, then periodically
      up to 1 year.
