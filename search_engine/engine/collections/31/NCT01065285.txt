      Patients responding to the inclusion criteria, will receive vaccine against seasonal
      influenza then, 3 weeks later, vaccine against H1N1 influenza. According to the results of
      ongoing trials a second injection of H1N1 vaccine has been scheduled 3 weeks later. At each
      consultation a blood sample will be taken to evaluate immunogenicity of vaccination. Two
      additional consultations have been scheduled: one month after the last vaccine administration
      and at 6 month, in order to evaluate the occurrence of late side effects.
