      approximately 15-20% of all coronary lesions considered for percutaneous intervention. If a
      side branch (SB) subtends significant myocardium, failure to preserve SB vessel patency can
      lead to complications such as myocardial infarction or persistent chest pain despite full
      patency of the main branch.

      Bifurcation lesions are inherently complex and interventional treatment remains a challenging
      problem for physicians.

      The optimal technique for stenting bifurcated lesions is still unknown. Several dual vessel
      stenting techniques have been described in the literature, such as "T", "V", "Y", "Culotte"
      and "Crush" procedures. However, most studies of bifurcation stenting have found that optimal
      long-term results are obtained by stenting the main vessel and then performing plain balloon
      angioplasty of the side branch ("kissing balloon"-technique). Nevertheless, occlusion or
      reduced flow of the SB are frequent after stenting of the MB. Therefore, the SB is stented in
      approximately 50% of procedures even if PTCA alone was intended.

      Hypothesis:

      Compared with plain dilatation of side branch, the placement of Cypher-Stent in side branch
      using modified T-stenting technique will reduce "in-segment percent diameter stenosis" of the
      side branch at 9 months post procedure as measured by quantitative coronary angiography.
