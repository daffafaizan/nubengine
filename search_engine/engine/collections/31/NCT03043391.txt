      the enhancing portion of the tumor. The population group are patients with recurrent WHO
      grade III or IV malignant glioma who are aged 12 through 21 years old. After a single dose of
      PVSRIPO, subjects will return for periodic visits to monitor tumor status, adverse events,
      and changes in blood immune profiles. A maximum of 12 pediatric patients will be treated with
      PVSRIPO, and then carefully monitored for safety for at least a year after treatment.
