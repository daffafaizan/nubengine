      numerical measurements of pupil changes as an alternative to qualitative- or observation
      based- testing can be done to assess optic nerve dysfunction in ON, MS with ON, and NMOSD
      with ON. One way this is done is through evaluating relative afferent pupillary defect
      (RAPD), which is a clinical sign that is used to detect an injury or defect in the pupil's
      pathway and this often involves the retina of the eye, which focuses light, and the optic
      nerve, which sends visual information to your brain. When shining a light into each eye, the
      eye with RAPD shows a slowed response to light, and when the light moves to the normal eye,
      the pupil of RAPD eye will dilate. Observational evaluations of RAPD are very common in
      clinical neurology to detect these optic nerve diseases. As technology has advanced, to
      lessen the observation errors, numerical measurement of RAPD is now possible through a web
      based app called Reflex (Brightlamp Inc., Purdue University), which is a FDAapproved class I
      regulated medical device. In this study, we will compare the results of your app recording to
      other data that has been collected which also tracks optic nerve function status.
