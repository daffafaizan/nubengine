    
      This is a Phase 1, open-label, non-randomized, single and multiple dose escalation study
      designed to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy (prevention of, or treatment of
      relapse) of administering Mana 312 to subjects with AML/MDS after allogeneic HSCT. The study
      will evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary antitumor activity
      of single and multiple doses of Mana 312. Each cycle of administration of Mana 312 will be 28
      days.

      In the Escalation Cohorts, subjects with low, intermediate, and adverse/high risk of relapse
      will be enrolled using a modified 3+3 design. Upon completion of Cycle 1, subjects not
      experiencing dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) may continue receiving their assigned Mana 312 dose
      every 28 days for an additional 2 doses unless the subject experiences progressive disease
      (PD), exhausts their supply of Mana 312, experiences intolerable side effects, is removed by
      the Investigator, withdraws consent, or the study is terminated. After Cohort 1 has been
      completed (i.e., a decision has been made to proceed to Cohort 2), enrollment will be limited
      to subjects with high-risk of relapse AML/MDS (see Inclusion Criterion #4b) until the RP2D is
      determined).

      In the Expansion Cohort, only subjects with high risk of relapse AML/MDS will be enrolled
      using the RP2D of Mana 312. Subjects in the Expansion Cohort will receive Mana 312 at the
      time of relapse or at 1 year after HSCT, whichever is first. Subjects not experiencing
      dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) may continue receiving their assigned Mana 312 dose every 28
      days for an additional 2 doses unless the subject experiences progressive disease (PD),
      exhausts their supply of Mana 312, experiences intolerable side effects, or the study is
      terminated.
