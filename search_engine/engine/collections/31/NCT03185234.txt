      stroke, evidence-based therapies do not exist. This randomized controlled clinical trial
      (RCT) investigates whether anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) as an add-on
      therapy during neuro-rehabilitation can ameliorate apraxic deficits in patients with left
      hemisphere stroke. Therefore, anodal tDCS is applied over the parietal cortex of the left,
      lesioned hemisphere with an intensity of 2 mA for 10 minutes at a time on 5 consecutive days
      in combination with motor tasks before and after the stimulation. The effect of the
      stimulation is compared to a sham stimulation. Moreover, application of a pre-programmed
      study mode ensures a double-blind study design (patient and investigator). The performance in
      the apraxia test KAS (Cologne Apraxia Screening) 3-4 days after the last stimulation,
      compared to baseline, serves as primary endpoint of the study. Secondary endpoints are
      evaluated using various apraxia tests, motor tests and neuropsychological tests 3-4 days
      after the last stimulation and 3 months after enrollment.
