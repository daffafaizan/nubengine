    
      Subjects and recruitment 15 consecutive patients with histologically confirmed non-small cell
      lung cancer and bone metastases of the thoracic or lumbar segments of the vertebral column
      will be screened for this trial in the Radiooncology Department of the Heidelberg University
      Clinic. Inclusion criteria are an age of 18 to 80 years, acute neurological symptom caused by
      metastatic spinal cord compression, no radiotherapy in this spinal area before, and written
      consent to participate.

      Design and procedures This is a prospective, controlled, explorative trial to investigate the
      neurological outcome after emergency radiotherapy in metastatic spinal cord compression of
      non-small cell lung cancer patients with acute neurological deficit. RT start within 12 hours
      after onset of neurological symptoms. The target parameters will be measured at the start of
      radiotherapy (t0), and six weeks after radiotherapy (RT) (t1). The target parameters comprise
      the documentation and completion of the ASIA Impairment Scale (AIS), and the recording of
      patient-specific data.
