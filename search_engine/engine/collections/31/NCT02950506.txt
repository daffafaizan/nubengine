      suffer not only from recurring seizures, but also from cognitive deficits despite adequate
      treatment control. Cognitive remediation therapy (CRT) is a therapeutic intervention that has
      recently shown promise in improving cognitive impairment in many neuropsychological
      disorders. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive method that
      modulates cortical excitability. It works by applying weak electrical currents to the scalp
      that induce acute modifications of neuronal membrane potentials, producing long-lasting
      changes in the bioelectric activity of underlying brain tissue. It is postulated that tDCS
      enhances benefit gained through cognitive remediation therapy. These interventions have yet
      to be combined with each other for the treatment of interictal dysfunction in patients with
      epilepsy. The goal of the study is to investigate whether the introduction of tDCS in
      addition to CRT is effective in the treatment of cognitive impairment in patients suffering
      from epilepsy.
