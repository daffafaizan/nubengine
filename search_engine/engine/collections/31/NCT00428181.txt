      intervention, brief intervention plus a booster and treatment as usual for adult patients
      with an alcohol related injury. The primary outcomes of interest in the proposed trial are
      injury recidivism, alcohol intake, and alcohol problems. Because brief alcohol interventions
      with injured patients are opportunistic in nature, the patient's motivation to change or
      stage of change likely influences their response to brief intervention as well as the need
      for additional intervention. Therefore, the primary hypothesis of the proposed research is
      that patients presenting for treatment of an alcohol related injury who are in the
      precontemplation or contemplation stages of change require brief intervention with booster
      while patients in the preparation or action stages of change benefit equally from brief
      intervention alone or brief intervention plus booster. That is, an interaction between the
      patient's stage of change (Precontemplation and Contemplation or Action) at enrollment and
      treatment type (Brief Intervention, Brief Intervention with Booster and Treatment as Usual)
      is hypothesized to influence treatment effect at follow up. In addition, the impact of
      intervention on the patient's motivation to change at follow up will be assessed.
