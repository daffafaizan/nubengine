      loss program (Pronokal method), which includes lifestyle and behavioural modification
      support. This method is based on high-biological-value protein preparations which contained
      15 g protein, 4 g carbohydrates, 3 g fat and 50 mg docosahexaenoic acid, and provided 90-110
      kcal. The study was divided in two phases. The first phase consists of a very-low-calorie
      ketogenic diet (600-800 kcal/day), low in carbohydrates and lipids. Throughout this ketogenic
      phase, supplements of vitamins and minerals such as K, Na, Mg, Ca and omega-3 fatty acids
      were provided. In this study the ketogenic step was maintained for 2 months. Then, the
      patients started a low-calorie diet (800-1500 kcal/day) which lasted two months.

      During the first phase consisting of a very-low-calorie ketogenic diet, subjects were
      randomly divided into two groups, the treatment group who received synbiotic supplementation
      as capsules, a complex of B. lactis, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, B. longum ES1 and prebiotics
      fiber (synbiotic 1) and the control group who received a placebo. During the second phase
      consisting of a low-calorie diet, the treatment group received synbiotic supplementation as
      capsules consisting of B. animalis subsp. lactis and prebiotics fiber (synbiotic 2)
      (synbiotic1 + synbiotic 2 group), while the control group was divided into two groups: one
      continued receiving a placebo (control group) whilst the other group received synbiotic 2
      (placebo + synbiotic2 group).
