      used to treat diabetes) or a placebo. Changes to the body's response to insulin in the liver
      and in peripheral tissues (eg, muscle and fat) will be measured using a procedure called a
      pancreatic clamp. During the clamp procedure, glucose (a sugar) and insulin are infused with
      an intravenous catheter, and blood samples are collected periodically throughout the
      procedure to measure blood sugar levels and the levels of several hormones that are found in
      the body and are related to glucose metabolism. Small amounts of muscle and fat tissue will
      also be taken during this study to measure changes in gene expression after taking the
      medication/placebo for 3 weeks.
