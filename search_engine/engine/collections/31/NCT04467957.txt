      Children's Hospital.

      Patients will be assessed before and approximately 6 months after the clinical initiation of
      triple-combination modulator therapy with the following imaging to demonstrate aim 1, that
      pulmonary perfusion is regionally altered in CF patients in association with the status and
      progression of lung ventilatory function: Ultra-short echo time (UTE) protocol to obtain
      structural lung imaging primarily for anatomic reference, Hyperpolarized Xenon gas inhalation
      protocol to measure regional lung ventilation and arterial spin labeling protocol to measure
      regional lung perfusion.

      To demonstrate aim 2, that different profiles of serum proteomic markers related to
      angiogenesis and vascular remodeling, characterize states of pulmonary hyperfusion and
      hypoperfusion, blood sample data analysis from a separate study conducted at Cincinnati
      Children's Hospital Medical Center will also be obtained before and 6 months after initiation
      of triple-combination modulator therapy.

      Safety will be assessed by recording adverse events. Vital signs (heart rate, SPO2) will be
      recorded before, immediately following inhalation, and 2 minutes after each Xenon gas
      inhalation; O2 saturation will be monitored continuously throughout the Xenon portion of the
      MRI, and the time and duration of nadir will be recorded.

      The overarching goal of this study is to demonstrate that arterial spin labeling MRI lung
      perfusion can be used to measure regional manifestations of pulmonary vascular disease in CF
      that precedes and contributes to global and local decline in ventilatory lung function.
