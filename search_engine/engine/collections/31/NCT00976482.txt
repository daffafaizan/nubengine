      mortality in a general population implanted with a PM according to current clinical practice.
      Additionally, the study aims to stratify the outcome by both known patient-related risk
      factors and by physiologic pacing mode setting (a specifically defined PM programming).
      Stratification will be done for pre-specified classes of patients on the basis of their
      primary rhythm disease.
