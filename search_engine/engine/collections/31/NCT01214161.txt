      contraception used by approximately 8% of women in the developed world. In the United States,
      historically candidates for IUDs were monogamous, parous women. Recent research has shown
      that both copper and levonorgestrel IUD use is safe and effective in nulliparous women.
      Nulliparous and parous women can experience significant amounts of pain during IUD insertion.
      Concerns about insertional pain could be a barrier to IUD initiation women and their
      healthcare providers.

      This study will recruit women at either the Family Planning Clinic or the offices of Columbia
      University Family Planning Practice who desire the copper or levonorgestrel IUD for birth
      control. Women who consent to participating in the study will be randomized to two groups:
      one group will receive 2% lidocaine gel placed in the cervix prior to IUD placement and the
      other group will receive a placebo inert gel. The primary objective of this study is to
      compare the pain scores on a 10cm visual analogue scale in the two groups after tenaculum
      placement (placing an instrument on the cervix to stabilize it), uterine sounding (measuring
      of the uterus) and at speculum removal; these are standard procedures during IUD insertion.
      Secondary outcomes include provider assessment of the patient's pain, patient's level of
      satisfaction with the insertion, and whether any adverse events such as nausea/vomiting,
      fainting, or IUD insertion failure occurred.
