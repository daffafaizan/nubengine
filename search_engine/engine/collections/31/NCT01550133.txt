      responses of participants to nutritive and non-nutritive beverage and solid food forms will
      be determined. In phase 2, participants will consume a randomly allocated solid food or
      beverage (either nutritive or non-nutritive) consecutively for 2 weeks. In phase 3, (which
      will occur immediately after the end of Phase 2), participants will be retested for their
      cephalic phase responses to determine if there is an effect of learning on appetite hormone
      response.
