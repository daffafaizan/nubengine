      last treatment (ie, one retreatment is permitted at 1 month after the first injection) in the
      blinded phase of the study. At Month 6, the open phase of the study will begin and subjects
      on sham will be offered open-label treatment with NASHA/Dx.

      Subjects who receive NASHA/Dx at the start of the blinded phase will be followed for up to 36
      months from last treatment in the blinded phase. Subjects who receive sham at the start of
      the blinded phase and then receive open-label NASHA/Dx at Month 6 (start of the open phase)
      will be followed for another 24 months (equivalent to approximately 30 months from
      randomization) from last treatment in the open phase of the study.
