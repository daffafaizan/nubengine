      the eye has field defects. Before 1980, some type of filtering surgery, such as
      trabeculectomy, was the usual method of intervention. Since then, laser trabeculoplasty has
      become a popular alternative. Sometimes the first intervention chosen succeeds in controlling
      pressure for many years; at other times, the success lasts only a few weeks or months.
      Because success is limited, some patients, over time, need to undergo a sequence of surgical
      interventions. Little is known about which sequence gives the best long-range outcome.

      The Advanced Glaucoma Intervention Study (AGIS) is designed to provide a comprehensive
      assessment of the long-range outcomes of medical and surgical management in advanced
      glaucoma. The study uses visual function status to compare two intervention sequences in
      managing the disease.

      Eligible eyes are randomly assigned to one of two intervention sequences: (1) trabeculectomy,
      followed by argon laser trabeculoplasty (ALT) should trabeculectomy fail, followed by a
      second trabeculectomy should ALT fail; or (2) ALT, followed by trabeculectomy should ALT
      fail, followed by another trabeculectomy should the first trabeculectomy fail. Antifibrotic
      agents may be used as an adjunct to trabeculectomy, but only in eyes with a previous history
      of invasive surgery. Eyes that fail the entire assigned sequence of interventions are managed
      at the discretion of the AGIS physician in collaboration with the patient.

      Interventions are supplemented with medical treatment as needed. A total of 789 eyes with
      advanced glaucoma have been enrolled. All patients are being followed under a standardized
      protocol for a minimum of 5 years to determine degree of visual function loss, failure rates
      of interventions, rates of complications, and need for supplemental therapy.

      After the initial intervention, followup examinations are scheduled at 1 week, 4 weeks, 3
      months, 6 months, and every 6 months thereafter. After second and third interventions,
      followup examinations are scheduled at 1 and 4 weeks. Additional visits are scheduled as
      necessary for the management of the disease.

      The primary outcome variable in AGIS is average percent of eyes with decrease of vision,
      where decrease of vision is a substantial decline of either visual field or visual acuity
      attributable to the effect of glaucoma. Secondary outcome variables include sustained
      decrease of vision, failure of interventions, number of prescribed glaucoma medications, and
      level of intraocular pressure. An ancillary study is assessing filtering bleb encapsulation.
