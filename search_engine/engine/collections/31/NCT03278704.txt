      York, USA). All data will be checked for normality and appropriate log transformations
      applied prior to analysis of variance (ANOVA) for primary and secondary outcomes. Satellite
      cell content will be compared using a two-way, mixed-model ANOVA with one within (2 levels;
      pre- and post-training) and one between factor (2 level; exercise group) with significance
      set at P < 0.05.

      Based on a mixed ANOVA with between- and within-participant factors, and previously published
      data (Babcock et al. 2012), a sample size of 24 participants (12 per group) will provide a
      power of 84%. This sample size will allow detection of a mean change in satellite cell
      content of 2.35, assuming standard deviations of the change from pre- to post-training as
      2.266 and 1.331 in the two exercise groups. Sample size calculation was performed with an
      alpha error of 0.05. SamplePower 2.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois, USA) software was used to
      determine sample size.

      This study will combine data collected at the University of Birmingham with previously
      collected data from an identical study design performed by a co-investigator (Dr Pugh) in
      Rome, Italy. The previous study has collected data from 10 participants across both exercise
      groups (RE, N = 7; RE + HIIT, N = 3). Therefore, it is necessary for the present study to
      recruit a further 14 participants (RE, N = 5, RE + HIIT, N = 9) in order to achieve a sample
      size of 24 participants (12 per group). However, based on an assumption of a 25% drop-out
      rate, the total minimal sample necessary will be 19 participants (RE, N = 7; RE + HIIT, N =
      12).
