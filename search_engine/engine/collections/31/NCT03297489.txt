      I. To determine the feasibility of performing intravital microscopy on accessible human
      ovarian, primary peritoneal and fallopian tube cancers during their standard course of
      treatment (i.e., surgical debulking).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the blood flow velocity of the tumor vessels and tissue penetration of
      fluorescein as a marker of tumor vessel permeability.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive fluorescein sodium injection intravenously (IV). Patients also undergo
      observation of primary and metastatic tumors via microscopy over 15-20 minutes during the
      course of standard of care surgery.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up for 30 days, at 1-3 weeks, and then up to
      2 years.
