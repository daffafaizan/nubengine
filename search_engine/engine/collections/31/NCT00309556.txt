    
      This study is a prospective, randomized, multicentre, phase III trial in the neoadjuvant
      treatment of patients with primary breast cancer and no distant metastases. Patients will be
      stratified at inclusion according to the centre, to the clinical tumour stage (T1, T2, T3,
      T4a-c), the axillary lymph node status (positive, negative), the menopausal status
      (pre-menopausal, post-menopausal), histology (invasive ductal, invasive lobular, mixed), the
      hormone-receptor status (positive [ER+/PR+, ER+/PR-, ER-/PR+], negative [ER-/PR-], not
      determinable]), the HER-2 status (positive, negative, not determinable), the grading (G1/G2,
      G3, not determinable) and will be randomly assigned to receive either 6 cycles of neoadjuvant
      epirubicin, docetaxel and capecitabine ± trastuzumab in HER-2 positive disease or 6 cycles of
      neoadjuvant epirubicin and docetaxel ± trastuzumab in HER-2 positive disease.
