      years have shifted their focus to earlier diagnosis and especially to the transitional phase
      between normal aging and dementia, named Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI).Lately, the concept
      of MCI has been expanded to address observed clinical heterogeneity, and subtypes were
      recognized: amnestic (including memory impairment) and non-amnestic (including impairment in
      other non-memory cognitive domains), with the later including deficits in executive
      functioning Executive functions (EF) are defined as higher order functions that are needed
      for completing complex or non-routine tasks. Deficits in EF refer to a collection of deficits
      in attention, planning, problem-solving, multitasking, monitoring and behavioral control and
      persons who suffer from impairments in EF typically have difficulty in initiating or
      suspending activities, show impaired mental flexibility, as well as increased distractibility
      and have difficulty in learning novel tasks despite apparently intact cognitive abilities.

      Lately, an increasing amount of studies suggest that persons with MCI might have deficits in
      EF, moreover, persons presenting a combination of executive deficits and memory deficits were
      found to be a high risk group for conversion to AD.
