      3% of the general population), occurring at any age. The etiology is not found in nearly 75%
      of cases (chronic idiopathic urticaria). Chronic idiopathic urticaria may resolve over
      several months or years. The quality of life of patients is usually strongly spoiled. The
      gold standard treatment consist of anti-H1 molecules. In severe cases, which are refractory
      to anti-H1, few therapeutic alternatives exist. Two studies have shown a benefit when adding
      to anti-H1, montelukast, anti-leukotriene, or cyclosporine. Methotrexate, which is another
      immunosuppressive drug, cheap and commonly prescribed by dermatologists, has been efficient
      in severe chronic urticaria, in an open study and in few case reports.

      Methotrexate, an anti-metabolite drug which inhibits dihydrofolate reductase, is indicated in
      hematologic malignancies and in autoimmune diseases. It may be given by oral or parenteral
      administration, once a week, and requires regular monitoring of renal and hepatic function,
      and blood count.
