      patients with recurrent or metastatic gastroesophageal cancer (limited metastatic disease).
      Arm A explores the safety and efficacy of nivolumab alone, and Arm B explores the safety and
      efficacy of nivolumab plus Relatlimib. Patients with recurrent or metastatic esophagogastric
      cancer are eligible for this study which will enroll patients with limited disease burden and
      who are Programmed death-1(PD-1) therapy na√Øve. This will allow for us to assess if systemic
      ablative radiation (SBRT to multiple metastatic sites plus PD-1/ anti-LAG3) is able to
      enhance the effectiveness of nivolumab +/- anti-LAG3 or to overcome treatment resistance
      mechanisms. Patients will be treated with targeted high dose radiation (SBRT) to metastatic
      lesions as outlined below. One of the lesions which is considered the easiest to biopsy and
      not causing symptoms will not be radiated so as to obtain tissue for correlative analysis.
      This lesion will then be re-biopsied approx. 4 weeks after the completion of radiation to the
      other metastatic sites. If a lesion is causing pain or other symptoms this site will not be
      chosen as the biopsiable site. The chosen metastatic lesion can then be irradiated at a later
      date if we do not see disease response in that region. Approximately 30 patients will be
      enrolled on study with 15 enrolled on Arm A, and 15 enrolled on Arm B.
