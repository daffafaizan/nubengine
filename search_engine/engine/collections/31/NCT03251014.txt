      8-week washout period. A total of 50 healthy overweight adults were recruited among staff and
      students in UPM. All the subjects were randomized into two groups. Each group was served with
      either cooked YSS (~265 g/ day) or salmon (~246 g/day) thrice per week. Blood and urine
      samples were collected for laboratory assessment.
