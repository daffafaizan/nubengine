      weeks (FETO group) or 2. Postnatal therapy only (Control)

      Main outcome: Survival rate in both groups Second outcomes: Postnatal diagnosis of severe
      pulmonary arterial hypertension, percentage of newborns in each group that will have clinical
      conditions for neonatal surgical repair of the diaphragmatic defect, fetal lung responses
      (increase of fetal lung size), maternal and obstetrical complications (prematurity, preterm
      rupture of the membranes, maternal hemorrhage and infection).
