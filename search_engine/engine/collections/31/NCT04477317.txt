      efficacy of 4% Articaine versus 2% Mepivacaine in pain management during extraction of badly
      decayed upper first primary molars. Thus, the purpose of the present study was to fill this
      knowledge gap.

      This trial will be held on a new brand of 4% articaine made in Egypt called Alexadricaine
      anesthetic solution where no clinical trials have been conducted on it yet in literature.
