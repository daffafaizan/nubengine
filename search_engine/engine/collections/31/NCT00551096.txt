      which targets the tyrosine kinase of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor 2 and
      epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in combination with cytotoxic agents: gemcitabine and
      capecitabine. The rationale is based on observations that there is an additive / synergistic
      effect when cytotoxic agents are combined with angiogenesis inhibitors. There is also
      evidence that EGFR mediated signaling pathways are potent stimulators of VEGF production.
      Also the concept of dual targeting of tumor and endothelial cells may provide more
      encouraging results.
