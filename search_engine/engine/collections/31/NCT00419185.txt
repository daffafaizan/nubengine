      anatomical and functional outcome in macular hole surgery has been reported. Controversies,
      however, exist regarding the application and possible toxicity of dyes, facilitating the
      surgical procedure. Since dyes were introduced for ILM peeling several authors reported on
      the use of indocyanine green and trypan blue (TB) for membrane peeling or ILM removal. Recent
      experimental and clinical reports raise concern about the safety of ICG-assisted membrane
      peeling. Morphological and functional damage was described in an animal model, in human donor
      eyes, in cultured human pigment epithelial cells and in clinical studies using ICG in macular
      surgery. The intraocular tolerance of TB has been demonstrated in rabbit eyes and in retinal
      pigment epithelium cell viability studies. Higher concentrations of TB (0.6 or 4 mg/ml) lead
      to toxicity on cultured RPE cells, but the application of lower clinically relevant levels
      did not show any significant effect. A recent retrospective comparative analysis indicates
      that TB may be the safer dye. They found better anatomical and functional results than with
      the use of ICG.

      Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare the anatomical and functional outcome after
      dye-assisted peeling of the ILM in patients with idiopathic macular holes using ICG or TB in
      a prospective and randomized trial.
