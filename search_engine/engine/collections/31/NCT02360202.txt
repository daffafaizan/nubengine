      introduction of clobetasol propionate treatment from 10 g/day dosage to 40 g / day in
      patients with bullous pemphigoid. Bio-impedance is a noninvasive device for measuring with an
      electric current of low intensity the different volumes of the human body. A preliminary
      experiment of impedance measurements in some patients with bullous pemphigoid (examination
      requested as part of a nutritional assessment) showed that these patients had mostly a total
      water loss without dehydration, corresponding to a significant undernutrition during 1 month
      of treatment, possibly related to muscle wasting and protein loss by skin erosions without
      obvious argument for fluid retention, justifying reproduce these measures on a larger number
      of patients and the other to accurately assess the evolution of nutritional parameters during
      the first month of treatment.
