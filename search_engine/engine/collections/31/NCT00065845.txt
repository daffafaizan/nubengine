      Women with advanced pelvic organ prolapse may experience stress urinary incontinence
      following surgery to repair the prolapse. Development of incontinence is unpredictable. This
      study will determine which, if any, clinical tests are useful for predicting post-operative
      urinary incontinence. The study will also determine if a Burch urethropexy should be
      performed routinely or selectively at the time of sacrocolpopexy in continent women.

      Women with pelvic organ prolapse who are scheduled for prolapse repair will be randomized to
      a Burch urethropexy group or to a control group. Women in the Burch group will undergo
      urethropexy at the time of prolapse repair. Assessments will include a quality of life
      telephone interview, urodynamic testing, and physical examination. Follow-up evaluations
      occur at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 1 and 2 years following surgery. Post-operative phone
      interviews will occur at 3 months, 6 months, and 1 and 2 years.
