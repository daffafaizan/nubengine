      elective knee and hip endoprosthesis in the orthopedic department of the University of
      Heidelberg. The blood is taken during the routine blood testes if possible, on admission and
      the days 1-4 following the operation. Usual baseline characteristics are taken as well as
      usual blood results (hb, cholesterol and so on). Primary endpoint is the detection of
      perioperative myocardial infarction and pulmonary embolism.
