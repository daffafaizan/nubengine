      cerebrovascular stroke. The circulating levels of albumin may be reduced in patients with
      stroke due to the presence of a systemic inflammatory state and to the inadequacy of
      protein-energy intake. In the patients admitted to the Montescano Neuromotor Rehabilitation
      Division, the prevalence of hypoalbuminemia is high at the time of admission and remains
      high, even if decreased, at discharge. The circulating levels of albumin have proven to be
      predictors of functional recovery in ischemic stroke and cerebral hemorrhage. In the present
      survey it is hypothesized that it is possible to significantly improve the values of
      hypoalbuminemia by supplementation with essential amino acids and that, in the second place,
      any increase in albumin may result in a strengthening of functional recovery in patients with
      a stroke.

      Several factors induce the use of free essential amino acids: they are the most efficient
      inducers of protein synthesis and albumin is a protein; free essential amino acids and not
      those contained in proteins allow a more reliable use of the isoleucine and tryptophan, true
      nutrients limiting the hepatic synthesis of albumin; the free essential amino acids have a
      faster and complete intestinal absorption of the essential amino acids derived from protein
      digestion.
