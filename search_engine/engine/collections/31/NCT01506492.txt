    
      We have developed and pilot-tested a brief manualized individual psychotherapy, called
      Managing Cancer and Living Meaningfully (CALM), to reduce distress in patients with various
      types of cancer, including metastatic disease. We propose to conduct a two-arm randomized
      controlled trial (RCT) to test the effectiveness of CALM against usual care (UC) for the
      reduction of distress in patients with various types of cancer, including metastatic disease.
      Usual care at our center includes routine screening for depression and other distress in
      oncology outpatient clinics, communication of screening information to the medical treatment
      team, and referral as needed for non-standardized, and primarily instrumental, psychosocial
      care and psychiatric assessment and treatment.

      The design will be an unblinded RCT consisting of two conditions (CALM and UC), with a
      baseline assessment and follow-ups at three and six months. The trial will take place in
      Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, a comprehensive cancer center in
      Toronto, Canada. Participants will be outpatients with various types of cancer, including
      metastatic disease.
