      nasal inhaler from a bag, open the sealed package, and inhale from the nasal inhaler 3 times,
      inhaling through the nose and exhaling through the mouth, just prior to entering the
      operating room. During recovery in the Post-operative acute care unit (PACU), nausea severity
      will be rated using a 0-3 scale where zero indicates no nausea.

      If your score is 1-3, participants will be instructed/assisted in using a nasal inhaler 3
      times, inhaling through the nose and exhaling through the mouth. After 5 minutes, nausea
      scores will be collected again and if the score is the same or higher, participants will be
      asked to use the nasal inhaler again in the same manner as before. If their nausea has not
      resolved after the second use, they will be give anti-nausea medication that a surgeon
      ordered. This process will be repeated again whenever you complain of nausea, until they are
      discharged from the hospital.
