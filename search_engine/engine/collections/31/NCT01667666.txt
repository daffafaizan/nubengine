      morbidity in critically ill patients, and a disease for which there is no effective
      pharmacologic therapy. Our group and others have focused on the anti-inflammatory effects of
      intravenous hypertonic saline (HTS) acting on the injured endothelium with promising results
      experimentally, but failed to confirm the benefit clinically. Recent work, however, has shown
      that inhaled or nebulized HTS targeted at the epithelium is safe and effective in treating
      cystic fibrosis, COPD, and neonatal bronchiolitis. Recognizing the central role of the
      pulmonary epithelium in ALI, nebulization has the advantage of achieving high concentrations
      of the therapy without producing systemic side effects. Thus, we hypothesize that nebulized
      hypertonic saline will attenuate acute lung injury following trauma.
