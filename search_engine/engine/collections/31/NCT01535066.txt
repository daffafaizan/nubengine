      Primary

        -  To determine whether true acupuncture administered twice weekly for 6 weeks (8-12
           sessions) compared to sham acupuncture and waitlist control causes a significant
           reduction in joint pain related to aromatase inhibitors (AIs) in women with early-stage
           breast cancer as measured by the Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form (BPI-SF) worst pain
           score at 6 weeks.

      Secondary

        -  To investigate the effects of true acupuncture administered twice weekly for 6 weeks
           (8-12 sessions) followed by 6 weekly treatments (4-6 sessions) of maintenance (12-18
           sessions total over 12 weeks) compared to sham acupuncture and waitlist control in this
           study population; the evaluations at 12 and 24 weeks are to determine the benefit of
           additional 6 weekly acupuncture treatments for maintenance and to determine the
           durability of response after stopping acupuncture, respectively; the evaluation at 52
           weeks is to determine the long-term effects of acupuncture and adherence to AIs.

        -  To evaluate the effects of acupuncture on the BPI-SF worst pain, worst stiffness, pain
           severity, and pain-related interference scores at 6, 12, 16, 20, 24, and 52 weeks.

        -  To evaluate the effects of acupuncture on Western Ontario and McMaster Universities
           Osteoarthritis (WOMAC) index (pain, stiffness, and function) for the hips and knees at
           6, 12, 24, and 52 weeks.

        -  To evaluate the effects of acupuncture on Modified-Score for the Assessment and
           Quantification of Chronic Rheumatoid Affections of the Hands (M-SACRAH) (pain,
           stiffness, and function) at 6, 12, 24, and 52 weeks.

        -  To evaluate the effects of acupuncture on the PROMIS Pain Impact-Short Form (PROMIS
           PI-SF) at 6, 12, 24, and 52 weeks.

        -  To evaluate the effects of acupuncture on quality of life (QOL) as assessed by the
           Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Endocrine Subscales (FACT-ES) at 6, 12, 24, and
           52 weeks.

        -  To evaluate the effects of acupuncture on functional testing with grip strength and
           "Timed Get Up and Go" (TGUG) test at 6, 12, 24, and 52 weeks.

        -  To evaluate the effects of acupuncture on analgesic and opioid use at 2, 4, 6, 12, 16,
           20, 24, and 52 weeks.

        -  To evaluate the effects of acupuncture on self-reported AI adherence at 12, 24, and 52
           weeks.

        -  To assess AI adherence via urine AI metabolites at baseline, 24, and 52 weeks.

        -  To evaluate the effects of acupuncture on serum hormones (estradiol, FSH, LH) and
           inflammatory biomarkers (serum TNFα, IL-6, IL-12, CRP, and urine c-telopeptides of Type
           II collagen (CTX-II) at 6, 12, and 24 weeks. (Exploratory)

        -  To evaluate whether polymorphisms in CYP19A1 aromatase gene predict severity of
           AI-related joint symptoms. (Exploratory)

        -  To assess the safety and tolerability of acupuncture in this study population.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to study site.
      Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive acupuncture twice weekly for 6 weeks and then once weekly for 6
           weeks.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive sham acupuncture twice weekly for 6 weeks and then once weekly
           for 6 weeks.

        -  Arm III: Patients are assigned to a waiting list for 12 weeks. Patients complete the
           Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form (BPI-SF), the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities
           Osteoarthritis (WOMAC) Index, the Modified-Score for the Assessment and Quantification
           of Chronic Rheumatoid Affections of the Hands (M-SACRAH), the PROMIS Pain Impact-Short
           Form (PROMIS PI-SF), the FACT-ES Trial Outcome Index, and the Aromatase Inhibitor Usage
           Form questionnaires at baseline and at 6, 12, 24 and 52 weeks.

      Patients undergo blood sample collection at baseline and at 6, 12, and 24 weeks for serum
      hormones (estradiol, FSH, LH) levels, inflammatory markers (TNFα, IL-6, IL-12, CRP), and DNA
      analysis. Urine samples are also collected at baseline and at 24 and 52 weeks for
      c-telopeptides of Type II collagen and aromatase inhibitor metabolites analysis.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 24 and 52 weeks.
