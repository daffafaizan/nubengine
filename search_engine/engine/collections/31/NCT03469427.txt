      Congenital, infectious, inflammatory, neoplastic, neurological, toxic, iatrogenic and
      atraumatic causes.

      Surgical intervention is indicated if 90-95% loss of function is seen at the very early
      period on Electroneuronography or if there is axonal degeneration on Electromyography lately
      with no sign of recovery.

      High-resolution multislice computed tomography of the temporal bone is routinely required for
      evaluation of traumatic facial paralysis. High-resolution multislice computed tomography is
      known to be the best method for evaluating the intratemporal course of the facial nerve, but
      it has some limitations as well. Occasionally, the surgeon may encounter facial nerve
      injuries which have not been revealed in the preoperative computed tomography.

      There are limited data in recent medical publications evaluating the diagnostic value of
      temporal bone High-resolution multislice computed tomography in the evaluation of traumatic
      facial paralysis. Therefore, in this study,the investigators will compare the findings of
      preoperative high-resolution multislice computed tomography with surgical findings to
      determine the diagnostic value of computed tomography.
