      I. To assess feasibility (accrual, participation, and retention) and acceptability of a
      supported self-management intervention for psycho-education and stress management skills
      building designed for informal caregivers (intervention group n=20; waitlist control group,
      n=20) of head and neck cancer (HNC) patients undergoing radiotherapy (RT).

      II. To obtain preliminary data on caregiver intermediate (self-efficacy for [a] coping with
      cancer and [b] abbreviated progressive muscle relaxation) and outcome variables (burden,
      psychological distress, quality of life) in intervention caregivers and waitlist control
      caregivers at the start of radiation (T1), end of radiation (T2), and 6-weeks post-radiation
      (T3).

      III. To compare intermediate (self-efficacy for (a) coping with cancer and (b) abbreviated
      progressive muscle relaxation) and outcome variables (burden, psychological distress, quality
      of life) between intervention caregivers and waitlist control caregivers at T1, T2, and T3.

      IV. To obtain preliminary data on caregiver cortisol response (cortisol slope, cortisol
      awakening

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I: Caregivers watch introduction video on a digital video disc (DVD) over 10 minutes at
      baseline. Caregivers receive Prepare to Care kit including 8 workbook modules and complete at
      least 1 module over 30-45 minutes each week. Caregivers also attend interventionist session
      over 10-30 minutes weekly.

      GROUP II: Caregivers receive educational intervention as in Group I but do not attend
      interventionist sessions.
