      clinic with ages between 18 and 35 years old and who intend to participate in the donation
      program for the semen bank, and come to evaluate their quality. Informed consent for this
      study will be given to all of them, which they will have to return signed.

      Depending on the semen quality evaluated in the diagnostic sample within the usual practice,
      in the laboratory the participants will be divided into 2 groups according to the WHO
      reference values in terms of sperm concentration and percentage of progressive motility:

        -  Group A (Normozoospermics): â‰¥15 mill / ml and> 32% progressive mobility.

        -  Group B (Non-normozoospermic): <15 mill / ml and <32% progressive mobility. The study
           will consist of 2 years. The first year will be used to collect all the diagnostic
           seminal samples from donor candidates, and the second year will be used in its first
           months to analyze the microbiome by extracting DNA from ejaculates, amplifying bacterial
           DNA with targeted primers. to the bacterial 16S rRNA gene regions, sequencing, library
           preparation and bioinformatic analysis.
