      is most often associated with stroke and is more severe and persistent following right
      hemisphere damage, with reported frequencies in the acute stage of up to 80%. This may result
      in gait disturbance, high levels of energy expenditure and increase the risk of falls.
      Vestibuleo-ocular training techniques are aimed at improving or even restoring visual
      function by training patients to detect stimuli in the blind hemifield and increase their
      overall sensitivity to them. The investigators propose a model based (Microsoft Kinect), a
      device can be used for assessment of spatiotemporal gait variables as well as gait
      kinematics.
