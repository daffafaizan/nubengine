      I. Assess toxicities of combining vorinostat and bortezomib as maintenance therapy after
      autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) for NHL.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Ability to complete planned therapy.

      II. Time to disease progression, event-free survival.

      III. Overall survival.

      OUTLINE:

      All patients receive carmustine intravenously (IV) over 3 hours on day -7; cytarabine IV
      twice daily (BID) over 3 hours and etoposide IV BID over 2 hours on days -6 to -3; and
      melphalan IV over 30 minutes on day -2. Only patients with history of cluster of
      differentiation (CD)20+ NHL receive additional rituximab IV on days -19 and -12. Patients
      undergo ASCT on day 0. Patients then receive bortezomib IV on days 2 and 8, and vorinostat
      orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-14. Treatment with bortezomib and vorinostat repeats
      for total of 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for at least 2 years.
