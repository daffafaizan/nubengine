      patients within two years, including 30 patients with MSS tumors and 30 patients with MSI
      tumors. Patients with MSS tumors will be randomized to either group 1 or 2. Patients with MSI
      tumors will all be allocated to group 1.

      Patients in group 1 will be treated with a single dose of ipilimumab 1mg/kg on day 1 and two
      cycles of nivolumab 3mg/kg on day 1 and 15, respectively.

      Patients in group 2 will be treated with a single dose of ipilimumab 1mg/kg on day 1, two
      cycles of nivolumab 3mg/kg one day 1 and 15 and celecoxib daily until the day before surgery.
