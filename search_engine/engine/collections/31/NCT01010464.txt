      patients may require an open abdomen and undergo a series of abdominal operations, which may
      be increasingly complicated by the presence of adhesions. Adhesions appear soon after the
      initial operation and gradually mature within days. The effects of adhesion development on
      subsequent surgery may include: increased procedure time; difficulty differentiating,
      exposing, and accessing tissue planes; and increased risk of inadvertent enterotomy.
      Complications of adhesions include enteric obstruction and enterocutaneous fistulae. This
      study will determine whether an adhesion reduction plan, consisting of early adhesion
      prevention and application of a bioresorbable membrane is effective in reducing the extent
      and severity of adhesions and the incidence of complications in managing the open abdomen in
      trauma and emergency general surgery.
