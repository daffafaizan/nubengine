      hybrid or eight-drug alternating regimen is the optimal treatment for patients with advanced
      Hodgkin's disease.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms.
      Arm I (ABVD): Patients receive doxorubicin IV, bleomycin IV, vinblastine IV, and dacarbazine
      IV on days 1 and 15. Courses repeat every 4 weeks. Arm II (ChlVPP/PABLOE): Patients receive
      oral chlorambucil, procarbazine, and prednisolone on days 1-14; vinblastine IV on days 1 and
      8; doxorubicin IV on day 29; vincristine IV and bleomycin IV on days 29 and 36; oral
      etoposide on days 29-31; and oral prednisolone again on days 29-38. Courses repeat every 7
      weeks. OR (Hybrid - ChlVPP/EVA): Patients receive vincristine IV on day 1; oral etoposide on
      days 1-5; oral chlorambucil, procarbazine, and prednisolone on days 1-7; and doxorubicin IV
      and vinblastine IV on day 8. Courses repeat every 4 weeks. Patients in both arms receive up
      to 6-8 courses of treatment. Radiotherapy may be given to sites of previous bulk disease for
      patients in complete remission or uncertain remission. Patients who achieve partial remission
      may receive radiotherapy to residual disease sites. Patients who fail to respond, or have
      disease progression, may receive induction therapy followed by high-dose consolidation
      therapy. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 5 years, and
      then annually for 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 800 patients will be accrued for this study.
