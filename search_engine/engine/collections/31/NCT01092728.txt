      Dasatinib is designed to change the function of genes. By changing the function of these
      genes, it may prevent cancer from growing and spreading.

      Study Groups:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be placed into one of
      two groups depending on if the disease can be removed by surgery on or not. Group 1 will be
      patients who have melanoma that can be removed by surgery. Group 2 will be patients who have
      melanoma that cannot be completely removed by surgery.

      Study Drug Administration:

      For this study, every 4 weeks is a study "cycle."

      Dasatinib pills will be taken by mouth with a full glass (8 ounces) of water with or without
      a meal. The pills should not be crushed or cut, they should be swallowed whole.

      If you are in Group 1, you will take 2 dasatinib pills 1 time every day, for 7 days before
      your already-scheduled surgery. About 6 weeks after surgery (depending on how long it takes
      you to recover) you will begin taking 2 dasatinib pills 1 time every day for up to 13 cycles
      as long as you tolerate it and the disease does not come back.

      If you are in Group 2, you will take 2 dasatinib pills 1 time every day, for 7 days before
      your already-scheduled biopsy on Day 8 (+/1 business day) of Cycle 1. Within 5 days after the
      biopsy, you will begin taking 2 dasatinib pills 1 time every day for up to 13 cycles, as long
      as you tolerate it and the disease does not come back.

      Both groups will be given a pill chart to fill out at home to record when you take the study
      drug, and how many pills you take each time. You will need to bring the pill chart to every
      study visit for the study doctor to review. You will also need to bring the pill bottles to
      each study visit.

      Group 1 Study Visits:

      After the screening tests have been complete, and before you start taking the study drug, the
      following procedures will be performed:

        -  Your weight and vital signs will be measured.

        -  You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking.

        -  Your performance status will be recorded.

      After 7 days of taking the study drug, and before surgery, the following procedures will be
      performed:

        -  You will have a physical exam, including a measurement of your weight and vital signs.

        -  Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  Your performance status will be recorded.

        -  You will have an ECG to check your heart function.

        -  You will have a PET scan to check the status of the disease.

      About 6 weeks after surgery, when you begin taking the study drug on Cycle 1, the following
      tests and procedures will be performed on Day 1 of each cycle:

        -  Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  You will have a physical exam, including a measurement of your weight and vital signs.

        -  Your performance status will be recorded.

           be experiencing.

      On Day 15 of Cycle 1 only, the following tests and procedures will be performed:

        -  Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  You will have a physical exam, including a measurement of your weight and vital signs.

        -  Your performance status will be recorded.

        -  You will be asked about any other drugs you may be taking, and any side effects you may
           be experiencing.

      Every 12 weeks while you are receiving treatment, the following tests and procedures will be
      performed:

        -  An ECG will be performed to check your heart function.

        -  You will have a CT scan or MRI scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis to check the
           status of the disease.

      Group 2 Study Visits:

      After the screening tests have been complete, and before you start taking the study drug, the
      following procedures will be performed:

        -  You will have a measurement of your vital signs including your weight.

        -  You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking.

        -  Your performance status will be recorded.

      After 7 days of taking the study drug, and before the biopsy, the following procedures will
      be performed:

        -  You will have a CT scan or MRI scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis to check on the
           status of the disease.

      Length of Study:

      You will continue to take the study drug for up to 13 cycles. You will be taken off study
      early if you experience intolerable side effects, the disease returns (Group 1 only), the
      disease gets worse (Group 2 only), or if the study doctor thinks it is in your best interest.

      If you are in Group 2, and you are benefiting from the treatment, you may be allowed to
      continue to receive treatment with the study drug after you have completed the 12 study
      cycles. The study doctor will discuss this option with you in more detail.

      End-of-Study Visit:

      Within 30 days after the last dose of study drug, you will have an end-of-study visit, at
      which the following tests and procedures will be performed:

        -  An ECG will be performed to check your heart function.

        -  You will have a CT scan or MRI scan of your chest, abdomen, and pelvis performed to
           check the status of the disease.

        -  You will have a physical exam, including a measurement of your weight and vital signs.

        -  Your performance status will be recorded.

        -  You will be asked about any other drugs you may be taking, and any side effects you may
           be experiencing.

      Follow-Up Visits:

      After your participation on this study is complete, you will have follow-up visit every 3
      months and you will be asked about your health status. If you do not come to the hospital for
      a regularly scheduled clinic visit, you will receive a follow-up phone call. The phone call
      should last about 15 minutes each time.

      This is an investigational study. Dasatinib is FDA approved and commercially available for
      the treatment of certain types of leukemia. The use of dasatinib to treat acral lentiginous
      melanoma, mucosal melanoma, or chronic sun-damaged melanoma is investigational.
