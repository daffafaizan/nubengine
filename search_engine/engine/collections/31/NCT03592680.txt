    
      After obtaining informed consent, patients which are planned for CABG or heart valve surgery
      are randomly assigned into the Vitamin C group or Placebo Group.

      Each patient will receive 1 g Vitamin C or Placebo twice a day from 5 days before until 10
      days after surgery. The medication will be given orally and both patient and surgeon are
      blinded for the administrated medication.

      Patients receive standard of care in the post-operative period, which includes close
      monitoring for possible arrhythmias. If such an arrhythmia develops, this is treated
      according to the normal procedures. All information such as the used medication, the
      hospitalization / ICU length of stay and the ventilation time is automatically registered in
      the patient records.

      From each patient, three additional blood samples (peri-operative, post-operative Day 0,
      post-operative Day 1) will be obtained for analysis of Neutrophil gelatinase-associated
      lipocalin (NGAL), a possible marker of subclinical kidney damage. These samples will be
      analysed in batch once all samples are collected.
