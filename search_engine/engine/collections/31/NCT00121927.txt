      a modified Atkins diet (15g/day of carbohydrates). Medications remain unchanged and labs are
      drawn. Followup is at 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months into the study. After 1 month,
      carbohydrates and medications can be altered. Ketosis (urine) is measured by patients
      semiweekly, weight weekly, and seizures daily and recorded on a calendar.

      This study is ongoing with approximately 20 patients of 30 enrolled as of February 2006.
