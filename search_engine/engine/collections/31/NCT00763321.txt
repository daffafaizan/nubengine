      double-blind (DB) period. Participants who were receiving benefit and were tolerating ABT-712
      during the OL period were randomized into the DB period. Study drug was given for a total of
      8 weeks, which included up to 3 weeks in OL, up to 4 weeks in DB, and a 1-week DB taper.
      During the OL period, all participants took increasing doses of ABT-712 until they were
      taking 2 tablets, twice daily. During the DB period, participants in the ABT-712 group took 2
      ABT-712 tablets, twice daily throughout the 4 weeks, while participants in the placebo group
      took 2 placebo tablets twice daily.
