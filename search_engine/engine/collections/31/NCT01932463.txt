      to provide precise, consistent treatments that can be monitored in real-time. The development
      of phased array transducers allows for tightly focused treatment volumes and for the ability
      to compensate for distortions by tissue inhomogeneities. The landmark advance in MRgFUS for
      neurosurgeons occurred as the ability to sonicate through the intact cranium was achieved
      with phased array transducers and acoustic modeling using CT reconstructions of the skull. By
      coupling HIFU with MRI, detailed treatment plans can be generated and intra-procedure
      real-time monitoring is available. Standard MR sequences have been shown to reliably predict
      tissue damage during thermal lesioning with ultrasound. The precision of the technology has
      already been demonstrated in animal models and is currently being investigated in humans with
      brain tumors and neuropathic pain syndromes. Unlike stereotactic radiosurgery, the treatment
      can be monitored continuously in real time with MRI and MR-thermography. We anticipate that a
      MRgFUS non-invasive thermal lesioning is similarly as safe as DBS (or other current procedure
      and will provide several years of benefit through reduction of contralateral motor symptoms
      and potential medication side effects in ET, while still permitting subsequent treatment with
      DBS should that become clinically desirable.
