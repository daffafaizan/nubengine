      the governmental preschools available within Edko administration of Beheira governorate,
      Egypt. A cluster random sampling strategy was used so that the contributors, after fulfilling
      eligibility criteria, mother/child dyads (pairs) in each nursery were subsequently assigned
      to the first test group (motivational interviewing MI), the second test group (motivational
      interviewing MI+ gaming) or the control group (conventional dental health education CE). The
      children were randomly assigned to the three study groups in the allocation ratio 1:1:1 using
      random allocation software in blocks of five. The schools' randomization sequence were
      written on identical sheets of paper and folded inside opaque envelopes that were sealed to
      be open at the time of intervention implementation.

      The three interventions were the conventional dental health education (CE) which were
      delivered through a 15-minute oral health session given to mothers of preschoolers in the
      control group whereas in the test groups Motivational Interviewing (MI) for mothers and Games
      for children were carried out via specific phases.
