      leading causes of death are those in which nutrition can play a key preventative role. The
      proposed study will provide information on the metabolic stress from varying body weight
      overlaid by the additional metabolic stress of a test-meal challenge, in this case being
      delivered in the form of an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and oral lipid tolerance test
      (OLTT), standard metabolic challenges in post-prandial research. Previous studies assessing
      metabolic risk factors associated with a disease have typically focused on information
      collected from individuals in a fasting state only. However, it is equally important to
      assess how the body responds when stressed. Employing an acute high fat or carbohydrate
      intake is sufficient to induce a mild stress in which time an individual's unique
      post-prandial response can be monitored. This study will combine traditional markers
      (dietary, anthropometric, lifestyle, clinical and physical activity) with nutrigenomics, a
      tool that attempts to describe the genome-wide influences of nutrition by examining the
      impact of diet on genes (genomics), mRNA (transcriptomics), proteins (proteomics) and
      metabolites (metabolomics).
