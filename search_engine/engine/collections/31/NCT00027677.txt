        -  Determine the toxicity profile, maximum tolerated dose, and dose-limiting toxic effects
           of halofuginone hydrobromide in patients with progressive advanced solid tumors.

        -  Establish a recommended dose of this drug for phase II study.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral halofuginone hydrobromide once daily on days 1 and 4-14 of course 1 and
      on days 1-14 of subsequent courses. Treatment repeats every 14 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 1-3 patients receive escalating doses of halofuginone hydrobromide until the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which 20% of
      patients experience acute dose-limiting toxicity. After the MTD is reached, 6-12 additional
      patients are treated at dose levels preceding the MTD until the recommended dose for phase II
      study is determined. The recommended dose for phase II study is defined as the dose preceding
      the MTD that allows a 90% dose intensity for 2 months with no greater than grade 2 toxicity
      in 80% of the patients.

      Patients are followed every 8 weeks until disease progression or initiation of another
      treatment.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 7-40 patients will be accrued for this study.
