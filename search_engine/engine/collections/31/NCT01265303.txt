      such as tachycardia or palpitations increase the probability of detecting infrequent but
      dangerous events with profound clinical significance. Patients with recommendation for the
      first catheter ablation of Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation in the reference center will be
      included in the study. Eligible patients will have 14-day telemetric ECG monitoring. Based on
      detected arrhythmia events, patient's medical history and available documentation the most
      appropriate treatment will be recommended. Patients will undergo invasive procedures of
      ablation or pacemaker implantation or can be treated pharmacologically. After the invasive
      treatment or initiation of pharmacotherapy the 14-day telemetric ECG monitoring will be
      repeated to assess efficacy of the treatment.

      Patients with no record of arrhythmia requiring treatment during the first 14 days ECG
      monitoring will terminate participation in the study. The referring physician will be
      informed. Further diagnosis or treatment should be performed at the referring physician's
      center according to the best clinical practice.
