      consent will undergo screening to determine eligibility for study entry. They will be
      randomly assigned to two conditions (Imagery rescripting Vs. Imaginal exposure) at a 1:1
      ratio. Participants will attend three ~1 hour online ZOOM sessions (pre-assessment and
      measurement, intervention, and post assessment and measurement).

      Assessors will be blind to the treatment condition.
