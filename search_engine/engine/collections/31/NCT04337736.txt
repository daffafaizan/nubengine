      breast cancer at the "Ospedale G. Bernabeo" of Ortona, Chieti, Italy. The participants were
      randomized to the following physical exercise protocols: aerobic training, walking or Nordic
      walking; resistance training.

      All the participants have been examined utilizing transthoracic echocardiography, carotid
      ultrasound and photo-plethysmographic method for the analysis of arterial stiffness, before
      and after the physical exercise protocol (T0-T1). The two-dimensional speckle-tracking
      analysis was performed with an offline, dedicated software from the apical 4-chambers-view.
      Moreover, ventricular-arterial coupling, epicardial fat thickness and intima-media thickness
      were also analyzed.

      Quality of life was assessed using SF-36 score at T0, T1 and at a mean follow-up of 34
      months. Moreover, at follow-up, we evaluated spontaneous physical activity and cardiovascular
      quality of life using IPAQ and SAQ-7 scores.
