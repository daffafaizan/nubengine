    
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study
      with two secukinumab dose regimens in approximately 541 patients with moderate to severe HS.
      The study consists of: screening (up to 4 weeks) treatment period 1 (16 weeks, active drug or
      placebo) and treatment period 2 (up to 1 year all patients on active drug); there will be an
      optional extension study. Adult males and females with moderate to severe HS will be
      included, with a diagnosis of HS greater than 1 year prior to baseline. Dosing will be once
      every 2 weeks, or once every 4 weeks via pre-filled syringe; periodic home-dosing is included
      The primary objective is to demonstrate the efficacy of secukinumab compared to placebo with
      respect to HISCR after 16 weeks of treatment; primary secondary objectives are to assess
      difference in proportion of patients with HS flares, and proportion of patients with clinical
      response in HS related skin pain after 16 weeks of treatment. Key safety data will be
      collected, along with Patient Reported Outcomes
