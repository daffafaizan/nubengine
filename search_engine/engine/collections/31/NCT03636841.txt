      The smoke produced by the electric section of the tissues during laparoscopy alters the
      vision of the operative field and presents potential risks. A new medical device with CE
      marking (Ultravision ©) has been developed to limit electroprecipitation on the wall and
      tissues of the abdomen.

      The aim of the work is to evaluate the effectiveness of this medical device in laparoscopic
      cholecystectomy for cholecystitis. It is an intervention for a common pathology where smoke
      is particularly important due to the tissue inflammation and due to the extensive dissection
      necessary to perform the surgical procedure.

      Material and method A randomized double-blinded study will be conducted in two academic
      hospitals (Marseille North Hospital and Timone, APHM) evaluating the use of a smoke
      electroprecipitation device (Ultravision ©) during laparoscopic cholecystectomy for
      cholecystitis operated at the acute phase. A group of 30 patients using the device will be
      compared to a control group of 30 patients. The evaluation will last thirty days per patient
      and the duration of inclusion is 2 years.

      Expected results The main objective is to demonstrate a significant reduction in operating
      duration by using the device. The secondary objectives are to reduce the CO2 consumption, the
      surgical incidents and the discomfort of the surgeon related to the smoke.
