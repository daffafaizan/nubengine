      ventilation. The primary cause of failure of extubation (and the need for reintubation) is
      apnea of prematurity. Standard treatment for improving extubation success and decreasing
      apnea of prematurity is with the use of nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP),
      use of methylxanthines, or both. Recent literature suggests that methylxanthines may have
      significant effect on long-term neurodevelopmental outcome.

      This primary objective of this study is to investigate the effect of synchronized nasal
      intermittent positive pressure ventilation (sNIPPV) combined with standard nasal continuous
      positive airway pressure (nCPAP) versus standard nCPAP alone, on the need for reintubation
      and the need of methylxanthine therapy in premature infants. The study period for the primary
      objective will be the first 7 days immediately after the initial extubation of premature
      infants with birth weights 500-1250 grams. A secondary objective is to identify any
      differences in duration of time free of endotracheal intubation and duration of time free of
      methylxanthine use between the two treatment modalities as measured from the first extubation
      attempt.

      The study is a randomized, controlled trial using a new CPAP machine (Infant Flow advanceâ„¢)
      that will be able to provide nCPAP with and without sNIPPV. Because of the mechanics of the
      sNIPPV mode, blinding of the study is not possible. The study is pragmatic in design allowing
      the medical staff to make clinical decisions on ventilatory management based on the routinely
      used criteria thus evaluating the study interventions in the everyday clinical environment.
      Analysis will be on an intention-to-treat basis.
