      their daily life. However, to date no treatment option has been definitively validated as
      effective for fatigue in survivors. In recent years Mind Body exercises such as yoga, Tai
      Chi, and Qigong have been shown in small clinical trials to be effective at treating the
      symptoms of CRF in a wide array of Cancer types. But understanding of basic science
      mechanisms is poor.

      Recent studies of Mindfulness meditation, by the investigators and others, confirm the
      importance of brain mechanisms related to awareness and attention. This study will assess
      whether Qigong activates similar physiological processes. The study will also assess (1)
      whether emotion regulation improves, suggesting that Mindfulness-related processes may
      partially underlie changes in Qigong as a Mindful exercise (2) whether grip strength
      improves, suggesting that Qigong activates similar processes to conventional exercise.

      As an exploratory question, the study will look at whether brain measures related to
      awareness are correlated with inflammatory markers called cytokines, suggesting possible
      neuro-immune interaction that may be relevant for understanding fatigue, vitality and
      embodied meditative movement therapies such as Qigong, Tai Chi and Yoga.
