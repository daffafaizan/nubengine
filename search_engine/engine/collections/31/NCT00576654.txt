      cells (PBMC) by measurement of PAR levels. (ORIGINAL DOSE ESCALATION PORTION) II. DNA
      damaging effects of irinotecan and the combination of irinotecan with ABT-888: levels of
      gamma H2A histone family, member X (gamma-H2AX) and RAD51 recombinase (Rad51) formation in
      tumor tissue. (ORIGINAL DOSE ESCALATION PORTION) III. Relevance of cytochrome P450 family 2,
      subfamily C, polypeptide 9 (CYP2C9) and 2C19 polymorphisms, uridine 5'-diphosphosphate (UDP)
      glucuronosyltransferase 1 family, polypeptide A1 (UGT1A1) polymorphism, and ATP-binding
      cassette, sub-family G (WHITE), member 2 (ABCG2) polymorphism to the pharmacokinetics of
      irinotecan and/or ABT-888. (ORIGINAL DOSE ESCALATION PORTION) IV. To explore whether a
      positive gamma-H2AX response in tumor tissue at 4-6 hours (hrs) is reflected in circulating
      tumor cells (CTCs) between 8-24 hrs but not at 4-6 hrs, as predicted. (EXPANSION PORTION) V.
      To explore whether PARP inhibition increases gamma-H2AX response of CTCs to plasma drug by
      4-6 hrs after CPT-11 administration. (EXPANSION PORTION) VI. To explore whether PARP
      inhibition increases gamma-H2AX response of tumor cells to tissue drug level, as indicated by
      CTCs at 8-24 hrs after CPT-11. (EXPANSION PORTION) VII. To explore when the gamma-H2AX
      response peak in CTCs occurs, indicating a response in tumor. (EXPANSION PORTION) VIII. To
      explore whether there is a tumor switch between gamma-H2AX and excision repair
      cross-complementation group 1 (ERCC1)-mediated repair in the presence of PARP inhibition,
      (i.e., repeat initial PBMC and tumor findings). (EXPANSION PORTION) IX. To perform analysis

      (continuous administration). (EXPANSION PORTION) X. To sequence the genome and transcriptome

      examining levels of Rad51 formation in tumors. (EXPANSION PORTION) XII. To evaluate the
      percentage of breast cancer stem cells (BCSC) in serial breast tumor biopsies before and

      tissue in response to treatment with irinotecan plus a PARP inhibitor, in this case ABT-888.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of veliparib. Patients are assigned to 1 of 3
      cohorts.

      DOSE ESCALATION: Patients receive irinotecan hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes
      on days 1 and 8 and veliparib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days -1 to 14 (days 3-14 of
      course 1 only). Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      8 and veliparib PO BID on days 1-15 (days 2-15 of course 1 only). Courses repeat every 21
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      INTERMITTENT DOSE ESCALATION: Patients receive irinotecan hydrochloride IV over 90 minutes on
      days 3 and 10 and veliparib PO BID on days 1 to 4 and 8-11. Courses repeat every 21 days in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.
