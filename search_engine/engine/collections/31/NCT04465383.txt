    
      This prospective Randomized Controlled Trial will evaluate efficacy, safety, and
      pharmacoeconomic outcomes in patients undergoing colonoscopy with either Digital Sedation
      using the Aqua© module of the Oncomfort device (Sedakit TM) or the standard of care,
      intravenous sedation with propofol. The Aqua© module is designed for sedation and management
      of pain and anxiety related to medical and surgical procedures.

      Participants will be recruited during the anesthesiology consultation conducted in
      preparation for colonoscopy. Those with indication for screening or diagnostic colonoscopy
      under conventional intravenous sedation (propofol) and willing to participate will provide
      their written informed consent and will be randomized (2:1) between two arms:

        1. Experimental arm: Digital Sedation, with rescue intravenous sedation (propofol) if
           needed upon patient request

        2. Control arm: conventional intravenous sedation (propofol)

      The study will be divided into two stages, with randomization (2:1) maintained throughout. In
      the first stage, accrual will be halted when about 45 patients have been randomized, at least
      27 of whom being evaluable patients randomized to the experimental arm. A non-binding
      futility analysis is planned for the primary outcome. If the milestones are met, accrual will
      be reopened to the second stage and the study will continue to the planned final accrual of
      177 patients (118 to experimental and 59 to control arm, respectively). At the end of the
      recruitment of Stage 1, an analysis of the secondary outcomes will also be run. Results of
      these analysis could also impact the decision for pursuing to second stage.
