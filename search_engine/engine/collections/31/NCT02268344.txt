    
      This study will be conducted as a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial. Two
      parallel treatment groups will be examined with a 1:1 allocation: 1) brief intraoperative
      electrical stimulation continuously at 20 Hz at an intensity of 1.5 times the motor threshold
      for 60 minutes, or 2) sham/no stimulation for 60 minutes. Individuals will be allocated to
      treatment groups using a block randomization sequence. Participants and researchers measuring
      outcomes will be blinded to treatment groups. Stimulation (BES or sham) will occur
      intraoperatively immediately following neck dissection for 60 minutes.
