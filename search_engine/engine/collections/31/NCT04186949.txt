      these diseases still have no clear preventative measures or curative treatments. Growing
      evidence shows that atopic dermatitis (AD), food allergy (FA), allergic rhinitis, and asthma
      are largely determined during the first 1000 days (time elapsed from conception to the 2nd
      birthday). This cohort aims to determine prenatal and perinatal conditions, as well as
      genetic and epigenetic factors, that participate in the early setting of immune responses,
      and the role of these in the later determination of the risk of allergic diseases, and asthma
      in the offspring.

      The investigators have designed a birth cohort of 250 families with recruitment in pregnancy
      (~14 weeks). The plan is to genotype relevant allergy/asthma-associated variants and will
      perform immunophenotyping and evaluation of allergy biomarkers in cord blood. At 2 years of
      age the investigators will assess if infants have developed allergic sensitization, AD, FA,
      as well as biomarkers of asthma including the asthma predictive index. The study will also
      evaluate how maternal conditions modify immune programming through epigenetic modifications,
      and will then confirm newborn epigenetic cues of allergy/asthma risk. Next, the investigators
      will assess composition/diversity of maternal gut, placenta, breastmilk and infant gut
      microbiome and their association with immunophenotype and biomarkers at birth, and clinical
      outcomes at age 2. Finally, another specific objective is to assess how environmental
      exposures (perinatal outdoor and indoor pollution, endotoxin and allergens) affect the
      incidence of allergic sensitization, AD, FA, and risk of asthma.
