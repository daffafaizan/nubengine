      of gonadotropin secretion from the pituitary prior to initiation of ovarian stimulation.
      Administration of GnRH agonists results in the prevention of spontaneous LH surges, which
      lead to luteinization of the developing follicles, initiation of final oocyte maturation and
      a decrease in pregnancy rates.

      GnRH agonists are usually administered according to two protocols: the short and long
      protocol.In the long protocol, downregulation with GnRH agonists is initiated either in the
      middle of the secretory phase, or at the beginning of the follicular phase. Stimulation of
      the ovaries with gonadotropins is initiated when downregulation is confirmed.

      Administration of gonadotropins is usually started during the second or third week of
      treatment with GnRH agonists.The possibility of earlier initiation of the ovarian
      stimulation, if downregulation is confirmed at an earlier stage, has not been examined so
      far.

      The purpose of this study is to assess whether the duration of pituitary downregulation with
      GnRH agonists, prior to initiation of ovarian stimulation with gonadotropins, has any effect
      on pregnancy rate, in women undergoing IVF.
