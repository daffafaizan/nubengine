      sensation which will lead to decrease the pain. Local anesthesia started with discovery of
      Cocaine in 1860. Followed by developments of Novocaine 1904 and lignocaine in 1942 by
      Lofgren. It became the gold standard drug compared to other local anesthetic. Later, several
      new drugs were discovered such as:Bupivacaine, Articaine, Mepivicaine etc. Articaine
      Hydrochloride (HCL) was available in Germany since 1976. It's the only amide local anesthesia
      containing ester group in its molecular structure leading to metabolizing of the drug by both
      plasma esterases and liver microsomal enzymes, the clinical efficacy and advantages of
      articaine is the duration of its anesthetic effect and its superior diffusion through the
      bony tissue.
