      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of indole-3-carbinol in healthy participants.

        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of this drug in these participants.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these participants.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the effects of this drug on selected markers of sexual function in these
           participants.

        -  Determine the effects of this drug on markers of susceptibility to cancer in these
           participants.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation study.
      Participants at each dose level are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Participants receive a single dose of oral indole-3-carbinol on day 1.

        -  Arm II: Participants receive a single dose of oral placebo on day 1. Cohorts of 3
           participants receive escalating doses of indole-3-carbinol until the maximum tolerated
           dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 1 of 3
           participants experiences dose-limiting toxicity. An additional cohort of 3 participants
           is treated at the MTD.

      Participants are followed on days 2, 3, and 6.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24 participants (18 in arm I and 6 in arm II) will be accrued
      for this study.
