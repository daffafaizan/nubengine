    
      This is a prospective study of montelukast efficacy in addition to standard treatment of
      status asthmaticus in children from 2-5 years old who are in the PICU. Children who meet
      eligibility requirements will be randomized to receive a rapid-dissolving oral dose of
      montelukast or placebo. Once enrolled, a baseline modified Wood's-Downes clinical asthma
      severity score will be recorded pre and post completion of a standard nebulized albuterol
      treatment of 0.15 mg/kg/dose (min2.5mg/dose). Patients who are able will have FEV1
      measurements obtained at predetermined intervals for determination of clinical asthma
      severity score. Blood samples for PK analysis will be collected prior to study drug
      administration and at predetermined time intervals to determine the plasma level of
      montelukast. In addition, a blood sample will be obtained for genetic study of polymorphisms
      of CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and CYP2C9.
