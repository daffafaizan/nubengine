      tolerance to drug, quality of life, depression, pain management and nutrition. During the
      study we will begin to study the kinetics of opioid growth factor (OGF) exogenous
      administration and the relationship between plasma OGF levels, stage of disease and length of
      treatment. Apart from potentially having growth inhibitory action on cancer, OGF may have
      some psychological and other biological effects which may prove to be beneficial in the
      patient's treatment. Presently there is no effective therapy or quality of life adjuvants for
      the 30,000 Americans who develop head and neck cancer yearly.
