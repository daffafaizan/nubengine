      shed off caused by AF is one of the major causes of stroke. Most patients with AF suffer
      ischemic stroke that the thrombosis was from the left atrial appendage(LAA). The majority of
      patients with atrial fibrillation, the blood clots come from the left atrial appendage, so
      close the left atrial appendage can reduce cycle thromboembolism of the patients with AF. Now
      patients have cardiac surgery and risk at left atrium related thromboembolism, the surgery
      has been conventional perform the left atrial appendage closed surgery.

      However, surgical left atrial appendage ligation is difficult to be completely closed to the
      left atrial appendage,internal medicine intervention methods of surgical closure the left
      atrial appendage is relatively simple, minimally invasive, high success rate and is expected
      to be widely used.

      Several versions of LAA occlusion devices have been developed.LAA occluder of Shanghai Push
      Medical Device Technology CO.td, consists of a fixed ball and a cover; The fixed ball
      composed of multiple umbrella and covered the ePTFE membrane.This study mainly evaluated the
      feasibility and safety of the new Left Atrial Appendage Occluder! Through the femoral vein
      puncture; insert inter atrial septum puncture device; puncture a small hole in the atrial
      septal, delivery sheath is inserted in the femoral vein puncture site and across the atrial
      septal reach the left atrial appendage, establishment of the channel. Through the
      built-channel sent the LAA occluder to the left atrial appendage by the delivery cable; The
      LAA occlude will be fixed in the left atrial appendage, close the entrance of the left atrial
      appendage meanwhile and block blood flow; then eliminate the risk of blood clots due to
      atrial fibrillation, prevention stroke.
