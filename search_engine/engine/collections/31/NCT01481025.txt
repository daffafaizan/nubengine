      women on quality of life.

      The investigators will test the mixture already in the market as GynoPlus and RemifeminPlus,
      but as each extract has its own particularities the investigators will try CIM/HIP as a
      unique formulation versus Clifemin® as control and Aplause® as comparator.

      This protocol was performed for the best of our volunteers.
