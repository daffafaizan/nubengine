      Chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN), it commonly caused by Paclitaxel
      chemotherapy which is usually used in the treatment of breast cancer. Metformin which is
      known as a safe anti-diabetic drug, was found to have a protective effect on neurons. It gave
      positive results in chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy in mouse models and in some
      clinical trials
