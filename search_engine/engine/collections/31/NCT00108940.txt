      acquired disability in adults. Each year, about 700,000 people experience stroke in the
      country. Ischemic stroke, which constitutes about 80 percent of all strokes, is a complex
      genetic disorder--the result of interactions between multiple genes and multiple
      environmental exposures. Genes affecting cholesterol, blood pressure, clotting, and other
      factors may increase the risk of ischemic stroke.

      In this clinical study, investigators are studying groups of siblings in which at least two
      of the siblings have had an ischemic stroke. The goal of this multi-center study is to find
      the genes that increase the risk of developing an ischemic stroke.

      To accomplish the aims of the study, researchers are using DNA samples collected from
      concordant (stroke-affected) sibling pairs to determine if there are regions in the human
      genome associated with ischemic stroke or that may harbor stroke susceptibility genes.

      Two teaspoons of blood will be collected from each participant and submitted for genetic
      analysis. Understanding the genetic predisposition to stroke could have major benefits for
      public health.
