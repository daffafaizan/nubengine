    
      This study is a non-inferiority, prospective, parallel-group open-label randomized controlled
      trial. Three hundred forty-two HIV-negative patients diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis
      (TB) and starting a new anti-multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) treatment cycle will
      be included in the study. Two randomized arms of 171 patients each will be recruited over the
      two-year period, each patient will be followed-up over the entire course of anti-TB treatment
      and one year after the end of therapy. Regular study visits will include physical
      examination, collection of sputum, blood and urine and filling in the study questionnaire. On
      the collected specimens standard bacteriological and blood tests, as well as extended
      immunological analysis, will be performed. In the experimental group, an RNA transcriptomic
      analysis using RNA-Seq technology will also be performed.

      In the control arm, the patients will receive a standardised World Health Organization
      recommended 20 months treatment while in the experimental arm the treatment duration will be
      guided by the transcriptomic signature-based model.

      Treatment outcomes and level of TB relapse and survival within the follow-up period will be
      compared between the experimental and control arms. The efficacy of biomarker-guided
      treatment therapy will be assessed by a comparison of the proportions of favourable study
      outcome between two arms.
