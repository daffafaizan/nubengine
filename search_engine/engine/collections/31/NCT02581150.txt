      hospital budgets constraints and patients who ask for a prompt recovery. Consequently,
      physicians should find ways to optimize the resources' allocation, without compromising
      quality, safety and efficiency of patient care. Several studies and routine practice have
      shown that ambulatory hospitalization was safe but we are still lacking evidence to
      demonstrate the cost-utility of this kind of management.
