      electroencephalography (EEG) biomarkers and early treatment versus delayed treatment with
      vigabatrin in infants with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) will have a positive impact on
      developmental outcomes at 24 months of age. It would also prevent or lower the risk of
      developing infantile spasms and refractory seizures. This preventative approach would be
      expected to result in more favorable long-term cognitive, behavioral, developmental and
      psychiatric outcomes and significantly improve overall quality of life. It is a randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial design. Successful completion of this trial
      will also advance the field by demonstrating the value of systematic surveillance with EEG in
      asymptomatic infants with TSC.
