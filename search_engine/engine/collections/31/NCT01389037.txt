      literacy that is designed to reduce high blood pressure (HBP) in a vulnerable African
      American (AA) population. A community-based participatory research approach delivered by
      community health workers (CHW) will be used to address the following specific aims: Aim 1. To
      examine the effect of health literacy on self-care skills, including HBP knowledge, adherence
      to HBP and substance abuse treatment recommendations, communication skills, health care
      utilization, and BP outcomes in AAs with HBP. Aim 2. To conduct a pilot randomized,
      controlled trial with a delayed intervention control group to test the effectiveness of a
      health literacy-focused self-help HBP intervention program using CHWs in 100 AAs who reside
      in Baltimore City.
