      Laryngoscope and direct laryngoscopy using the Miller Blade Laryngoscope.

      The primary outcome of the study will be time to successful intubation. Other outcomes of
      clinical relevance such as first attempt success rates of intubation, grade of laryngeal
      view, percentage of glottic opening, number of insertion attempts, hemodynamic responses, and
      complications will also be assessed.
