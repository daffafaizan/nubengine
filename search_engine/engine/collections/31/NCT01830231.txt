      informed consent, they will be randomised to receive treatment based on cabazitaxel or
      vinflunine according to the following study schema:

      (Randomize 1:1)

        -  Cabazitaxel 25 mg/m2 q3w

        -  Vinflunine 250-320 mg/m2 q3w

      Random assignment of treatment will be stratified by the presence of 0 versus 1 of the
      following unfavourable prognostic risk factors proposed recently by Bellmunt et al. (1):

        -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) PS 1.

        -  Anaemia with Hb <10 g/dL.

        -  Presence of liver metastases.

      All patients enrolled in the study will receive a cycle of treatment with the study
      medication (cabazitaxel or vinflunine) every 21 days until disease progression or
      intolerable/unacceptable toxicity. Tumour evaluations will be scheduled every 6 weeks until
      progression
