    
      This clinical study was designed as an extension of the Trifecta™ IDE Study supporting FDA
      approval of the Trifecta™ valve. A total of 11 Trifecta™ IDE Study investigational sites in
      the United States (n=9) and Canada (n=2) participated in the Trifecta™ LTFU Study. Study
      enrollment included 329 subjects implanted from 2007 through 2009 at these 11 sites during
      the IDE Study who consented to participate in continued annual follow-up through 10 years
      post-implant. Of these 329 subjects, 140 also participated in the FDA-mandated Trifecta™
      Post-Approval Study (PAS, NCT01514162) prior to consenting to additional annual follow-up
      under the Trifecta™ LTFU protocol. The remaining 189 subjects entered the Trifecta™ LTFU
      Study directly from the Trifecta™ IDE Study.

      The Trifecta™ LTFU Study database subsumes all data collected in the 329 participants under
      the Trifecta™ IDE and Trifecta™ PAS protocols and extends these data through 10 years from
      each subject's original date of implant in the Trifecta™ IDE Study. The Trifecta™ LTFU Study
      data thus encompass 10 years of continuous annual post-implant follow-up in the 329
      participants as well as their pre-implant Baseline Visit data. Data collected includes
      adverse events, assessments of heart failure symptoms by New York Heart Association (NYHA)
      functional classification, and echocardiographic assessments of Trifecta™ valve function.
