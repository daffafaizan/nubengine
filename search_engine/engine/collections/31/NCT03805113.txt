      compared to placebo, in terms of pain (assessed by Visual Analog Scale (VAS)) and
      functionality (assessed by The Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) score)
      during the treatment and after a 3-months period. Secondarily, rigidity (Modified Kapandji
      Index), grip strength (JAMAR dynamometry) and quality of life (SF-36 questionnaire) were
      assessed. Treatment safety will also be evaluated.
