      as a novel, Carbonic Anhydrase IX (CAIX) targeted PET/CT tracer for the imaging of metastatic
      triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients.

      TNBC patients are known to be rapidly progressive and have a poor prognosis. This poor
      prognosis is due to the lack of common breast cancer targets in TNBC. As TNBC expresses CAIX,
      this stuy will evaluate CAIX targeting by using a radiolabeled monoclonal antibody that
      recognizes carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX) : 89Zr- girentuximab otherwise known as 89Zr-TLX250.
      Previous and ongoing studies have demonstrated the potential application of 89Zr-TLX250 as a
      new PET/CT imaging tracer for the detection of renal cancer.

      After establishing the TNBC targeting properties of the 89Zr-TLX250 PET/CT imaging tracer, it
      should be interesting to develop a new targeted therapy using TLX250- radiolabeled with a
      therapeutic radionuclide such as 177Lut√©tium.
