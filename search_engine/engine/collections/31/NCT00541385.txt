      given that they are the major group affected by acute uncomplicated malaria. There are
      relatively few paediatric formulations of artemisinin combination therapies. In addition to
      the tablet formulation of pyronaridine artesunate (PA) (PYRAMAX), Shin Poong Pharm Co is
      developing a paediatric dosing form presented as a granule formulation, packed in appropriate
      aluminium sachets each containing 60mg pyronaridine tetraphosphate and 20mg artesunate.

      This Phase III study is designed to demonstrate that the efficacy of PA granule formulation,
      as assessed in terms of PCR-corrected APCR, is above 90% and subsequently to compare
      (non-inferiority) the efficacy and safety of PA granule formulation to CoartemÂ® crushed
      tablets in infants and children.
