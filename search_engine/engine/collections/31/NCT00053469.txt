      object categorization in early development. The proposed work is designed to examine the
      emergence of infants ability to access internal categorical representations in service of
      planning actions on the external environment. Representation, in this capacity, refers simply
      to stored information that can influence later behavior. Categorization refers to the
      treatment of discriminable objects as equivalent in some way. Even very young infants appear
      able to visually categorize diverse sets of discriminable patterns or objects, and can form
      internal representations of such bounded collections. Much less is known, however, about
      infants ability to actually utilize such representations in the guidance of goal directed
      action. The present research is designed to characterize the functional and behavioral
      significance of object representations in infancy, focusing particularly on categorically
      organized representations. The primary research strategy to be used consists of analyzing
      infants examination and manipulation of novel objects that vary both in visual (i.e., shape
      and color) as well as nonvisual dimensions (i.e., weight). In a laboratory procedure,
      twelve-month old infants will explore novel objects of different weights, and their
      subsequent handling of modified test objects will be measured with an electronic motion
      analysis system. Kinematic analyses of infants actions on the test objects will reveal how
      these actions were prepared in relation to their previous experience with similar objects.
