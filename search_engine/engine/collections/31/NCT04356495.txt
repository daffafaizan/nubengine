        -  A safety study pilot phase.

        -  An efficacy study phase. The data collected during the pilot phase, combined with new
           external data that emerged during the period, will be used to position treatments for
           the efficacy phase.

        -  Pilot phase will evaluate the tolerance of experimental treatments for drugs given for
           the first time ("first in home-based care") in ambulatory individuals with COVID-19 with
           aggravating risk factors.

        -  Efficacy Phase: To estimate the effectiveness of experimental ambulatory treatments,
