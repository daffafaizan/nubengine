    
      1. Before their initial intake appointment, all CCDP patients are given a patient binder
           that includes the baseline Standardized Questionnaires. These are clinical
           questionnaires that all patients complete regardless of whether or not they consent to
           participation in research. In addition to the questionnaires completed at baseline,
           patients who consent to participate in the data registry will complete the
           questionnaires, via email or paper copy, at the following time points: approximately 6
           months after intake, at discharge and 3 months post-discharge.

        2. Patients who consent to the data registry will also be asked to complete a short
           questionnaire collecting basic demographic information at baseline. The demographic
           questionnaire will be either mailed to their home or sent via an online link; the
           investigators will ask participants to complete this form either before or when they
           come in for their first in-person visit at the CCDP.

        3. Additional data will be collected and entered from the clinical chart. Specifically,
           after the patient's initial clinic appointment, the Research Coordinator or designate
           will enter data points from the Interdisciplinary Assessment Tool, into REDCap.
