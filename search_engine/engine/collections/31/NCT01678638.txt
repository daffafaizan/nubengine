      with an inguinal hernia (IH) to determine which approach may be safer. Safety in this trial
      is defined as the freedom from significant adverse events, a reduction in hospital days
      during the study period, and normal neurodevelopmental testing at 2 years. Costs of each
      treatment strategy are also important and are being evaluated.
