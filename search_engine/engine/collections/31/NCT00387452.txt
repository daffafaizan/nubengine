           cardiovascular control mechanisms (arterial baroreceptor function, autonomic nervous
           system function and cerebral autoregulation) that prevent syncope. The purpose of this
           study is to examine the ability of different intensities of aerobic exercise to reverse
           these impairments.

        2. HYPOTHESES: a) Aerobic or strength training will improve the compensatory cardiovascular
           responses that prevent syncope in older adults with Type 2 diabetes. Aerobic training
           will:

             -  increase arterial baroreflex sensitivity

             -  increase heart rate variability (marker of autonomic nervous system function)

             -  decrease cerebrovascular resistance

             -  improve cerebral autoregulation during upright tilt. b) There will be relationship
                between the improvement in compensatory cardiovascular responses and aerobic or
                strength training.

                c) The majority of the benefits of aerobic or strength exercise on the above
                parameters will with which training, allowing for the design of more practicable
                training prescriptions than that used in a research setting.
