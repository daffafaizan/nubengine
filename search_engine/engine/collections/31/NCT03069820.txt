      with an annual incidence of 15 to 50 cases per 100,000 people. NPC is both radiosensitive and
      chemosensitive. Recently, many new drugs including docetaxel and cisplatin have been
      incorporated in the induction chemotherapy phase of NPC. The most common toxicity of TP
      (docetaxel and cisplatin) chemotherapy is chemotherapy-induced liver injury, and appropriate
      management of these toxicities can help patients improve tolerance for chemotherapy. However,
      patients don't always experience same chemotherapy-induced liver injury for the same drugs.
      Therefore, it is important to determine the risk factors to predict chemotherapy-induced
      liver injury. The investigators designed the present study to clarify risk factors associated
      with the development of severe hepatotoxicity after therapy with docetaxel and cisplatin for
      nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).
