      a control group. The experimental group will receive the 1st forgiveness intervention for 12
      weeks and then the control group will turn into an experimental group to receive a 2nd
      forgiveness intervention for 12 weeks.

      In order to assess if such education increases psychological well-being in students
      (children) and teachers (adults), teachers and students in both groups will receive the same
      measures for four times in the study: within one week before the 1st forgiveness
      intervention, within one week after the 1st forgiveness intervention, within one week after
      the 2nd forgiveness intervention, four weeks after the 2nd forgiveness intervention.

      The instruments include: for teachers, the assessment data will consist of the Enright
      Forgiveness Inventory Short Form (EFI-30), the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement
      Information System (PROMIS): Anger, Anxiety, and Depression scales, the Ethnic Prejudice
      Scale, the Herth Hope Index, the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, a Classroom Cooperation scale,
      and a Cross-Cultural Exit Interview (written questionnaire). For students, the assessment
      data will consist of the Enright Forgiveness Inventory for Children (EFI-C), the PROMIS
      measures for pediatric self-report (ages 8-17): Anger, Anxiety, and Depressive Symptoms
      scales, the Ethnic Prejudice Scale for children, the Children's Hope Scale, the Coopersmith
      Self-Esteem Inventory (School Form), and academic achievement (likely to be scores/grades of
      Math, writing and reading in their own language). After the 2nd forgiveness intervention,
      select participants (teachers and children) will take part in individual interviews.
