      at their own discretion. In all centers, patients with ovulatory cycles are typically
      prescribed an NC-FET or mNC-FET, whereas patients with oligomenorrhoea or amenorrhoea are
      prescribed an artificial cycle to prepare the endometrium for FET.

        1. The antagonist protocol

        2. The long 21 /2 agonist protocol Laboratory technique

      a. IVF or b. ICSI Embryo freezing using only vitrification will be performed in days 3 or
      5/6. Embryo transfer will be conducted at days 3 or 5/6. The maximum number of embryos
      transferred will be two, as in accordance to the Hellenic legislation.

      The following modalities will be analyzed, patients with:

        1. Natural cycle, spontaneous ovulation or ovulation triggering by exogenous hCG without
           luteal support (Group 1)

        2. Natural cycle, spontaneous ovulation or ovulation triggering by exogenous hCG with
           luteal support (progesterone) (Group 2)

        3. Hormone Replacement cycle (cyclacur) plus GnRHa suppression with luteal support
           (progesterone) (Group 3)

        4. Hormone Replacement cycle (cyclacur) without GnRHa suppression with luteal support
           (progesterone) (Group 4)

      Of note, the conversion between different supplementation methods may be testimated as
      follows: 0.75 mg of micronised estradiol (oral administration) = 1.25 g of estradiol gel
      (transdermal administration) = 1 mg of estradiol valerate (oral or vaginal adminstration).
