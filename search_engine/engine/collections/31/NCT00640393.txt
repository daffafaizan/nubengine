      reach PASI-90 at Day 84 will be discontinued from the study (they can continue receiving
      commercial etanercept outside the study). Participants remaining in the study at Day 84 will
      decrease etanercept to 50 mg weekly for another 12 weeks.

      Participants who do not attain a 90 percent reduction in PASI from baseline (PASI-90) after
      12 weeks will be randomized (1:1) to receive either etanercept alone or etanercept with short
      courses of narrow band ultra violet B (nbUVB)phototherapy. Participants randomized to the
      nbUVB group will receive nbUVB treatments three times a weeks for at least four weeks. At
      every planned study visit after Day 84, nbUVB treatment will be discontinued in participants
      who reach PASI-90. nbUVB phototherapy will be re-initiated for another four weeks at the
      subsequent planned study visit if they lose their PASI-90 response.

      Efficacy will be evaluated with PASI, BSA and PGA by a blinded evaluator at Days 0, 28, 84,
      112, 140 and 168. The effect of the treatment on quality of life will be evaluated using the
      DLQI questionnaire at Days 112, 140 and 168. Safety will be evaluated by physical examination
      and adverse events evaluation.
