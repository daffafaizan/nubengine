    
      Primary Study Objectives:

        1. To evaluate the efficacy of retapamulin 1% ointment with clobetasol propionate 0.05%
           foam versus vehicle ointment with clobetasol propionate 0.05% foam as a treatment
           regimen for hand or hand/foot atopic dermatitis.

        2. To evaluate the incidence of intranasal and hand/foot S aureus carriage rates in
           subjects with hand/foot atopic dermatitis via cultures of an anterior nare and the most
           severely graded target lesion of the hand/foot dermatitis.

        3. To evaluate the incidence of mupirocin-resistance and methicillin-resistance in S aureus
           isolates in subjects with hand/foot atopic dermatitis via cultures of an anterior nare
           and the most severely graded target lesion of the hand/foot dermatitis.

      Primary and secondary endpoints will be analyzed by appropriate statistical models by a
      qualified statistician. Any results of this pilot study will be treated as exploratory and
      hypothesis generating.
