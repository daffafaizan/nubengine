    
      This is a multicenter, prospective, open-label, randomized, interventional study enrolling
      patients with indications for permanent cardiac pacing according to the current European
      Society of Cardiology Guidelines on Cardiac Pacing. All participants will undergo permanent
      pacemaker implantation for HB or LBB pacing. Subsequently, an invasive electrophysiological
      study (EPS) and ECANS will be performed. The 2 x 2 randomisation will be performed, i.e.
      right vs left side superior ECANS and blinded for operator ultrasonography guided effective
      vs ineffective inferior vagal nerve stimulation). The randomisation will prove the
      feasibility and efficacy of superior ECANS and feasibility, efficacy, and reproducibility of
      ultrasonography guided inferior ECANS. All the measured parameters as well as demographic and
      clinical data will be recorded in the study database. Patients with an exit block or an
      increase in a pacing threshold of an HB/LBB electrode will be further managed by
      electrophysiologists from the research group. The management will be based on clinical
      assessment and patient's decision and may involve pacemaker reprogramming, pacemaker upgrade
      with a back-up pacing electrode implantation, or cardio-neuro-ablation.
