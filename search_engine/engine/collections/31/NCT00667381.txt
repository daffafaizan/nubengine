      combination of arterial pulse palpation, anatomical landmarks, and fluoroscopic landmarks to
      guide needle insertion. Vascular access complications including hematoma formation,
      retroperitoneal bleeding, and arterial dissection are the most common types of adverse events
      associated with cardiac catheterization, and have been associated with insertions above and
      below the level of the common femoral artery. Real-time ultrasound assistance for central
      venous catheter placement has been proven in multiple studies to reduce complications, and
      has been recommended by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality as a "Top 11 Highly
      Proven" patient safety practice. This recommendation has not yet been extended to arterial
      access, due to a lack of studies to date. However, ultrasound assistance is licensed for and
      commonly utilized for arterial access, especially in difficult patients.

      In a pilot study of 71 procedures performed by the lead researcher, ultrasound guidance was
      associated with an improved 1st pass success rate (83% vs 47%, p=0.002), reduced risk of
      accidental venipunctures (0% vs 25%, p=0.002), and greater overall success in common femoral
      artery cannulation (89% vs 69%, p=0.048) as compared with the fluoroscopic control.

      This study is a multicenter prospective randomized trial to generalize the above findings
      with more patients studied, a larger number of operators, and across several centers. Similar
      to the previous study, the ultrasound will be used real-time to visualize the femoral vein,
      femoral artery, and needle tract as the needle is inserted, to guide the needle towards the
      appropriate location in the artery. The time for insertion, number of passes, complications,
      and position of the insertion catheter on the femoral angiogram will be analyzed in the
      setting of patient factors including age, body mass index, and presence of peripheral
      vascular disease.
