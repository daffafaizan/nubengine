      procedures in liver transplantation. Ischemia/reperfusion injury in liver graft results in
      major organ damage including kidney, lung and heart as well as graft dysfunction. Graft
      dysfunction and renal injury after liver transplantation are major clinical issues and are
      associated with prognosis and low survival rate. The incidence of acute kidney injury after
      liver transplantation has been reported to be 17 to 95 percent, but no definite treatment has
      been reported yet. Therefore, it is important to identify and prevent reversible risk factors
      for acute kidney injury after liver transplantation. Previous studies have reported several
      preoperative clinical risk factors, but perioperative medication, metabolic variables
      (albumin, glucose, uric acid), intraoperative colloid administration and hemodynamic
      parameters have not been evaluated. In addition, a neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), which
      has been reported to be related to systemic inflammation and associated with prognosis of
      cardiac and cancer patients, might be related to the development of AKI after LDLT.
      Therefore, we attempt to evaluate these perioperative risk factors and develop simplified
      clinical risk scoring model.
