    
      This is a 6 by 3 cross-over study to evaluate pharmacokinetics of YH22189 FDC compared to
      reference telmisartan/amlodipine and rosuvastatin co-administered in three groups enrolling
      healthy adult male subjects under fasting conditions.

      Subjects will be admitted to the clinic in the evening before Day 1. All subjects will
      receive a single oral dose of YH22189 FDC or telmisartan/amlodipine or rosuvastatin
      administered in the morning on Day 1. All the subjects will remain in the clinical unit until
      completion of all assessments on Day 2 including collection post-dose PK sample. Subjects
      will return to the clinic for pharmacokinetic samples at scheduled time. The three treatment
      periods will be separated by a washout period.
