    
      The AMIS Plus project has two main goals:

        1. To Maintain a Nationwide Registry

             -  An ongoing nationwide registry (databank) of acute coronary syndromes

             -  Description of the patient population with acute coronary syndromes

             -  Description of characteristics of treatment and hospitalization

             -  Description of outcomes 3- and 12-months after admission for ACS

             -  Epidemiological studies, e.g. definition of risk factors of patients with acute
                coronary syndromes, hospital mortality, time and cost-effective strategies as well
                as outcome measures

        2. Quality Control

             -  Evaluation of compliance with guidelines for the medical care of acute coronary
                syndromes

             -  Internal quality control through regular feedback and benchmarking

      Methods

      All Swiss hospitals admitting patients with acute coronary syndrome are eligible. Data are
      collected on demographics, risk factors, symptoms, laboratory results, invasive therapy,
      complications and medication.

      Since the start in January 1997, the method of data collection has continuously improved in
      order to suit the different needs and technological advancements of the participating
      hospitals. Participants can either complete paper questionnaires and send them directly to
      the AMIS Plus Data Center at the Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine in Zurich where
      these questionnaires are then checked and entered online or they can enter data directly
      online (AMIS online questionnaire). Data security has a high priority. Participant
      identification (code for hospital and physician) and a password are required to access the
      data entry form and send data.
