      our centre and assessed in the urology clinic from 2005 to 2019 would be enrolled to the
      study. This study will be conducted by observation; that is, data will be captured from
      medical records and central medical system (CMS), but patients will not be contacted. All the
      demographic and medical background, as well as investigations performed during the assessment
      including uroflowmetry, post-voiding residual, questionnaires, blood pressure, pulse,
