    
      1:1 randomized trial using blocked randomization based on chronologic arrival in clinic, a
      group of patients will be randomized to the standard of care verbal consent (Arm A), or the
      standard of care consent plus the online brachytherapy informed video consent (Arm B). There
      will be three time points for the collection: After the standard consent process as the
      baseline, following the standard only vs standard and educational video consent process prior
      to the first brachytherapy procedure, and prior to the last brachytherapy procedure. The
      patients in the brachytherapy video consent process will be watching this online. The patient
      will be given a specific log in to use, and study researchers will be able to track the
      number of times the patient watches the video and the completion of the video view. The
      patient is allowed to watch the video as many times as desired
