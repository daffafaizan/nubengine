      randomized study of treatment with RAD001 (everolimus (Afinitor®) or sunitinib (Sutent®) in
      subjects with mRCC and non-clear cell histology. Special emphasis is placed on papillary and
      chromophobe histologies while sarcomatoid clear cell variants, medullary, and collecting duct
      carcinomas will be excluded (see eligibility). Subjects may continue receiving study drugs
      until disease progression, unacceptable toxicities, or withdrawal of consent, for a maximum
      of 24 months. Continuation of study assigned treatment will be allowed beyond 24 months at
      the discretion of the sponsor. Stratification variables will include histology (papillary vs.
      chromophobe) and Motzer risk criteria (0, 1-2, and 3). Tumor progression will be assessed
      locally and by independent review, in strict accordance with Response Evaluation Criteria in
      Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1) criteria measured every 12 weeks. At the time of progression,
      subjects will be taken off study other than simple administrative mortality follow-up.
      Primary pathologic samples and plasma/urine angiokine levels at baseline and over time will
      be collected and stored centrally for biomarker analysis.
