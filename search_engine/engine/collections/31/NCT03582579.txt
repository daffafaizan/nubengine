      evidence demonstrates that training can promote beneficial brain plasticity in both healthy
      individuals and clinical populations. Much of the recent interest in brain training can be
      traced back to the seminal work done at the University of Rochester, where Daphne Bavelier
      and colleagues showed that training with action video games (AVG) can lead to a wide range of
      cognitive and perceptual improvements. In our recent work, we developed a novel training
      paradigm that isolates and concentrates the key aspects of AVG-training while eliminating
      complex and often violent gameplay associated with AVGs. The results revealed similarly broad
      effects of training as with conventional AVGs. In this study, we aim to move this training
      paradigm to virtual reality (VR) and extend its application to cognitive aging and mild
      traumatic brain injury (TBI) populations.
