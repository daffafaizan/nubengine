      obtained from healthy subject volunteers. Trained phlebotomists will collect blood samples
      from subjects after confirmation of eligibility criteria. Blood samples will be drawn to fill
      all study syringe types in a randomized order. Each syringe type will be drawn per subject to
      analyze each of the available blood parameters in duplicate using three different
      multi-parameter analyzers. The analytes tested will vary per analyzer capabilities. All blood
      draws and analyte testing will be performed at an independent laboratory. The study is to
      confirm that all of the syringes tested provide consistent readings when analyzed using the
      most common multi-parameter analyzers used in hospital laboratories.
