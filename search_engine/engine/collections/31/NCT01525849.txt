      15 US clinical sites comparing the efficacy of balloon sinus dilation with traditional
      endoscopic sinus surgery. The primary hypotheses were to demonstrate that: 1) long-term
      change in sinus symptoms after balloon dilation is not worse (non-inferior) than after FESS,
      and 2) balloon dilation is superior to FESS for a reduction in the number of postoperative
      debridements per patient. A minimum of 36 participants per arm is required to test the
      primary hypotheses. All participants will be followed through a minimum of 12 months post
      treatment.
