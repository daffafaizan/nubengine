      in older patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) in order to reverse brain metabolic
      adaptations and restore metabolic sensitivity, hypoglycemia awareness and appropriate
      hormonal counterregulatory responses (CRR). For purposes of this study we are looking to
      enroll aged T1DM subjects under insulin pump treatment.
