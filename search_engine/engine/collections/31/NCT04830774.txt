      spread worldwide with more than 100 million confirmed cases to date. COVID-19 is mainly
      characterized by respiratory symptoms; however, patients can exhibit a wide range of clinical
      manifestations, including cardiovascular complications. Among them, supraventricular and
      ventricular arrhythmias have been described in patients at different stages of disease
      severity. According to a recent study on 9564 COVID-19 patients, 17.6% developed AF during
      hospitalization, 65.7% of whom without a past arrhythmic history.

      Several factors (e.g., hypoxia, systemic inflammatory response, myocardial injury) may
      interact with a preexisting substrate and act as a trigger for AF initiation. Nonetheless,
      the pathophysiology of COVID-19-related new-onset AF remains elusive. It is unknown whether
      the disease merely acts as a transient arrhythmia initiator or promotes long-term atrial
      electrophysiological and structural changes which may facilitate AF recurrence and
      progression.

      Therefore, the investigators designed a multicenter, prospective registry to assess the
      natural history of AF via continuous cardiac rhythm monitoring (ILR, PMK, ICD) in patients
      with a first AF episode during COVID-19 hospitalization.
