    
      There are a number of complications of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation.

      The main complications are:

        -  Recurrence (relapse) of the disease for which the transplantation is done (for example,
           leukemia). The relapse usually leads to death.

        -  Acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). This may lead to death.

        -  Chronic GVHD. This may lead to poor quality of life long-term.

      This study is being done to minimize the chances of patients getting relapse and chronic
      GVHD, without increasing the chances of getting acute GVHD.

      At this time, the standard of care approach to treat this condition would be with:

        -  Low dose thymoglobulin (ATG), given on Day -2, -1 and 0.

        -  Cyclosporin (CSA), given from Day -1 through to Day 84.

        -  Methotrexate, given on Days 1, 3, 6 and 11

      CSA reduces the chances of getting acute GVHD, but it does not reduce the chances of getting
      chronic GVHD and increases the chances of getting relapse. ATG reduces both acute and chronic
      GVHD, and does not increase relapse.

      In this study, high dose ATG will be given on days -4, -3, -2, -1 and 0 (instead of only on
      days -2, -1 and 0), no CSA (instead of CSA from day -1 through 84) will be given, and the
      routine dose of methotrexate (unchanged) will be given. We think that this may lead to better
      outcomes.

      Patients will be followed per standard practice of the Alberta Blood and Marrow Transplant
      Program for the development of acute and chronic GVHD, and for relapse.

      Patients will also be asked to complete a quality of life questionnaire 2 years after the
      transplant to assess how their treatment and illness affects their quality of life.
