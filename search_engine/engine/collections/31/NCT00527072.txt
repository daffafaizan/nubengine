      recurrent flaring of thickened, red, scaly patches of skin. Although psoriasis is usually not
      life threatening, these physical discomforts combined with the potential psychological
      effects of the disease may interfere with everyday activities and negatively impact an
      individual's quality of life. Many therapies are available for psoriasis; however, with
      limited effectiveness and significant toxicity. Infliximab is an antibody made in a
      laboratory. Antibodies are proteins that fight other substances in the body that may cause
      infections or diseases. A substance called "tumor necrosis factor" (TNF) naturally occurs in
      the body. TNF is related to the itchy patches of skin (or plaques) of psoriasis. Infliximab
      stops the TNF from working. Other studies have shown that stopping the TNF may reduce the
      plaques. To address the unmet medical need for effective chronic therapies, TNFalpha blockers
      have recently been used to treat patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.
      Etanercept also works by stopping the TNF, but in a different way than infliximab. This
      multi-center, open-label study is designed to test whether or not patients with plaque
      psoriasis who have not responded well to etanercept treatment may benefit from treatment with
      infliximab. Key effectiveness measurements will include the time to onset of symptom
      improvement and health-related quality of life. Safety will be assessed throughout the study.
      Two weeks after their last dose of etanercept, all eligible patients will receive open-label
      5 mg/kg infliximab infusions at Weeks 0, 2, 6, 14, and 22.
