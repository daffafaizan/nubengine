      manifestations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) that occur in all stages of
      disease and are associated with poor outcome. In patients with COPD, bioelectrical impedance
      analysis (BIA) has usually been used to estimate fat-free mass (FFM) and body composition
      through predictive equations. Very few studies had focused on raw BIA data. The aim of this
      study is first describe the measurement of phase angle in patients with with acute
      exacerbation and second to determine the validity of phase angle in this group by assessing
      its relationship with established markers of function, disease severity and prognosis.
