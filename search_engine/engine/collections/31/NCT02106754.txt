           alcohol problems (academic, social, injuries, intoxicated driving, unprotected sex), b)
           abuse/dependence, c) past 4 week binge drinking. 1B) This will be repeated to predict
           risk prospectively over 12 months. Classification rates will be compared for race,
           ethnicity, gender, and age groups.

        2. A) To evaluate SN, SP, PP and NP of the 2-question Screener to detect a) 30-day drug
           use, b) 30-day cigarette use, c) conduct disorder, d) unprotected sex. 2B) This will be
           repeated to predict risk prospectively over 12 months. Classification rates will be
           compared for race, ethnicity, gender, and age groups. 3) To evaluate BI as compared to
           usual procedures. The investigators hypothesize those youths in BI will a) receive more
           services, b) be more satisfied with services, c) rate the relationship with the PO more
           highly, and d) have improved outcomes (alcohol, alcohol-related problems, problem
