      than female. Gender-related factors may be involved in the pathogenesis of BC.

      Studies have suggested that androgen-receptors may be present in the bladder and potentially
      involved in BC aetiology, thus making BC susceptible for androgen deprivation therapy (ADT).

      Currently treatment for BC includes surgery or radiation therapy. ADT include Degarelix,
      which besides decreasing testosterone, has been shown to reduce the occurrence of BC in rats
      and promote stem cell recovery following radiation therapy.

      Hypothesis ADT will lower the incidence of BC, and the prognosis of BC will vary depending on
      the type of ADT used. Furthermore Degarelix administered during radiation therapy for BC will
      reduce the degree of fibrosis in the bladder thus decreasing adverse side effects.

      Methods A cohort of patients treated with ADT for PC will be compared to two cohorts of
      age-matched men with and without PC both without ADT. The incidence of BC will be recorded
      for every group. Furthermore the cohort of patients with PC and ADT will be divided into
      subgroups, depending of the type of ADT they have received and the degree of deprivation.
      They will be compared in terms of incidence and prognosis of BC.

      Finally, a small pilot study will be conducted to investigate the effect of Degarelix when
      administered during radiation therapy for BC.

      Perspectives This will be one of the largest studies to investigate the potential influence
      of sex hormones in the development and prognosis of BC and potentially lead to new treatment
      options and possibly a new way of reducing radiation side effects.
