      hyperthyroidism may be associated with any form of sexual dysfunction in men but only a few
      studies reported the relationship between thyroid dysfunction and female sexuality.

      The study is an observational study. An informed consent will be obtained from all patients
      before the study.

      The aim of the study is:

        -  to evaluate the incidence of sexual dysfunction in presence of dysthyroidism and the
           impact of restoring euthyroidism on female sexual function (evaluated with the Female
           Sexual Function Index)

        -  to evaluate the influence of hormonal changes on the emotional and psychological
           wellness (evalueted with the Middle Sex Hospital Questionnaire)

        -  to evaluate the influence of hormonal changes on the satisfaction of body image
           (evalueted with the Body Uneasiness Test)

        -  to evaluate the influence of hormonal changes on the distress related to sexuality
           (evaluated with the Female Sexual Distress Scale).
