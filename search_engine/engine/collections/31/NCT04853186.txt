        1. Clinical cholera surveillance to measure cholera diseases incidence in selected African
           hotspots targeted by vaccination.

        2. Serial serological surveys to measure the prevalence of recent cholera infection (within
           the last 12 months).

        3. Identification and follow up of individuals with positive V. cholerae shedding
           (symptomatic or asymptomatic) among sero-survey participants and among household members
           of cholera confirmed cases.

      The present protocol relates to the setup of clinical surveillance and the follow up of
      individuals with positive V. cholerae shedding identified through clinical surveillance, in
      DRC.

      This protocol will allow us to assess if a large vaccination campaign reaching high coverage
      in cholera hotspot in Africa can allow sustained control of cholera for at least two years,
      by fulfilling the following specific objectives:

        -  To measure cholera incidence rates following the mass vaccination campaign in two
           cholera hotspots in Africa.

        -  To assess the duration of shedding among vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals and the
           duration of viable V. cholerae in the peri-household environment.

        -  To measure the secondary cholera attack rates (symptomatic and asymptomatic) at
           household level among vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals following the
           identification of an index case in a given household.

        -  To describe the global genetic diversity of V. cholerae strains in the study areas and
           within households affected by cholera.

        -  To develop sustainable surveillance methods that could be applied in other hotspots in
           Africa and elsewhere aiming to monitor the impact of the cholera control program.
