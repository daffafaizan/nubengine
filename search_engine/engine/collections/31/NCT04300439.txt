      single-use ancillary group or conventional ancillary group. Only the medical team and the
      block staff will be informed about the ancillary group, not the patient.

      The use of the single-use ancillary does not induce any modification of the surgical
      technique for fitting a TKA. The surgical approach is unchanged and is specific to the
      surgeon. The appearance and use of the single-use ancillary are similar to the conventional
      ancillary except for the materials used for their design. Please note that a preliminary
      training at the beginning of the study will be carried out with the different investigators
      so that they can handle the different medical devices.

      In total, 48 participants will be randomized. The medico-economics assessments will be
      performed for 20 patients (10 per group) by micro-costing to evaluate the preoperative,
      intraoperative and post-operative costs : reconditioning time, sterilization and transport
      time, preparation time and duration of intervention. The qualitative score of subjective
      assessment of the operator's perception of the ancillary measured during the intervention.
      The participants will evaluate their QOL by completing a questionnaire 3 month and 12 month
      postoperative. The safety parameters will also be collected.
