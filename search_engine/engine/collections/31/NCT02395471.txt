      utility of the Cytosponge device as a non-endoscopic method for collecting surface cells from
      the esophagus. This study will enroll 2 groups of subjects: 1) Subjects presenting for
      routine endoscopic BE surveillance examinations (n=120), and 2) Subjects with
      gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) symptoms undergoing upper endoscopy for screening for
      BE (n=55). After informed consent, and on the same day as the endoscopic procedure, the
      subject will undergo administration of the Cytosponge device and complete a questionnaire.
      The subject will then undergo routine upper endoscopy, with assessment of BE (where
      applicable), and biopsy per accepted surveillance or screening recommendations. The
      Cytosponge will be placed in fixative and shipped to an accredited pathology laboratory for
      embedding in paraffin and hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining to assess the adequacy of the
      specimen. Further evaluation of the specimen may be performed using trefoil factor 3 (TFF3).
      If the Cytosponge tissue specimen is inadequate, the subject will be recalled for a repeat
      sponge procedure (not endoscopy) 30 days later. Routine care tissue biopsies will undergo
      standard processing and H&E staining at the home institution, with assessment by expert
      gastrointestinal pathologists. Subjects will be contacted via phone 7 days (+/- 2 days) after
      Cytosponge administration to complete additional questionnaires and assess adverse events.
