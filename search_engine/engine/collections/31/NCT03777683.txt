    
      Randomization:

      investigators randomly assign eligible patients on enrolment (1:1) to either the control
      group or the intervention group. Randomization is stratified by site and a randomization list
      of unique patient identifiers is generated by the study statistician using a
      computer-generated random block size. The classification is based on age (18 to 40 and 40 to
      65 years old), gender (male / female) and APACHEII score (0 to 35 and 35 to 71) using
      quadruple blocks.
