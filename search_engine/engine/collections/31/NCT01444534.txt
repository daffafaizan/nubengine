      doctor or the hospital-based nurse specialised in the care for diabetes patients. All
      participants in this study were adults with T1DM having a smartphone.

      All participants will complete the The Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) and the Problem Areas
      In Diabetes questionnaire (PAID) at baseline and after three months of follow-up. Baseline
      information, including socio demographic information (age, sex, highest level of school
      education), and clinical characteristics (diabetes duration, insulin therapy and presence and
      severity of diabetes complications) will be collected in a database. Moreover parameters such
      as blood pressure, body weight, HbA1c and lipid profile will be added.

      Sample size calculation

      The study was powered to detect a between-group mean difference of 10 points in the The Short
      Form Health Survey (SF-36) questionnaire after 3 months. With a power of 80%, alpha 0.05, the
      total sample size of the study should be 62 patients (31 in each group).
