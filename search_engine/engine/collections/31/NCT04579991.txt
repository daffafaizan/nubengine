      product. Visnadin is an active ingredient which has the vasodilator effect and improve blood
      flow to female vulvovaginal area. This will improve lubrication from increase Bartholin's
      gland secretion. As the clitoral blood flow increase, the sexual response could be improved.
      The ethyl ximeninate, coleus barbatus and millet are plant extract which have moisturizer,
      anti-inflammation and antioxidant effects. Our hypothesis is a daily topical visnadin, ethyl
      ximeninate, coleus barbatus and millet in emulgel could improved sexual function and
      vulvovaginal atrophic symptoms in postmenopausal women with vulvovaginal atrophy.
