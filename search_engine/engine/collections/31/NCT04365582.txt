      patient with respiratory symptoms and risk factors for poor outcome can improve the prognosis
      of these patient and decrease the need for hospital admission.

      Our study is an open label randomized clinical trial comparing 4 arms of treatment: Standards
      of Care (SoC) alone versus SoC + Azithromycine versus SoC + Hydroxychloroquine vs Soc +
      Lopinavir/Ritonavir.

      Our involved population is patients more than 50 years of age with comorbidity or patients
      more than 70 years of age.

      Our primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of early outpatient treatment compared to
      standard of care in patients COVID-19 with risk factors for poor outcome. The criteria is
      hospital admission at Day 20 and the hospital admission rate will be compared between groups
      by a ChiÂ² test or a Fisher's exact test.
