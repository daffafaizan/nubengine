    
      The primary purpose of this study is to compare caries detection rates between conventional
      intraoral bitewing radiography and a stationary intraoral digital tomosynthesis (s-IOT) using
      a carbon nanotube X-ray source array. Patient experience with the s-IOT device will be assess
      using a short questionnaire.

      Fifty adult patients who have been referred to the Section of Oral and Maxillofacial
      Radiology (OMR) at the University of North Carolina (UNC) School of Dentistry (SOD) for
      horizontal bitewing (BW) radiographs or a Full Mouth Series (FMX) with horizontal bitewing
      radiographs will be recruited for the study.

      Participants will receive an experimental s-IOT bitewing radiograph on each side of their
      mouth and a visual exam to look for caries. Experienced observers will assess the presence or
      absence of caries using the two imaging modalities. The results of their analysis will be
      evaluated to determine statistical difference. Participants completed questionnaires will be
      tabulated and the data will be analyzed using descriptive statistics.
