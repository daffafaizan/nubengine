      condition leading to the majority of hospital admissions in young children. It is also
      probably the most common serious illness of childhood lacking evidence-based treatment.
      Evidence against the effectiveness of chest physiotherapy with vibration and postural
      drainage techniques has been described but forced expiratory technique, as described in
      France, has never been evaluated.

      The investigators hypothesised that forced expiratory technique was able to reduce the
      duration of respiratory distress.

      Comparison(s): The investigators compare physiotherapy with forced expiratory techniques to
      simple aspiration of naso-pharyngeal secretions.
