      anxiety disorders and are directly related to treatment outcomes in different anxiety
      disorders. In this study we will examine the relation between positive and negative affect,
      emotion regulation, emotional instability, emotional differentiation, experiential avoidance
      and therapy outcomes in participants undergoing Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy for Flight
      Phobia. We assume that treatment outcomes will be positively related to changes in the
      regulation, management and experience of emotions.
