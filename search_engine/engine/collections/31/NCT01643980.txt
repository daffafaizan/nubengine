      responsible of greatest of 50% neonatal morbimortality and heavy costs. Despite the
      significant medical advances, the rate of prematurity has not declined over the past 40 years
      and even continues to rise in the developed countries. In order to decrease the prematurity
      is necessary that two premises: to identify the pregnant women at risk of preterm birth, and
      dispose of useful measures aimed at prolonging the pregnancy and therefore avoid preterm
      delivery. Since 1990, many published articles describe the sonographic measurement of the
      cervix from the week 16 as method of population screening to detect women at risk. Several
      studies provide evidence about an inverse relationship between the cervical length and the
      risk of preterm delivery. For this reason, if there is an effective intervention for patients
      with cervix short (about < 25mm), made this measure in the middle of the second term, the
      investigators could reduce the prematurity. Regarding possible therapeutic strategies, recent
      published data demonstrate the effective of vaginal progesterone and cervical pessary in this
      population. However, both treatments have never been compared and none of the two strategies
      are indicated in this population. Therefore it results necessary to compare both treatments
      in order to establish clinical recommendations. The investigators propose a clinical trial to
      compare two accepted strategies: administration of progesterone (vaginally) or the placement
      of vaginal pessaries in order to reduce the premature birth (34 weeks and earlier) rate in
      the population of pregnant women at risk for premature birth, which will be identified by
      ultrasound during the second trimester of their pregnancy.
