      participants by conducting 1-2 hour semi-structured interviews on Zoom. The interview
      questions are designed to systemically inquire about patient experiences, affective
      reactions, coping strategies, social support, self-identity issues, and treatment
      experiences. The investigators will collect quantitative data by asking participants to
      complete The Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire. The data will be analyzed using a
      comprehensive stress and coping model, which has not been done previously in the field. The
      investigators hope to discover themes about psychosocial burdens and related coping
      mechanisms.
