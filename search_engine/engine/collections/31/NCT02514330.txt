      of different valences usually stimulated in the same session. When aerobic activities of long
      duration prior isokinetic strength exercises, isotonic, or explosive, deleterious effects
      seem to be induced on performance of these valences. These short and long-term changes in
      muscle strength and power would be directly associated with repetitive eccentric loads that
      characterize the endurance running. Gradual increases in the running slope were inversely
      associated with a proportional reduction in the eccentric loads, which in turn would result
      in less muscle damage to intra and extrafusal fibers. So, the change in the slope of the race
      would emerge as an optional way to neutralize the competitive effect on the power
      performance. The research consisted of five visits. At the initial visit was conducted
      familiarization to vertical drop jump, and immediately after, the determination of VO2max
      values and their associated speed (vVO2max). The second visit was a new familiarization for
      the vertical drop jump followed immediately determining the Time to exhaustion performance in
      vVO2max (100% of VO2Max). Two jumps were performed on each of the three selected heights (20,
      30 and 40 cm) were used in the experimental sessions and control only the height associated
      with the highest performance. In subsequent visits (third to fifth), participants performed
      three maximum jumps before and about 10 min after the following conditions: high intensity
      Interval running a 10% gradient (C10%), 1% grade (C1%) and control condition (CON).
