      Primary

        -  To investigate the effect of sunitinib malate on the progression-free survival of
           patients with stage IIIB or IV non-small cell lung cancer Secondary

        -  To evaluate the toxicity of sunitinib when administered in the maintenance setting.

        -  To evaluate the additional response rate to sunitinib malate when administered in the
           maintenance setting.

        -  To evaluate the overall survival of patients treated with sunitinib. After completion of
           study treatment, patients are followed every 2 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 1
           year, and periodically for 3 years.
