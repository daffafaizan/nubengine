      diseases throughout its history. Within the population in general, periodontal diseases
      exhibit great expressiveness, they appear as the most common chronic diseases, but in the
      indigenous population there is a certain epidemiological invisibility. In this population
      there is a shortage in the studies, some of these show that the higher prevalences of
      insertion level and depth of probing occur in individuals with more advanced age and that
      they are afflicted with periodontal diseases. The objective of this cross - sectional
      observational study will be to evaluate the oral conditions of indigenous people in the state
      of Roraima, comparing habits and hygiene conditions in each ethnicity evaluated. This project
      was submitted to the Coordination of the Yanomami Indigenous Special Sanitary District, the
      CONDISI presidency and the CASAI leadership. Around 200 indigenous people from the
      aforementioned ethnic groups, of both sexes, aged between 18 and 75 years, will be evaluated,
      with voluntary participation and by means of the signature of the free and informed consent
      form of the same or its person in charge. Due to the difficulties encountered in the
      indigenous communities in relation to the distance from health care, where there are no care
      centers near their residence and thus not obtaining the information necessary for basic
      health care, with the aggravation of contact with the culture. Indigenous people with often
      deleterious eating habits, we expect to find a population with many oral health problems,
      such as periodontal disease, dental caries and tooth loss. The insufficiency of studies with
      appropriate methodology gives the indigenous peoples of Latin America an epidemiological
      invisibility that impairs the production of knowledge about oral health conditions and the
      elaboration of strategies to prevent oral diseases and promote health in these populations.
