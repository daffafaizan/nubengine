      fenofibrate and propranolol impact burn patient outcomes. The investigators hypothesize that
      these metabolic regulators given for one year will maintain body mass, improve muscle
      function by increasing protein synthesis, augment wound healing, reduce fibrosis, improve
      cardiovascular function, reduce systemic inflammation, restore insulin sensitivity, and
      decrease liver dysfunction without the risk of the hypoglycemia.
