      Non-Interventional Cohort will be at least 36 months. The study also includes retrieval of
      retrospective data entered into the registry for 36 months before the initiation of Kalydeco
      treatment, from patients matched for Non-Interventional Cohorts. This will permit a
      within-group comparison of outcomes before and after Kalydeco treatment for effectiveness and
      safety. The interventional cohort will not be utilized.
