    
      Objective of the study:

      Assess the feasibility of preoperative treatment with pertuzumab and trastuzumab combined
      with preoperative chemoradiation (carboplatin, paclitaxel and radiation) in terms of
      withdrawal rate from surgery.

      Study design:

      This is a non-randomized feasibility study with Paclitaxel (T), Carboplatin (C), Pertuzumab
      (P). Trastuzumab (H), and radiation (RT) followed by surgical resection of the oesophagus.

      Study population:

      Patients (male/female) with histologically proven adenocarcinoma of the intrathoracic
      esophagus or gastro esophageal junction, age >18 and <75 years.

      Intervention (if applicable):

      Paclitaxel 50 mg/m2 and Carboplatin AUC = 2 will be given by intravenous infusion on days 1,
      8, 15, 22 and 29.

      Trastuzumab will be administered at a dose of 4 mg/kg on day 1, followed by 2 mg/kg at wk
      2-6. From wk 7 onwards trastuzumab is administered at a dose of 6 mg/kg every 3 weeks.
      Pertuzumab will be given 840 mg intravenously at each administration.

      Thus, trastuzumab and pertuzumab will be continued during eight weeks after the end of
      chemoradiation. Surgery will be planned in or around week 14, approximately eight weeks after
      the end of chemoradiation.
