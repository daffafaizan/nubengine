      During general anesthesia, up to 90% of patients will develop atelectasis, which is thought
      to be a major contributing factor to their development. The adjustment of ventilator settings
      to prevent the occurrence of atelectasis and reduce pulmonary complications remains
      controversial. Despite the use of similar mechanical ventilation strategies, two recent
      studies (IMPROVE, PROVHILO) involving 1300 patients diverged in their conclusions regarding
      the impact of these strategies in the prevention of pulmonary complications. In these
      studies, the absence of imagery to assess the pulmonary end-result of the different
      ventilation strategies complicates the interpretation of their results.

      On arrival in the operating theatre, each patient will undergo a baseline lung ultrasound
      examination. The anesthetic technique and monitoring will be standardized. The radial artery
      will be cannulated after induction of anesthesia for blood gas monitoring. Ventilator
      settings will be adjusted according to randomization.

      A second lung ultrasound examination will be performed 5 minutes following induction of
      general anesthesia. In the PEEP group, a lung ultrasound examination will be performed
      immediately following the first recruitment maneuver. A lung ultrasound examination will also
      be performed at the end of surgery before emergence of general anesthesia.

      Fifteen minutes after arrival in the recovery room, a last lung ultrasound examination will
      be performed. Fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) and vital signs will be recorded during each
      ultrasound examination. Arterial blood samples will be collected simultaneously. The aeration
      score will be calculated for each lung ultrasound examination.
