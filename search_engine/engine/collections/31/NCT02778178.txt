      parallel group, of superiority, in intention to treat, monocentric study.

      The main steps of the study are:

        -  preoperative assessment of eligibility

        -  exclusion and inclusion criteria, written informed consent, baseline preoperative
           assessment (see specific section)

        -  randomization (using a computer generated list) immediately before induction of
           anesthesia

        -  TAP block: ropivacaine + clonidine (experimental group, n=20) OR saline (control group;
           n=20)

        -  anesthesia (propofol, sufentanil, cisatracurium, ketamine and desflurane) and
           postoperative analgesia (paracetamol, ketoprofen, nefopam, and patient-controlled
           analgesia with morphine) similar in both groups

        -  surgical procedure

        -  primary outcome parameter (morphine consumption first 24 hours; see specific section)

        -  secondary endpoints (see specific section, up to 6 months following surgery)
