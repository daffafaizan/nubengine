    
      This is a study of guselkumab in participants with active PsA who are biologically naive and
      have had inadequate response to standard therapies. It will evaluate the clinical efficacy of
      guselkumab in the reduction of signs and symptoms, structural damage inhibition and the
      safety profile of guselkumab in the treatment of PsA. The study will consist of a screening
      phase (up to 6 weeks), a blinded treatment phase (approximately 100 weeks) including a
      placebo controlled period from Week 0 to Week 24 and an active treatment period from Week 24
      to Week 100 and a safety follow-up phase of 12 weeks after the last administration of study
      agent. Efficacy, health economics, safety, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity, biomarker and
      pharmacogenomics evaluations will be performed in the study at defined schedule.
