      I. To investigate the safety of the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab with radiation
      treatment for definitive management of patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma
      of the head and neck.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the 1 year progression-free survival (PFS) in all patients treated.

      II. To assess the overall response rate and overall survival of patients at one year

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore whether PDL1 expression is associated with treatment response. II. To explore
      whether there is a net change in the Th1/Th2 ratio (IFN-gamma, IL-4, IL10, etc) or cell
      subset frequencies (M2 monocytes, myeloid-derived suppressor cells, etc) within a patient's
      peripheral blood either at baseline or in response to treatment is associated with treatment
      response.

      III. To explore whether exosomes or other immune related serum biomarkers change after
      combination therapy.
