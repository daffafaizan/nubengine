      radiolabelled glucose by tumour cells. PET might detect neck tumours better than other
      imaging tests. This is a cohort study in which patients with N2 N3 squamous cell carcinoma of
      the head and neck undergo a PET and a CT scan at baseline and then post-radiation therapy and
      chemotherapy. Then, they undergo neck dissection surgery. The PET and CT results are compared
      with the presence or absence of tumours in the neck nodes. If PET is sufficiently accurate in
      predicting the presence or absence of tumours in the neck nodes, then a neck dissection could
      be avoided.
