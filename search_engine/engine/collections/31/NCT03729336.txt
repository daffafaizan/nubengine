    
      Female patients presenting to the Baylor Scott & White Health (Temple, TX) Urology clinic for
      complaints of lower urinary tract symptoms will be included. They will be approached by a
      clinical research coordinator and given more information. If they meet eligibility by
      screening, consents will be completed.

      Patients will proceed with their regular clinic visit with their clinician. Just prior to the
      physical exam, patients will use the PEEZY device to give a urine specimen in the privacy of
      the bathroom. The package with PEEZY includes the simple instructions for use. Patients
      return to the clinic room and the physical exam proceeds. An in-and-out catheter is used to
      obtain a post-void residual as well as a control urine specimen. After the remainder of the
      patient routine exam is complete, they will fill out a brief questionnaire.

      The 2 specimens will then be delivered to the lab. The clinical research coordinator will
      store consents and questionnaires that include the subjects study identification number in
      individual opaque envelopes that will be kept in a locked drawer accessible to only the
      investigators.
