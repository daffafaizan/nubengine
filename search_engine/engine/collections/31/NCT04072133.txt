      helpful for body composition improvement. Less strenuous forms of exercise that include a
      focus on the breath and meditative state (i.e., "meditative movement" such as Yoga, Qigong,
      or Tai Chi) may be easier to adopt for unfit, sedentary, overweight or obese women, which
      characterizes a large percentage of the general population. Despite this preliminary
      evidence, no studies have proposed a model for how or why weight loss might occur in MM
      interventions where the goals are not designated as weight loss, nutritional counseling is
      not included, and energy expenditure is not at the level assumed to be required to achieve
      weight loss. The proposed intervention is designed to refine and gather preliminary evidence
      for a novel "mindful-body-wisdom" model of intervening on improving body composition and to
      examine the contribution of model factors (psychological and behavioral) of how such a
      non-diet/non-vigorous exercise intervention might work, in 60 midlife women.

      TCE is a simple TC/QG form that was developed by Dr. Roger Jahnke and developed into a
      standardized research intervention protocol by a team of researchers. It has been used in
      several prior projects and one recently completed NIH/NCCAM-funded randomized controlled
      trial (RCT) with breast cancer survivors showing reduction in fatigue and depression, and
      improved sleep and physical function.
