      enrolled in the study. Patients will undergo standard (routine) of care treatment, either
      conservative or surgical or both, and followed up during one year after the initiation of the
      treatment. Treatment outcome (development of the condition), pain and complications will be
      collected and documented over the duration of the registry.
