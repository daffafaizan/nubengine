      Patients will be identified by clinical investigators at participating centers. Patients who
      sign the screening consent patients will undergo an MRD assessment with the clonoSEQÂ® assay.
      If the assessment identifies the patient to be MRD negative, the patient will undergo a
      repeat MRD assessment no less than 28 days later. If two consecutive MRD assessments indicate
      MRD-negativity, the patient will then be directed to sign the study intervention phase
      informed consent form and will undergo the rest of the screening process.

      Enrollment

      Once the patient fulfills all eligibility criteria, the patient will be enrolled into one of
      two cohorts based on the type of therapy they are receiving at the time of enrolled:

      Cohort A: Venetoclax monotherapy at time of enrollment.

      Cohort B: Venetoclax with anti CD20 monoclonal antibody at time of enrollment (The latter
      includes patients who initiated anti CD20 monoclonal antibody with venetoclax and have since
      completed the anti CD20 monoclonal antibody portion of the regimen.)
