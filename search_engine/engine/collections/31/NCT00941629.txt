      served in Iraq and Afghanistan (OEF/OIF). Despite unprecedented efforts by the Dept. of
      Defense (DoD) and Dept. of Veterans Affairs (VA) to treat these service personnel with mental
      disorders, significant gaps in the continuum of care for psychological health remain,
      specifically related to which services are offered, where services are offered, and who
      receives services. The DoD and VA have also attempted to address problems with accessibility
      through the development of a video teleconference (VTC) network to ensure that service
      members have access to top-quality specialized medical care regardless of their geographical
      location. Provision of medical treatment over VTC is often referred to as telemedicine;
      telemental health (TMH) refers to the provision of mental health treatment over the same
      system. A handful of studies have shown that psychiatry (primarily medication management)
      delivered over TMH systems can be as effective as face-to-face (FTF) treatment as long as the
      equipment and band-width are capable of delivering the communication in near real time.TMH is
      an increasingly common method of providing psychological treatment to service members with
      PTSD and other mental health problems, and yet there are no randomized trials of TMH
      provision of an empirically validated treatment for PTSD compared with FTF treatment.
      Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the treatment outcomes of patients with PTSD treated
      with CPT either remotely via TMH or traditionally in FTF treatment.
