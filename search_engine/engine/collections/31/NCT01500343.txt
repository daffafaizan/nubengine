      and functional intestinal disorders, increased enteropathogenic bacteria concentration,
      bacterial translocation and inflammatory activation, thus contributing for clinical worsening
      and progression of the disease.

      In clinical practice, probiotics has been used in several different conditions, as
      inflammatory bowel diseases, acute and antibiotic-associated diarrhea, food allergies, and
      cancer, showing benefits in inflammation and reducing bacterial translocation. However, the
      use of probiotics in heart failure has never been described.
