      response to the seasonal influenza virus vaccine in patients 12-21 years of age with asthma.
      Benralizumab will be given subcutaneously (SC) at Weeks 0, 4, and 8 weeks, at which time
      benralizumab levels will reach steady state. Patients will then receive 1 dose of
      intramuscular (IM) seasonal influenza virus vaccine at Week 8 and samples drawn at Week 8 and
      Week 12 to measure the antibody response to the influenza virus
