      of children with uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria under "real life conditions" in West
      Africa. Important parameters, such as concomitant medication, the patient's medical history
      and diseases, differential WBC counts, the presence of parasitaemia as well as the patient's
      compliance are evaluated. Detailed recording of possible AEs and SAEs enable additionally an
      assessment of the safety and effectiveness of Artequin Paediatric over a period of 63 days
      following treatment initiation. The present study primarily serves to detect and assess
      possible neuropsychiatric and neurological events in young children using a standardized
      questionnaire and axamination.
