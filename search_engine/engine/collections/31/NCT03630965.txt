      consented and enrolled to receive either a video describing CPR and it's outcomes after
      standard of care code discussions versus standard of care code discussions alone. All
      participants will complete a short questionnaire to determine their knowledge level regarding
      CPR and to assess their anxiety levels. Patients who view the video will also rate their
      comfort level while watching the video on a 5 point Likert scale.
