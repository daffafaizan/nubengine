    
      This is a single-center, randomized, controlled trial (RCT), comparing bedside US-guided
      trocar technique versus the US-guided Seldinger technique for percutaneous cholecystostomy
      (PC). The study will randomize a total of 100 consecutive patients (50 in each group)
      undergoing PC at one large tertiary university hospital. The primary endpoints will be
      technical success and procedure-related complication rates. Secondary endpoints will be
      procedural duration, pain assessment, and clinical success after up to 3 months of follow-up.
