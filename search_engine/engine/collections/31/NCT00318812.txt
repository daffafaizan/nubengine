      associated with significant morbidity. Conventional treatment with oral iron salts or IV iron
      formulations are costly and are associated with side effects. Heme iron polypeptide is a
      newly available formulation of oral iron which can be administered orally, is well absorbed
      by uremic patients, and has potentially fewer side effects.

      Comparison: Iron deficient anemic patients will be randomized to either oral heme iron
      polypeptide or IV iron sucrose for six months.
