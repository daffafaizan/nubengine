    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the clinical utility of images collected by an iPhone application (app)
      MoleMapper, and a professional grade portable imaging system (Visiomed microDERM DL200evo
      imaging system or 'Visiomed'), a commonly used polarized-light dermatoscope, the DermLite DL4
      joined to a research iPhone used by the MoleMapper team, as well as assessment of the use of
      in vivo confocal microscopy for teledermatology.

      II. To incorporate in vivo confocal images into the triage system in order to determine to
      what degree the information gathered in this modality changes the classification of a lesion
      assigned by a board-certified dermatologist.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants undergo imaging of suspicious moles via iPhone app MoleMapper, Visiomed, and
      confocal microscopy. Participants then receive lidocaine subcutaneously (SC) and undergo
      shave or punch biopsy of suspected melanomas.
