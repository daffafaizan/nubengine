      outcome in acute ischemic stroke. However, its role in outcome in thrombolysed ischemic
      stroke patients remains uncertain. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of T-I as a
      predictive biomarker of short-term outcome in thrombolysed ischemic stroke patients. Methods:
      This study included 72 acute ischemic stroke participants were treated with intravenous
      thrombolytic therapy. All participants were subjected to general and neurological evaluation
      including assessment of stroke severity using National Institute of Health Stroke Scale
      (NIHSS) at admission and investigations including measurement of serum level of T-I on
      admission. Outcome was assessed three months after stroke onset using NIHSS and modified
      Rankin scale (mRS).
