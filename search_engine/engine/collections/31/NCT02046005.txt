      communication that includes biomarker, genetic and lifestyle RA risk factors. This risk
      calculator is referred to as the Personalized Risk Estimator for Rheumatoid Arthritis
      (PRE-RA) which will be used in the PRE-RA Family Study. A 3-arm randomized trial will be
      conducted among 222 RA first degree relatives that will be followed for one year.
      Participants will be surveyed before and after RA education concerning (i) knowledge and
      attitudes about RA risk, (ii) decisional balance related to behaviors, and (iii) stage of
      behavior change concerning lifestyle risks.

      At the initial study visit, participants will be randomly assigned to one of three arms. Arm
      1 participants will receive general education about RA (comparison group). These participants
      will be followed to assess for willingness to change behaviors associated with RA risk. Arm 2
      participants will receive personalized risk by the personalized RA risk tool (PRE-RA). These
      participants will be followed to assess for willingness to change RA risk behaviors. Arm 3
      participants will receive personalized risk by the online risk tool along with health
      education and counseling (PRE-RA Plus group). These participants will be followed to assess
      for willingness to change RA risk behaviors.
