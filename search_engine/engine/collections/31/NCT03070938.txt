    
      The purpose of the case series is to assess the ability of PuraPly AM to meet wound specific
      treatment goals including management of bioburden, support of granulation tissue formation
      and support of wound closure. Patients will undergo clinical assessments and receive the
      standard of care as determined by the treating physician.

      The case series is being undertaken to better understand PuraPly AM utilization and
      subsequent healing outcomes as well as to evaluate the effects of concomitant wound therapy
      on healing. Patient's participation may involve follow-up for up to 12 weeks following
      application of PuraPly AM.
