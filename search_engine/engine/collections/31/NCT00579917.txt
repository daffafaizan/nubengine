      increased five-fold over the last decade. Among the cancers treated with BMT/SCT are
      Hodgkin's Lymphoma, non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma, multiple myeloma, and leukemias such as acute
      lymphoblastic (ALL), acute myelogenous (AML), chronic lymphocytic (CLL), and chronic
      myelogenous (CML). With the development of non-myeloablative transplants (either "mini" or
      reduced intensity transplants) for patients unable to tolerate standard BMT/SCT, the use of
      this procedure is expected to increase substantially over the next five years. BMT/SCT
      adversely affects almost every aspect of the patient's life (1;2). A standard (fully
      ablative) transplant involves conditioning with dose intensive chemotherapy, with or without
      total body irradiation.

      Although various medical regimens and supportive psychosocial services are used to reduce the
      intensity of these side effects, symptoms may persist. Moreover, the drugs used to control
      side effects often have aversive side effects of their own. Thus, patients must tolerate a
      protracted course of treatment that is highly aversive and invasive at a time when their
      lives are disrupted and they are fearful about their survival. A common complaint among
      survivors is that such problems go unaddressed, and these types of adjustment problems appear
      to become most intense in the first year post treatment, when physical functioning has
      stabilized and contact with the BMT/SCT clinical care team wanes (5;10).
