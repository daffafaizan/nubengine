      angina attacks. Coronary spasm provocation test, as a diagnostic golden standard, has been
      widely used for the management of VSA according to JCS 2013 guidelines.

      With regard to the characteristics of spasm segment, had been clearly described by other
      invasive imaging methods including intravascular ultrasound and optical coherence tomography.
      However, there is potential risk during these invasive procedures, such as severe myocardial
      ischemia or fatal arrhythmia.

      Presently available imaging test for coronary artery disease including multi-detector
      computed tomography angiography (MDCTA) with high diagnostic accuracy to evaluate coronary
      artery stenosis. However, the diagnostic accuracy of MDCTA in patients with VSA is lacking.

      Therefore, more efficient and safe noninvasive diagnostic method is required for the
      detection of angina-like attacks patients.
