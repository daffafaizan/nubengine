      cholecystectomy, can lead to about 15% of pulmonary atelectasis.

      According to literature, Low Pressure Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy, LPLC；8-10mmHg is thought
      to probably decrease cardio-pulmonary related complications and postoperative pain. However,
      most of the existing study have combined population with all age scale, bringing bias to the
      result. Our study aim to evaluate the potential pulmonary benefit of low pressure
      laparoscopic cholecystectomy in elderly or patients accompanied with cardio-pulmonary
      disorders.
