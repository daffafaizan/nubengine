      study. Patients will undergo a sleep test and if positive for Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA)
      will continue in the study.

      At the time of enrolment baseline history and physical examination will be assessed. Baseline
      lab samples will also be obtained to measure levels of fasting blood glucose, insulin, HbA1c,
      lipids, biochemical markers and creatinine/albumin ratio. Post-prandial glucose levels and
      24-hour ambulatory blood pressure will be evaluated. Participants will also be asked to
      complete Quality of Life (QoL) questionnaires.

      Participants will be randomised into either continuous positive airway pressure CPAP
      treatment or no treatment. All subjects will be counselled regarding adopting a healthy
      lifestyle and advised on the Heart Foundation, National Health and Medical Research Council,
      and American Diabetes Association nutrition and exercise recommendations. Follow-up on
      adoption of the healthy lifestyle approach will be done for all study participants for the
      duration of the trial period. Total duration of a patient's participation is 6 months.
