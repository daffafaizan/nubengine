      role of cervical cerclage versus expectant management in women with placenta previa
      presenting with shortened cervical length ( ≥ 10mm and ≤ 30mm) between 18w0d and 26w0d of
      gestation. In addition, the role of fetal fibronectin (fFN) for the prediction of preterm
      birth and hemorrhage will be elucidated. The hypothesis is that placement of a cervical
      cerclage between 18w0d to 26w0d in patients with a short cervix and complete placenta previa
      will decrease preterm birth as compared to expectantly managing these patients.
