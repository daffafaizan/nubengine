    
      This is a dose escalation protocol to determine, first and foremost, the safety, tolerability
      and feasibility of intratumoral administration of AdAPT-001.

      The study has 2 parts. Different groups of patients will participate in each part.

      PART 1: Dose Escalation Safety Run-In

      During part 1, all participants will be treated with AdAPT-001 as a single injection, one
      time. Participants will be assigned to different dose levels to find the highest dose of
      AdAPT-001 that is safe and tolerable.

      PART 2: Dose Expansion Single-Agent

      All participants in PART 2 will receive injections of AdAPT-001 on Days 1 and 15 of 28-day
      cycles. The dose of AdAPT-001 used in Part 2 will be decided by the results from Part 1.
