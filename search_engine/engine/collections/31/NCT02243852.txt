      of growth hormone (growth hormone deficiency or GHD) leads to people feeling generally unwell
      and having a lower feeling of well-being and quality of life scores. In addition, the
      investigators, and others, have demonstrated people with GHD have reduced muscle and bone
      strength and a greater storage of fat, particularly in unfavourable sites such as in the
      liver and within the abdomen (visceral fat), rather than beneath the skin (subcutaneous fat).

      Treatment of GHD is achieved by administration of GH replacement therapy, given as a once
      daily subcutaneous injection, which generally reverses these symptoms. Due to its high cost,
      patients are only started on GH replacement depending on the impact that the GHD is having on
      their quality of life. Patients must be severely affected to be eligible for replacement
      therapy. Patients are screened for quality of life using a well validated, disease specific
      questionnaire (AGHDA, Adult Growth hormone deficiency questionnaire) and there are specific
      criteria that govern whether a patient with GHD warrants GH replacement and also whether they
      continue treatment (NICE guideline: Growth hormone deficiency (adults) - human growth hormone
      (TA64)).

      This study will specifically determine whether the mechanism of action by which GH exerts its
      beneficial effects on metabolism (within adipose tissue and skeletal muscle) involves changes
      in serum FGF21 concentrations.
