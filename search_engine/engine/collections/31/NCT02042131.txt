      patients and is now in widespread use, but has never been empirically tested. The CRP is
      purported to reduce suicide risk via unique mechanisms that directly suicide risk, notably
      suicidal ambivalence (i.e., the relative balance between the wish to live and the wish to
      die) and problem solving. Because suicidal ambivalence has gained support as an active
      mechanism for reducing suicide risk, the present study will also seek to augment this
      underlying mechanism by directly engaging the suicidal patient in a discussion about their
      reasons for living, thereby potentially increasing the potency of the CRP.

      The present study therefore entails a component analysis of crisis interventions. As such, we
      anticipate ordered effects, whereby the S-CRP and E-CRP conditions will show significantly
      better outcomes than TAU, and E-CRP will demonstrate significantly better outcomes than the
      standard CRP condition.
