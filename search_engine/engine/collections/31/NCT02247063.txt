      empirical treatments offer uncertain relief for a large number of patients. Many conventional
      therapies are ineffectual, leading to persistent treatment failure and/or poor
      iatrogenic-induced results; which raises the possibility that the cause for their pain
      endurance may also lie in the brain milieu. Although MRI-based techniques have provided
      insights into some neuroplastic mechanisms of TMD in humans, many questions regarding its
      molecular mechanisms in vivo are still unanswered. First, how are endogenous μ-opioid
      mechanisms in the brain, known to be centrally involved in pain regulation, affected by acute
      and chronic TMD pain? Second, how can they be directly modulated to provide analgesic effect
      on pain measures? Finally, what are the neuroplastic effects in the brain after continuous
      modulation of those molecular mechanisms? The understanding of these processes is crucial to
      determine the mechanisms engaged in the persistence and, most important, the alleviation of
      TMD.

      Preliminary studies from our center, using positron emission tomography (PET) with [11C]
      carfentanil, a selective radiotracer for mu-opioid receptor (muOR), have demonstrated that
      there is a decrease in μOR availability (non-displaceable binding potential -BPND) in key
      pain-related structures in the brains of chronic trigeminal pain patients, which correlated
      with their clinical pain measures. We propose to demonstrate that acute (masseteric pain
      challenge) and chronic clinical pain measures in TMD patients are correlated with μ-opioid
      receptor (µOR) non-displaceable binding potential (BPND) in the thalamus and other
      pain-related regions.
