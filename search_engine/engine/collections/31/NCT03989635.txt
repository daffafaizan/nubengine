    
      The main purpose of this study is to demonstrate the anti-inflammatory effects of fevipiprant
      (QAW039) compared to placebo after 12 weeks of treatment in moderate to severe asthma
      patients with an elevated sputum eosinophil count (≥ 2%) and high blood eosinophil count (≥
      250 cells/μL). This study is also designed to investigate the effects of fevipiprant on key
      inflammatory cells bearing the DP2 receptor (such as eosinophils, Th2/Tc2 cells, and ILC2
      cells) in sputum and blood.
