      main cause of clinical deterioration that leads to death is the cytokine storm in the lung.

      CD24 is a small heavily glycosylated GPI-anchored protein. CD24 is a key player in the vast
      majority of human cancers and also plays an important role in controlling the homeostatic
      proliferation of T cells. Hence, CD24 can negatively regulate inflammation.

      The treatment is a biologic therapeutic agent based on exosomes carrying CD24. The rationale
      for this treatment is that exosomes overexpressing CD24, isolated and purified from
      T-RExâ„¢-293 cells engineered to express CD24 at high levels, can suppress the cytokine storm
      and are delivered directly to the target organ using exosomes as a highly body-compatible
      delivery vehicle. This enables a strong reduction of the required dose (as opposed to
      systemic administration), and reduces the risk for adverse events.
