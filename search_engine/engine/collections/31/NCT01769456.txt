      to evaluate acceptability, patterns of use, rates of adherence, and measured levels of drug
      exposure when YMSM are provided with open label FTC/TDF (Truvada速) and information regarding
      safety and efficacy of FTC/TDF (Truvada速) as PrEP based on prior studies in adults. The study
      will also examine patterns of sexual risk behavior among HIV-uninfected YMSM in the U.S. at
      high risk of acquiring HIV infection who are provided with open label FTC/TDF (Truvada速) as
      PrEP. The study will also explore the feasibility and acceptability of implementing an
      efficacious risk reduction behavioral intervention prior to the provision of PrEP- PCC. The
      inclusion of a behavioral intervention in this project not only addresses the ethical
      responsibility of providing at least the minimum risk reduction education to all subjects
      given the high HIV risk of the study population, but also builds behavioral skills to assist
      subjects in reducing their risk when not taking PrEP. Furthermore, the study will evaluate
      the process of protocol implementation to better understand how to best implement PrEP
      research and program practice at adolescent medicine sites, including an evaluation of
      consent procedures and the acceptability/feasibility of allowing youth minors to consent for
      their own participation in HIV prevention intervention, to the extent allowable by local laws
      and regulations, and to allow youth minor participation in a clinical trial without requiring
      disclosure of their sexual orientation and risk behaviors to their parents or legal
      guardians.
