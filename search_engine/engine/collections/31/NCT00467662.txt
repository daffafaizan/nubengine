        -  Experiment duration; 5 to 10 days

        -  4 visits (days 1, 3,6,10)

        -  5 application /day for each derivative

        -  Documentation Metric digital images of localized area signs at each visit Clinical
           assessment of prodrome/erythema, papule, vesicle, ulcer, crust, or healed skin (with or
