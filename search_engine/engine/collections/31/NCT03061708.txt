    
      Tumour evaluation using RECIST 1.1 will be conducted at screening (within 28 days prior to
      first dose) and every 8 weeks relative to the date of first dose, up to week 40, then every
      16 weeks until objective disease progression (within a window of +/- 7 days of the scheduled
      date).

      Study treatment will be continued until objective disease progression (unless other criteria
      for 3 treatment discontinuation are met). Patients may continue AZD2014 beyond progression
      (according to RECIST 1.1), at the discretion of the investigator if they are clinically
      benefiting from the treatment and they do not meet any other discontinuation criteria.

      If a patient discontinues study treatment prior to disease progression, they should continue
      to be assessed using RECIST 1.1 until disease progression and then followed up for survival.

      Assessments for survival should be made every 8 weeks following objective disease
      progression. The details of first and subsequent therapies for cancer, after discontinuation
      of treatment, will be collected. The imaging modalities used for RECIST 1.1 assessment will
      be CT or MRI scans of chest, abdomen and pelvis. RECIST 1.1 scans will be analysed by the
      investigator on site.
