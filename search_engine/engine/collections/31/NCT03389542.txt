      performed within 3 months after randomization. Clinical interview will be performed at
      discharge, at 6 months and afterwards yearly until the end of follow-up. Echocardiography
      will be performed at discharge, at 6 months and at the end of follow-up.

      Control group: Patients randomized to initial conservative management will be followed up by
      clinical interview and echocardiography every 6 months. Patients will be instructed to report
      any change in functional status in a prompt manner. Surgery will be indicated at the onset of
      symptoms or if one or more of the following occur during follow-up: LV end-systolic diameter
      >40mm, LV ejection fraction <60%, recurrent atrial fibrillation, or resting systolic
      pulmonary artery pressure >50mmHg.
