      that interfere with their appetite and their ability to eat and enjoy meals. Several studies
      suggest that nutritional intake increases when the patient is satisfied about the quality of
      the meals. Therefore, adapting meals in a way that responds to these symptoms might be a good
      strategy to improve patient satisfaction, nutritional status and hence, quality of life. In
      this vein, the investigators hypothesize that meals from FoodforCare at Home will contribute
      to the quality of life of cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy when compared to usual
      care. Also, the investigators expect that this strategy will have a positive effect on
      patient satisfaction, other nutrition-related issues, including nausea and vomiting, on
      nutritional intake per se and hence, on the nutritional status. Additional benefits might
      include reduced use of medication, especially anti-emetics.
