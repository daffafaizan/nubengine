      Phase 1: The primary objective is to assess the safety of autologous T cells genetically
      modified to express chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) targeting CD19 antigen (19-28z) with or
      without conditioning chemotherapy.

      â€¢ Phase IIa: The primary objective is to compare the relative engraftment and persistence of
      the two CAR modified CD19-targeted T cells expressing different co-stimulatory signaling
      domain CD28 (19-28z) and 4-1BB (CART-19:CD3z-4-1BB) in the CAR construct.

      To compare the in vivo survival of genetically modified 19-28z CAR+ T cells after T cell
      infusion alone or in combination with conditioning chemotherapy.

        -  To compare the gene transfer/expression efficiency of the two viral vectors (retrovirus
           vs. lentivirus).

        -  To assess the anti-leukemic activity of adoptively transferred CD19-targeted modified T
           cells linked to the CD28 (19-28z) and 4-1BB signaling domains (CART-19:CD3z-4-1BB).

      OUTLINE:

      The first stage is a standard 3-step phase I dose escalation trial to assess the safety of
      19-28z CAR expressing autologous T cells with or without prior conditioning chemotherapy. In
      Step 1, a cohort of patients will receive the lowest planned dose of 19-28z+ modified T
      cells. In Step 2, a cohort of patients will receive cyclophosphamide conditioning
      chemotherapy followed by the lowest planned dose of 19-28z+ modified T cells. If less than
      33% of patients in the cohort (Step 2) experience unanticipated dose-limiting toxicity. In
      Step 3, a cohort of patients will be treated with the investigator's choice conditioning
      chemotherapy followed by the higher dose of 19-28z+ modified T cells. If less than 33% of
      patients in the initial cohort (Step 3) experience unanticipated dose-limiting toxicity, the
      cohort in Step 3 may be be expanded to include up to 15 patients. In Step 3, an additional
      cohort of Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia (WM) patients will be treated with the
      investigator's choice conditioning chemotherapy followed by 19-28z+ T cells. However, to
      maximize safety for WM patients, they will be treated at the lower dose of modified T cells
      (1x106 19-28z+ T cells/kg). If no toxicity is observed in the initial cohort, the dose may be
      increased in a standard 3-step dose-escalation scheme as described above.

      In the Phase IIa extension part of the trial, 12 patients from MSKCC will be enrolled, and
      will be treated with co-infusion of 19-28z and CART-19:CD3z-4-1BB+ modified T cells mixed at
      1:1 ratio at the MTD of T cells determined from the phase I trial.
