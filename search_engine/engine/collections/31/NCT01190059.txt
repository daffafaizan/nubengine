      but fit into the study inclusion criteria will be retrieved from the donor using current
      donor lung retrieval techniques.

      These lungs will be brought to the study transplant center to be re-assessed by the
      transplant team. The lungs will be physiologically assessed during ex vivo perfusion with
      Steen Solution. Perfusion of these lungs will be performed using Steen solution with the
      addition of methylprednisolone, heparin and antibiotics. With respect to the decision of lung
      utilization those organs with a delta pO2 (Δ pO2 = Pulmonary vein pO2 - pulmonary artery pO2)
      during ex vivo perfusion assessment > 350mmHg, good lung compliance, and a favorable opinion
      of the transplant surgeon will be considered transplantable. Lungs will be excluded for
      transplantation: if the Δ pO2 is less than 350mmHg or if they demonstrate >10% deterioration
      in any of the following functional parameters: pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), dynamic
      compliance or airway pressures. Lungs will also be excluded if they are deemed unsuitable
      based on the clinical judgment of the lung transplant surgeon.
