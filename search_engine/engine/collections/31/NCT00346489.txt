      long term full evaluation of the efficacy of intraoperative 5-FU and MMC needs to be
      performed to assess the true efficacy of MMC compared to 5-FU. We, therefore propose, a
      long-term prospective study of patients previously enrolled in the prospective study
      involving the evaluation of single intraoperative application of mitomycin C versus
      5-fluorouracil in low to moderate risk glaucoma patients.
