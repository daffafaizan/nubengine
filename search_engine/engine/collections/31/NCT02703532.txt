      intervention designed to facilitate carepartners' roles in stroke survivor rehabilitation.
      Stroke survivors and caregivers will participate in pairs. Stroke survivors will receive
      constraint induced movement therapy (CIMT). Caregivers of stroke survivors will be randomized
      to traditional caregiver education or a web based intervention for the duration of stroke
      survivor therapy. A tablet will be provided to participants who do not have access to
      complete the web based intervention. All participants will be asked to complete
      questionnaires at the beginning of therapy, the end of therapy, and one month post therapy.
