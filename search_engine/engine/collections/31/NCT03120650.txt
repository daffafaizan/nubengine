    
      A randomized, controlled, parallel, clinical trial. 116 ischemic stroke patients will be
      collected with dyskinesia from Longhua Hospital, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese
      Medicine and Huashan Hospital, Fudan University in China. All patients will be equally
      randomized into either a control group (conventional rehabilitation) or an experimental group
      (scalp acupuncture + conventional rehabilitation). In the control group, patients will
      receive conventional rehabilitation according to the Guidelines for Stroke Rehabilitation in
      China. In the experimental group, conventional rehabilitation will be supplemented with
      oblique acupuncture at approximately 15Â° and an insertion depth of 25-35 mm in the motor
      areas of the scalp. Twisting speed will be 200 times per minute. Acupuncture will be
      performed six times per day in 1-minute bouts, with a 4-minute rest following each bout.
      Patients in both groups will receive rehabilitation five times per week for 8 consecutive
      weeks. The primary outcome will be the difference in Fugl-Meyer motor function score between
      posttreatment (4 weeks, 8 weeks, and 6 months of follow-up) and baseline.

      The secondary outcomes will be differences in the Modified Barthel Index, stroke-specific
      quality of life, and stroke syndrome of traditional Chinese medicine.
