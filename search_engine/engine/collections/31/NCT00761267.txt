    
      Prospective, open label study to assess the pharmacokinetics, safety & efficacy of
      anidulafungin when used to treat children (aged 1 month - < 18 years) with invasive
      candidiasis, including candidemia (ICC). To participate in the study, at the time of
      enrollment subjects must (1) have either a confirmed diagnosis of ICC or mycological evidence
      highly suggestive of Candida sp or (2) in infants 1 month to < 2 years only, be at high risk
      of candidiasis. All subjects meeting screening criteria receive IV anidulafungin. Subjects
      will be stratified by age (1 month - < 2 years; 2 years - < 5 years; 5 years - < 18 years).
      Subjects may be switched to oral fluconazole, provided that the pre-specified criteria are
      met. Subjects with microbiologically confirmed ICC must have a minimum total treatment
      duration of 14 days. The maximum allowed treatment duration of anidulafungin is 35 days; the
      maximum total treatment duration for the study is 49 days. At selected centers, anidulafungin
      pharmacokinetics will be assessed in the first 6 subjects age 1 month - < 2 years to confirm
      the recommended dosage regimen. A population PK-PD analysis will be performed in all other
      enrolled subjects. Subjects will be followed for safety through 6 week FU visit. Efficacy for
      subjects with confirmed ICC will be assessed at EOIVT, EOT, 2-week FU and 6-week FU visits.
