    
      This study is a clinical trial in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), of a drug called
      exenatide, which is already licensed for the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes.
      There have been several groups that have confirmed that exenatide has beneficial effects of
      nerve cells when tested in the laboratory, which raises the possibility that exenatide may
      slow down or stop the degeneration of PD. In an open label trial in patients with PD who self
      administered the drug for a period of 48 weeks, investigators have previously shown that the
      drug is well tolerated and shows encouraging effects on the movement and non-movement aspects
      of the disease. A double blind placebo controlled trial involving 60 participants was then
      conducted which indicated that exenatide may be a "neuroprotective" drug, i.e. one that stops
      the nerve cells dying in PD. The next step is therefore to confirm this "neuroprotective"
      effect and to see whether this effect can be reproduced in a multi-centre setting including a
      larger number of participants. An important objective is to explore whether any positive
      effects remain static or increase when the treatment is continued over a 96 week period.
