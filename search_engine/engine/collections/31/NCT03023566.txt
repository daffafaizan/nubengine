      per month. Recently PCH changed its MRI contrast agent from the linear contrast agent
      Magnevist to the macrocyclic contrast agent Dotarem. The goal of this study is to evaluate
      safety and efficacy of Dotarem enhanced MRI in pediatric and neonatal population who are
      referred for contrast enhanced MRI at PCH.

      The study is designed as a single center, open label comparison of unenhanced MRI with
      Dotarem enhanced MRI in pediatric patient population (<18years). The comparison will be
      performed intra-individually by 3 independent blinded radiologists. Overall, the study
      population will consist of 250 pediatric patients who are indicated for contrast enhanced
      MRI. The safety follow-up period will be 24 (+/- 4) hours post injection of Dotarem and
      includes the assessment of physical examinations and vital signs as well as the assessment of
      AEs.
