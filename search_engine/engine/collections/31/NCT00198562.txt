      systolic blood pressure (BP) with different target levels using two classes of drugs.

      The HOSP study is a multicenter, prospective, randomized, open, blinded endpoint study.
      Inclusion criteria are 40-79 years old treated or untreated hypertensive patients without
      serious medical conditions. After a 4 weeks of baseline period, subjects are randomly
      assigned to (1) modest control group (target morning home BP <140 mmHg) or (2) strict control
      group (morning home BP <130 mmHg), and to (a) amlodipine group (2.5-5 mg od) or (b) losartan
      group (25-50 mg od). Additional antihypertensive drugs (diuretics, beta-blockers and
      alpha-blockers) can be used if home BP is not controlled. Home BP is measured in the early
      morning and late evening. Primary end point is combined cardiovascular events.The
      participants will be followed up for 5 years.
