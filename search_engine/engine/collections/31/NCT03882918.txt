      OV101 in subjects with AS who have completed previous Ovid studies (OV101-15-001 or
      OV101-16-001). There will be no placebo treatment. As this study will enroll subjects who
      have completed previous AS studies for different periods of time before entering this study,
      subjects will be required to complete screening and baseline visits before receiving OV101
      under this protocol.The secondary objective of this study is to evaluate the long-term
      efficacy of OV101 treatment assessed by changes in behavior, sleep, and functioning in
      individuals with AS.
