      especially from its distant part called the fimbria. These tubal, ovarian or primary
      peritoneal carcinomas are quite always of high grade serous type. They cannot be effectively
      screened due to the quickness of their evolution. In this context, a laparoscopic bilateral
      salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) is the recommended prophylactic procedure.

      Some BRCA-mutated women are reluctant to undergo this procedure considering the numerous
      adverse effects on body and quality of life, especially when hormonal replacement is
      forbidden. This refusal makes them at risk of developing a serous pelvic carcinoma.

      The goal of the bilateral laparoscopic radical fimbriectomy the investigators suggest, is to
      suppress the tubal source of possible dysplastic cells from which can stem this high grade
      tumor, while preserving a natural ovarian hormonal secretion
