      will breath spontaneously (without CPAP) for both nights. On the study nights, subjects will
      present to the laboratory in the evening and be instrumented with a full polysomnigraphy for
      monitoring sleep, physiological variables (endotypes), and respiratory events. A history and
      physical examination will be performed on each night prior to beginning the study, as will a
      urine pregnancy test in premenopausal women. DAW2020 34 mg will be given 4 hours before
      lights out. Subjects will sleep at least 50% of the night in the supine position. At least
      four hours of sleep with high quality signal acquisition will be required for a study to be
      judged adequate. After the first overnight study is completed, there will be a one-week
      washout period prior to crossing over to the other treatment.
