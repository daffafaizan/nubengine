      aripiprazole (Abilify) in the treatment of youth with Tourette's Disorder (TD). Tourette's
      Disorder is characterized by multiple motor (more than one uncontrollable movement) and vocal
      tics (vocal outbursts) which have been present for more than 1 year, with onset before the
      age of 18. The disorder causes marked distress in social, occupational or other important
      areas of functioning. Abilify has been approved by the United States Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) to treat adults with schizophrenia but has not been approved to treat
      Tourette's Disorder (TD) so it is considered experimental or investigational in this study.
