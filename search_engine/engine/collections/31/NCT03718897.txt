      medicine using genetic analysis in lung cancer, colorectal cancer, and melanoma has been
      actively studied. The need for such precision medicine is also increasing in biliary tract
      cancer patients. Although whole genome sequencing is relatively costly, it is known to
      provide more accurate information than other methods such as exome analysis and RNA
      sequencing in identifying promoter mutations, regulatory regions, and structural variants.
      Pancreatic cancer and melanoma have been studied by whole genome sequencing, but there is no
      previous study using whole genome sequencing method in biliary tract cancer.
