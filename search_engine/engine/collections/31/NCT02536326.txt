      clinical outcomes of RDN in East Asian populations are seldom reported. Therefore, the
      purpose was to evaluate 6-month outcomes of RDN for the treatment of resistant hypertension
      in Chinese patients.In a prospective single-center cohort study, 50 Chinese patients with
      resistant hypertension would be recruited to undergo RDN by LEPU Renal denervation system,
      which was similar to Symplicity the Symplicity renal-denervation system (Medtronic). The
      primary effectiveness endpoint was change in systolic and diastolic blood pressure at six
      months as measured by office-based blood pressure assessment and 24-hour ambulatory blood
      pressure monitoring following therapeutic renal denervation compared to baseline. The primary
      safety endpoint was the incidence of Major Adverse Event (MAE) through 6 months , including
      severe renal artery dissection/stenosis(>60%) that required stenting or surgery,
      cerebrovascular accident, myocardial infarction, death.
