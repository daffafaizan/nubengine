      of immunotherapy with CIK every year. The immunotherapy were started at 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 6
      weeks, 10 weeks, 14 weeks, 18 weeks and then every 12 weeks after MWA. Peripheral blood
      mononuclear cells were differentiated into phenotypically confirmed DCs and effector cells.
      DC-CIK and CTL were injected into the abdominal cavity. CIK was infused intravenously. The
      safety, survival effect and peripheral T-lymphocyte subsets of combination therapy group will
      be recorded and compared with those of MWA group.
