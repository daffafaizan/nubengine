      evaluate the effectiveness of ThermaCare HeatWraps in improving flexibility and low back
      muscle relaxation, and in participants experiencing pain, reducing pain during movement. Two
      discrete subject samples will be enrolled; (1) people with recent back pain, and (2) people
      who regularly play sport. Both samples will be enrolled using respective criteria.

      Following enrollment, both subject groups will have a "start interview" on their allocated
      baseline assessment day (Day 1). This will include fitting of the ViMove movement and EMG
      sensors, as well as a live "pain on movement" assessment. This session will take
      approximately 20-30 minutes. Whilst wearing the ViMove sensors, subjects will then leave the
      clinic and conduct normal daily activities for a pre-determined monitoring period. No
      ThermaCare HeatWraps are worn on Day 1. This allows a baseline assessment and allows any
      placebo effects from the sensors to be discounted. At the end of the monitoring session,
      subjects will return to the clinic to have an "end-of-day" interview. Clinicians will
      administer the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), the Visual Analogue Scale for Pain (VAS
      Pain), and the Patient Global Impression of Change scale (PGIC). ViMove movement sensors will
      then be removed, and the subject will be reimbursed for that day.

      The intervention day (Day 2) will have the same procedure as Day 1 (baseline), with the only
      difference being the additional application of ThermaCare HeatWraps during the "start
      interview". Subjects will continue to wear the HeatWrap and ViMove sensors during the 8-hour
      daily activity monitoring period, with the wrap and sensors being removed during the
      end-of-day interview. The subject will then be reimbursed for Day 2.
