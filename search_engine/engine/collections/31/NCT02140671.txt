      launch an asthma initiative designed to improve asthma management and outcomes. The project
      incorporates key learning from a 10 year programme in Finland designed to improve asthma care
      and cap healthcare costs for paediatric and adult populations.

      The Finland programme focused on accurate diagnosis, training and education of healthcare
      professionals and patients and early use of anti-inflammatory therapy. The programme
      successfully improved medication compliance, reduced asthma hospital admissions, reduced
      asthma-related benefit claims and reduced the overall cost of asthma to the Finnish
      Government.

      To test the validity and sustainability of an enhanced asthma management model for the UK,
      the BLF proposes to undertake a pilot initiative in England. The pilot will focus on:
      improving diagnostic accuracy through analysis of GP asthma registers; increasing asthma
      education among healthcare professionals; assessment of risk and control of patient's asthma;
      supportive self-management and education of people with asthma.

      It is anticipated that the pilot will lead to measureable and significant improvements in
      asthma management, including:

        -  Reduced number of severe exacerbations (asthma hospitalisation, A&E attendance and oral
           steroid rescue)

        -  Improved diagnostic accuracy (and reduction of diagnostic doubt)

        -  Improved implementation of recognised asthma guidelines, including appropriate step wise
           management of patients

      The pilot will also aim to increase the proportion of patients on the asthma register with an
      asthma management plan and a recorded asthma control test therefore supporting higher levels
      of control, and will promote peer-to-peer health care professional asthma education and
      knowledge sharing to establish an asthma-training legacy.

      The pilot model will be sustainable and reproducible across England and the devolved nations
      (Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland). Whilst the core aspects of an agreed national model
      will be rolled out across the pilot site, it will be tailored and refined through local
      collaboration (primary care, secondary care and commissioners) to help attain local targets
      in line with regional differences, needs and priorities.

      Results from the pilot will be reported 15 months after project initiation on site
      (July/August 2014)
