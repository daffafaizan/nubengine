      irresectable carcinoma of the oesophagus, consisting of concurrent chemoradiation therapy
      (50.5 Gy + cisplatin/5-FU). Attempts to improve outcome by intensifying conventional
      cytotoxic drugs or increasing the radiation dose have not been successful. Future
      improvements will likely require the incorporation of targeted agents that probably will not
      add significant toxicity, the use of molecular predictors of response and early
      identification of responders. In both squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma of the
      oesophagus expression of EGFR is correlated with poor outcome. Furthermore the addition of
      cetuximab, a chimaeric EGFR antibody, to radiation therapy in head and neck cancer and
      non-small cell lung cancer showed a gain in overall survival. In head and neck cancer studies
      with the addition of panitumumab to chemo-radiation therapy are currently ongoing. Therefore,
      we propose to perform a randomised phase II study of chemo-radiation therapy with or without
      the combination of panitumumab (human EGFR antibody) in irresectable squamous cell carcinoma
      or adenocarcinoma of the oesophagus without distant metastases.
