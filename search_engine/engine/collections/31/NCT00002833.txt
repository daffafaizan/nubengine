      hematopoietic recovery and leukemia control after intensive but nonmyeloablative salvage
      chemotherapy. II. Determine the engraftment kinetics and degree of chimerism achievable.

      OUTLINE: The trial will have 2 patient groups. Patients not in remission are assigned to
      group 1, while patients in remission are assigned to group 2. Then, groups are divided into 2
      treatment arms. Patients failing fludarabine therapy receive cytarabine (Ara-C) IV over 2
      hours on days -7, -6, -5, -4 and -3. Beginning 4 hours before the first dose of Ara-C,
      patients receive cladribine (2-chlorodeoxyadenosine; 2-CdA) by continuous infusion for 5
      days. Patients without prior fludarabine therapy receive fludarabine IV over 30 minutes daily
      on days -6, -5, -4 and -3. Ara-C IV begins 4 hours after the beginning of the fludarabine
      infusion and continues for 4 hours. Idarubicin IV is given on days -6, -5 and -4. Donors
      receive filgrastim SC every 12 hours for 2 days prior to stem cell collection. Cells are
      infused on day 0. For GVHD prophylaxis, all patients receive cyclosporine via continuous IV
      infusion. Oral cyclosporine is administered once patients tolerate oral feeding and continued
      for 6 months postinfusion. Then, the dose of cyclosporine is tapered 10% weekly until
      discontinued. Methylprednisolone begins 5 days after infusion and is gradually tapered.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 15 patients per arm are likely to be entered in 24 to 36
      months.
