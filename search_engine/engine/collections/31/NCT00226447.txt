      Southeast Asian countries. The efficacy interferon-alfa (IFN-alfa) or lamivudine monotherapy
      is far from satisfactory with approximately 20% sustained viral response. Extended use of
      lamivudine is associated with the emergence of drug resistance mutants. As interferon is an
      immune modulator and lamivudine directly suppresses viral replication, it is therefore
      logical to combine the 2 drugs for more efficient viral clearance.

      Previous studies on IFN-alfa and lamivudine combination treatment of chronic hepatitis B
      showed marginal benefit over lamivudine monotherapy. In these studies, lamivudine was either
      started 8 weeks prior to IFN-alfa or simultaneous with IFN-alfa. Recently, we have performed
      a study comparing the efficacy of polyethylene glycol-interferon alfa-2b (PEG-Intron A) and
      lamivudine versus lamivudine monotherapy for 1 year in the treatment of chronic hepatitis B.
      In our protocol, PEG-Intron A is started 8 weeks before the commencement of lamivudine, and
      PEG-Intron A is given for 32 weeks while lamivudine is given for a total of 52 weeks. Our
      published results suggested PEG-Intron A and lamivudine combination treatment is far superior
      to lamivudine monotherapy (end of treatment virological response 92% vs 20%, p=0.0015). We
      are not certain whether the benefit of PEG-Intron A and lamivudine combination in our study
      is due to our staggered regime, the superiority of PEG-Intron A over IFN-alfa, or both. The
      aim of this study is to investigate the best treatment regime of PEG-Intron A and lamivudine
      combination in terms of viral clearance.
