      the potential treatment of wide neck, intracranial, saccular aneurysms with the Next
      Generation Neuroform Stent System with any approved embolic coils currently on the market.
      The study will evaluate the percent occlusion of the treated target lesion on angiography in
      the absence of retreatment, or parent artery stenosis at the target location at 12 months.
      Subjects with documented wide neck, intracranial, saccular aneurysms arising from a parent
      artery may potentially benefit from stent assisted coiling, provided they meet the other
      eligibility criteria.
