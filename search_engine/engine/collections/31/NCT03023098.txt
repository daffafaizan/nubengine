      and lower limb arteries. Stenosis and restenosis is a known problem in bypass vein grafts,
      and drug-eluting devices might be beneficial in this field as well.

      In the procedure a conventional balloon is passed through the stenosis which is then dilated.
      After this patients are randomized before a second dilatation with either a conventional
      balloon or a drug-coated balloon.

      The stenosis is evaluated preoperatively and followed up by means of ultrasound by a vascular
      technician. Follow-up will end at 12 months.
