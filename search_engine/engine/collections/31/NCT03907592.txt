      are randomly assigned to two experimental groups (n=20) and control group (n=20). During the
      24-weeks intervention period, Group A undergoes training procedure supplemented with the
      carnitine and leucine, whilst group B undergoes training procedure supplemented with leucine.
      At the same time control group go through only training procedure. Measurements are performed
      before, at the mid-point, and at the end of the intervention period.

      Approximately 1 week prior to the experimental trial day, participants perform a
      familiarization session during which one-repetition maximum (1RM) strength testing is also
      performed to determine the experimental exercise load. Resistance exercise training is
      performed twice weekly on non-consecutive days (Monday+Thursday, or Tuesday+Friday) for
      24-weeks under direct supervision by a research assistant. Prior to a training session
      subjects are required to perform warm - up on the treadmill (walk) and static stretching,
      after each session - cool down on the cycle ergometer and static stretching. Resistance
      exercise for each session consisted of 6 exercises: horizontal seated leg press, seated chest
      press, leg extension, shoulder press, lat pull-down seated row, seated cable row First two
      weeks of training consist of 3 sets of 10-12 repetitions and are keeping exercises at 65% of
      1 repetition maximum (1RM). After this period training consists of 3 sets of 6-8 repetitions
      and is progressing to 80% of 1RM. The 1RM is re-evaluated every 2 weeks, and the training
      load is adjusted accordingly. The exercise program follows the recommended guidelines for
      older adults by the American College of Sports Medicine and the National Strength and
      Conditioning Association.
