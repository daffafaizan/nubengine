      scars. This prospective, comparative study (before-after treatment) included 15 patients with
      keloid scars refractory to conventional treatment (corticoids, surgery, cryotherapy). The
      primary outcome was the percentage of patients achieving a complete remission of their keloid
      scar 2 years after the end of treatment. Secondary outcomes were the Vancouver scar scale and
      pruritus severity scored at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months post treatment vs baseline.
