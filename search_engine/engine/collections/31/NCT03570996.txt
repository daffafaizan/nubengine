      open esophagectomy. Epidurals have been shown to reduce post-operative pulmonary morbidity
      and mortality. However, epidurals are often associated with sympathetic blockade that creates
      hypotension and could therefore adversely affect the conduit. Pain management techniques that
      use peripheral nerve blockade are becoming more prevalent, reducing the need for an epidural.
      Transversus abdominis plane (TAP) catheters have been used in colorectal and abdominal
      surgery showing equivocal pain scores to epidurals. With the minimally invasive chest
      approach, the analgesia coverage focuses on the abdominal incision where both epidurals and
      TAPs are considered standard of care.

      The investigators have completed a retrospective study in preparation for a randomized
      control trial. The investigators previous retrospective study found that TAP blocks/catheters
      are a reasonable alternative to epidurals, providing adequate pain coverage for abdominal
      incisions. The study found no statistical difference in pain scores between the two groups.
      The TAP group had a lower prevalence of hypotension and lower crystalloid resuscitation
      needs. Pulmonary complications were similar between the two groups. This retrospective review
      showed that TAP blocks are a reasonable alternative to epidurals and may reduce episodes of
      hypotension. The investigators aim is to now expand this study to a randomized control trial.
