      Primary

        -  Determine the efficacy and tolerability of gemcitabine hydrochloride and carboplatin
           followed by paclitaxel in patients with stage IIIB-IV non-small cell lung cancer in
           regard to response rate, median survival, and one year survival.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is multicenter study.

        -  Part 1: Patients receive carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1 and gemcitabine
           hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 2
           courses. In week 7, all patients proceed to part 2 regardless of disease response.

        -  Part 2: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 1-3 hours once weekly for 6 weeks. Treatment
           repeats every 8 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 46 patients will be accrued for this study.
