      outcomes of coronally advanced flap (CAF) using two different surgical strategies in the
      treatment of multiple gingival recessions. Recessions were randomly treated according to a
      split-mouth design by means of: CAF with oblique interdental incisions (OBL technique) or CAF
      with horizontal interdental incisions (HOR technique). Marginal gingival recession (REC),
      clinical attachment level (CAL), pocket probing depth (PPD), height of keratinized tissue
      (HKT) and thickness of keratinized tissue (TKT) were measured at baseline, 3 and 6 months
      after treatment. Patient-centered outcomes concerning morbidity and improvement in the
      esthetic appearance were recorded using a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS).
