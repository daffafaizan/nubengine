      To evaluate the effect of chemotherapy and thoracic radiotherapy on pulmonary function and
      identify predictors of radiation pneumonitis in locally advanced lung cancer [stages IIIA and
      IIIB].

      Hypothesis:

      Respiratory function tests may predict the development of radiation pneumonitis in patients
      with locally advanced lung cancer who receive radical treatment with chemoradiation.

      Methods Prospective cohort study with patients with locally advanced lung cancer of the Lung
      Cancer Clinic of the National Cancer Institute [INCAN]. Patients will receive weekly
      paclitaxel 50 mg and carboplatin AUC 2 with concomitant radiotherapy 44-63 Gy (22-33
      fractions). Followup of lung function tests at baseline, during treatment with radiotherapy
      and will be carried out on 4 more occasions.
