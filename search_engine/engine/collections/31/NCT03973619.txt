      results than ventral grafts. Fixed grafts on the corpora cavernosa results in a better
      mechanical support and vascular supply, with less chance to complications such as
      pseudodiverticula and sacculations either a better urethral phisiology.

      This study aims to evaluate the current surgical management in our centre: buccal mucosa
      graft urethroplasty with jugal or labial replacement, comparing their group success rate and
      complications between the groups in patients led to surgery from October 2016 to June 2018.

      Prospective analysis from urethral stricture surgical HCPA patient data by dorsal buccal
      mucosa graft urethroplasty. The graft choice were done by a software. Longer stricture with
      transoperative need for the two grafts use were excluded. Success rate were measured with a
      no stricture de novo or absence of complications in a six month interval.
