      IgE-dependent allergic diseases. Sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) is the method which allows
      to give allergens via alternative oral route in patients home. Due to possibility of avoiding
      injection this therapy offers better relationship with pediatric patient. However efficacy
      and safety of sublingual immunotherapy are still important issues, especially in asthmatic
      children. The purpose of the trial is to asses the efficacy and safety of sublingual annual
      immunotherapy in children with bronchial asthma and/or allergic rhinitis allergic to house
