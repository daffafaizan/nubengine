      revealing one third of pregnant women in United state considered obesity.

      Obesity is associated with increased in maternal and neonatal complications. Also, there was
      an increasing in the rate of cesarean delivery. Anesthetic management of the obese parturient
      is differ from non-obese parturients. There were higher risk of difficult intubation and
      difficult regional anesthesia such as spinal anesthesia or epidural catheter placement
      comparing with non-obese parturient.

      WHO categorised obesity into 3 classification; grade 1: BMI 30-34.9 kg/m2, grade 2: BMI
      35-39.9 kg/m2, grade 3: BMI > 40 kg/m2. This study emphasised in grade 3 obese pregnant women
      (BMI>40 kg/m2) undergoing cesarean delivery that were at risk of increasing in anesthetic
      complications such as airway complications as well as complications derived from regional
      anesthesia eg. high spinal block, failed spinal block etc.

      Therefore, the primary objective of the study is to report complication associated with
      anesthesia in obese patients undergoing cesarean delivery in Single University hospital,
      Bangkok, THAILAND. The secondary objectives rate of postpartum haemorrhage, rate of
      hysterectomy and neonatal outcomes.
