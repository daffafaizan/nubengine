      bacteria species and thousands of bacteria strains. The composition of bacteria in an
      individual's microbiome can change over time and this can be influenced by factors including
      diet, drugs, genetics and infection. These bacteria play a central role in digestion of food,
      development and regulation of our immune system as well as our resistance to pathogens.
      Recent evidence suggest that a patient's intestinal microbiota composition plays a critical,
      though as yet poorly defined, role in determining both therapeutic efficacy and likelihood of
      significant adverse events to T-cell checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy.

      Immune checkpoint inhibitors are revolutionising treatment of many types of metastatic
      cancer, including melanoma, renal and non-small cell lung cancer, in the expectation of
      improving patient overall survival. However, they have limitations as they do not work for
      all patients and can cause unpredictable, complex immune-related toxicities. The
      investigators will perform a detailed study of cancer patients receiving checkpoint
      inhibitors. Saliva and a series of stool samples will be collected from each patient to
      analyse their microbiome and will be linked to treatment response, by examining blood samples
      and - if available - tumour and organ samples. The investigators hope this work will enable
      personalisation of patient immunotherapies based on microbiome biomarkers, as well as
      precisely manipulate a patient's microbiota to optimise their immunotherapy.

      Comparison with a limited cohort of healthy household members (up to 360 volunteers) acting
      as controls will provide additional essential information about the role of the
      patient-specific microbiome.
