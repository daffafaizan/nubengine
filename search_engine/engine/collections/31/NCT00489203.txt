      I. Assess the efficacy of oral BDP for prevention of acute GVHD after allogeneic
      hematopoietic cell transplantation with myeloablative conditioning regimens.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive oral beclomethasone dipropionate 4 times daily beginning at the start
      of the conditioning regimen and continuing through day 75 post-transplant. Patients also
      receive a standard immunosuppressive regimen comprising tacrolimus and methotrexate
      post-transplant.

      ARM II: Patients receive oral placebo 4 times daily beginning at the start of the
      conditioning regimen and continuing through day 75 post-transplant. Patients also receive a
      standard immunosuppressive regimen comprising tacrolimus and methotrexate post-transplant.

      In both arms, treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.
