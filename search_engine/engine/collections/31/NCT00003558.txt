        -  Compare the overall survival after treatment with paclitaxel, carboplatin, and etoposide
           and after treatment with fluorouracil and leucovorin calcium in patients with
           adenocarcinoma of unknown primary.

        -  Compare the response rates, progression free survival, toxicity profile, and quality of
           life between the two regimens in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified by center and
      presence or absence of liver metastases.

      Patients are randomly assigned to one of two treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on
           day 1, and oral etoposide on days 1-10. Treatment is repeated every 3 weeks for up to
           four courses.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours followed by fluorouracil IV
           over 24 hours weekly for 6 weeks. Treatment is repeated every 7 weeks for up to two
           courses.

      Patients are followed every 3 months after treatment for 1 year or until death. Quality of
      life questionnaires are completed at each follow-up.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 120-140 patients will be accrued for this study within 3
      years.
