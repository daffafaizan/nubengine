      tracking to account for the relative motion of the moving prostate tumour target and the
      static pelvic nodal target for high-risk prostate cancer patients. The capability of tracking
      for the relative motion of multiple targets will ensure that all the treatment targets
      receive correct dose as prescribed by the doctor and minimising side effects to the critical
      organs.

      During radiation treatment, the prostate position will be monitored in real time using the
      KIM technology. The nodal target will be imaged before and after each treatment to evaluate
      the nodal treatment margin. The MLC tracking is implemented by recalculating the radiation
      beam shape fit for the moved prostate and static nodal targets and sending the adjusted MLC
      leaf positions to the treatment delivery system. The actually delivered dose to the patient
      will be calculated after the treatment and compared to the dose without MLC tracking to
      assess the treatment efficacy.
