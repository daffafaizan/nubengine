      Touch Application (FTA) installed. They may use either their own compatible Android handsets,
      or provided handsets. The study uses a delayed start design. Participants are randomized into
      two groups, who get access to the module "Diastat" after 4 and 12 weeks post-enrollment
      respectively. Each group uses the FTA with Diastat for 8 weeks post-intervention (i.e. access
      to Diastat).

      Diastat is a module within FTA that provides data-driven feedback to the patients using their
      own data. This module is based on the data recorded in a previous trial [1]. Three submodules
      are part of Diastat; Periodicity detection and visualization, multiscale trend detection
      based on the c-SiZer algorithm [2], and situation matching for insulin dosage [3].
