      complication rates, and local cancer control rate experience with brachytherapy used as the
      sole method of radiotherapy in women with stage I/II breast cancer treated with tylectomy who
      have histologically assessed negative surgical margins, less than 4 positive axillary nodes,
      and no extracapsular nodal extension or extensive intraductal component. II. Reduce the total
      treatment time of breast irradiation from 6 weeks to 4-5 days in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Treatment begins no sooner than 4 days and within 6 weeks after definitive surgery.
      All patients receive brachytherapy to the target volume (as defined by the excision cavity
      demarcated by post-tylectomy surgical clips plus 2 cm margin) using iridium-192 implants for
      dose distribution to five planes. Patients may be treated with either high-dose-rate or
      low-dose-rate brachytherapy at the institution's discretion. Patients are followed at 2 and 6
      weeks after treatment, then at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months, then every 4 months for 1 year, every 6
      months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 46 patients will be accrued in each group (high-dose rate vs
      low-dose rate) over 2 years.
