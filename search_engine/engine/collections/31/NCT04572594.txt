      which can occur in almost all organs and soft tissues, and is characterized by low-grade or
      borderline tumors.

      The diagnosis of inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor is mainly based on histopathology and
      immunohistochemistry. The treatment is resistant to conventional chemotherapy and
      radiotherapy. The only curative treatment is complete surgical resection. When IMT shows
      typical cellular structural features in pathology, the diagnosis is relatively simple.
      However, in the presence of atypical features, the accurate diagnosis of IMT is still a
      challenge. Therefore, it is necessary to explore a better diagnostic method. Secondly, there
      is no individualized treatment method for aggressive IMT patients who relapse and metastasize
      after surgery. At present, gene mutation is a research hotspot in the occurrence of various
      malignant tumors. The somatic gene mutations of many different types of tumors not only help
      to study the tumorigenesis mechanism and molecular diagnosis, but also can be used as an
      ideal therapeutic target. Large-scale gene profiling studies performed by humans in various
      types of epithelial tumors have confirmed some new gene mutations. However, there are few
      reports on the detection of inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, and humans have not yet
      understood its molecular content. Therefore, it is necessary to further use molecular
      detection methods to explore the molecular markers of IMT to facilitate its follow-up precise
      treatment plan.
