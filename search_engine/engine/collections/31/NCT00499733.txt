        -  Document radiologic and/or tumor marker response to cryotherapy of tumor lesions
           followed by cyclophosphamide.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot study.

      Patients undergo percutaneous biopsy of the targeted lesion prior to cryoablation. Patients
      then undergo percutaneous or open cryotherapy of the largest or most accessible lesion on day
      0. On day 3, patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour.

      Tumor markers (if applicable) are assessed at baseline and monthly during study until marker
      progression.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically for up to 3 years.
