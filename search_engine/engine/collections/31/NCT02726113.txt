    
      This study will enroll 80 (40 per study arm) subjects (>18 years of age), recently diagnosed
      with prostate cancer (histologically documented adenocarcinoma of the prostate), who are
      scheduled to undergo prostatectomy.

      Eligible subjects will be recruited in the Urology Clinic at MUSC or Ralph H. Johnson VAMC.
      All subjects will be refered to the study by their Urologist. At the baseline visit, consent
      will be obtained before any study procedures are initiated. A blood sample will be obtained
      for 25(OH)D3 analysis. Subjects will be randomized to either the intervention group (vitamin
      D3 4000 IU daily) or the placebo group and take the study medication for approximately two
      months before their scheduled prostatectomy. The final study visit is the day of surgery. A
      blood sample for 25(OH)D3 analysis will be obtained. Prostate tissue will be collected from
      the Pathologist for (a) genomics (RNA sequencing) analysis; (b) proteomics (proteins, glycons
      and lipids) analysis and (c) Vitamin D Receptor (VDR) by immunohistochemistry.
