      of young women. Its' etiology, epidemiology and treatment is not yet well described. This
      will be a retrospective, national, multicenter observational study, conducted in centres in
      Turkey. It is expected that approximately 50 women with PPCM will be recorded.

      The objectives of the study are:

      To define the clinical status and clinical characteristics of PPCM in Turkey

      To define the outcome of PPCM (short and long term)

      To define the demographical and possible etiological factors

      To define prognostic factors
