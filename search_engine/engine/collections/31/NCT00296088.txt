      surpass smoking as the most common cause of preventable death. Despite the well-known health
      consequences of obesity, little is known about the specific effects of obesity in critically
      ill individuals. There are significant differences in ventilator management procedures among
      obese and non-obese individuals in an ICU. The long-term effect of these differences,
      however, has not been studied. Preliminary research has shown that differences in the
      mechanical ventilation process may be responsible for worse outcomes in obese individuals, as
      compared to non-obese individuals. The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of
      obesity on ventilator management processes and medical outcomes in individuals in an ICU. The
      study will also identify any increased risks for the critically ill obese and the causes of
      their augmented mortality and morbidity levels.

      This study will enroll individuals in an ICU who are receiving mechanical ventilation through
      an endotracheal tube. Because potential participants are critically ill, and are unable to
      provide consent to participate in the study, each participant must have a surrogate decision
      maker who will provide consent on their behalf. Once enrolled, participants' weight, height,
      and waist circumference will be measured. Medical outcomes and information on the processes
      of ventilator management and care will be assessed while participants are in the ICU.
      Information on hospital outcomes, quality of life, utility, employment, and living situation
      will be collected upon release from the ICU, as well as during follow-up telephone
      interviews, which will occur every 90 days for a period of up to two years.
