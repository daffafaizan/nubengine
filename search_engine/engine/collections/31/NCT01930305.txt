      in animal experiments and in clinics.In a recent study, it has been shown that perioperative
      warming was associated with a higher incidence of cognitive dysfunction in elderly
      patients.Therefore, we hypothesised that perioperative heating transfusion have a side effect
      on brain function of surgical patients.
