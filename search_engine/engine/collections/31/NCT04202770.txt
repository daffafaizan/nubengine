      agents to localized targets (determined by specific condition) by using focused transcranial
      ultrasound prior to intravenous infusion of exosomes. Exosomes, which are ubiquitous in
      blood, body fluids, and tissues are thought to play a normal physiological role in
      intercellular signaling. Exosomes delivered intravenously can be demonstrated to cross the
      blood brain barrier naturally. Exosomes and mesenchymal signaling cells (MSC's) demonstrate
      anti-inflammatory and pro-growth effects in preclinical models and clinical cases reports and
      have been used intravenously and with intracerebral and intrathecal injection. Various
      clinical trials have claimed safety and clinical efficacy.

      Focused ultrasound has been demonstrated to enhance local blood flow and has been proposed as
      a non-invasive means of targeting delivery of therapeutic agents. The present paper was
      designed to use focused ultrasound as a means of enhancing delivery of intravenous exosomes
      to the subgenual target for patients with refractory depression, the amygdala for patients
      with anxiety, and the hippocampus for patients with cognitive impairment due to
      neurodegenerative disease.
