      diabetes (T2DM), contributing to the significant economic burden on health systems and
      societies. When prediabetes is recognized, lifestyle intervention including weight loss
      through diet and exercise can reduce the relative risk of developing T2DM by more than 50%
      within 3 years. In the context of the current pandemic caused by COVID-19 the implementation
      of prevention strategies is heavily affected. Telemedicine consultations give patients the
      opportunity to receive personalized advice on disease prevention even in times of pandemic.
      Previous studies on telemedicine intervention strategies for the prevention of T2DM show that
      there is a need to further explore the utility of telemedicine and especially telephone-based
      personalized behavioural interventions in patients with prediabetes.The aim of the present
      research is to determine whether a nurse-led personalized telephone lifestyle intervention is
      effective in reducing risk factors associated with the development of T2DM in subjects with
      prediabetes, versus automated short message service (SMS).
