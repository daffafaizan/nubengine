      a site of origin for dissemination of pathogenic organisms to distant body sites, such as the
      lungs. THe aims of the study were to compare the oropharyngeal microbiological profile, VAP
      incidence, duration of mechanical ventilation, and length of stay in the intensive care unit
      of children receiving mechanical ventilation who had pharmacological or nonpharmacological
      oral care.

      A randomized and controlled study has been performed in a pediatric intensive unit in SÃ£o
      Paulo, Brazil. The children are randomly assigned to an experimental group that received oral
      care with use of 0.12% chlorhexidine digluconate or a control group that received oral care
      without an antiseptic. Oropharyngeal and tracheal secretions were collected and cultured on
      days 0, 2, and 4, and at discharge.
