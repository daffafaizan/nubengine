    
      The aim of this study is the development and implementation of a new protocol of physical
      therapy training, based on a gait training associated with executive tasks for treatment of
      individuals with Parkinson's Disease.

      The proposed motor training consists of 30 minutes of global exercises that involves
      stretching, muscle strengthen and axial mobility exercises, and after this, 30 minutes of
      gait training in a dual-task condition, associated with distracting tasks that require
      handling of the main executive functions.

      It will be an open label study, non randomized, where 30 patients with PD in stages 1 to 3 on
      Hoehn & Yahr scale will participate in the study, to be held in Brazil Parkinson Association.
      The training will consist of 10 sessions, two times per week for five weeks.

      The executive tasks concomitant with gait training cover the following executive functions:
      volition, self-awareness, planning, response inhibition, response monitoring and attention.

      The main outcome measures are: (1) Dynamic Gait Index (DGI), (2) Montreal Cognitive
      Assessment (MoCA), (3) Trail Making Test A and B, (4) Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating
      Scale (UPDRS) and (5) Falls Efficacy Scale (FES).
