    
      Triheptanoin is proposed for the treatment of seizures in glucose transporter type-1
      deficiency syndrome (Glut1 DS). Glut1 DS is a rare disease with an estimated US prevalence of
      ~3,300.

      The proposed study is an open-label study to assess the safety and long-term efficacy of
      triheptanoin in patients with Glut1 DS over a 5-year treatment period. Eligible patients may
      be those who are able to tolerate triheptanoin if they have been treated or are currently
      being treated with triheptanoin and do not qualify for any other clinical trial. Subjects
      previously treated with triheptanoin will continue to dose at approximately 35% of total
      daily calories (~1-4g/kg/day, depending on age). Subjects who are na√Øve to triheptanoin will
      begin a 2-week fixed titration schedule up until they have reached 35% of total daily
      calories.

      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety of triheptanoin via adverse
      event rates and laboratory values. The secondary objective is to evaluate the long-term
      efficacy of triheptanoin as measured by the change in seizure frequency from historical
      baseline.
