      mortality rate. And more and more young patients account for the increasing morbidity. Among
      them, Symptomatic intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis（sICAS）is a major cause, especially in
      Asians.

      Currently, traditional therapeutic methods present reluctant achievements on reducing stroke
      recurrence and pose threat on patients'health because of invasive operation and severe side
      effects. Therefore, other treatment methods are called for urgently. Remote ischemic
      post-conditioning refers to local or distal ischemia treatment after the occurrence of
      cerebral ischemia. Prior research has shown that repeatedly ischemic reperfusion have
      protective effect on lowering the occurrence rate of ischemic events of patients with carotid
      stenosis. However, in-depth research on cerebral protection and correlation with collateral
      circulation has not been proven in an open, definitive clinical trial.

      Thus, the EPIC-sICAS trial will provide important information on the protective effects of
      upper limb ischemic post-conditioning on collateral circulation after cerebral Infarction.
      Hopefully to present us a very meaningful way to improve the patient's quality of life.
