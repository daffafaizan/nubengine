      hypoxemia can be corrected with low flow nasal cannula. When placed above nasal cannula, some
      systems have demonstrated their interest in improving the performance of patient's oxygen
      delivery. For example, two recent studies have shown that adding a Double-Trunk Mask (DTM) or
      Surgical Mask (SM) above nasal cannula has the potential to improve the PaO2 despite no
      change in oxygen output (Duprez et al., J Clin Monit Comput 2020; Montiel et al., Ann
      Intensive Care 2020). However, there is no study comparing the relative effectiveness of
      these 2 systems.
