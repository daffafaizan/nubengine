      outdoor environmental conditions and are effective in relieving symptoms of seasonal (winter)
      depression, but their effectiveness in treating chronic depression has not been explored.

      Participants in this 10-week study will have an interview, a complete physical exam, and six
      one-hour appointments for progress evaluations. They will be randomly assigned to either
      light or high- or low-dose negative ions. Each treatment must be taken consistently for five
      weeks at the same time every day, after which treatment is temporarily suspended to determine
      whether symptoms return. Participants will then have the opportunity to try the alternate
      active treatment to determine which works best for them. On two occasions, participants will
      provide saliva samples, used to determine the level of melatonin, a hormone that becomes
      active at night and indicates whether a person's internal circadian clock is "in sync" with
      the day-night cycle or is early or late. This diagnostic test for melatonin, which is not yet
      readily available in medical practice, provides our research participants with unique
      information that can be used to optimize the timing of future treatment.
