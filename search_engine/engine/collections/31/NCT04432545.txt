      infusion as a treatment in patients with systemic sclerosis refractoryto conventional
      therapy. The group of patients will be collected from the database of families of Stem
      Regenerative Medicine according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria and verified in the
      academic committee.

      The administration will be intravenously, with a concentration of 2 X 10^6 mesenchymal cells
      per kilogram of patient weight. The infusions will be carried out nested at cyclophosphamide
      application cycles ten days after each application of the cyclophosphamide schedule for each
      patient. To assess safety and therapeutic effects, the occurrence of any adverse event will
      be described from start of infusion until the conclusion of the trial in six months.

      To assess the response, a pre-infusion and sixth-month post-infusion instrument will be
      applied that includes clinical variables, paraclinical and hemodynamic tests to evaluate skin
      involvement using the modified RODNAN score, changes in nail capillaroscopy, lung function
      and structural involvement by high-resolution chest tomography (hrCT), diffusion capacity for
      carbon monoxide (DLCO) and a 6-minute walk. As part of the cardiovascular assessment,
      cerebral natriuretic peptide (BNP), transthoracic echocardiogramwill be performed; The
      Cambridge Pulmonary Hypertension Outcome Review(CAMPHOR) and Sysq will be used as tools for
      the assessment of pulmonary hypertension. A comparison of these tests before initiation of
      therapy and after completion of 24 weeks of infusion scheme should be performed.
