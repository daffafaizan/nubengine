      of 12 weeks. Subjects will be observed off of PPIs for 4 weeks and then will be placed on
      PPIs for 4 weeks. Subsequently, subjects will be randomized to receive an additional 4 weeks
      of PPIs or no therapy. Stool samples will be collected at 4 separate time points.

      Study Outcomes and Statistical Analyses The primary outcome will be change in overall
      diversity of fecal flora after 4 weeks of PPIs compared to 4 weeks of no acid suppression.
      Additional outcomes to be assessed include the effect of PPIs on the relative abundance of
      Bacteroidetes at week 4 and change in the diversity of fecal flora at week 8.
