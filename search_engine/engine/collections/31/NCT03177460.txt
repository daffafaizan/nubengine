      I. Safety and tolerability of therapy with the study drugs in men with high-risk localized
      prostate cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the proportion of patients who achieve pathological complete response (CR) with
      the study drugs in men with high-risk localized prostate cancer.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To study immunological changes in tumor tissues and peripheral blood in response to the
      study drugs in men with high-risk localized prostate cancer.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM A: Patients receive daratumumab intravenously (IV) over 4-8 hours once weekly for 4 weeks
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then undergo radical
      prostatectomy during week 6.

      ARM B: Patients receive FMS inhibitor JNJ-40346527 orally (PO) twice daily (BID) for 4-5
      weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After a 3 day wash-out
      period, patients undergo radical prostatectomy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at week 18.
