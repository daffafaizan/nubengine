    
      Patients who come to the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Presbyterian Medical
      Center or American Access in Northeast Philadelphia with a dialysis catheter that's not
      functioning well, will be screened for this study.

      If the patient qualifies and consents to participate, an envelope will be opened that tells
      us to exchange the catheter for a new one OR infuse TPA (clot-dissolving drug) into the 2
      ports for two and a half hours. Some dialysis patients have had a TPA "dwell" at the dialysis
      clinic to help increase blood flow during dialysis. The motion of the "infusion" of TPA is
      expected to be more effective than a "dwell" that sits still. Also, there is more TPA used
      during "infusion" than during the "dwell".

      Once the catheter is functioning, the patient goes home as usual and follow-up is done by
      phone after the next dialysis session, at 30 days and at 60 days. Follow-up is done to check
      for flow rates during dialysis and to check for any problems related to the catheter
      treatment. Participation is complete after the 60-day follow-up phone call.
