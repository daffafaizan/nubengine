        -  Compare celecoxib vs placebo in terms of preventing the development of new actinic
           keratoses in patients with actinic keratoses.

        -  Compare these treatment regimens in terms of inducing regression of actinic keratoses in
           these patients.

        -  Determine the safety of this drug in these patients.

        -  Compare the effect of these treatment regimens on potential surrogate end-point
           biomarkers in areas of actinic keratosis, sun-exposed skin, and non-sun-exposed skin and
           correlate these biomarkers with clinical outcome in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Patients
      are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral celecoxib twice daily for 9 months in the absence of
           disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo as in arm I. Patients are followed at 2 months
           after completing treatment.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 240 patients (120 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
