    
      This prospective, single arm, multi-center study is to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of
      the Surfacer System. Safety will be evaluated based on the overall rate of acute
      complications using the study device as compared to historical rates of device/procedure
      related safety events using conventional central venous access methods. Efficacy will be
      evaluated by the rate of transient successful central venous accesses created by the study
      device. A total of 30 patients are planned to be enrolled, with 10 patients initially
      following review of safety data. Duration expected to be through 7 days. A minimum of 3 sites
      will participate in the study in the United States.
