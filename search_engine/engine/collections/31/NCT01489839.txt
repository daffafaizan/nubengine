      progression. The study will enroll 375 subjects with periodontal disease and 125
      periodontally healthy subjects. All subjects will be monitored clinically and have samples
      taken every 2 months for 12 months for analysis of inflammatory and immunological biomarkers
      and microbial species. Subjects displaying periodontal disease progression greater than an
      established threshold will receive periodontal rescue therapy at progressing periodontal
      sites and continue with monitoring. Periodontally healthy subjects and non-progressing sites
      in subjects with periodontal disease will serve as controls. After 12 months, subjects with
      periodontal disease will receive periodontal therapy consisting of 4 quadrants of scaling and
      root planing. Periodontally healthy subjects will receive prophylaxis and scaling and exit
      the study. Following periodontal therapy, subjects with periodontal disease will be followed
      for a maintenance period of 6 months for clinical and biological monitoring. Statistical
      analyses will compare biomarkers and microbial species between periodontally healthy subjects
      and subjects with periodontal disease, between progressing and non-progressing periodontally
      diseased sites, and between periodontally diseased sites before and after periodontal
      therapy.
