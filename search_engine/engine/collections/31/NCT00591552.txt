      Knowledge of lymph node status plays a key role in therapeutic decision making and prognosis.
      Associated with this dissection comes the propensity for lymphatic leakage, increased chest
      tube drainage, prolonged retention of chest tubes in the postoperative period and increased
      patient length of stay. Our center performs complete mediastinal node dissection of all
      relevant regional lymph nodes which generally include paratracheal, pretracheal, subcarinal,
      hilar and paraesophageal nodes. The current standard of practice for the dissection of the
      lymph nodes includes the use of the Harmonic Scalpel or electrocautery. Known risk of
      electrocautery include localized nerve damage, cardiac arrhythmias and damage to the tissue
      sample/specimen that is used for pathology. The Harmonic Scalpel technology has recently
      become available for use. Current experience with the Harmonic Scalpel suggests that there is
      less localized nerve damage, less incidence of arrhythmias, less damage to the tissue sample
      and less lymph leakage. There is no published data to support this hypothesis, thus the
      purpose of this study.
