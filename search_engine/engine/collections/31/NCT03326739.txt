    
      Patients presenting to the Emergency Department 18 years old or greater, who do not belong to
      a vulnerable group, requiring arterial line placement will be included in this trial. The
      investigators will randomize each patient into LM vs US. Data collected will include number
      of attempts, success rate, and time for procedure to be completed. PGY-1 residents will
      perform the arterial line placement.
