      arrest (DHCA). The most feared complication of aortic surgery is neurological injury, which
      can range from mild cognitive impairment to more severe injuries such as stroke. Due to the
      significant morbidity and mortality associated with post-operative stroke and neurological
      dysfunction, cerebral protection techniques have evolved extensively. A recommended approach
      to cerebral protection during DHCA is to deliver blood to the brain in an antegrade fashion
      via the arterial system, so called antegrade cerebral perfusion (ACP). Axillary artery
      cannulation, a form of ACP, has become the preferred method of neuroprotection for aortic
      operations requiring DHCA. However, axillary artery cannulation requires more surgical time
      and presents potential complications such as brachial plexus injury, seromas, and limb
      ischemia. The present study aims to determine whether a less common alternative strategy,
      innominate artery cannulation, offers similar neuroprotection compared to axillary artery
      cannulation and reduces operative times. A total of 110 patients undergoing elective aortic
      surgery will be randomly assigned to one of the two strategies. The primary outcome will be
      the number of patients with new ischemic lesions found on post-operative diffusion weighted
      MRI (DW-MRI) and total operative time.
