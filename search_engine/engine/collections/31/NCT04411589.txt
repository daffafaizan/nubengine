      treatment of gastric intestinal metaplasia (GIM) and early gastric cancer (EGC) is essential
      to improve patients' 5-year survival rates. Conventional endoscopy with white light imaging
      (WLI) is widely used for endoscopic evaluation of EGCs. However, conventional endoscopic
      visualization of EGCs has a high rate of interobserver variability and correlates poorly with
      the histological findings. For this reason, diagnosis has been based mostly on repeated
      endoscopy with multiple biopsy samples. It has been reported that optical enhancement (OE)
      system is useful for discriminating cancerous lesions from non-cancerous lesions. The OE
      system is the newly developed image-enhanced endoscopic technology, which combines high
      definition white light endoscopy (WLE) and optical filters that limit the spectral
      characteristics of the illumination light. The optical filters can achieve higher overall
      transmittance by connecting the peaks of the hemoglobin absorption spectrum creating a
      continuous wavelength spectrum. Magnifying endoscopy is useful for observing the mucosal
      structures and microvessels. The VS theory proposed by Yao K is widely used in Magnifying
      endoscopy with optical enhancement system (ME-OE). Based on technical considerations, it is
      conceivable that ME-OE imaging techniques might have a distinct advantage over WLE in the
      diagnosis of endoscopic lesions. However, few reports have objectively proved that ME-OE is
      superior to WLE in the detection rate and diagnostic efficiency of EGCs.
