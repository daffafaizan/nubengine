      cured by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Previous myeloablative conditioning regimen
      has problems related to the severe toxicities, and non-myeloablative conditioning regimen has
      the risk of graft failure. Recently, reduced-intensity myeloablative conditioning regimen
      with busulfan and fludarabine was used usually in leukemia patients.

      Busulfan is a highly toxic drug with narrow therapeutic window. In this study we plan to use
      optimal busulfan dose through pharmacokinetic study in stem cell transplantation of CGD
      patients.
