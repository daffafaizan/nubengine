      patients who present with symptomatic primary or idiopathic PAP. A total of 10 subjects with
      primary PAP will be enrolled over 12 months at East Carolina University. Patients over age 18
      with a clinical diagnosis of moderate symptomatic idiopathic PAP, established by appropriate
      clinical history, radiographic and physiologic findings, presence of circulating anti-GM-CSF
      antibody, and confirmatory findings on bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage and/or
      open-lung biopsy will be recruited. Patients with newly diagnosed PAP or established disease
      may be considered for this study.
