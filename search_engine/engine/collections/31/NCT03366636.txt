      Project Legacy intervention curriculum for reducing sexual risk behaviors among homeless
      youth age 14-19. CHLA project staff will work with 6 homeless youth serving sites in Southern
      California (Los Angeles, San Diego) to recruit 600 youth. Randomization to the intervention
      or control condition will occur at the group level and will be stratified by site. Field
      staff will survey all eligible homeless youth who provide consent to participate in the study
      at baseline (before randomization and implementation) and at 3 and 9 months post intervention
      (5-5.5 and 11-11.5 months post-baseline). The program group will receive an additional
      intervention-based survey immediately upon completion of the program.

      Youth in the control condition will receive the normal standard of care provided at the
      recruitment sites. Services available as standard of care at the recruitment sites include:
      medical care; mental health services; substance abuse services; educational, career, and
      vocational services. Intervention participants will not be excluded from receiving these
      services as well. Surveys will capture mental and physical health care service utilization
      and services to reduce substance use across both groups. The study team will monitor HIV and
      pregnancy prevention programming and other similar goal-planning/decision-making
      interventions offered to homeless youth in the study areas during the program implementation
      and follow-up period via interviews with site staff. The study team will include selected
      program exposure items on the follow up surveys to assess youth's self-reported exposure to
      similar goal-planning/decision-making and sexual health (pregnancy prevention and STI/HIV)
      education.
