      conditions, shifting attention between different task demands, and using working memory to
      consistently execute intended actions, and as a result limit the ability to execute routine
      ADLs. Presently there are no interventions that have demonstrated robust effectiveness in
      reducing disability among individuals with cognitive impairments after stroke. Recent
      findings suggest that individuals with cognitive impairments may experience ADL disability in
      part because they have difficulty engaging in, and benefiting from rehabilitation programs as
      they are currently delivered. In other words, individuals with cognitive impairment, due to
      the nature of their impairments, have difficulty learning and applying adaptive strategies as
      they are currently provided during traditional rehabilitation training. Therefore,
      interventions that train individuals with cognitive impairments a new way to learn and apply
      adaptive strategies may help them benefit from rehabilitation programs and reduce long-term
      disability. Cognitive Orientation to daily Occupation Performance (CO-OP) is a strategy
      training approach that trains individuals to identify problems in the performance of daily
      activities, develop strategies to address these problems, and monitor their own performance
      in the course of their daily routines. Therefore, CO-OP teaches individuals to "take charge"
      of their rehabilitation, and develop adaptive behaviors to "work around" cognitive
      impairments to meet their goals. The proposed project examines whether CO-OP facilitates
      reductions in ADL disability and improvements in rehabilitation engagement among individuals
      with cognitive impairments after acute stroke.
