      Patients in group I received pregabalin and exercise therapy, whereas those in group II
      received exercise therapy alone. All patients were evaluated as follows: for pain by VAS;
      trigger-point pressure pain threshold-(PPT) by algometry; neuropathic pain using DN4 and
      quality of life with the SF36. Evaluations were performed pretreatment and at the end of the
      first and third months of treatment.
