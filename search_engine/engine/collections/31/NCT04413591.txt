        1. To examine the effect of exposure to community intervention components on HIV/STI risk
           behaviors (e.g., drug use/unprotected sex), and HIV/STI cumulative incidence over time
           in FSWs in the intervention (n=275) compared to those in the comparison group (N=175);

           a. to explore the intervention's effects on the risk environment of exotic dance clubs
           (N=15) over time

        2. To examine how socio-structural (e.g., social cohesion, stigma) and structural
           vulnerability (e.g., financial and housing stability) indicators change and are
           associated with the biological and behavioral outcomes over time in FSWs in the
           intervention (n=275) compared to those in the comparison (n=175) group

           a. examine the role of these indicators as mediators of the intervention effect on study
           outcomes;

        3. To examine the intervention's implementation through qualitative (e.g., in-depth
           interviews) and quantitative (e.g., assessment of program fit, reach, facilitators,
           barriers, program costs) measures.

      3.1 To examine participant knowledge of the COVID-19 crisis as well as the impact of the
