    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the safety and tolerability of GSK2118436 (dabrafenib) given with pazopanib
      (pazopanib hydrochloride) as well as determining the maximum tolerated dosing regimen in
      patients with BRAF mutated advanced malignant tumors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate pharmacokinetics of the two study drugs and identify potential drug-drug
      interactions.

      II. Determine pharmacogenomics with microarray testing. III. Perform genotyping of tumors and
      if objective tumor response rates are identified.

      IV. Assess objective tumor response rates.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive dabrafenib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28 (once daily on day 1
      and BID on days 3-28 of course 1), and pazopanib hydrochloride PO once daily (QD) on days
      1-28 (days 2-28 of course 1). Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks.
