      replication and consequently preserve the functioning of immune system. HAART therapy is a
      lifelong treatment with several different concomitantly administered oral medications.
      According to studies, low adherence to treatment is directly related to patient's knowledge
      and beliefs about HAART.

      Studies have shown the success of different interventions increasing adherence to HAART, but
      additional studies need to be carried out in order to determine the most effective components
      of the interventions and the methods most suitable considering the local context, that could
      be used in everyday work and with limited resources.

      The first places to implement the activities directed at improving treatment adherence are
      medical institutions, i.e. the departments of infectious diseases where HIV-positive
      individuals receive HAART treatment.

      The aims of the study are:

        -  to determine the rate of adherence to HAART and its associated factors;

        -  to conduct a small-scale intervention (randomised controlled) study implementing a brief
           adherence counseling targeting persons receiving HAART.
