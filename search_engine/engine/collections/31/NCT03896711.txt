      NIH Stage III (Real World Efficacy) randomized trial, Making Engagement Meaningful through
      Organized Routine Interaction (MEMORI) Corps, a novel 12-week activity-based companion care
      model, to mobilize and equip a critical mass of senior volunteers to deliver individualized,
      evidence-based activity programming to PWD living at home and offer family CGs needed
      respite. Synthesizing and adapting prior evidence-based work from the Tailored Activities
      Program® (a proven activity-based intervention to address functional decline and behavioral
      symptoms in persons with dementia), Experience Corps® (an inter-generational civic engagement
      program that engages senior volunteers to work in elementary schools to improve academic
      outcomes for children and improve health outcomes for the volunteers), and MIND at Home® (a
      home-based dementia care coordination program delivered by non-clinical care coordinators
      supported by a clinical team), MEMORI Corps takes a social model of health approach to
      simultaneously address unmet respite care needs of family CGs, provide PWD structured
      meaningful activities and social engagement, and provide meaningful engagement and peer
      support opportunities for senior volunteers-creating potential for a "win-win-win" scenario.

      This single blind, two-arm, randomized controlled trial will evaluate the feasibility and
      efficacy of a 12-week, evidence-based, individualized MEMORI Corps program delivered by
      trained senior volunteers (n=80) to community-living PWD and participant's family caregivers
      (n=240 dyads). Core intervention components include: (1) detailed initial home-based
      assessment of interests and preserved abilities of PWD; (2) individualized activity program
      plans based on interests and abilities; (3) training of volunteers in communication and
      simplification strategies and use of activity program plans; (4) delivery of activity plans
      by volunteers to PWD over 12 weeks (8 hours/week) in participant's homes; (5) family CG
      education on activity plans and ways to utilize respite opportunities; and (6) support of
      volunteers from a skilled multidisciplinary clinical team. PWD/CG outcomes will be assessed
      at baseline, 6-, and 12-weeks. Volunteer outcomes will be assessed at baseline, 6- and
      12-months (volunteer participation lasts 12 months).

      Specific aims are to evaluate the:

      Aim 1: Efficacy of the MEMORI Corps intervention on community-living PWD quality of life and
      neuropsychiatric symptoms at 6- and 12-weeks (primary endpoint) versus augmented wait-list
      control.

      Aim 2: Efficacy of MEMORI Corps intervention on CG subjective and objective burden and
      depressive symptoms at 6- and 12-weeks (primary endpoint) versus augmented wait-list control.

      Aim 3: Efficacy of MEMORI Corps intervention on volunteer physical function, cognition, and
      social and psychological engagement at 6-months and 12-months (primary endpoint) versus
      augmented wait-list control.

      Aim 4: Acceptability and feasibility of implementing the MEMORI Corps program from various
      stakeholder perspectives (PWD, informal CGs, senior volunteers, volunteer
      coordinators/supervisors).
