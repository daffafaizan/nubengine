      quantitative SPECT imaging will be correlated to the ex vivo tracer distribution in patients
      undergoing pancreatectomy or a Whipple procedure. In vivo imaging will be combined with
      post-pancreatectomy (micro)autoradiography, measurement of In-111-DTPA-exendin-4
      concentrations in the pancreas using a gamma counter and morphometric determination of the
      actual beta cell mass. By this means, the relation between tracer uptake and beta cell mass
      in non-diabetic patients and T2D patients will be established. These highly relevant data
      will allow the improvement of the interpretation of clinical quantitative SPECT data in
      subsequent studies in patients with T1D and T2D. In addition, high uptake has been observed
      in the duodenum/pyloric area in patients in an ongoing study. At this point in time, it
      remains unclear which cells are responsible for this uptake. It would be of great interest to
      identify the GLP-1R positive cells in order to better understand the physiological actions of
      GLP-1 agonists.
