      resource and opportune time to minimize stress and optimize weight gain, nutrition, and
      activity, positively impacting outcomes and lifelong health. The overarching hypothesis of
      this study is that a simple, personalized, smartphone-based activity intervention using a
      wrist-based activity tracker will help high risk pregnant women increase their activity level
      during pregnancy, reduce stress, and optimize gestational weight gain and biometric
      parameters. Importantly, the investigators propose that women can be engaged in care via a
      simple, personalized text-message based intervention.

      Women will be enrolled early in pregnancy and followed prospectively. All women will receive
      a wrist-based activity tracker. Some women (those randomized to receive individualized
      counseling) will receive weekly text messages based on their activity and sleep in the prior
      week. Other women will not receive any specific instructions regarding activity level. The
      investigators will follow their outcomes prospectively. Biologic samples (including blood,
      urine, vaginal swabs, placental tissue) will be collected at enrollment and at delivery.
