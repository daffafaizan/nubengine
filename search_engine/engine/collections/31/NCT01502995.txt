      determine whether a laser light beam, attached to a rolling walker and projected onto the
      floor, reduces freezing episodes. Patients will perform two trials of 3 timed walking tasks:
      once with the laser beam and once without. For each trial, the time to complete, number of
      steps, and number of freezing episodes will be recorded. Patients will be randomized to
      perform the first trial either with the light or without the light, to control for fatigue.
