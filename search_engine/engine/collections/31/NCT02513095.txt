      Due to the life-threatening nature of exertional heat stroke (EHS), rapid assessment for
      inclusion into the study and subsequent immediate treatment must occur. Following initial
      triage and primary assessment of a subject, the subject's baseline status should be
      documented, and once a diagnosis of EHS is obtained, SOC treatment will be initiated
      immediately, the subject will be randomized to one of two treatment arms (SOC only or SOC
      plus Ryanodex).

      Patients will be remain hospitalized for up to 72 hours after administration of the first
      dose of study drug and implemented SOC and will receive all necessary supportive measures
      until resolution of symptoms.

      Study duration: 72 hours
