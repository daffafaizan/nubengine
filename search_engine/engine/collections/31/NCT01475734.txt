    
      This is a Phase II, single-site, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group,
      placebo-controlled, stepped glucose clamp study designed to investigate the effect of
      treatment with albiglutide on counter-regulatory hormone responses and recovery from
      hypoglycemia in subjects with Type 2 diabetes mellitus. A single dose of albiglutide or
      placebo will be given 3 days before employing a stepped hyper- and hypoglycemic clamp. The
      goal of this study is to demonstrate that albiglutide increases insulin secretion and
      decreases glucagon levels in a glucose-dependent manner. In particular, this study is being
      conducted to ensure that albiglutide does not impair counter-regulatory responses during
      hypoglycemia.
