      endotracheal intubation often is avoided in patients undergoing vocal cord surgery.

      Instead intermittent so called jet ventilation is carried out by using the Hunsaker Mon-jet
      tube. The safe conduct of these procedures requires full muscle paralysis. In clinical
      practice, however, deep neuromuscular blockade (NMB) usually cannot be established for this
      relatively short surgery (<1h) because of an increased risk of prolonged NMB and
      postoperative ventilation.

      The novel neuromuscular blockade reversal agent sugammadex may prove particularly useful in
      this patient population because it allows fast and reliable reversal of even deep NMB. Deeper
      muscle paralysis during vocal cord surgery may be associated with better surgical conditions.

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether deep neuromuscular blockade provides better
      surgical conditions than moderate neuromuscular blockade in patients undergoing vocal cord
      resections requiring jet ventilation.
