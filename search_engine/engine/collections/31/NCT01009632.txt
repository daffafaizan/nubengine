      correspond to high-amplitude, low impact vocal cord oscillations, "resonant voice," improve
      the amount and time-course of recovery from acute phonotrauma, compared to vocal rest or
      spontaneous speech, as measured with molecular assays (primarily) and with behavioral and
      clinical tests (secondarily)?
