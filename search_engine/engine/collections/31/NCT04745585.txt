      non-compressible hemorrhage. Point of Care Ultrasonographically guided External Aortic
      Compression (POCUS-PEAC), a new technique, has been used for management of junctional
      hemorrhage. The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of US-PEAC to M-PEAC in reducing
      the distal arterial flow. This study also evaluates whether a small weight operator would
      benefit most of the US-PEAC compared to a standard weight operator. Other objectives are to
      evaluate pain and secondary effects. We will conduct an experimental crossover trial on
      healthy volunteers. Subjects will be recruited using a convenient sample. M-EAC and US-EAC
      will be performed on each subject. Femoral arterial flows will be measured by Doppler before
      and after each compression. Femoral flow reduction will be calculated for each technique and
      compared. The compression will be first accomplished by an 80 kg operator followed by a 57 kg
      operator. After each compression, pain will be evaluated using a visual analog scale (VAS).
      Fifteen minutes after the intervention, pain will be recorded using the same VAS. A follow-up
      will be ensured at 24 hours and at one week to evaluate for secondary effects.
