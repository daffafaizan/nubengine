      impaction of the fetal head deep in the maternal pelvis and is associated with increased risk
      of both maternal and perinatal complications. There is little existing data to inform
      management of deeply impacted fetal heads, therefore these situations can be difficult for
      surgeons and other healthcare staff when they arise. Team simulations for obstetric
      emergencies have been shown to assist with provider comfort, improved clarity of thinking,
      and quicker action during emergency situations resulting in improved outcomes.

      This study aims to show that a simulation education project for the entire obstetric team can
      decrease morbidity of difficult fetal head extraction associated with second stage cesarean
      deliveries and improve provider and nursing staff confidence regarding anticipation and
      management of this emergency. The simulation education project is not being conducted for the
      purpose of research, but is a department-wide educational activity and Quality Improvement
      project.
