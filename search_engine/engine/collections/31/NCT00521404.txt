    
      Primary Objective:

      - To evaluate the efficacy of CS-1008 administered in combination with gemcitabine to
      chemotherapy naive subjects with unresectable or metastatic pancreatic cancer, based on the
      progression-free survival at 16 weeks.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To evaluate the efficacy of CS-1008 administered in combination with gemcitabine on
           overall progression-free survival rate, objective response rate, duration of response,
           and overall survival.

        -  To determine the pharmacokinetics of BIP CS-1008 and DSC CS-1008.

        -  To study potential biomarkers of CS-1008 activity

        -  To assess possible human anti-human antibody formation after exposure to CS-1008

        -  To evaluate the safety profile of CS-1008 when administered in combination with
           gemcitabine to chemotherapy naive subjects with unresectable or metastatic pancreatic
           cancer.
