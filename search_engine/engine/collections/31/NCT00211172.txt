        1. Assess the persistence of beta blocker use for post-acute myocardial infarction (AMI)
           patients following a direct to patient intervention designed to increase rates of
           evidence-based long-term use of medications (beta blockers, lipid lowering agents,
           aspirin and ACE inhibitors) that increase survival following AMI.

        2. Describe patient and system characteristics associated with differences in impact of the
           intervention

      Research Design and Methods:

      We will conduct a randomized controlled trial within the 4 participating HMOs (Kaiser
      Permanente Northwest, Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, Health Partners, and Kaiser Permanente
      Georgia). Inpatient data will be used to identify patients with a primary discharge diagnosis
      of AMI 4-6 months before the extraction date. Practices will be block-randomized to the
      intervention group or to usual care. To increase repetition of the message, there will be two
      personalized mailings, occurring at 4-6 months post AMI, and at 9 months. The first message
      will include elements in the table below, and the repeat message will be shorter, but include
      similar information. The message will come from the patient's own health plan with the choice
      of specific individual (e.g. quality assurance department, medical director, or Chief of
      Cardiology) being informed by our qualitative work. This intervention will be done in
      collaboration with the cardiovascular care committees and quality assurance departments of
      participating Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs).
