      period, placing the patient at high risk for adverse events, including the experience of a
      medical error or loss of community tenure. Recent successful studies have used a Care
      Transition Intervention (CTI), using a nurse who conducts home visits, telephone follow-up,
      and provides assistance at and after discharge. Although successful, this model is costly and
      and not feasible in settings serving geographically dispersed populations. We propose a
      cost-efficient technological solution to the problems presented by the traditional CTI
      through "e-Coach," an Interactive-Voice-Response-supported (IVR) Care Transition coaching
      intervention. We propose to develop and evaluate "e-Coach," by performing a randomized
      controlled trial of this intervention versus a usual care comparison group. Our Specific Aims
      are to: 1) Randomize 720 patients at high risk of transition-related errors (complex adult
      patients discharged alive after a hospitalization with congestive heart failure (CHF) or
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), from a geographically diverse area including
      many rural areas across Alabama and the South) to an IVR-supported care transition program
      ("e-Coach") versus a usual care comparison group. The IVR system will actively call patients
      at multiple intervals after discharge. In a stepped-care approach, the IVR will be further
      supported by a Care Transition nurse who monitors patient symptoms through the e-Coach IVR
      and supports patient self management through telephone-based interactions when needed, up to
      3 months after discharge; 2) Evaluate use of the e-Coach by patients and healthcare
      providers; 3) Evaluate the impact of the e-Coach on patient outcomes, including 90 day
      rehospitalizations, successful community tenure over a 3 month period, medication
      discrepancies, and patient self-efficacy based on the previously validated Care Transition
      Measure; and 4) Quantify the cost associated with the e-Coach.
