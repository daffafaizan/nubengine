    
      Patients will be eligible for inclusion if their primary tumors have been resected and if the
      patients have histologically confirmed wild-type-KRAS colorectal adenocarcinoma with
      synchronous liver-confined metastases deemed non-resectable. Eligible patients will be
      randomly assigned to chemotherapy plus cetuximab (arm A) or chemotherapy alone (arm B).
      Treatment will be planned to commence between 2 and 4 weeks after the primary surgery.
      Treatment will continue until tumor response indicates suitability for surgery for liver
      metastases or until disease progression or unacceptable toxic effects. The primary endpoint
      is the conversion rate to radical resection for liver metastasesï¼Œwhich will be assessed by
      local multidisciplinary team (includes more than three liver surgeons and one radiologist)
      with the use of contrast-enhanced CT or MRI after 4 cycles and then every other 2 cycles up
      to 12 cycles. To provide an objective assessment of changes in resectability, radiological
      images will be presented by a radiologist to more than 3 liver surgeons, who are blinded to
      the clinical data. Patients will be considered resectable if 50% or more of surgeons vote for
      radical resection of LM. For patients whose liver-metastases are assessed resectable,
      resection should be scheduled to be performed within 2~3 weeks of the last treatment cycle.
      Following resection, patients will be advised to continue the same therapeutic regimen until
      the treatments reach a sum of 12 cycles.
