      of subjects with chronic stroke, will improve subjects' proximal arm active range-of-motion.
      We hypothesize that the combination of assisted movement, torque biofeedback, and muscle
      vibration will reduce impairment (i.e., increase strength and range-of-motion; decrease
      inappropriate patterns of muscle contraction) and, thereby, lead to more accurate reaching
      with the proximal arm.
