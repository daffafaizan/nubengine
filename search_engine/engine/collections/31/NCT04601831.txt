      day 30 PET/CT evaluation. Of those who do not, the large majority (~70%) ultimately fail,
      while ~30% convert to CR after a median time of 64 days (range, 49-424). This group of
      patients, who have incomplete response on day 30 PET/CT after CAR-T and thus are most likely
      to fail CAR-T alone, may be the ideal target for early therapeutic intervention to 're-prime'
      CAR-T and convert them from IR to CR.

      Preclinical and early clinical studies suggest potential immune augmentation when combining
      RT with CAR-T. Therefore, we propose a phase I/II clinical trial investigating the impact of
      RT to poor responding sites of disease after CD19-directed CAR-T in R/R NHL patients who are
      likely to fail CAR-T alone. We hypothesize that focal RT to residual FDG-avid sites of
      disease on day 30 PET/CT will improve the number of patients who convert to CR by day 90
      PET/CT both through local cytotoxic effects as well as local and systemic synergistic effects
      through 're-priming' of CAR T-cells.
