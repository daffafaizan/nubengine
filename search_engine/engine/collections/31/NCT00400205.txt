      cisplatinum, and 5-fluorouracil in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity
      to determine what effects these agents may have on cancer cells.

      Approximately 60 patients will take part at multi-sites with potentially 20 patients
      participating at the Emory Winship Cancer Institute in Atlanta, Georgia.
