      however, adherence to both medication and therapy regimes is low. Thus, identifying effective
      adjunct treatments for ADHD is imperative.

      Previous studies exploring computerized training programs as supplementary treatments have
      targeted working memory or attention. However, many lines of research point to inhibitory
      control (IC) playing a central role in ADHD pathophysiology. IC abnormalities in children
      with ADHD have been evidenced both in behavioral performance on computerized tasks as well as
      in the structure and function of neural systems known to support IC function. Furthermore,
      these IC abnormalities have been linked to symptom severity.

      Given findings that the most successful training interventions for children with ADHD are
      those that have implemented IC training along wtih working memory or attention and previous
      work demonstrating that IC is a central deficit for children with ADHD, it is surprising that
      no studies have sought to investigate programs that specifically target IC. Investigators
      hypothesize that training IC alone will decrease symptoms of ADHD, and information confirming
      this hypothesis would contribute to making training regimens for children with ADHD efficient
      by identifying the primary cognitive skill that requires intervention. To test this, they
      administer a randomized control trial of either adaptive of non-adaptive stop signal reaction
      time (SSRT) tasks to children with ADHD and assess effects of training on ADHD symptoms and
      neural activity.
