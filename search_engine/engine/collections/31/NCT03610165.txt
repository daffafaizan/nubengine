      fail because it is difficult to predict which patients will become hypotensive, much less
      when. A risk score for predicting minute-by-minute intraoperative hypotension is not
      currently available. Yet it seems likely that ability to identify when a patient is likely to
      become hypotensive, and the pathophysiology of the event, will improve hemodynamic management
      and perhaps patient outcome. Acumen HPI appears to be a reliable predictor of intraoperative
      hypotension, and should thus help clinicians anticipate and avoid hypotension. Furthermore,
      the secondary guidance provided by the Acumen HPI may help clinicians optimally manage fluids
      and thus prevent future episodes in the same patient.

      AIMS To determine whether use of Acumen HPI software to guide intraoperative hemodynamic
      management in the non-cardiac surgery reduces the duration and severity of hypotension.

      PRIMARY HYPOTHESIS Our primary hypothesis is that use of the Acumen HPI software guidance
      reduces TWA intraoperative hypotension below a threshold of 65 mmHg.

      Specifically, we will compare the amount of intraoperative hypotension below mean-arterial
      pressure (MAP) threshold of 65 mmHg, in patients randomized to invasive arterial pressure
      monitoring vs. invasive arterial pressure monitoring with Acumen Hypotension Prediction Index
      software. In both cases, clinicians will strive to keep MAP above 65 mmHg to the extent
      practical.
