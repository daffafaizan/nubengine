        -  Compare the incidence and severity of erlotinib-, cetuximab-, or other epidermal growth
           factor receptor inhibitor-induced skin rash development in patients with cancer treated
           with prophylactic topical sunscreen vs placebo.

        -  Determine the toxicity of topical sunscreen vs placebo in these patients.

        -  Determine whether discontinuation of treatment intervention is followed by rash
           development.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Patients
      are stratified according to chemotherapy regimen (first-line chemotherapy vs other),
      epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor therapy (small molecule vs monoclonal
      antibodies), concurrent medication that increases sun hypersensitivity (yes vs no), and
      gender. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients apply sunscreen generously to the entire body twice daily for 4 weeks.

        -  Arm I: Patients apply placebo generously to the entire body twice daily for 4 weeks.

      Patients complete self-reported questionnaires regarding their rash status at baseline and
      then weekly for 8 weeks.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 8 weeks.
