        -  Determine whether [18F]-labeled substance P antagonist receptor quantifier positron
           emission tomography can identify pancreatic cancer evident on multiphase CT scan.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo multiphase CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. No more than
      15 days later, patients receive [18F]-labeled substance P antagonist receptor quantifier IV
      and undergo positron emission tomography over 6 hours.

      Blood is collected periodically to measure the metabolism of the radiotracer by high
      performance liquid chromatography with radioactive detectors.
