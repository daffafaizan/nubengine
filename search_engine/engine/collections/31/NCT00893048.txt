      since cellulitis is not a reportable disease. In some Emergency Departments up to 3% of
      visits are for cellulitis. Depending on the severity of the disease, some are treated as
      outpatients, and others are admitted for IV antibiotics. In some Emergency Departments cases
      of cellulitis are treated in an observation area for 23 hours with doses of IV antibiotics.
      My proposed research is to see if the addition of one dose of prednisone the treatment will
      decrease the inflammatory reaction enough to decrease length of stay and treatment and
      increase patient satisfaction.
