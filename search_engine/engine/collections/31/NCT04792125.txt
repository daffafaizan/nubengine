      were divided into three groups of PFMT (n:17), EES (n:17) and PFMT+ EES (n:17) by block
      randomization. The PFMT was applied every day of the week, and EES was applied 3 days a week
      for 8 weeks. Pelvic floor muscle strength (PFMS), pelvic floor muscle endurance, subjective
      perception of improvement, severity of incontinence, quality of life, pelvic floor
      dysfunction (PTD) and urinary parameters were assessed as outcome variables. All
      measurements, except subjective perception of improvement were investigated before and after
      treatment.
