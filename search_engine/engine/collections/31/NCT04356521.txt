    
      The CC approach is a recently introduced infraclavicular approach that targets three cords
      (medial, lateral and posterior) located lateral to the axillary artery in the costoclavicular
      space. Cords in this space are located more superficially than with the classical approach at
      the lateral infraclavicular fossa and are clustered but maintain a consistent anatomical
      relationship with each other.

      Patients will be divided into two groups:

      Group LS: Ultrasound-guided infraclavicular block - lateral sagittal approach (20 ml 0.5%
      bupivacaine)

      Group CC: Ultrasound-guided infraclavicular block - costoclavicular approach (20 ml 0.5%
      bupivacaine)
