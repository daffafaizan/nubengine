      center of the macula in adults of working age. Though previously the condition was considered
      stress-related, multiple recent reports have indicated correlation of appearance of CSC with
      exposure to exogenous or elevated levels of endogenous corticosteroid. Since the level of
      endogenous corticosteroids is upregulated in many inflammatory conditions, control of the
      inflammation may downregulate the endogenous steroids thus eliminating the stimulus for CSC.
      Methotrexate (MTX) is widely used to control different types of inflammation. Few short
      retrospective series of beneficial effect of MTX on CSC were reported recently. The
      investigators are going to try an escalating doses of MTX to treat CSC under full medical
      supervision in a prospective manner.
