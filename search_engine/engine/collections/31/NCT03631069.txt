      suffer from dementia, a syndrome associated with progressive decline in brain function. While
      there is currently no cure for most types of dementia, early diagnosis can help patients
      receive the appropriate treatment and support to help maintain mental function.

      The focus of this project is to identify changes in retinal structure associated with
      dementia. In collaboration with bioinformatics experts at University College London (UCL),
      the investigators propose to analyse our repository of >1 million retinal scans, termed
      optical coherence tomography (OCT), performed regularly on patients since 2008. OCT scans
      will be linked at a patient level to data from the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) database
      to identify those who have been diagnosed with dementia or went on the develop dementia.
      Thus, a pseudonymised classified dataset of retinal scans will be generated for qualitative
      and quantitative analysis. The primary objective is to characterise changes in the layers of
      the retina associated with dementia. Machine learning techniques may also be employed to
      identify novel patterns of retinal change associated with dementia.
