    
      Cervical radiculopathy caused by spondylosis or disc protrusion is a common disorder with a
      usually benign natural course. Often, physiotherapy (exercise programs) and/or cervical
      collar are prescribed. However, there are no reliable data on the effects of these
      conservative therapies.

      In this study, patients with acute cervical radiculopathy, defined by clinical criteria, are
      randomized for cervical collar, physiotherapy or a wait-and-see policy.
