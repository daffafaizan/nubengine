      due to a lack of data in the literature. Thus, the interest of monitoring cannot be asserted
      and its superiority over waiting for a fixed delay has not been proven.

      Due to a large inter-individual variability on the delay of the NMB onset after
      administration of atracurium, the relevance of monitoring NMB during an anesthetic induction
      should be assessed to improve the quality of laryngoscopy.

      In case of monitoring, the experts recommend monitoring the NMB onset at the corrugator
      supercilli because it reflects neuromuscular blockade at the laryngeal adductor muscles.

      During the pre-anaesthetic visit, patients will be enrolled after inform consent.

      Patients will be randomized in two groups, control group (waiting for a 3-minute delay after
      injection of atracurium) or monitoring group (waiting for the TOF ratio at 0 at the
      corrugator supercilli).

      Anesthetic induction will be performed with sufentanil, propofol and atracurium. After
      laryngoscopy, the primary outcome will be evaluated using Copenhagen score.

      Patients will be followed up until they leave the recovery room..
