      incudes shorter operation time due to simulatous surgery transanlly and transabdominally,
      reduced operative difficulty in narrow male pelvis, less retained rectal cuff and less
      "dog-ear" formation. However, its adgange has not been proven in prospecitve randomized
      trials. The aim of current study is to compare the short and long-term postoperative outcome
      of transanal versus transabdominal minimally invasive proctectomy with ileal pouch-annal
      anastomosis in patients with ulcerative colitis.
