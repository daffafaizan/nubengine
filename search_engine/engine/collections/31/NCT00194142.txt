      has been infected with CMV, they may have recurrences (relapses) of the infection. If a
      mother is infected with the virus or relapses during pregnancy, her fetus may be at risk for
      infection. Unlike infection in adults, congenital infection may result in serious
      complications (congenital infection). The effects of fetal infection with CMV are well
      understood and many efforts have been made to potentially reduce the risk of congenital
      infection. However, the effect of CMV infection on the pregnancy itself (when the fetus is
      not affected by CMV) is less understood.

      The incidence of CMV detection in amniotic fluid collected in the second trimester is thought
      to be low. However, the association between detection of CMV infection in the second
      trimester and ultimate pregnancy outcome is poorly described.

      In this study, we plan to determine if CMV detection in amniotic fluid collected in the
      second trimester is associated with pregnancy complications.
