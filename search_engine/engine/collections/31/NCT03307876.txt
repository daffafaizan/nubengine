      identified in patients with degenerative disc disease (DDD). Alpha-2-macroglobulin (A2M) can
      prevent the formation of the G3 domain of aggrecan, reducing the fibronectin-aggrecan G3
      complex and therefore may be an efficacious treatment. The present study was designed to
      determine 1) the ability of autologous platelet poor plasma (PPP) with concentrated A2M to
      relieve back pain in patients with low back pain (LBP) from DDD and 2) the ability of FAC to
      predict the response to this biologic therapy.

      Study design/setting: Prospective cohort

      Patients: 24 patients with low back pain and MRI-concordant DDD

      Methods: All patients underwent lavage for molecular discography and delayed FAC analysis and
      injection of autologous platelet poor plasma (PPP) rich in A2M (Cytonics Autologous Protease
      Inhibitor Concentrate, APIC) at the time of the procedure. ANOVA with Bonferonni correction
      for multiple comparisons was performed.
