      action of vaporized PFC inhalation will be evaluated on the treatment of ALI/ARDS patients,
      and the safety of vaporized PFC inhalation on the treatment of ALI/ARDS. The Test group will
      make a timing and fix quantify inhalation of PFC, while the control group will be treated
      with the inhalation of water for injection. The general condition of patients will be
      assessed by monitoring their vital signs, hematology testing and APACHE II score, etc. Main
      outcome measures include the oxygenation index, respiratory mechanics; secondary outcomes
      include ventilator-free days, 28-day mortality and so on.
