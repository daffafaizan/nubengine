    
      OUTLINE:

      This is a dose-escalation study of CD4+ and CD8+ HA-1 TCR T cells.

      Patients receive fludarabine for 1-3 doses 3-14 days prior to HA-1 TCR T cell administration.
      Patients then receive CD4+ and CD8+ HA-1 TCR T cells intravenously (IV) over 1 hour.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up closely for 12 weeks and then
      every 6 months for years 1-5, and every year for years 6-15.
