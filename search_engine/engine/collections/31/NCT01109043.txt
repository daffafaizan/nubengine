      with Concor [bisoprolol] or Concor Plus [bisoprolol + hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ)].

      The objectives of this study are:

      After 6 months of the therapy treatment, 60% of the subjects showed a heart rate â‰¥ 80
      beats/min.

      An improved quality of life information after 6 months of therapy treatment, collected by
      asking standardised questions A decrease in systolic and diastolic BP after 6 months
      presented significant differences Digital sphygmomanometers (BP measuring devices) will be
      supplied in order to document the values of BP and heart rate. Blood pressure and heart rate
      should be measured at least 2 times, ideally 4 times per day. Furthermore, every subject will
      additionally receive a documentation sheet, where he/she will record the measurement data.
      The documentation sheet will be a part of the improvement of the quality of life; it can be
      removed and passed on.

      Every subject will be explained how to use and handle the BP measuring device and the
      importance of the documentation. The assessment of the quality of life must be made at the
      beginning and at the end of 6 month therapy. Within the framework of the examination the
      attending physician will ask 8 standard questions (SQ-8 Short Form Health Survey). The
      questionnaire will be a part of the quality of life assessment.

      The main focus of the observation is on the age group < 55 years with concomitant diseases,
      such as diabetes or ketohexokinase (KHK).
