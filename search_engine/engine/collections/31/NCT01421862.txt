        -  Define a "non-response" signature that will help up-front identification of cases of
           intermediate-risk acute myeloid leukemia (AML) destined to fail existing
           standard-of-care therapy.

        -  Identify biological pathways in the "non-response" group that can provide targets for
           novel therapeutics.

      OUTLINE: DNA and RNA extracted from cryopreserved bone marrow cells and/or blood cells are
      analyzed for mutations and gene expression signatures (genome-wide methylation, mRNA and
      miRNA expression, and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis) by microarray assays.
