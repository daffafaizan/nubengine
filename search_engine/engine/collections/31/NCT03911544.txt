      and autonomic and sensory blockade of responses to noxious stimulation.

      Depth of anesthesia in standard practice is controlled by monitoring equipment such as blood
      pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), train of four ratio (TOF) and by clinical signs such as
      profuse sweating, tearing, cough and movements.

      BIS can be used as additional tool to monitor and manage anesthesia. BIS is an empirically
      derived scale for measuring brain electrical activity. It computes an index between 0 and
      100, whereas 0 corresponds to "no detectable brain electrical activity" (flatline EEG) and
      100 to awake state. A patient is considered to be appropriately anesthetized when the BIS'
      value is between 40 and 60.
