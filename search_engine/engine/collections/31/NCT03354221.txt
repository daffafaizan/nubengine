      patients with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). Dietary studies were initially reported in
      children, but the results appear to be similar in adult patients. Elemental diets are
      successful in 70-95% of patients but are poorly tolerated.

      The six food elimination diet (SFED) involves the elimination of the six most common food
      allergens (i.e. milk, wheat, soy, eggs, nuts, and fish) for six weeks and has become the
      mainstay of dietary therapy in EoE. A six week SFED has demonstrated excellent efficacy and
      durability in both pediatric and adult EoE. However, compliance with the SFED for a total of
      six weeks can be challenging for patients.

      Previous studies have found the esophageal sponge to be an accurate technique of accessing
      esophageal eosinophilia in EoE . The sponge is swallowed as a 12 mm capsule on a string. The
      capsule rapidly dissolves upon entering the stomach and the sponge then expands and can be
      pulled out the mouth five minutes after ingestion. In previous studies, the procedure was
      very well tolerated and all patients preferred the sponge to endoscopy. Therefore the sponge
      is a well tolerated, inexpensive, very low risk procedure that would be an ideal option to
      replace EGD esophageal sampling in the evaluation of dietary treatment of EoE.

      Although initially described as a six week trial, it is possible that a shorter duration food
      elimination diet of 2 or 4 weeks would have equal efficacy. This would have important
      implications for patients as it would make the diet more tolerable.
