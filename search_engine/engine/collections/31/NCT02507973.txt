      as determined by the attending trauma intensivists. 12-18 hours after recruitment, continuous
      monitoring of participants' ICP and hemodynamic status will commence to collect participants'
      baseline data for 30 minutes.

      Participants will then undergo low tidal volume mechanical ventilation (LOTV), serving as a
      control mode of ventilation, for 2 hours prior to switching back to the primary mode of
      ventilation for 30 minutes. Next, patients will be placed on Airway Pressure Release
      Ventilation (APRV) for 2 hours. While receiving APRV, participants Intracranial pressure and
      hemodynamic status will be continuously monitored and recorded for comparison and analysis.
      After 2 hours of APRV, patients will be switched back to their previous mode of ventilation
      and more data collected for another 30 minutes.
