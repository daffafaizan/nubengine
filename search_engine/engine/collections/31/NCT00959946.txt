      concluded that further translational biomarker analyses were needed to better define the
      breast tumor biomarkers that predict sensitivity to Src family kinase inhibitors. Thus the
      Sponsor made a determination to stop the study after Part 1 as communicated to investigators
      on 02Dec2010 . No subjects were enrolled into Part 2 of this study. The study was not
      terminated due to safety reasons.
