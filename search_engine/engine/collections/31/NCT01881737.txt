      behavioral deficits in adults with autism. Pregnenolone is a naturally occurring hormone
      found in the body which has been shown to help with the function of nerve cells. It is also
      shown to modulate the activity of certain brain receptors implicated in autism.

      Pregnenolone has been used safely in research studies involving individuals with
      schizophrenia. In the proposed trial, we hope to examine the tolerability of pregnenolone in
      adults with autism. We hope to see improvement in behavioral outcomes as measured by
      standardized behavioral measures. Further, we will measure concentrations of pregnenolone and
      related neuroactive compounds in the blood. The use of pregnenolone has been studied in a
      number of mental disorders but not autism. Thus, we hope the study will identify new avenues
      of research for the treatment of autism.
