    
      The purpose of this study is to begin to test a brain training video game in people with
      Multiple Sclerosis (MS).

      Visit 1. After informed consent, you will complete a series of questions about your
      functioning and mood. You will then complete a series of tests (vision, hand tapping,
      walking). Then, you will complete a set of thinking tests. The first set will be paper and
      pencil. The second set will be on a tablet or a computer. You will use your study code to
      sign into these tools and you won't provide any personal details for the digitized tests.

      Finally, you will complete the "cognitive training tool". There are two versions of this
      digital, iPad based tool, which takes about 25 minutes to complete and is designed to be
      entertaining. You will be randomized into 1 of 2 groups: each group will play a version of
      the brain training game. You will not be told what group/game type you were randomized into.
      You will be given the tablet with the game on it to take home, and to practice this game 5
      times a week for 6 weeks.

      Visit 2. After the 6 weeks of at-home training, you will then come back to the research study
      unit to do a repeat of the initial visit (with physical and cognitive assessments). At this
      study visit, you will also be returning the iPad.

      Visit 3. You will then return 8 weeks after Visit 2, to do a repeat of the assessments.

      You will be compensated for each study visit (visit 1: $50, visit 2: $100, visit 3: $150).
