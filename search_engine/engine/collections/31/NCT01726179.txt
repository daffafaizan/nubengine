      proximal caries lesions in primary molars. It was hypothesized that infiltrated lesions (test
      lesions) will progress significantly less than non infiltrated lesions (control lesions).
      Additionally, it was hypothesized that dental anxiety and stress related to caries
      infiltration will be significantly less than dental anxiety related to a conventional
      restorative procedure. The study will be a controlled clinical trial with a split mouth
      design and blind evaluation of the outcome (caries progression). Caries progression will be
      evaluated annually, 12, 24, and 36 months after treatment.
