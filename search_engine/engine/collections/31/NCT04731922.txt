      tolerability, and PK of TAK-510 in healthy participants.

      The study will enroll up to approximately 160 healthy participants. Participants in each
      cohort will be randomized to receive treatment with TAK-510 or matching placebo which will
      remain undisclosed to the participant and study doctor during the study (unless there is an
      urgent medical need). The study consists of 3 parts and up to 20 cohorts as mentioned below.

        -  TAK-510, Part 1: SRD design to assess the safety, immunogenicity, tolerability, and PK
           of TAK-510

        -  TAK-510, Part 2: MRD design to assess the safety, immunogenicity, tolerability, and PK
           of TAK-510

        -  TAK-510, Part 3: Dose titration and redosing design to assess the safety,
           immunogenicity, tolerability, and PK of TAK-510

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall duration of the
      study is approximately 57 days. Participants will be followed up for 7 days after the last
      dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.
