    
      Patients with unexpected difficult airway requiring endotracheal intubation (ETI) remain
      extremely challenging for emergency physicians and intubation failure with subsequent hypoxic
      complications still represents the majority of cases in a recent closed claims analysis.

      An incidence of major complications in airway management of 1 in 5,500 was estimated in the
      Fourth National Audit Project in the UK.

      Therefore, our aim was to compare intubation conditions regarding the modified Cormack &
      Lehane score (CL) between the D-Blade® in indirect laryngoscopy or Macintosh blade in direct
      and indirect laryngoscopy with C-MAC PM® in a simulated setting of a difficult airway in
      human subjects.
