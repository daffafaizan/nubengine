      leading cause of cancer-related deaths. Nowadays, endoscopic resection（ER） is widely accepted
      as the primary treatment for early gastric cancer (EGC) without lymph node metastasis，which
      includes endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) and endoscopic submucosal dissection
      (ESD).However, recurrence rate after endoscopic resection for EGC still achieves 6.7%-14%.
      However, there is no comparative analysis about H. pylori infection rate before and after ER
      yet.
