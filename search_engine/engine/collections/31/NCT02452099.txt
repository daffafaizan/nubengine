      cryopreservation of HSCs. Addition of DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide) is necessary to secure the
      viability of such cells, but this cryoprotectant is potentially toxic to stem cell recipient.
      The concentrations of DMSO in cryopreservation mixture vary strongly between protocols in
      different transplant centers. Usually, the HSCs are stored in mixtures containing 10% DMSO,
      but there is no sufficient evidence that this concentration of DMSO is indeed optimal.

      The main aim of the study is to evaluate the clinical impact of reduction of DMSO
      concentration in cryopreservation mixture on engraftment after autologous hematopoietic stem
      cell transplantation. 150 consecutive patients will be randomly assigned to one of three
      study arms (50 patients each). HSCs obtained by leukapheresis will be cryopreserved in three
      concentrations of DMSO: 5%, 7.5%, 10%, respectively. Evaluation of the mixtures will be
      carried out by monitoring reconstitution of hematopoiesis and the frequency the side effects
      in patients. The most important aspect of our evaluation will be the speed of neutrophil
      recovery after transplantation (defined by the first day, when absolute neutrophil count in
      peripheral blood will be higher than 0.5 G/L). The investigators will also evaluate the
      toxicity of cell suspension by monitoring the frequency of infusion-related adverse events
      (like nausea or vomiting) during infusion and 24 hours after transplantation.
