      be recruited; there will be extensive microbial, viral and parasitic screening of the donors.
      Recipients will be randomized to receive capsules of stool from the donors, or cellulose
      placebo. Recipients will take cloxacillin 500 mg 4 times daily for 5 days before the FMT, and
      will undergo purging with an electrolyte solution, (PegLyte) the day before the FMT.
      Metagenomic analysis of the recipient stool will be performed before FMT, 6 weeks later and
      after 12 months.Plasma levels of toxic intestinal metabolites will be measured before FMT, at
      6 weeks and 12 months after FMT; the levels to be measured will be TMAO, P-cresylsulfate,
      Hippuric acid. Indoxyl sulfate, P-cresyl glucuronide. Phenyl acetyl glutamine, and Phenyl
      sulfate.

      The investigators will analyze the metagenomic changes in the intestinal microbiome of
      recipients that are associated with decline in the plasma levels of the metabolic products of
      the intestinal microbiome to identify candidate bacteria for an "ecosystem therapeutic for
      atherosclerosis. Based on previous experience of designing such a therapeutic for clostridium
      difficile, it is anticipated that ~ 40 bacterial species would be needed.
