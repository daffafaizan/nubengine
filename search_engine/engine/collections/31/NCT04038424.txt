      music. The participants will receive the program on three steps (early step, middle step, and
      late step). These steps aim to train the participants on the AT from simple to complex and
      motivate them to engage in the AT program.Therefore, this study aims to investigate the
      effect of art therapy on cognitive ability, arm activity and mental health status of patients
      with stroke.
