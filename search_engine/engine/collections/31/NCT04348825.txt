      response parameters, neuropsychological functioning as well as neurochemical and genetic
      biomarkers that can elucidate the underlying mechanisms. The aim is to document both
      treatment effects and potential harmful effects of ECT.

      Sample: n = 40 patients in a major depressive episode (bipolar and major depressive
      disorder). Two control groups with n = 15 in each group: age and gender matched healthy
      volunteers not receiving ECT and patients undergoing electrical cardioversion (ECV) for
      atrial fibrillation (AF). Observation time: six months.
