    
      Due to the introduction of drug-eluting stents (DESs) and to improvements in therapy for both
      percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) patients,
      PCI is challenging CABG as the gold standard for treatment of three vessel (3VD) and left
      main (LM) coronary disease.

      SYNTAX is a novel, randomized trial with nested registries comparing PCI with
      paclitaxel-eluting TAXUS stents to CABG for 3VD and LM patients to evaluate the best
      treatment for these patients with complex coronary disease.

      Patients at participating centers will be evaluated by both a cardiothoracic surgeon and by
      an interventional cardiologist.

      Those patients who are determined to be eligible for treatment by both PCI and CABG will be
      randomized to receive either PCI with a polymer-based paclitaxel-eluting TAXUS stent or CABG.

      Patients who are determined to be unsuitable for treatment by PCI will be treated by CABG and
      will be entered into a CABG registry to help define the patient population in which stenting
      continues to be an unacceptable treatment option.

      Similarly, patients who are determined to be unsuitable for treatment by CABG will be treated
      by PCI, using any interventional techniques or devices with or without the use of DES, and
      entered into a PCI registry to help define the patients for whom CABG is considered
      inappropriate.
