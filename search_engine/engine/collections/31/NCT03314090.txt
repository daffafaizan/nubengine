      previous study (Botulinum Toxin to Improve Results in Cleft Lip Repair; IRB No 101-3009C) who
      were treated using the current established protocol for scar care following cheiloplasty 2.
      This involved microporous tape placed across both cheeks and spanning the upper lip during
      daytime, and silicone sheets fixed with a shorter length of microporous tape (that did not
      span the cheeks) at night. This continued strictly for 6 months.

      The Study group consisted of another 33 consecutive age-matched patients with unilateral
      cleft lip, whose postoperative scar care was exactly the same except the silicone sheet was
      replaced with silicone gel (Dermatix Ultra, Menarini, Singapore), which was applied twice per
      day. The parents (or caregivers) were instructed to apply silicone gel (the amount being
      similar in size to a grain of rice) along the upper lip scar from the nostril base to the
      vermillion, avoiding the wet mucosa.

      Inclusion criteria were: 1. Baby born with cleft lip planned for primary lip repair around 3
      months of age, . Written informed consent for the study provided by the parent/guardian.
      Exclusion criteria were: 1. presence of other craniofacial anomalies; 2. lack of signed
      informed consent from the parent/guardian.
