      for treatment of anaemia, reduction of intraoperative blood loss and increasing anaemic
      tolerance.

      In the Kepler University Hospital (former General Hospital Linz) PBM was introduced in 2006.
      Since then patients for elective orthopedic surgery (knee an hip replacement) are screened
      for iron deficiency anaemia and if needed treated with the more effective intravenous iron.

      Oral iron medications are not as efficient (low bioavailability, more side effects) as the
      intravenous iron infusion. Although there is risk of anaphylactoid reactions.

      In this study the new oral iron supplement OLEOvital Eisen forte (available in Austria) ist
      tested on its effectivity for treatment of iron deficiency in the course of PBM.

      It has a much more higher bioavailability without the typically side effects of the routinely
      used oral iron medications.

      Within this study the investigators want to examine the feasibility of this iron substitution
      concept OLEOvital and its efficacy. Also the investigators want to get pilot data for a
      further randomized controlled trial.

      The increase of the hemoglobin level in 4 weeks of minimum 1g/dl is going to be expected and
      monitored.

      For comparison of the new oral substitution concept OLEOvital with the standard intravenous
      iron substitution an historic control group is going to be used.
