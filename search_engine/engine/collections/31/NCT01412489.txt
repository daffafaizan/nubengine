    
      Hysteroscopic myomectomy is the referent surgical treatment for submucous myoma. But
      intrauterine adhesion rate was evaluated about 7 to 15% after this procedure. The
      investigators hypothetically believe that application of HYALOBARRIER Gel at the end of the
      procedure, could be reduce the mean intrauterine rate to 50%. Thus, the investigators
      performed a multicenter (n = 20) prospective study non randomized in 220 patients with
      submucous myoma < 3 cm of diameter, evaluated by preoperative ultrasound. The investigators
      prefer this study design, because the principal reason is the number of enrolled patient were
      more 200 patients in each group with a double blind randomized study. Now, in all patients,
      after hysteroscopic myomectomy which performed with a same technique in each center (bipolar
      coagulation and physiologic serum), a diagnostic hysteroscopy was performed at 2 month to
      determinate the existence of intrauterine adhesion. Secondary end points were in this study
      the tolerance and side effects of HYALOBARRIER Gel and the subsequent fertility at 2 years.
