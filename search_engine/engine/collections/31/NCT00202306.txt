      subjects at ultra-high risk of developing a psychotic disorder. This aim will be achieved by
      treating a high-risk patient population with low-dose lithium (450mg/day) and investigating
      its effects using clinical, neuropsychological, neuroimaging and cell biological approaches.
      We will recruit 30 patients considered to be at ultra-high risk of developing a first
      psychotic episode, currently receiving treatment at the Personal Assessment and Crisis
      Evaluation (PACE) clinic in Melbourne, Australia. PACE criteria for identifying patients at
      high risk include subjects with a family history of psychosis and a decrease in functioning
      (30% GAF) AND/OR attenuated psychotic symptoms AND/OR brief psychotic symptoms (BLIPS)
      resolving without treatment. Patients who give informed consent will receive treatment with a
      slow release form of low dose lithium for a period of a year, plus supportive therapy.
      Patients who do not consent will receive supportive therapy only. Assessments will be
      conducted at baseline, twelve weeks and one year post-recruitment. Assessments will include
      cognitive functioning, structural MRI, 1H-MRS at 3Tesla and cell biological parameters
      (bcl-2, AP-1; NIMH, Washington DC). In addition, all patients will be seen on a monthly basis
      for a clinical interview, covering psychopathology, global functioning, and quality of life.
