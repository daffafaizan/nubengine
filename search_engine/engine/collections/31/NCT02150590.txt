    
      Patients with moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease living below 800 m
      will be invited to participate in a randomized, cross-over field trial evaluating the
      hypothesis that nocturnal breathing and sleep during nights spent at moderate altitude are
      improved by oxygen therapy via a nasal cannula compared to room air (sham oxygen). Outcomes
      will be assessed at low altitude (Zurich, 490 m, baseline), and during 2 study periods of 2
      nights each spent at moderate altitude (St. Moritz Salastrains, 2048 m) separated by a
      wash-out period of at least 2 weeks spent at low altitude (<800 m).
