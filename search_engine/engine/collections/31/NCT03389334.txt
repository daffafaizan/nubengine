      for lower limb amputees suffering from lower back pain or the effects this has on muscle
      performance and/or range of motion. In addressing the physical, psychological, and social
      needs of a person living with limb loss, there should be a consideration for a
      multidisciplinary approach that could potentially include massage therapy as a fundamental
      standard of care. Therefore, the purpose of this graduate student research study is to test
      whether myofascial release massage can improve lower back pain levels in lower limb amputees
      and consequently improve quality of life and other measurable variables such as range of
      motion and muscle strength.
