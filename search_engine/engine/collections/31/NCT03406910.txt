      anthropometric and dietary data at baseline. Meat and egg intake will be assessed with a
      validated quantitative food frequency intake questionnaire. The relationship between meat and
      egg intake and the incidence of Type 2 Diabetes will be determined using
      multivariate-adjusted logistic regression.
