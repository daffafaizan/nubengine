      I. To evaluate the safety of adding oral soy isoflavone to concurrent chemotherapy and
      radiotherapy for the treatment of patients with unresectable stage III non-small cell lung
      cancer (NSCLC).

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups.

      GROUP I (SQUAMOUS CELL HISTOLOGY): Patients receive etoposide intravenously (IV) over 1 hour
      on days 1-5 and 29-33, cisplatin IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, 29, and 36, and undergo
      radiation therapy (RT) 5 days a week for 6.6 weeks. Within 48 hours of initiating treatment,
      patients receive soy isoflavones orally (PO) daily on days 1-90.

      GROUP II (NON-SQUAMOUS CELL HISTOLOGY): Patients receive pemetrexed disodium IV over 10
      minutes on days 1, 22, and 43 and cisplatin IV over 1 hour on days 1, 22, and 43. Patients
      also undergo RT and receive soy isoflavones as in Group I.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4 weeks and then every 4
      months for 1 year, every 6 months for 1 year, and then yearly thereafter.
