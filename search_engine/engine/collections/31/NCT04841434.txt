    
      MTX is used either alone or as part of a combined chemotherapy protocol either in standard or
      high doses in the treatment of a range of cancers and other diseases.

      Dose escalation will be performed using three dose levels of MTX:

      Level 1: 3.0 g/m2 Level 2: 3.5 g/m2 Level 3: 4.0 g/m2 Up to 6 patients will be treated at
      each dose level; each will receive a maximum of 6 cycles of treatment. The dose may be
      increased in Cycle 3 in individual patients to the next level, if renal function is adequate
      (GFR â‰¥ 40 mL/min, or in the case of decreased GFR, the decrease is <10% compared with the
      pre-treatment value), and absence of grade 3 or 4 non-hematological toxicities.
