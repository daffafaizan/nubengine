    
      This is a single-blinded randomized controlled trial performed at the Department of
      Obstetrics and Gynecology of Medical University of Warsaw. The study will involve 518
      patients undergoing caesarean section who after giving their informed consent will be
      randomly divided into two groups: study (n=259) and control group (n=259). The study group
      will receive DACC impregnated dressing - Sorbact Surgical Dressing Â® (ABIGO Medical AB,
      Sweden) and the control group will receive standard surgical dressing.

      In all participants transverse skin incision and low transverse uterine incision will be
      performed during caesarean section procedure.

      All participants will receive prophylactic dose of antibiotics prior to the start of surgery
      (1g cefazolin intravenously 0-30 minutes before surgery) and wound irrigation with octenidine
      prior to the subcutaneous tissue closure.

      For fascial incision, subcutaneous tissue and skin incision closure continuous antibacterial
      braided absorbable suture, single monofilament absorbable suture and subcuticular continuous
      monofilament non-absorbable suture will be used, respectively.

      Dressing will be left in place for the first 48 hours post caesarean section unless clinical
      reason exists to replace it. After the first 48 hours postoperatively all of the dressings
      will be removed and first wound evaluation will be performed. On post-operative day 3
      patients will be discharged and indicated to revisit on post-operative day 7 to remove the
      skin suture. During this follow-up visit second wound review will be performed for any signs
      of infection. Third, and final wound assessment will take place on post-operative day 14.

      To analyze overall treatment costs patients with SSI will be followed up until the end of
      treatment, up to 8 weeks post surgery.
