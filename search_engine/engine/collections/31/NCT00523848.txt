      Primary

        -  To determine the overall response rate (complete response and partial response) in
           patients previously untreated stage I, II, or III multiple myeloma.

      Secondary

        -  To evaluate the complete response rate in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  To determine the time to disease progression from the start of this therapy in patients
           treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive low-dose oral thalidomide once a day on days 1-28, bortezomib IV on
      days 1, 4, 15, and 18, and doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome IV over 60-90 minutes on days 1
      and 15. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with residual disease who continue to show response after
      completion of 6 courses may receive 2 additional courses for a total of 8 courses.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months.
