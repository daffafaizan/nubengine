      The aim is to evaluate the effects of a tDCS stimulation and exercise vs sham tDCS and
      exercise on pain control in chronic (lasting more than 3 months from the intervention)
      painful total knee arthroplasty (TKA) patients.

      The participants will be randomized in two groups: intervention group (IG) and control group
      (CG).

      The IG will receive a 20 minute program of active tDCS (2mA intensity, anode placed on
      primary motor cortex controlateral to the TKA, cathode placed on controlateral supraorbital
      region) followed by a 30 minute exercise program, 5 days a week, for 2 consecutive weeks.

      The CG will receive a 20 minute program of sham tDCS (15 seconds of activation and then no
      stimulation, same position of IG) followed by the same 30 minute exercise program, 5 days a
      week, for 2 consecutive weeks.

      The participants will be evaluated at T0 (enrolling), T1 (at the end of the program), T2 (at
      1 month from the end of the program) and T3 (at 3 months from the end of the program).

      The primary outcome is the variation of pain intensity, the secondary outcomes are the
      variation of knee function and of the quality of life.
