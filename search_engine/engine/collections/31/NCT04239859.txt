    
      First, the investigators hypothesize that a proportion of participants with moderate to
      severe PsO may sustain good outcomes when a short course of secukinumab is withdrawn.

      Second, the investigators hypothesize that they can identify the perturbations in the
      architecture of the immunome which are pathogenic, and to discriminate such perturbations
      based on treatment and clinical responses, thus distilling therapeutics and diagnostics
      signatures.

      Therefore, the objectives of this study are as follow:

      Specific aim 1: To describe the clinical course, sustained good outcomes, relapse rate, time
      to relapse and quality of life in PsO participants who stopped a 6-month short course
      treatment of secukinumab, till the end of 2-years.

      Specific aim 2: To identify the genomic and immunomics signatures in skin biopsies and blood
      in PsO participants who has good outcomes (PASI 75) at 6 months, comparing treatment vs
      pragmatic control.

      Specific aim 3: To identify the genomic and immunomics signatures in skin biopsies and blood
      in PsO participants who sustained good outcomes at 1 year after stopping secukinumab,
      compared to those relapsed.
