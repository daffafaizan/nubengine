      I. To assess the efficacy of combined systemic and tumor directed therapy for recurrent
      oligometastatic M1a,b prostate cancer patients with 1-5 metastases (exclusive of pelvic nodal
      N1 metastases) staged by prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positron emission
      tomography (PET)-computed tomography (CT).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Time to biochemical progression. II. Time to additional antineoplastic therapy. III.
      Prostate cancer specific survival. IV. Safety and tolerability. V. Assessment of health
      related quality of life using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Prostate (FACT-P)
      scale.

      CORRELATIVE OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine genomic and transcriptomic features present in metastatic tumors in patients
      that respond to this multimodal therapy.

      II. To evaluate biomarkers of response using circulating tumor cells (CTCs). III. To evaluate
      biomarkers of response using circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (ctDNA).

      IV. To evaluate immunophenotypes of circulating immune cells.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive a single dose of leuprolide subcutaneously (SC) on day 1 and apalutamide
      orally (PO) once daily (QD) and abiraterone acetate PO QD for up to 6 months in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning 2 months of initiation of
      antiandrogen therapy (ADT), patients also receive SBRT over 1, 3, or 5 fractions in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up within 2 -4 weeks, every 30
      days for 6 months, and then every 3 months thereafter.
