      their blood sugars within days of their surgery, even before they have lost much weight. It
      typically takes much longer for these improvements to occur after adjustable gastric banding
      (AGB), despite an equally low caloric intake. Changes in levels of hormones released by the
      small intestine as a consequence of the particular type of surgery may be an important factor
      in the rapid improvement of blood sugars. One of these hormones, glucagon-like peptide-1
      (GLP-1), has an important effect on insulin secretion from the pancreas. This study seeks to
      determine whether changes in GLP-1 are responsible for the improvement in blood sugar after
      certain types of weight loss surgeries. In order to meet inclusion criteria, participants
      must have type 2 diabetes for less than 10 years and be approved by insurance to undergo RYGB
      or AGB at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania or Penn Presbyterian Medical Center.
      We will obtain several measurements of GLP-1 and other hormones that affect glucose levels
      during the three study visits: 1) Visit 1 (2-3 weeks before surgery); 2) Visit 2 (after 10%
      of body weight is lost); and 3) Visit 3 (5-10 days after Visit 2). To see if the improvement
      in blood sugar after surgery is due to changes in GLP-1, we will block its effect on insulin
      release by giving either salt water or a medication that blocks the activity of GLP-1 during
      the two visits that take place after surgery (Visits 2 and 3). Each visit will last for 4-6
      hours and participants will be compensated for their time.
