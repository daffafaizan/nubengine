    
      Kaposiform hemangioendothelioma (KHE) is a rare aggressive vascular neoplasm that occurs
      predominantly in infancy or early childhood, with an incidence of approximately 0.71/100,000.
      Currently, sirolimus is a promising treatment modality for KHE. Most scholars consider
      sirolimus blood concentration of 5-15 ng/ml to be an effective therapeutic concentration.

      However, long-term higher dose sirolimus treatment can cause some common complications such
      as oral mucositis which affects the quality of life of the patient. Finer control of the
      plasma concentration of sirolimus may contribute to the efficacy of treatment and reduce the
      incidence of complications. Therefore, we conducted this study to find out whether an early
      reduction in sirolimus dose would benefit the prognosis of the patients.
