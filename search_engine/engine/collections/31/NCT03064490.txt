      as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes every 3 weeks). The first dose of pembrolizumab
      will be administered approximately 14 days prior to initiating radiotherapy. The second dose
      will be administered three weeks later (week 1 of chemoradiation). The third dose will be
      administered 3 weeks later (week 4 of chemoradiotherapy). Pembrolizumab will be given every 3
      weeks and may be given at the same time as systemic therapy. All patients will receive
      radiation treatment (45Gy in 25 fractions at 1.8 Gy/fraction) using image-guided radiation
      therapy with concurrent, weekly carboplatin (AUC 2) and paclitaxel (50mg/m2 of BSA).
      Restaging will be performed per standard of care approximately 4-8 weeks after completing
      chemoradiotherapy. Resection will be performed approximately 6-12 weeks after completing
      chemoradiotherapy per standard of care. Postoperatively, three additional cycles of
      pembrolizumab (200 mg every 3 weeks) will be administered as adjuvant therapy.
