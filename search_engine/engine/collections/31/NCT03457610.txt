      intervention (speech therapy) is one of the few methods which seem to be useful in management
      of persistent chronic cough. This method has not been available for patients with cough in
      Poland so far.

      The aim of the study is to implement speech therapy to the management plan of patients with
      difficult-to-treat chronic cough and to analyze its efficacy in this particular group.

      Patients, who are diagnosed and unsuccessfully managed because of difficult-to treat chronic
      cough, will be offered speech and language intervention as an added therapy. It is based on
      the technique described by Vertigan et al.The entire therapy will consist of eight sessions
      once a week.

      Cough severity, its influence on quality of life and cough challenge test with capsaicin will
      be assessed by Visual Analogue Scale, Leicester Cough Questionnaire and cough challenge test
      with capsaicin will be performed before and after speech therapy in every patient to analyze
      its effectiveness
