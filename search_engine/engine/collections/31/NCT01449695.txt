      disease. As a consequence the risk of premature death, hospital admissions and related costs
      is increasing. Therefore, detection of apparent poor adherence and interventions to improve
      adherence, are of great importance to enhance cardiovascular risk management over time.

      This study is a prospective randomized trial, which compares 1) usual care with 2) the effect
      of a personalized visualization of cardiovascular risk levels (website) to support self
      management and 3) the additional effect of a communication intervention by a nurse on
      adherence on top of 2). Adherence is determined and continuously monitored with a dedicated
      calculation of refill data obtained from patient's pharmacy.
