      pulmonary disease, asthma and pulmonary fibrosis. Results from HBPR have been similar to
      those observe in the outpatient pulmonary rehabilitation such improvement in exercise
      capacity, symptoms and quality of life. However, HBPR has not yet been investigated in
      patients with bronchiectasis, a progressive and debilitating disease with a high
      socioeconomic impact. Objective: To investigate the short-and long-term effects of the home
      rehabilitation program in peripheral muscle strength, functional capacity and quality of life
      in patients with bronchiectasis. Methods: Patients diagnosed with bronchiectasis will be
      recruited from the Obstructive Diseases Outpatient Clinic of the Hospital das Clínicas -
      Medicine School, University of São Paulo. Participants will be randomized into two groups:
      control group (usual care and recommendations for performing exercises and respiratory
      physiotherapy) and training group, that will perform aerobic (stepping training) and
      resistance training (lower and upper limbs) for eight weeks, three times a week. All patients
      will receive a phone call once a week and patients allocated to the training group,
      additionally, will get a home visit every 15 days. At baseline, immediately after finishing
      and after six months of the HBPR patients will undergo to assessments. Expected results: HBPR
      will have positive effects on exercise tolerance and quality of life. Also, this study will
      contribute to future guidelines on the recommendation of HBPR for patients with
      bronchiectasis.
