      Primary

      - Compare the 5-year survival rate in patients with resectable local recurrent rectal cancer
      treated with either surgical resection or neoadjuvant.

      Secondary

        -  Compare the side effect of chemo radiotherapy according to the Common Toxicity
           Criteria(CTC) version 2.0 in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the postoperative complications in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the recurrent rate in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the distant metastatic rate in patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter clinical trial. Patients are stratified according
      to participating center, gender, age. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive surgical resection and undergo FOLFIRI for 12 cycles, from 2-4
           weeks after operation. Patients undergo radiotherapy once daily 5 days a week for 5-6
           weeks, from 8-12 weeks after operation.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (mFOLFIRI for 5 cycles and
           undergo radiotherapy as in arm I from the second cycle of FOLFIRI), surgery and FOLFORI
           for 7 cycles from 2-4 weeks after operation.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, and
      then every 6 months for at least 3 years.

      The side effect of chemo radiotherapy, postoperative complications, recurrent rate, distant
      metastatic rate and 5-year survival rate will be investigated.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 360 patients will be accrued for this study within 5 year.
