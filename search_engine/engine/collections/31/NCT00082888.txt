      I. To assess tumor response to R115777 (tipifarnib) in patients with relapsed aggressive
      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. (Permanently closed to accrual 6/28/06) II. To assess tumor response
      to R115777 in patients with relapsed indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. (Permanently closed to
      accrual 9/26/07) III. To assess tumor response to R115777 in patients with uncommon
      non-Hodgkin's lymphomas.

      IV. To evaluate toxicity associated with this regimen in patients with relapsed non-Hodgkin's
      lymphoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate known and unknown molecular markers that may predict for response to R115777
      in lymphoma tissue.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive tipifarnib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-21. Courses repeat every
      28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for 2 years.
