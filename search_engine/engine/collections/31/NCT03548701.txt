      Mount Sinai Hospital will be performed. Blood samples are being collected at time of study
      entry. Patient health history will be collected and blood samples will be tested using
      thromboelastometry in prospective fashion. Samples will be compared between groups.

      A prospective cohort will then be established using the subjects from the case control study.
      The purpose of this prospective cohort will be to collect outcomes of pregnancies to
      determine association with the initial thromboelastometry results.
