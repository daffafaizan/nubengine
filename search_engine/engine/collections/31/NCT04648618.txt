      patients with macular edema with and without OSA.

      This will be a single centre, prospective, cross-sectional study. We will be recruiting
      patients undergoing intravitreal injection for diabetic macular edema divided into 2 groups:

        -  Group 1: diabetic patients with macular edema, no OSA

        -  Group 2: diabetic patients with macular edema, and OSA

      All patients will undergo baseline ophthalmologic examination as part of a regular clinic
      visit including best-corrected visual acuity, intraocular pressure, slit lamp exam, dilated
      retinal exam, fluorescein angiography and optical coherence tomography (OCT). Diagnosis of
      diabetic macular edema will be confirmed with standard domain OCT. Diagnosis of OSA will be
      confirmed through gold standard of overnight polysomnography.

      Data including demographics, ocular history, best corrected visual acuity, IOP, blood sugar
      control and sleep metrics will be collected. Serum and aqueous fluid samples will be
      collected at time of first intravitreal injection including VEGF, Placental growth factor,
      TGFB, ICAM-1,IL-2, IL-3, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10,IL-17, VCAM-1, MCP-1, Epidermal growth factor,
      Pigment epithelial derived factor (PEDF), Angiotensin 2 and Platelet derived growth factor
      (PDGF).

      Primary outcome:

      Levels of cytokine in serum and aqueous humour

      Secondary outcome:

      Best-corrected visual acuity

      Data analysis:

      Level of cytokines in serum and aqueous humor in patients with and without OSA will be
      compared using T test. Statistical significance is defined as p < 0.05.
