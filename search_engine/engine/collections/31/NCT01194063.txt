      containing primarily omega-3 fatty acids. Animal studies have shown that IV fat emulsions
      such as fish oil that are high in eicosapentaenic and docosahexaenoic acids reduce impairment
      of bile flow as seen in cholestasis caused by conventional fat emulsions. It is thought that
      by administering Omegaven™ in place of conventional phytosterol/soybean fat emulsions,
      cholestasis may be prevented or reversed, and patients will be able to be maintained on
      adequate PN for growth until they are able to ingest adequate nutrition enterally. Ongoing
      studies are addressing safety and efficacy of Omegaven™ in the pediatric population. In this
      trial, infants and children with parenteral nutrition associated liver disease will receive
      Omegaven™ as compassionate use to potentially prevent progression of disease. Safety and
      efficacy are monitored.
