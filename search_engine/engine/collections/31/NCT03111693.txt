    
      In this prospective single-center study, obese patients of our clinical nutrition service,
      hospitalized for nutritional assessement, are included.

      All unenhanced coroCT examinations are performed on the same 64-Row CT scanner (discovery CT
      750 HD scanner, GE Healthcare), using prospective ECG-triggerring. The investigation protocol
      began with a standard-dose acquisition followed immediately by a low-dose acquisition,
      recorded over strictly identical segments (identical first and last sections).

      After these two examinations, estimated dose values are less than the diagnostic scan
      reference level for a coroCT.
