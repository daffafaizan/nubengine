      I. To examine the prognostic role of histopathological variables, in particular cellular
      density, mitotic count, and tumor cell invasion in intracranial pediatric ependymomas.

      II. To study whether hTERT expression and telomere dysfunction correlate with
      progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in pediatric intracranial
      ependymoma.

      III. To perform a genome-wide copy number screen and validation of copy number abnormalities
      (CNAs) on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) ependymomas using Affymetrix Molecular
      Inversion Probe (MIP) arrays and interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (iFISH). IV.
      To evaluate associations between infiltration of immune markers and PFS as well as OS in
      pediatric ependymoma.

      V. To examine the role of 1q gain and 9p deletion in pediatric ependymomas by exploring their
      association with PFS and OS in a multivariable model.

      VI. To establish the frequency and clinicopathological associations of mutations in genes
      involved in Notch pathway signaling.

      OUTLINE:

      Archived tumor tissue samples are analyzed for cellular density, mitotic count, tumor cell
      invasion, hTERT expression, telomere dysfunction, 1q gain, 9p deletion, and genetic mutations
      by IHC, Affymetrix Molecular Inversion Probe (MIP) arrays, and fluorescence in situ
      hybridization (FISH). Results are then correlated with patient-outcome variables and known
      risk factors, namely gender, age at diagnosis, tumor location infratentorial vs.
      supratentorial), tumor grade (differentiated vs anaplastic), and extent of surgery as well as
      pathologic variables.
