      young healthy individuals. The results of our study will show the effects of face masks
      commonly used during the pandemic period.

      The hypotheses we will test for this purpose; H1: face masks affect cardiopulmory capacity in
      healthy individuals H2: face masks affect heart rate in health individuals H3: face masks
      affect oxygen saturation in healthy individuals H4: face masks affect respiratory frequency
      in healthy individuals
