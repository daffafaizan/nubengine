      external-beam radiotherapy for prostate cancer will start using tadalafil 20 mg or placebo
      the first day of radiation. The blinded medication (active drug or placebo) has to be taken
      once every two days starting the day of the first radiation up to 12 months (52 weeks) after
      radiotherapy. The active drug or placebo may be taken at bedtime unrelated to sexual
      activity. In case of side effects the dose can be reduced to 10 mg. Erectile function will be
      assessed every 3 months up to 6 weeks (week 58) after discontinuation of drug treatment by
      using questions 3 and 4 of the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF). Responders
      (maintained erectile function) are defined as having a combined score of >=8 for the IIEF
      questions 3 and 4.
