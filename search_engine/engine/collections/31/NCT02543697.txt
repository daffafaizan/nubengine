      they are unknown of. Some percentage of this patients produce a little to much cortisol, but
      not enough to give overt Cushings syndrome. It is shown that slightly elevated cortisol
      production will give higher blood pressure, higher blood sugar and maybe higher BMI. For
      another hormone produced in the adrenal glands , aldosterone, we know that even if you have
      an adrenal tumor on one adrenal, you could have bilateral overproduction of the hormone.In
      that situations it is no need of an operation of the adrenal with the tumor. When the
      overproduction is unilateral it is of great value to the patient to operate the adrenal
      gland, and the symptoms from the hormone excess will disappear. For aldosterone Adrenal
      venous sampling (AVS) has been used for several years to try to determine if the hormone
      overproduction is one-sided or to sided. We are in this study using the same principle for
      cortisol overproduction.
