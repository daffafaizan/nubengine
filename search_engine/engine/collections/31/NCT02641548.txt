      hard-to-heal ulcers that eventually can make amputation of the foot necessary.

      Patients are advised to use heel creams to heal fissures and prevent them from developing
      into ulcers. Clinical observations have suggested that wearing a silicone sock nighttime can
      heal fissures, but the additional advantage of using a silicone sock compared to use a heel
      cream only has not been investigated.

      Participants will be randomized to an intervention group (silicone sock and heel cream) or a
      control group (heel cream only) and the healing of fissures and development of new ulcers
      will be compared between the groups.
