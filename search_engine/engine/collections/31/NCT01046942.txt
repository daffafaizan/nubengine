    
      Graft patency after CABG is reported to 80-90% worldwide 1 year following surgery. In the
      immediate period after surgery, and the following month, graft occlusion mainly occurs due to
      thrombosis.

      Patients with platelet hyperreactivity have increased risk of thromboembolic events,
      including graft occlusion, myocardial infarction and stroke. Therefore intensifying the
      antiplatelet therapy in these patients, must be anticipated to have beneficial effects.

      Hypercoagulable patients are identified with thrombelastography(TEG) as having a Maximal
      Amplitude(MA)>69, thereafter randomized to either clopidogrel(3months) and aspirin or aspirin
      alone. At 3 months postoperative after surgery the coronary graft patency is assessed with
      Multislice CT scan.

      Pre- and postoperatively, and then again at 3month followup, TEG and multiplate aggregometry
      are performed to assess platelet reactivity and resistance to aspirin and clopidogrel.
