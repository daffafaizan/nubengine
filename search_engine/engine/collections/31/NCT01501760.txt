      addressed for corneal pathologies including corneal newvessels. The patients will be randomly
      assigned to two groups, one receiving three subconjunctival injections of bevacizumab, the
      other three subconjunctival injections of placebo (Balanced salt solution). The progression
      of newvessels will be assessed using color photographs and a picture-analyser software that
      will calculate the percentage of corneal surface occupied by the newvessels. Randomization,
      and preparation of both study drug and placebo syringes will be performed by the central
      pharmacy of the CHU de Limoges. Patients will be followed-up as outpatients, with visits
      scheduled 15 days before treatment, at baseline, and then at 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, and
      6 months.

        -  Primary outcome: To demonstrate Bevacizumab subconjunctival injections effectiveness on
           corneal neovascularisation reduction definite by a superior percentage of patient with a
           reduction higher than 30 % of the corneal surface occupied by newvessels , at 3 months,
           in the group Bevacizumab compared with the group placebo

        -  Secondary outcomes:

        -  The effectiveness of bevacizumab on reducing the percentage of corneal surface occupied
           by neovascularization at 6 months

        -  The effectiveness of bevacizumab on reducing the use of corneal graft.

        -  The local and general toxicity of bevacizumab administered by subconjunctival way.
