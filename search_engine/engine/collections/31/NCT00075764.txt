        -  Compare the time to tumor progression in postmenopausal women with metastatic breast
           cancer treated with anastrozole with or without fulvestrant as first-line therapy.

        -  Compare the clinical benefit (complete or partial response, confirmed or unconfirmed, or
           stable disease â‰¥ 24 weeks) and overall survival of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare adverse events in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Determine the prognostic significance of estrogen receptor positivity and HER2/neu
           status in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Determine parameters of estrogen and clinical pharmacology and estrogen levels in
           patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare anastrozole plasma levels at 8, 16, and 24 weeks in patients treated with these
           regimens (closed as of 4/16/2009).

        -  Compare estradiol serum levels at 8, 16, and 24 weeks in patients treated with these
           regimens (closed as of 4/16/2009).

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to prior
      adjuvant tamoxifen therapy (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral anastrozole once daily on days 1-28.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral anastrozole as in arm I. Patients also receive fulvestrant
           intramuscularly on days 1, 14, and 28 during course 1 and then on day 28 of the
           subsequent courses.

      In both arms, courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed for up to 4 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 690 patients (345 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 3 years.
