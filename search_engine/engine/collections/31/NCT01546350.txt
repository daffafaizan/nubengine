      produce 3 or less blastocysts on day 5. The Primary efficacy endpoint of comparing the study
      group with the control will be (I) implantation rates and (II) multiple pregnancies (twin or
      higher order) comparing the first transfer.

      The study may be extended to evaluate secondary efficacy endpoints which will be miscarriage
      rate and take home baby rates comparing the two groups.
