      Studies have shown that hyperoxia alters healthy volunteers' microcirculation, whereas
      hyperbaric oxygen therapy is commonly used to facilitate cicatrization. There seems to be a
      paradox. A recent study in rabbits has given some evidences that hyperbaria may restore
      microcirculation integrity, but to date, there is no such evidences in human.

      To study hyperoxia and hyperbaric induced changes in micro and macrocirculation, fifteen
      healthy volunteers will be exposed to successive variations of inspired oxygen fraction and
      barometric pressure according to a predefine sequence so that only one parameter will change
      from a condition to the next one :

        1. FiO2 0.21 - 1 ATA

        2. FiO2 1 - 1 ATA

        3. FiO2 1 - 2.5 ATA

        4. FiO2 0.21 - 2.5 ATA

        5. FiO2 0.21 - 1 ATA

      At each time, and after a 30 minutes period of exposure, measures will be made using
      SDF-microscopy, Laser Doppler and NIRS to assess microcirculation.

      As previously described, macrocirculation can modify microcirculation due to a mechanism
      called hemodynamic coherence.

      Hence, the investigators planned to assess macrocirculation changes at every step of the
      protocol using bioimpedancemetry and transthoracic echocardiography.

      Each volunteer will be his own control, using the first measurements (condition 1. FiO2 0.21
      - 1 ATA) as reference.
