      before breast surgery.

      The required number of patients has been calculated following Simon's method. 43 patients
      will be enrolled in two phases: first, 29 patients must be enrolled, and at least 2
      pathological complete responses obtained. Patients recruitment will continue until 43
      patients have been enrolled. Assumptions are that there is a 95% probability to obtain a rate
      of pathological complete responses of at least 10%.
