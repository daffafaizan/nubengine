    
      Primary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of Aprotinin as add-on therapy in
      patients hospitalized with COVID-19 using the following parameters:

        -  The time to elimination of SARS-CoV-2 virus until Day 10;

        -  The time to C-reactive protein (CRP) normalization until Day 10;

        -  The time to D-dimer normalization until Day 10.

      Secondary objectives are to evaluate the following parameters of efficacy and safety of
      Aprotinin add-on therapy in patients hospitalized with COVID-19:

        -  The time to body temperature normalization (<37oC);

        -  Changes from baseline of the laboratory parameters during 14 days: hematology, CRP,
           coagulogram;

        -  Changes of lung injury on CT scan on Day 7 and Day 14 from baseline;

        -  Frequency of clinical status improvement by 2 scores in accordance with the WHO Ordinal
           scale of clinical improvement (WHO-OSCI) or discharge from the hospital before Day 14;

        -  Frequency of transfer to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), frequency of the non-invasive
           ventilation, frequency of the invasive ventilation and mortality rate;

        -  Frequency of Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) of various severity
           according to subjective complains, physical examination, vital signs, laboratory tests
           and ECG.
