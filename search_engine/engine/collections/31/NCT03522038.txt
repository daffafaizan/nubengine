      devices and refinement of operator techniques, PCI of CTO can currently be performed with
      high success and low complication rates at experienced centers, the clinical benefit of
      recanalization of CTO is still a matter of debate. Accumulating evidence suggests that the
      improvement of left ventricular functional and prognosis is closely related with the area of
      viable myocardium, which has the potential for contractile recovery after revascularization.
      For the majority of interventional cardiologists, coronary angiography is the only invasive
      test deemed necessary for clinical decision-making, despite its weak ability to predict the
      functional impact of vascular occlusion on the subtended myocardium. To overcome this
      limitation, adjunctive diagnostic tools for functional evaluation, such as FFR, CFR, IMR and
      D-SPECT, have been introduced. In non-CTO patients, physiology-guided revascularization
      strategy has been definitely proven to be better than angiography-guided strategy in pivotal
      landmark studies. However, the clinical value of these functional parameters for the PCI of
      CTO is still unknown.

      The aim of this study was to determine whether functional evaluation is a better predictor of
      clinical outcome in patients with CTO undergoing PCI.
