      this cancer. So far, pharmaceutical chemoprevention has not gained widespread acceptance due
      to side effects of the chemopreventive agents used. Nutraceuticals such as polyphenols from
      tea plants have demonstrated remarkable therapeutic and preventive effects in molecular,
      epidemiological and clinical trials. However, controlled trials demonstrating the efficacy of
      nutraceuticals fo the prevention of colorectal cancer are largely missing.

      The investigators present this randomized, placebo controlled, multicentric trial to
      investigate the effect of diet supplementation with green tea extract containing 300mg
      epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), the major polyphenol of green tea, on the recurrence of
      colon adenomas.

      Patients who underwent polypectomy for colonic polyps will be randomized after a one month
      verum run-in period to receive either 150mg EGCG two times daily or placebo over the course
      of three years. The beneficial safety profile of decaffeinated green tea extract, the
      quantifiable and known active content EGCG, and the accumulating evidence on its cancer
      preventive potential require in our view a validation of this compound for the
      "nutriprevention" of colorectal adenoma. Good accessibility and low costs might render this
      nutraceutical a top candidate for a wider use as food supplement in colon cancer prevention.
