    
      International, multicentre, pragmatic, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial.

      Routine antibiotics for the intravenous and oral prophylaxis of colorectal surgery will be
      used.

      Experimental group: Patients undergoing elective colonic surgery that involves colonic
      resection.

      The antibiotic prophylaxis in this group will be composed of:

      An oral antibiotic pattern of ciprofloxacin (750mg / 12h, 2 doses) and metronidazole (250mg /
      8h, 3 doses) the day before surgery, plus mechanical bowel preparation with Sodium
      picosulfate, light magnesium oxide, and anhydrous citric acid (10 mg - 3.5 g - 10.97 g per
      dose/ 2 doses the day before surgery) + An intravenous antibiotics pattern of cefuroxime 1,5
      g and metronidazole 1 g at anesthetic induction.

      Control group: Patients undergoing elective colonic surgery that involves colonic resection.

      The antibiotic prophylaxis in this group will be composed of:

      An oral antibiotic pattern of ciprofloxacin (750mg / 12h, 2 doses) and metronidazole (250mg /
      8h, 3 doses)

      + An intravenous antibiotic pattern of cefuroxime 1,5 g and metronidazole 1 gr at anesthetic
      induction.

      In both groups a second intravenous dose of cefuroxime (750mg) will be administered if the
      intraoperative time prolongs for more than three hours or if there is an intraoperative
      bleeding over 1000cc.

      There will not be a placebo treatment. Subject compliance will be evaluated according to the
      usual practice in surgical care field
