      several sutures of the skull. The prevalence of craniosynostosis is approximately 1 in 2,100
      to 3,000 births. Originally described by our group, Muenke syndrome (OMIM # 602849) is a
      specific form of craniosynostosis caused by a single nucleotide transversion in fibroblast
      growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3), c.749C>G, resulting in p.Pro250Arg. Individuals carrying
      the defining mutation variably manifest coronal suture craniosynostosis, developmental delay,
      deafness, and carpal and tarsal bone fusion. The purpose of the present study is to increase
      our understanding of the clinical manifestations of Muenke syndrome through detailed
      physical, developmental, neurologic, dental, ophthalmologic, otolaryngologic, audiologic,
      radiologic, and genetic/genomic studies. We also plan to examine the spectrum of clinical
      characteristics of Muenke syndrome to facilitate early diagnosis and clinical management,
      including genetic counseling. To accomplish this, we plan to enroll approximately 10-20
      probands, as well as their family members each year, with an enrollment ceiling of 200
      probands. Our study has three arms. The clinical arm is the major focus of our study.
      Patients and their families will be seen at the NIH Clinical Center and Children's National
      Medical Center. Individuals with Muenke syndrome who are unable or unwilling to come to the
      NIH, can submit their medical records, including a copy of the molecular testing, for review.
      The second arm is genetic/genomic studies with the goal of investigating modifying factors
      that relate to disease severity and expression. The third arm consists of a cognitive
      function, development and hearing questionnaire to be completed by patients online, via phone
      or mail.
