      to the hamstring muscles in the first group and the Mulligan TSLR technique will be
      administered on the same muscle in the second group. Active knee extension angles of the
      individuals will be evaluated by a digital goniometer and muscle elasticity will be assessed
      by ultrasound elastography.

      Acute effects of Mulligan TSLR on reducing muscle resistance to movement will be evaluated by
      ultrasound elastography for the first time in this study. In our study, it was planned to
      examine the acute effects of static stretching and Mulligan TSLR techniques on reducing
      muscle resistance to movement by ultrasound elastography in healthy individuals with
      hamstring shortness.
