      ablation at Vanderbilt University. Data recorded at enrollment includes a detailed past
      medical history and measurements from pre-ablation imaging (cardiac MRI or CT). At the time
      of ablation, a blood sample is collected for storage of plasma/serum and extraction of DNA,
      and details of the ablation procedure are recorded. Post-ablation monitoring for arrhythmia
      recurrence is performed according to a standard clinical follow-up schedule at 3, 6, and
      12-months. ECG's are performed at each follow-up visit along with placement of an ambulatory
      ECG-monitor. At 6-months post-ablation, cardiac imaging with a repeat cardiac MRI or CT is
      performed.
