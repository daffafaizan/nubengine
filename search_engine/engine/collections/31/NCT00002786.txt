        -  Assess the safety and toxicity of cellular adoptive immunotherapy using autologous CD8+
           antigen-specific T-cell clones in patients with metastatic melanoma.

        -  Estimate the duration of in vivo persistence of adoptively transferred CD8+
           antigen-specific cytotoxic T-cell clones in these patients.

        -  Evaluate the antitumor effects of CD8+ antigen-specific T-cell clones in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells are harvested and then CD8+ cytotoxic
      T-lymphocyte (CTL) clones targeting melanosomal antigens are generated ex vivo. Patients
      receive cellular adoptive immunotherapy comprising autologous CD8+ CTL clones over 30 minutes
      on day 1. Patients also receive interleukin-2 subcutaneously every 12 hours on days 1-14 of
      courses 2-3. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 3 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed for approximately 1 year after the last infusion.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 20 patients will be accrued for this study.
