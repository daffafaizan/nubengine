      stratified by age group (2 to <6 years; 6 to <12 years; and 12 to <18 years). Subjects will
      receive one of the following treatment regimens:

      • Ferumoxytol: 7 mg Fe/kg IV (maximum 510 mg/dose) x 2 doses, the first dose administered on
      Day 1 and the second 2 to 8 days later.

      OR

      • Iron sucrose (Venofer®): 4 mg Fe/kg IV (maximum 200 mg/dose) x 5 doses, the first dose on
      Day 1 and subsequent doses administered at least once per week and up to 3 times/week. All
      subjects will be monitored at the study site through at least 1 hour after the completion of
      each infusion of study drug. Assessment of blood Hgb concentrations, adverse events, and
      other safety assessments will be performed through study Week 5.
