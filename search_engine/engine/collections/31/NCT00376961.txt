      Primary

        -  Determine the 2-year progression-free survival rate in patients with newly diagnosed
           mantle cell lymphoma treated with induction therapy comprising rituximab,
           cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin hydrochloride, vincristine, prednisone, and bortezomib
           followed by bortezomib maintenance (VM) therapy.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the response rate (complete, complete unconfirmed, and partial responses) in
           patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the toxicity of VM in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

        -  Induction therapy: Patients receive R-CHOP-V induction therapy comprising rituximab IV
           over â‰¤ 6 hours, cyclophosphamide IV over 15-45 minutes, doxorubicin hydrochloride IV
           over 5-20 minutes, and vincristine IV over 5-15 minutes on day 1; oral prednisone once
           daily on days 1-5; and bortezomib IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1 and 4. Treatment
           repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or
           unacceptable toxicity. After completion of 6 courses, patients with stable disease or
           better proceed to bortezomib maintenance therapy.

        -  Maintenance therapy: Beginning 3 months after completion of R-CHOP-V induction therapy,
           patients receive bortezomib IV on days 1, 4, 8, and 11. Treatment repeats every 3 months
           for up to 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 4 years and then
      annually for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients will be accrued for this study.
