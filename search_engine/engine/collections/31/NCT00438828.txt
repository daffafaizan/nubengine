      bones. This often results in significant pain and suffering. Radiation treatment is often
      recommended as a safe and quick treatment that gives most people good relief from bone pain
      within a couple of weeks. However, some people can experience a short episode of increased
      pain called a flare a day or two after radiation treatment that lasts about a day. Studies
      suggest that around a third of all people who receive radiation treatment to help pain from
      cancer in the bones will have a pain flare. This study is being done because it would be
      helpful to prevent extra bone pain from happening to people after they receive radiation
      treatments. The purpose of this study is to find out if a medication called dexamethasone can
      help prevent pain flare as a result of radiation therapy.
