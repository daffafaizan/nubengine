      to a 3 weeks' multimodal rehabilitation program will be tested in the motion analysis
      laboratory before (T1) and after (T2) the program. This program is an intensive 3-weeks
      multidisciplinary rehabilitation program. Patients come daily for individual and group
      treatments, with a total of 100 hours of intervention during 3 weeks. The program includes
      physiotherapy treatments, occupational therapy, psychologists encounters and education
      session. The programs encompasses a multidimensional view of chronic low back pain.
      Therefore, this setting is a unique opportunity to improve our understanding of the role of
      motor behavior alterations in CLBP because it will allow connecting changes in spinal
      kinematics and muscle activity with changes in pain, disability and pain-related fear.

      This project has two aims in relation to motor behavior in patients with CLBP:

      The first aim is to analyse the relationship between changes in spinal kinematics and changes
      in pain and disability during and after a multimodal rehabilitation program. First, changes
      in spinal kinematics and muscle activity between T1 and T2 will be calculated. The
      relationship between these changes and changes in pain and disability during the program will
      be tested. Pain and disability will be also measured at 3 months (T3) and one year (T4) after
      the program, which will allow to further analyze the relationship between spinal motor
      behavior and pain and disability.

      The second aim concerns the role of pain-related fear, and its decrease, in spinal motor
      behavior alterations. Consequently, the second aim is to analyse if changes in pain-related
      fear are associated with changes in spinal kinematics during a multimodal rehabilitation
      program.
