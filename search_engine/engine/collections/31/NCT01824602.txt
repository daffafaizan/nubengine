      multicentre clinical trial in patients with a diagnosis of bipolar I disorder who experienced
      an acute manic (including mixed) episode. Patients who met the selection criteria at
      randomisation visit (V) (V2, Day 1) were randomised to 1 of 4 treatment groups: 600, 1200, or
      1800 mg eslicarbazepine acetate, or placebo. Patients started the assigned treatment on Day 1
      and were followed for up to 3 weeks. On Day 10, patients who showed no improvement were
      switched to open-label escape therapy with an established antimanic therapy. Patients could
      have been hospitalized at screening or at any time during the study at the investigator's
      discretion. Following randomisation (V2, Day 1), patients were assessed on Days 3, 7, 10, 14,
      21, 28, and 56, after which they could either enter a recurrence prevention study, or the
      study drug could be tapered off and they could undergo follow-up assessments.
