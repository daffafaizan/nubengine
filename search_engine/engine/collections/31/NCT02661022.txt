      Relapsed and Refractory Multiple Myeloma.

      This study is a Phase 1/2 multi center, open label study of SL-401 in combination with
      standard doses of Pomalidomide and Dexamethasone. The study will be conducted in 2 Phases:
      Phase 1 is the dose escalation Phase to determine the MTD or maximum tested dose of SL-401 in
      combination with standard doses of Pomalidomide and Dexamethasone. In Phase 1, each evaluated
      SL-401 dose level will incorporate an initial "Run-in Cycle" (i.e. cycle 1) of single agent
      SL-401 in at least 3 patients; following the Run-in Cycle, patients who have not experienced
      a DLT will receive combination SL-401/Pomalidomide and Dexamethasone in cycles 2 and beyond.
      All patients in Phase 2 will initiate therapy with the combination of SL-401/Pomalidomide and
      Dexamethasone at the maximum tested dose established in Phase 1 in the same manner (i.e.
      SL-401 alone in cycle 1 followed by combination of SL-401 and Pomalidomide and Dexamethasone
      in cycles 2 and beyond).
