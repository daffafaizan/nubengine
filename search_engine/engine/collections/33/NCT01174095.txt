      all 31 subjects, and obtain contact information for all living subjects. Living subjects will
      be called by the research coordinator at Stony Brook University Medical Center and invited to
      participate in the current follow-up study, which will entail a full medical chart review. If
      the potential subject is interested, he/she will be invited to Stony Brook University Medical
      Center where Dr. Rosengart or a designated co-investigator conducts the informed consent
      process. However, subjects who are unable to travel to Stony Brook University Medical Center
      will be mailed the consent form. Those who consent to participate will compile their medical
      records and send them to Stony Brook University Medical Center. The research coordinator at
      Stony Brook will conduct a chart review in order to collect information regarding the
      subject's medication, evaluation and surgical history over the past 10 years. This
      information will include cardiac health evaluations such as 99mTc-sestamibi SPECT, treadmill
      exercise tolerance test and cardiac specific blood tests. These parameters will be compared
      to evaluations done at baseline and evaluations done at the subject's last visit as a
      participant of either Institutional Review Board (IRB) protocol #0794-894 or #0297-693.
