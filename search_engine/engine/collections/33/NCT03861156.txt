      (Firstly, D-0316 was orally given 75mg for a cycle(21 days), if tolerated, the dose will be
      increased to 100mg. Otherwise, the dose will be maintained at 75mg.) in patients with a
      confirmed diagnosis of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor mutation positive and T790M mutation
      positive NSCLC,who have progressed following prior therapy with an approved Epidermal Growth
      Factor Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) agent. The primary objective of the
      study is to assess the efficacy of D-0316 by assessment of Objective Response Rate according
      to RECIST 1.1 by an Independent Central Review.
