      bypass surgery to receive either standard diabetes care by their admitting physician, or
      diabetes care under the direction of the Diabetes Action Team post operatively until hospital
      discharge and post discharge in the community. Subjects without diabetes will have their
      blood glucose levels monitored while in the hospital. The Diabetes Action team will consist
      of a nurse coordinator who is a Certified Diabetes Educator (CDE) and a team of physicians
      specialized in the management of diabetes. The study will not increase the length of the
      hospital stay.
