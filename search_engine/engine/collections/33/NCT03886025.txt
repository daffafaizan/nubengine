      maladaptive personality development and violent behaviour. There is a dearth of studies that
      examined the effects of combined tDCS and cognitive training on decision-making under
      conditions of uncertainty and risk. It is also unclear if these effects are generalizable to
      tasks in other domains such as response inhibition (motor impulsivity).

      To examine these issues further, a single blind parallel arms randomized controlled trial
      will be conducted, involving a sample of healthy volunteers aged between 18 and 40. This will
      entail applying either active or sham tDCS over the anterior frontal cortex (including the
      vm-PFC) while participants undertake decision-making training using the Iowa Gambling Task.
      Decision-making will be assessed using the IGT, which is a computerized gambling task used to
      assess decision-making under conditions of uncertainty and risk. IGT is sensitive to damage
      to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), which is considered to play a key role in
      decision-making. Motor impulsivity will be measured using the Stop Signal Task (SST). The
      UPPS+P Impulsive Behaviour Scale will be used to index trait impulsivity. The Profile of Mood
      States will be used to measure state emotion before and after tDCS.
