    
      Eligible participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive denosumab 120 mg or placebo
      subcutaneously (SC) for up to 5 years. Randomization was stratified based on:

        1. Breast cancer therapy/lymph node (LN) status: neoadjuvant therapy/any LN status versus
           adjuvant therapy/LN negative (based on axillary LN dissection, or based on sentinel node
           status) versus adjuvant therapy/LN positive

        2. Hormone receptor (estrogen receptor [ER]/progesterone receptor [PR]) status: ER and/or
           PR positive versus ER and PR negative

        3. Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2) status: HER-2 positive versus HER-2
           negative

        4. Age: < 50 years versus â‰¥ 50 years

        5. Geographic Region: Japan versus Other regions.

      The primary analysis was conducted after all enrolled participants had the opportunity to
      complete 5 years of treatment from study day 1.
