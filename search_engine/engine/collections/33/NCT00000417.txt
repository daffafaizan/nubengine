      predict physical and mental health and disease activity in lupus. We wished to study the
      relationships among patient/partner communication, social support, and self-efficacy as they
      influence patient health longitudinally. We are randomizing 150 lupus patients and their
      partners to either (1) participate in a counseling intervention to improve self-efficacy,
      partner support, and patient/partner problem-solving in lupus management or (2) see an
      informational film about lupus (control). The counseling intervention includes an initial
      in-person session followed by five monthly telephone calls to monitor and reinforce
      problem-solving. We will follow patients for 12 months for self-reported physical and mental
      health, disease activity, self-efficacy, coping, social support, and couples communication.
