      parallel, interventional pilot study HCL and intramyocellular lipids (IMCL) will be
      quantified with 1H magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy. Hepatic ATP and inorganic phosphate
      (Pi) concentrations will be assessed with 31P MR spectroscopy (1). Whole-body and hepatic
      insulin sensitivity and metabolic flexibility will be measured by combining
      hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic pancreatic clamp tests with isotopic dilution of 6,6-2H2 glucose
      and indirect calorimetry as shown (2). Abdominal fat distribution will be quantified by MR
      imaging.

      Newly diagnosed patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) will be randomly allocated to once daily
      25 mg empagliflozin (EMPA) or placebo for 24 weeks with a computer-generated random sequence
      and will be masked to the treatment assignment. Participants will visit the clinical research
      center at baseline, 12 weeks and 24 weeks for MRS and metabolic examinations, including blood
      sampling for hepato- and adipocytokines. Anthropometric parameters (body weight, waist
      circumference, total body fat, blood pressure) and glycemic control (HbA1C, fasting blood
      glucose, FBG) will be assessed at baseline and during monitoring visits every 4 weeks.
