      emerging adulthood, a unique stage of life between ages 18 and 25. Over half of emerging
      adults experience weight gain and/or disordered eating (e.g. overly restrictive dieting,
      binge eating); both of which contribute to obesity. Because many emerging adults attend
      college, the college community represents a viable population for implementing interventions
      to prevent weight gain, while not triggering disordered eating.

      A promising strategy for preventing weight gain during college is daily self-weighing, an
      example of behavioral self-monitoring, an evidence-based strategy for weight control.
      Self-monitoring is fundamental to behavior change: feedback allows the user to evaluate
      progress in relation to a goal and modify behavior. Despite self-monitoring being
      recommended, some evidence suggests that self-monitoring strategies, self-weighing in
      particular, may have unintended psychological consequences; the concern being that negative
      mood states could precipitate disordered eating. Alternatively, other evidence suggests
      positive psychological outcomes related to daily self-weighing in young adults.

      Technological advances have allowed for users to track personal health information in real
      time. Given that 60% of U.S. adults track weight, diet, or exercise, and 92% of adults aged
      18-34 own a smartphone, electronic self-monitoring is feasible in this population. What is
      less known is individuals' psychological and behavioral response to self-monitoring. This
      original, important study will contribute to the fields of obesity and eating disorders and
      experimentally test the psychological effects of this daily weight-control intervention.
