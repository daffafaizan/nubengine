    
      South Africa has a huge tuberculosis (TB) disease burden, with 948 per 100 000 people
      diagnosed with TB in 2008. TB drug induced hepatitis (DIH) is a common adverse effect of TB
      therapy that causes significant patient morbidity and prolonged hospital stays.
      N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) has been extensively studied and used for many years in the treatment
      of paracetamol-induced hepatotoxicity, with good evidence of efficacy and safety. NAC has
      also been used in other forms of liver injury and drug toxicity. It has not previously been
      used in the management of TB DIH.

      We will screen all patients with clinical hepatitis on TB treatment admitted to New Somerset
      and Groote Schuur hospitals and aim to recruit 100 participants over 3 years. We will
      randomise 50 participants to receive an IV loading dose of 150mg/kg of NAC over 60 minutes
      followed by 50mg/kg IV over 4 hours by continuous infusion and finally 100mg/kg IV over 16
      hours. Fifty participants will be randomised to receive placebo. The primary outcome will be
      time to normalisation of liver function (ALT<100). We will also determine the effect of NAC
      on duration of hospitalization, rate of recovery from liver failure, all cause mortality, and
      describe adverse effects of IV NAC in this patient population.
