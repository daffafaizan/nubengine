    
      This phase 2, two-center, open-label, single-treatment group, within-patient-controlled study
      was conducted to:

        -  Expand the safety database and gather data on the percentage of patients with known or
           suspected ovarian carcinoma or recurrent endometrial carcinoma who show increased uptake
           of FolateScan in tumors (primary objective).

        -  Calculate the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value, and
           negative predictive value of FolateScan compared with immunohistochemical (IHC) staining
           (secondary objective).
