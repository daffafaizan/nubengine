      gastric cancer. A previous randomized study of ILF regimen versus IP in patients with AGC
      showed that the ILF produced an overall response rate of 42% and a median survival of 10.7
      months, which were significantly better than the results with IP regimen [Pozzo C, et al. Ann
      Oncol 2004]. However, since cisplatin is still considered one of the key drugs for the
      treatment of gastric cancer, a combination of these four drugs (irinotecan, leucovorin, FU
      and cisplatin) seemed to be a promising strategy for advanced AGC. We desinged this
      randomized phase II study to compare the combination of irinotecan, leucovorin and 5-FU (ILF)
      with ILF plus cisplatin (PILF) as first-line chemotherapy in patients with measurable
      metastatic gastric cancer.
