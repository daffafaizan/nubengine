        -  Determine response in patients with high-grade dysplasia, carcinoma in situ, or early
           intramucosal adenocarcinoma of the esophagus and Barrett's esophagus treated with
           photodynamic therapy using HPPH.

        -  Determine the safety, in terms of toxicity to surrounding normal tissue, of this regimen
           in these patients.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this regimen on surrounding normal tissue in these
           patients.

        -  Determine the incidence of adenocarcinoma in these patients after this treatment.

        -  Determine the magnitude and duration of increased skin sun sensitivity in patients
           treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the minimal erythemal dose of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified according to presence of
      intramucosal tumor (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive HPPH IV over 1 hour on day 1. Approximately 24 hours later, the
           lesion is exposed to laser light endoscopically.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive HPPH as in arm I, but at a higher dose, followed by laser light
           exposure.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients (30 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 3 years.
