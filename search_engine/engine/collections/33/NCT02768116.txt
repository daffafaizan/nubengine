      Transfer of Plaque vs. Provisional T Stenting for the Treatment of Non-Left-Main Coronary
      Bifurcation Lesions.

      The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Active Transfer of Plaque
      and provisional T stenting techniques treating non-left-main coronary bifurcation lesions
      based on TLR rate 12-months post-procedure.

      Provisional T Stenting is a common technique in BL treatment. Active Transfer of Plaque or
      ATP was reported, but there are no comparison between two procedure. In the ATP treatment of
      bifurcation lesions, two wires are advanced to distal main vessel (MV) and side branch(SB).
      Stent and balloon are advanced to MV and SB respectively. The MV stent is released while
      dilating the SB balloon. By predilating the balloon in the target SB, the plaque will be
      actively transferred from SB to MV. Subsequently, the plaque will be fixed by the expansive
      stent in MV.As to the provisional T treatment, provisional T stenting is the typic step-T
      stenting. In brief, two wires are advanced to distal MV and SB. Predilation is left at
      operator's discretion, however, predilating SB is not encouraged. Kissing balloon inflation
      before stenting MV is left at operator's discretion. A stent with stent/artery ratio of 1.1:1
      is inflated in MV. Rewire to SB is also left at operator's discretion. FKBI is recommended if
      there is at least one of following: residual stenosis>75%, >type B dissection and TIMI
      flow<3.

      All patients will be followed clinically at 1-, 6- 12- and 24-month after stent implantation.
      Repeat angiographic follow-ups are recommended for all patients at 12 months after the index
      procedure.

      The primary endpoint of the trial is the rate of TLR at 12-month follow-up.
