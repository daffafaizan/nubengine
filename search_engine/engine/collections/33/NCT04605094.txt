      with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis (AD) who remain symptomatic despite treatment with
      topical medications. It is proposed that benralizumab will deplete eosinophils from affected
      skin, improve symptoms of AD, and improve AD-related quality of life. This Phase 2 study is
      designed to compare the efficacy of treatment with benralizumab versus placebo and compare
      benralizumab maintenance dosing regimens in the extension period.
