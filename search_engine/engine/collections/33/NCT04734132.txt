      areas, also consumed as food, which is currently expanding worldwide as a protein-rich leafy
      vegetable and for the medicinal value of its phytochemicals, in particular its
      glucosinolates. Specifically, MO dry leaves and leaf extracts have been shown to exert
      numerous in vitro activities and in vivo effects, including the hypoglycemic effect. Thus, MO
      could be an alternative to prevent or treat diabetes. In this sense, in vitro and preclinical
      experiments have shown that MO could potentially reverse some of the pathophysiological
      manifestation of diabetes and its comorbidities, such as hepatic fat accumulation and insulin
      resistance, oxidative stress, inflammation and peripheral hyperglycemia. Studies in humans,
      however, are still limited. This proposal aims to study the efficacy of Moringa oleifera to
      improve the control of glycaemia in subjects with prediabetes. A 3-month dietary intervention
      with MO dry leave capsules will be performed and compared to placebo. This will be a
      double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled, parallel group intervention study. Subjects
      will randomly consume either 6 capsules of dry MO leaves (400 mg dry leaf powder /capsule) or
      6 placebo capsules per day during 3 months. The study subjects will provide samples for
      outcome measurements at three different time points: basal, 6 weeks and 12 weeks of
      supplementation. Glycaemia and plasma inflammatory and metabolic markers will be measured, as
      well as the gut microbiota composition.
