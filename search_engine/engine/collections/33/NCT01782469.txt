      treated with adalimumab in accordance with usual clinical care practices and local marketing
      authorization requirements. A total of 5 visits were planned: Baseline (Visit 1), Visits 2,
      3, 4 and 5 (Week 13). The time interval between the baseline visit and the second visit was
      approximately 2-3 weeks, with a window of one week. Additional study objectives were to
      investigate the rate of RA progression via changes in the B-mode ultrasonography assessment
      score over time as well as changes in the number of joints with erosion over time. The study
      was terminated due to low enrollment.
