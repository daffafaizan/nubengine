      I. To identify maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of nintedanib for combination treatment of
      nintedanib and azacytidine (5-azacitidine) in the treatment of newly diagnosed and
      relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia with HOX overexpression and who are ineligible for
      intensive chemotherapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Adverse events (AEs) including dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) will be assessed according
      to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)
      4.03.

      II. To determine median overall survival. III. To determine complete remission (CR) rate.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine composite CR rate (CR + complete remission with incomplete platelet recovery
      [CRp] + complete remission with incomplete hematological recovery [Cri]).

      II. To determine duration of confirmed response. III. To determine event free survival. IV.
      To determine leukemia free survival. V. To establish correlation between response and
      pre-treatment Fgf2 levels and change in Fgf-2 levels during treatment.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of azacitidine.

      Participants receive nintedanib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28 and azacitidine
      intravenously (IV) or subcutaneously (SC) on days 1-7. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up
      to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion
      of 6 courses, participants may discontinue treatment, receive nintedanib every 4-8 weeks, or
      receive nintedanib and azacitidine every 4-8 weeks.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up at every 3 months for 12
      months and then every 6 months for up to 24 months.
