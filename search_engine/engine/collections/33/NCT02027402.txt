      removal of infected debris or abscess, and supporting the healing of leakage or fistula.
      Although the usability of therapeutic drain is commonly accepted, the efficacy of
      prophylactic drain still has been debated. Most surgeons have inserted prophylactic drain
      with expectations that the drain would be helpful for early detection of postoperative
      bleeding or leakage, and also prevention of intra-abdominal abscess through removing debris
      or curd. However, there are only few evidence-based studies for the actual effectiveness of
      prophylactic drain and the objections against the routine use of drain have been raised.

      Most surgeons have placed the drain after cholecystectomy with expectations that it could
      help to detect postoperative bleeding or bile leakage and prevent intra-abdominal infection.
      However, there is a lack of evidence regarding the role of drain in laparoscopic
      cholecystectomy for acutely inflamed gallbladder and surgeons have placed the drain based on
      their experiences and beliefs, not on evidence-based guidelines. In the previous
      retrospective study, [4] we described that the routine drain use in laparoscopic
      cholecystectomy for acutely inflamed gallbladder has no advantage to detect bile leak or
      bleeding and it was no helpful to prevent the postoperative morbidities such as
      intra-abdominal abscess or wound infection. The aim of present multicenter trial is to assess
      the value of routine drain use in laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acutely inflamed
      gallbladder in a large, randomized controlled prospective study.
