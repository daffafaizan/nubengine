    
      This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety profiles of A006 and to assist in
      identifying the optimum dose of A006 for future clinical studies. ProventilÂ® HFA MDI, a
      currently marketed Albuterol MDI product, will be used as an Active Control. The study also
      employs a Placebo Control DPI, which has the same configuration as the A006 DPI except that
      it contains no active ingredient.
