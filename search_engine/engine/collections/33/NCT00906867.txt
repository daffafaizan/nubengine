      the paradoxical, intermittent adduction of the vocal cords during inspiration. Methacholine
      challenge testing combined with laryngoscopy is useful in differentiating vocal cord
      dysfunction from asthma during the asymptomatic period.

      In one visit patients will be characterized with a questionnaire based on the ISAAC
      questionnaire. Furthermore, FeNO, eCO, skin prick testing and total serum IgE will be
      examined. The psychiatric condition of patients will be determined by CBCL/6-18 and YSR/11-18
      behavior questionnaires. After initial fiberoptic laryngoscopy and pulmonary function
      testing, bronchoprovocation is performed using nebulized methacholine at increasing doses,
      until a 20% decline in the forced expiratory volume in 1 second is achieved (PD20FEV1). Each
      methacholine testing will be followed by a second laryngoscopy and pulmonary function
      testing. The visualization of paradoxical vocal cord motion during inspiration will be
      recorded.
