      (renal) transplantation for over 40 years. However, poor growth and bone loss caused by the
      use of steroids are devastating to pediatric kidney recipients. The negative physical
      implications of steroid use also greatly impacts patients' compliance to their prescribed
      steroid-containing regimens.

      The development of a steroid-free regimen for post-transplant pediatric patients is sorely
      needed. This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of a steroid-free based treatment
      regimen in children and adolescents who have received kidney transplants, compared to a
      standard of care steroid-based regimen. Participants in this study will be pediatric patients
      with end-stage kidney disease who will undergo kidney transplantation at the start of the
      study.

      Patients will participate in this study for 3 years. Participants will be randomized (1:1) to
      one of two groups. The study includes 23 study visits over 3 years. A physical exam,
      medication history, adverse events reporting, blood pressure readings, growth assessment, and
      blood collection will occur at most visits. At the time of transplantation, participants will
      have a kidney biopsy. Participants will also undergo cataract screening within 4 months of
      transplantation.
