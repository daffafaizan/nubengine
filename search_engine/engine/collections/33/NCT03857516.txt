      Lead dislodgment requiring re-intervention is rare. However, data on minor lead movements
      which may affect pacing capabilities and application of new pacing algorithms is scarce. Aim
      of the study is to characterize pacing thresholds of each of the implanted electrodes on
      quadripolar leads in a short term follow-up.
