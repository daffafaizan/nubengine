      autologous CD34+ stem cells (SC group) or no intracoronary infusion (control group). At the
      time of enrollment, and at yearly intervals thereafter, we performed detailed clinical
      evaluation, echocardiography, 6-minute walk test, and measured plasma levels of NT-proBNP. To
      better-define the potential role of inflammatory response, we also measured plasma
      inflammatory markers (tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-Î± and interleukin [IL]-6) at the time of
      CD34+ stem cell injection.
