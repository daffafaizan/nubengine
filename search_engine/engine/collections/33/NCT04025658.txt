      accounts for an estimated 140,000 deaths per year worldwide. Furthermore, recent evidence has
      shown that the rate of PPH secondary to uterine atony is increasing.

      Multiple pregnancy is a well-recognized risk factor for PPH. Compared with singleton
      pregnancy, women with a multiple pregnancy have an increased risk of PPH, severe PPH,
      transfusion, uterine atony, hysterectomy, prolonged hospital stay and death. This is true in
      both high- and low-income countries. Uterine atony as a cause of PPH is more likely in
      multiple pregnancy compared with singleton pregnancy.

      Prophylactic uterotonic drugs administered after the delivery have been demonstrated to
      reduce the incidence of PPH by up to 40%. Oxytocin is the most commonly administered
      uterotonic drug used to prevent PPH in North America but is associated with adverse effects
      such as hypotension, nausea, vomiting, dysrhythmias, ST segment abnormalities, and severe
      water intoxication that may lead to pulmonary edema and convulsions.

      Previous dose finding studies have excluded women with twin pregnancies. Therefore, the
      investigators wish to perform a double blinded dose finding study using the biased coin flip
      up-and-down sequential allocation technique to determine the ED 90 of oxytocin at cesarean
      section in those women with a twin pregnancy.
