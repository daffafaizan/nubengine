      inclusion. WLE without magnification was performed first in eligible patients. Based on an
      assessment of the shape (such as flat, depressed or elevated) and color (pale or reddened),
      small focal gastric lesions were identified and included for evaluation by experienced
      endoscopists. When such a lesion was detected during non-magnifying observation with WLE, the
      mode was then changed to ME-NBI for observation of microvascular pattern and ME-AIM for
      observation of microsurface pattern subsequently. All endoscopic images of the whole
      procedure were recorded in digital filing system for later evaluation. To avoid possible
      selection bias and to maintain the quality of the study, all images of each endoscopic
      modality (including WLE, ME-NBI, ME-AIM), which were arranged randomly on one slide and
      displayed independently of the images of other endoscopic modality, were evaluated by 4
      skilled endoscopists, who were not access to the clinical and pathological data. The general
      consensus was established for an assessment of each lesion. Two forceps biopsy specimens were
      taken from each lesion and pathological diagnosis were used as the criterion standard for
      cancer diagnosis.
