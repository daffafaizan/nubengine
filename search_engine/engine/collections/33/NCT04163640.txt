      not. Regardless of randomization patients will be re-assessed at the same time points for
      ovarian reserve parameters. If antral follicles are detected at follow up, patients will
      undergo controlled ovarian hyperstimulation and a routine in vitro fertilization cycle as per
      protocol.
