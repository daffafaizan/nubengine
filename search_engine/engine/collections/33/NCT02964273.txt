    
      Tolvaptan has been demonstrated to delay the decline of kidney function in adults with
      rapidly progressing ADPKD (CKD stages 1 to 3) as measured by estimated glomerular filtration
      rate (eGFR) and Total Kidney Volume (TKV).

      This trial will be the first trial of tolvaptan in children and adolescents with ADPKD.

      Participants in this study will be randomly assigned to one of two groups in Phase A;
      tolvaptan or placebo. Participants will have an equal chance of being assigned to either
      treatment group and will be stratified by age and gender into the following cohorts:

        -  Female participant ages 12 to 14 years, inclusive

        -  Female participant ages 15 to 17 years, inclusive

        -  Male participant ages 12 to 14 years, inclusive

        -  Male participant ages 15 to 17 years, inclusive

      Phase (A) of this study will last 12 months. After that time, all participants who qualify
      will be assigned tolvaptan and will be treated with tolvaptan for 24 months (Phase B).

      A qualified participant is defined as one who has completed Phase A on investigational
      medicinal product (IMP), is willing to continue in the trial, and who does not have any
      adverse events (AEs), which would require IMP discontinuation.

      Participants in this study will be required to make monthly visits to the study clinic and
      will be closely monitored over the course of the study.
