      non-small cell lung cancer randomized to concomitant vinblastine/cisplatin (VBL/CDDP) and
      thoracic radiotherapy versus sequential VBL/CDDP and once-daily thoracic radiotherapy. II.
      Compare the survival rate of such patients randomized to 2 courses of concomitant
      etoposide/cisplatin and hyperfractionated thoracic radiotherapy versus sequential VBL/CDDP
      and once-daily thoracic radiotherapy. III. Assess the frequency of treatment-related
      esophageal and hematologic toxicity/morbidity in patients on concomitant versus sequential
      chemoradiation treatment arms.

      OUTLINE: Randomized study. The following acronyms are used: CDDP Cisplatin, NSC-119875 VBL
      Vinblastine, NSC-49842 VP-16 Etoposide, NSC-141540 Arm I: 2-Drug Combination Chemotherapy
      Followed by Radiotherapy. CDDP/VBL; followed by thoracic irradiation using photons of at
      least 6 MV (electrons may be used to boost the supraclavicular lymph nodes). Arm II:
      Radiotherapy plus 2-Drug Combination Chemotherapy. Thoracic irradiation using equipment as in
      Arm I; plus CDDP/VBL. Arm III: Hyperfractionated Radiotherapy plus 2-Drug Combination
      Chemotherapy. Thoracic irradiation using equipment as in Arm I; plus CDDP/VP-16.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 597 patients will be entered over 3.1-4.2 years. If fewer than
      6 patients/month are accrued, the feasibility of the study will be re-evaluated.
