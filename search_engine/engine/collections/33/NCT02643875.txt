    
      Subjects were fitted with ortho-k lenses of conventional (0.75 D) and increased (1.75 D)
      compression factor. The laterality of the compression factor for each subject was randomised.

      Subjects were instructed and trained with proper lens handling and disinfection procedures.
      Lenses were given to the subjects only when they demonstrated proper techniques.

      All subjects were required to attend regular follow-ups (baseline, first overnight, and
      weekly over one-month period). The follow-ups were scheduled (except for the first overnight
      which was scheduled in the early morning) at a similar time to the baseline visit (+/- 2
      hours) to minimise any potential influence of diurnal variation on ocular biometrics.

      Additional unscheduled visits were provided when necessary to ensure good ocular health and
      vision throughout the study period.
