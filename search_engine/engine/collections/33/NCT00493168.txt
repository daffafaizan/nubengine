      lethal coronary heart disease. However, since the diagnosis of unrecognized MI is based on
      the appearance of incidental Q-waves on 12-lead electrocardiography, the syndrome of
      unrecognized non-Q-wave MI has not been described. Delayed-enhancement cardiovascular
      magnetic resonance (DE-CMR) can accurately identify non-Q-wave MI. The aims of this study are
      three-fold: 1. to determine the prevalence of unrecognized non-Q-wave and Q-wave MI, 2. to
      define predictors of unrecognized non-Q-wave MI, 3. to determine the prognostic significance
      of unrecognized non-Q-wave MI.
