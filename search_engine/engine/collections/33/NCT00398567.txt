    
      Open label phase 1/2 study of ascending multiple oral doses of HKI-272 in combination with IV
      trastuzumab in subjects with advanced human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive
      (HER2+) breast cancer. Three to six subjects will be enrolled in each dose group. Adverse
      events and dose limiting toxicities will be assessed from the first dose of study drug though
      day 21. When the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of HKI-272 plus trastuzumab is determined, an
      additional 30 subjects will be enrolled at that dose level, and followed for progression free
      survival for approximately 1 year.
