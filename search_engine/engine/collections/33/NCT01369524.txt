      a better organ perfusion? In hospital the investigators are now looking to the pump function
      of the heart, as there is not a better measurement. However this gives no information about
      necessity of giving fluids. A healthy volunteer also gives a better pump function of the
      heart after fluid, but that fluid is not necessary and gives no better organ perfusion. The
      question is: How many percent of the patients have a MFI score of < 2.6, when the doctor on
      clinical basis plans to give fluid to the patient, improves organ perfusion after fluid, and
      is this correlated with an improvement of the cardiac output All intensive care patients who
      need extra fluid are eligible for this study. Before and after the fluid challenge we do SDF
      imaging sublingual. Per patient the investigators do this 1x in 24 hours. Concurrently, data
      on both patient characteristics (e.g. severity of illness) will be obtained Study population
      max 100 patients. Possible outcome: MFI < 2,6 en SV > 10% + MFI up MFI < 2,6 en SV equal +
      MFI equal MFI < 2,6 en SV > 10% + MFI equal MFI < 2,6 en SV equal + MFI up MFI > 2,6 en SV >
      10% + MFI up MFI > 2,6 en SV equal + MFI equal MFI > 2,6 en SV > 10% + MFI equal MFI > 2,6 en
      SV equal + MFI up
