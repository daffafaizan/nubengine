      repeated extreme life threat is unique to military combat personnel and a core characteristic
      of combat-related Prolonged Grief Disorder (PGD), a disorder as prevalent as Post-traumatic
      stress disorder and associated with functional impairment, disability, and suicidality.
      Effective treatments for depression and PTSD have proven less than adequate in treating PGD
      when each is offered in isolation; and simply combining these 12-16 week treatment regimens
      into a 24-36 week treatments is not a viable approach, particularly with a population
      predisposed to avoiding extended mental health care. This project addresses the need for a
      Veteran/ military specific treatment of PGD, and uses technology to deliver this treatment in
      a format that is far more likely to be accepted by military personnel and Veterans. This
      study will impact clinical practice by providing the first evidence for effective treatment
      of PGD in Veterans.
