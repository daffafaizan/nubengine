      incidence and other maternal and neonatal outcomes in pregnancies complicated by PPROM, thus
      enabling proper sample size calculation for future powered RCT.

      Study population and Sample size - Eligible patients included those with single pregnancies
      with PPROM at 24+0-33+6 weeks of gestation who were admitted to and delivering at our
      tertiary center. PPROM was diagnosed on the basis of patient's history and sterile speculum
      examination with visualization of amniotic fluid pooling in the vagina and/or leaking from
      the cervical canal. Exclusion criteria included indication for immediate delivery on
      admission (chorioamnionitis, placenta abruption, cord prolapse, signs of fetal
      hypoxia/distress), fetal malformations, multiple gestation, and maternal immunosuppressive
      disease. Considering future sample size calculation based upon assumed differences between
      groups regarding latency and infection, we aimed a sample of 30 participants.

      Randomization - A pilot unblinded randomized controlled trial (RCT) in a 1:1 allocation ratio
      between two groups (complete bed rest versus activity restriction after PPROM). Simple random
      allocation sequence was generated by the investigators and implemented by sequentially
      numbered sealed envelopes. Participants were enrolled by physicians after hospital admission
      and written informed consent was obtained before randomization. The trial was conducted in a
      single tertiary center of the Portuguese national health system after approval by its ethical
      committee.

      Statistical analysis - An intention-to-treat analysis was performed with a significance level
      of 5%.
