      participation will be recruited from the University of Ottawa and the general public.
      Participants will be randomized into one of three groups: early booster, late booster, or no
      booster (control). Currently, no booster is the educational standard. The early booster group
      will receive a booster at 3 weeks, the late booster at 2 months, and no booster for the
      control. All participants will undergo BLS training, an immediate post-test, and a retention
      post-test at 4 months. Post-tests involve a simulated cardiac arrest scenario. Raters will be
      blinded to the group allocation and simulation test order.
