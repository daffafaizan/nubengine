      unprecedented successes in treating patients with hematopoietic and lymphoid malignancies. In
      this study, investigators will evaluate their safety and efficacy in patients with different
      types of hematopoietic and lymphoid malignancies. The primary goal is safety assessment
      including cytokine storm response and any other adverse effects. In addition, tumor targeting
      and disease status after treatment will also be evaluated.
