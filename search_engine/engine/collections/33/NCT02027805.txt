      20 adult patients with acute steroid-resistant GVHD will be enrolled in a 12 months period.
      The treatment consists of a standard dose of 4 infusions T-Guard (4 mg/m2), given 48-hours
      apart over a 4-hour period. The intended follow-up period is 6 months.

      The primary objective is to determine the efficacy of T-Guard, 4 weeks after the first
      infusion (Day 28), in inducing an objective clinical response in patients with acute GVHD
      refractory to standard first line corticosteroid therapy.

      Secondary objectives are:

        -  To evaluate the overall safety and efficacy of T-Guard during the first 6 months after
           imitation of therapy;

        -  To determine the pharmacokinetic profile of T-Guard;

        -  To determine the immunogenicity of T-Guard.

      Exploratory objectives are:

        -  To study the specificity and kinetics of the treatment-induced depletion and subsequent
           repopulation of lymphocyte subsets;

        -  To evaluate diagnostic and predictive GVHD biomarkers relative to treatment outcomes.
