      specimens, from known HIV-positive individuals, to test for HIV-1 antibodies using both the
      DPP HIV 1/2 and HIV 1/2 STAT-PAK tests. Two oral fluid collection devices will be used and
      compared (MPC and Chembio collection devices) and the results obtained from oral fluids will
      be compared with those obtained from whole blood and plasma using paired samples from the
      same participants. The comparison between oral fluid, whole blood and plasma will be made in
      both Chembio devices (HIV 1/2 STAT-PAK and DPP HIV 1/2).
