    
      DDAVP (Desmopressin) is commonly used in the treatment of persons with bleeding disorders
      such as hemophilia, von Willebrand disease, or qualitative platelet disorders to help them
      clot better. The investigator wants to assess the increase in the subjects' clotting factors
      in response to intravenous DDAVP (Desmopressin) and the levels of these internal clotting
      factors will be measured at different times after the medication is given. The investigator
      will compare the response to DDAVP (Desmopressin) in adult hemophilia A carriers to women
      with a diagnosis of qualitative platelet dysfunction.
