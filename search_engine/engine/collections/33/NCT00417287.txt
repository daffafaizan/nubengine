      across a wide dose range. At higher doses, one side effect of the agent was a garlic-like
      odor of an expired metabolite. This study is being conducted to evaluate the clinical
      efficacy, biologic activity (inhibition of PX-12 target thioredoxin-1) and effects of the
      expired metabolite at two dose levels of PX-12. This study will determine if the efficacy and
      biologic activity achieved at either of the two dose levels is sufficient to proceed to
      further studies without pushing to the maximally tolerated dose.
