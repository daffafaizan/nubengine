    
      This is a single-center randomized controlled clinical study. Purpose of this study is to
      explore whether the coverage of the warming patch (for 5min before injection) can reduce the
      pain induced by propofol injection.

      The patients included in the study were randomly divided into two groups. The group W used a
      warming patch to cover the injection site, and the group C used a cotton pad to cover the
      injection site. After 5 minutes of coverage, the propofol injection was induced, and the
      patient's complaint of pain (calling or arm withdrawal) during propofol injection was
      observed, and the patient's recall of the pain score during induction after the patient
      recovered. After the patients regained consciousness, the data of the two groups were
      compared to determine whether the use of the warming patch could reduce the pain caused by
      propofol injection.
