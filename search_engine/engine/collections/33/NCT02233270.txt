      groups are developing and validating the diagnostic capabilities of device that conducts
      AEGIS. A belt (AbStats) fits externally around the abdomen and is embedded with acoustic
      sensors, similar to "electronic stethoscopes." The investigational software is designed to
      continuously, safely, and comfortably monitor acoustic signals emanating from the esophagus,
      stomach, and intestines, and stores the data in a HIPAA compliant hard drive. Through the
      study of associating these readings with current diagnostics and treatments we anticipate
      that the AEGIS device will eventually provide clinically interpretable information that is
      immediately actionable. In this study, the Abstats sensor will track signals in tandem with
      current techniques and standard of care treatments based on those diagnostics. AEGIS analysis
      could potentially refine, support, or even replace, existing costly and invasive techniques
      in the diagnosis of gastroparesis, intestinal psueodo-obstruction, colonic inertia, and
      disorders related to small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO).
