    
      This project will create a prospective registry of 3,000 patients with follow-ups of up to 5
      years.

      The aims of the project will be:

        1. identify plaque characteristics on OCT that are associated with adverse cardiac events
           including myocardial infarction

        2. to identify characteristics of stented arteries that are associated with adverse events
           including restenosis and stent thrombosis

      Because detailed clinical, angiographic and intravascular imaging data will be gathered from
      a large number of patients with clinical follow-ups, we anticipate that the registry will be
      a tremendous resource for additional research questions going forward.
