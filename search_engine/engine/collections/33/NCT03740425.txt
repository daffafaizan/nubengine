    
      Periprocedural bleeding events are frequent during transcatheter aortic valve implantation
      (TAVI), mainly driven by vascular complications and are associated to a worse prognosis.
      Therefore, red blood cell (RBC) transfusion is often required, although it is associated with
      worsened outcomes.

      There is no consensus on the optimal transfusion strategy after bleeding: among patients
      undergoing cardiac surgery, the Transfusion Requirements in Cardiac Surgery (TRICS) III trial
      documented that a restrictive RBC transfusion strategy (if hemoglobin level was <7.5 g/dl)
      was noninferior to a liberal approach (if hemoglobin level was <9.5 g/dl) with respect to the
      composite occurrence of death, myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, or new-onset renal failure
      with dialysis.

      The Transfusion Requirements in Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TRITAVI) will be a
      multicenter retrospective registry enrolling consecutive patients who underwent TAVI; the
      primary aim of the study will be to test whether RBC transfusion is a marker or an
      independent predictor of adverse events. Patients will be stratified according to their
      lowest hemoglobin value (>9.5 g/dl, 7.5-9.5 g/dl and <7.5 g/dl) and to whether they received
      or not periprocedural RBC transfusion.

      The primary endpoint will be the 30-day occurrence of major adverse cardiovascular events
      (MACE), as death, myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, or acute kidney injury (AKI, as
      absolute increase in serum creatinine ≥0.3 mg/dL [≥26.4 μmol/L] or ≥50% increase ≤72 hours).
