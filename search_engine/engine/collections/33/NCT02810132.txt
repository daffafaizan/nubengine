      present in approximately 50 % of HF patients. Metformin is the most commonly prescribed oral
      anti-diabetic drug, and registry and experimental studies show beneficial effects of
      metformin in HF, but randomized trials are needed.

      Objectives: To investigate if treatment with metformin in patients with HF has beneficial
      effects on myocardial efficiency,

      Design: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-center design. 36 patients
      with systolic heart failure will be randomized to either metformin (N = 18) or placebo (N=
      18) for 3 months.

      Methods: Patients will undergo echocardiography at rest and during exercise along with
      [11C]-acetate PET.

      Primary outcome parameter is changes in myocardial external efficiency from visit 1 to 3
      months of therapy.
