      axillary or inguinal lymph node dissection is eligible for inclusion of the study. A bipolar
      vessel sealing device (LigaSure, Covidien) will be used for dissection in all procedures. All
      patients will be scheduled for an outpatient visit with an experienced nurse three weeks
      after the surgery. Any deviation from the normal postoperative course will be recorded in the
      electronic patient journal. Complications are graded according to the Clavien-Dindo
      classification. Patients with complications or with suspected complications at the three-week
      follow up will be scheduled for new an outpatient visit. Patient demographics,
      clinicopathological characteristics of the primary melanoma, indication for the procedure,
      length of postoperative stay and early complications and treatment for complications will be
      collected for analysis
