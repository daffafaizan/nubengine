    
      The Atrial Fibrillation Ablation Registry (AFib Ablation Registry™) is designed to assess the
      prevalence, demographics, management, and outcomes of patients undergoing percutaneous
      catheter ablation procedures to treat atrial fibrillation (AF). Patient-level data will be
      submitted by participating hospitals on a quarterly basis to the American College of
      Cardiology Foundation's National Cardiovascular Data Registry (NCDR™). The primary aims of
      the AFib Ablation Registry are to optimize the outcomes and management of patients through
      the implementation of evidence-based guideline recommendations in clinical practice,
      facilitate efforts to improve the quality and safety for patients undergoing percutaneous
      catheter ablation procedures, investigate novel quality improvement methods and provide
      risk-adjusted assessment of patients for comparison with nationwide NCDR data. The secondary
      purpose of the AFib Ablation Registry is to serve as a rich source of clinical data to
      support assessments of short- and long-term safety, comparative and cost effectiveness
      research, and as a scalable data infrastructure for post market studies.
