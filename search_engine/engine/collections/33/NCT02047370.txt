      Asthma causes wheezing, chest tightness, shortness of breath, and coughing.

      A variety of manual therapies are commonly used to treat patients with asthma. There is a
      need to conduct studies in order to examine the effects of manual therapies on clinically
      relevant outcomes. Techniques aim to increase movement in the rib cage and the spine to try
      and improve the working of the lungs and circulation.
