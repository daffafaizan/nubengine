    
      This trial assesses the efficacy of two different weekly dosing regimens of Sym004 (Arm A: 12
      mg/kg/week versus Arm B: 9 mg/kg loading dose followed by 6 mg/kg/week) compared with
      investigator's choice in terms of overall survival time in subjects with mCRC. Subjects
      assigned to Arm C will receive best supportive care (BSC), Fluorouracil (5-FU), or
      Capecitabine, per local standard of care.

      Subjects will receive treatment until unacceptable toxicity, disease progression, withdrawal
      of consent, or until the subject meets any of the criteria for treatment discontinuation or
      trial discontinuation. Therefore, the duration of treatment will differ among individuals and
      cannot be fixed in advance.
