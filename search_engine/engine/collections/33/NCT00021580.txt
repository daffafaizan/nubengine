      transplant patients who have normal blood sugars and do not need insulin injections. Some of
      this group will have received a kidney transplant as well. All these patients will be studied
      in great detail along with other investigators in our islet cell program to understand better
      the mechanisms of efficacy and side effects of islet transplant and these new
      immunosuppressive drugs.
