      metabolic adverse effects associated with SGAPs (second generation antipsychotics) during 4
      visits over 12 weeks. Participants will also be evaluated at month 6, 9, and 12. This study
      does not involve treatment for participants. Treatment of subjects enrolled in this study
      will be determined by their clinician and will remain unaffected by participation in this
      observational minimal risk study.

      All participants were prescribed risperidone (Risperdal) for the duration of study
