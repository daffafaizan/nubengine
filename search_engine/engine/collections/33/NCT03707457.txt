    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE

      1. To determine safety of each of the following study agents, anti-GITR, IDO1 inhibitor, and
      ipilimumab, in combination with nivolumab (BMS-936558) flat dose in patients with first
      recurrence of GBM.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES

        1. To estimate toxicity

        2. To estimate progression-free survival

        3. To estimate overall survival

        4. To evaluate pain for patients undergoing the treatment of anti-GITR, IDO1 inhibitor, and
           ipilimumab, in combination with nivolumab.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES

        1. To characterize the immune response during and after treatment as measured by
           immunohistochemistry, and other T cells etc. in peripheral blood

        2. To characterize the pharmacodynamic and genomic activity in tumor tissue as target
           inhibition

        3. To characterize radiographic response

        4. Genetic characterization of correlative samples
