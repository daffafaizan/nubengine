           Bifidobacterium sp. between infants born by normal or caesarean delivery, fed with the
           test or a control product

      milk formulae.

      Number of patients (to be enrolled / to be analyzed): Approximately 450 / 240 Stratification
      will be done by gender and delivery mode.

      Description of subjects and main criteria for inclusion:
