      administered into the pleural space in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma. II.
      Determine the time to progression and overall survival in this patient population. III.
      Evaluate the quantitative and qualitative toxicity of intrapleural L-NDDP.

      OUTLINE: All patients undergo a thoracoscopy under general anesthesia. The thoracoscope is
      removed and any collected fluid is drained from the chest cavity. The first treatment with
      liposomal-cisplatin analogue (L-NDDP) is administered at this time into the intrapleural
      space over a 10 minute period. Subsequent 10 minute intrapleural infusions of L-NDDP through
      a percutaneous catheter are administered every 3 weeks. Treatment continues unless
      unacceptable toxic effects or disease progression occurs. Antitumor activity is assessed 2
      months after the second course of therapy, and every 2 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 2.5 years.
