      (miR-193a-3p) mimic destined for therapeutic intervention in oncology. Preclinical work
      showed that INT-1B3 has a multi-target mechanism of action with an anti-proliferative,
      anti-metastatic, anti-migration, cell cycle disruption, induction of apoptosis effect and
      modulation on the tumor microenvironment leading to significant induction of T cell-mediated
      immune response.

      The first part of the study (Phase I) is a dose-escalation phase to determine the maximal
      tolerated dose and the recommended Phase 2 dose, as well as the safety profile of INT-1B3 in
      patients with advanced malignancies.The subsequent expansion phase of the study (Phase Ib)
      will further explore safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamic responses, and antitumor
      activity of INT-1B3 in patients with selected cancer types treated at the recommended phase 2
      dose.
