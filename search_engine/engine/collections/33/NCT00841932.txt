      procedure can safely be performed without anticoagulation, thereby lowering the associated
      procedural risks by avoiding the bleeding and groin complications that may occur with
      anticoagulation. Performing FFR without anticoagulation may also decrease facility costs as
      femoral artery closure can be performed using standard protocols for a diagnostic procedure,
      instead of standard protocols for an interventional procedure when a patient has been
      anticoagulated. Performing FFR without anticoagulation does not increase risk of injury to
      the coronary artery or thrombus in the coronary artery.
