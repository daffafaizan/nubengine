    
      Patients and methods: women with low risk single pregnancy will be studied. Fetuses with
      multiple pregnancies, maternal chronic disease and severe congenital anomalies except mega
      cisterna magna (MCM) will be excluded from the study. Measurements will be performed on the
      axial cerebellar plane.The anteroposterior measurement will be made between the posterior
      border of the cerebellar vermis and the internal face of the occipital bone.

      The primary outcome variables will be cisterna magna length measured on different angles
      between the transducer and the axial cerebellar plane of the fetal head.

      Cisterna magna length measurement related to fetal presentation and gender will be secondary
      outcomes.
