      neuro-physiotherapy practice and community exercise programme.Gait analysis will be used to
      look at several gait parameters through the use of a three-dimensional visual analysis system
      based in our Biomechanics Lab at the University of Winchester. Participants will attend
      testing one testing session of approximately 1 hour. During this testing session functional
      measures and walking trials will be assessed. Participants will first be asked to complete a
      set of simple movements that will contribute towards Fugl Meyer questionnaire. Twenty eight
      reflective markers will then be attached to specified joints and segments of the body, such
      as the thigh, with double sided sticky tape to allow for data collection through the camera
      system to collect kinematic data. The belt mounted accelerometer (G-Walk) will be positioned
      around the waist over the L5 vertebrae. Participants will be asked to perform 6 walking
      trials of 10m to collect 3D kinematic and accelerometer gait data.
