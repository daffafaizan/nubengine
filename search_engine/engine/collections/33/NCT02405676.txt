      Stage II, 75.8% ± 4.4% for Stage III, 56.3% ± 13.5% for Stage IV, and 36.4% ± 14.5% for B-AL,
      respectively. To improve survival for pediatric patients with B-NHL/B-AL, the investigators
      launched a new study in China. Compared with our previous treatment regimens (CCCG-2010),
      patients with stage III and LDH>4 times NL, any stage IV or B-AL were stratified into R4. The
      dose of methotrexate was increased to 5000mg/m2 for patients in R3 or R4 (previously
      3000mg/m2). Four injections of rituximab was added to the chemotherapy for patients in R4.
      Our aim is to test whether adding rituximab or high dose of methotrexate (5000mg/m2) would
      improving 2-year EFS for patients in advanced groups.
