      mesothelioma (MM) patients. However, there is evidence that MM patients may benefit from
      immunotherapeutic agents.

      Clinical studies examining CTLA-4 blockade are providing convincing evidences on the
      immunobiological effects and on the clinical activity of this new class of immunomodulating
      therapeutic agents, likely due to their ability to stimulate patients'immune system to more
      effectively attack tumor cells by blocking a negative regulatory signal.

      Tremelimumab is a fully human anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody (mAb), developed as an IgG2
      isotype to minimize complement activation and reduce the risk of cytokine storm. As a single
      agent, Tremelimumab can induce durable tumor regression in 7-10% of patients with advanced
      melanoma. Tremelimumab has been tested in several clinical trials as single-agent or in
      combination with other agents in different solid tumors.

      The evidences above unveil a strong immunologic potential of treatment with Tremelimumab also
      in MM patients.
