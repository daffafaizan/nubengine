      sexual assault that includes situation-specific mechanisms and key moderators of sexual
      violence. Specifically, hypotheses will be tested in the context of two carefully controlled
      laboratory studies. In Study 1, laboratory alcohol administration procedures will be used to
      manipulate intoxication (vs. placebo control) in men. Impaired attention and objectification
      will then be measured multi-modally including behavioral, self-report, and implicit measures.
      Finally, sexual aggression will be measured with a laboratory-based analogue of sexual
      assault. Study 2 will include women and follow the same alcohol administration procedures as
      Study 1. Additionally, mirroring men's objectification, objectifying gazes (vs. eye gazes)
      will also be manipulated. Impaired attention, self-objectification, and decreased sexual risk
      perceptions will then be assessed. Prior the laboratory visit, all participants will complete
      a battery of questionnaires to assess key moderators including a history of sexual assault
      perpetration and victimization, prior sexual objectification and self-objectification, as
      well as alcohol-related sex expectances and rape myth acceptance. The overall model will be
      analyzed within a conditional process model framework.
