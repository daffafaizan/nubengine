    
      The EarlySense Home Care System developed by EarlySense, Ltd., is a contact-less
      tele-monitoring system. The system is intended for continuous monitoring of patients'
      respiration rate, heart rate and patient's motion.

      The system, which monitors the patient while in bed, consists of a piezoelectric sensor that
      produces an electrical signal in response to physiological stimulation, and a microprocessor
      control unit that analyzes the recorded signal and identifies respiratory and heart rates and
      patient motion, while patient is in bed,. In addition, the system indicates patient's in or
      out of bed status. The system also provides alerts if either of the physiological parameters
      cross predefined threshold settings (e.g., high/ low heart rate or respiratory rate, or
      motion or time in bed).

      The system saves patient's parameters and then flags the patients, as those to have changes
      in their vital signs and motion, or those that do not have noteworthy changes during recent
      hours of monitoring. Flagging of the patients are based on changes detected in patients'
      baseline vital signs (heart and respiratory rates and patterns) and well as recognition of
      changes in patients motion and in and out of bed status in comparison to set thresholds.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate relevance of the information (vital sign trends, alerts
      and flags) as provided by the EarlySense Home Care Tele-monitoring system to medical staff in
      Sheba Medical Center's Heart Rehabilitation Institute (Shelev) in order proactively monitor
      patients at home. The correlation between the EarlySense system alerts and flags to patient
      deterioration and hospital readmission will be studied.
