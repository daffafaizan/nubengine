      associated with chronic anovulation, hyperandrogenism and insulin resistance. The central
      importance of insulin resistance in the pathogenesis of the syndrome has been established by
      several in vivo and in vitro studies. No data are available for the best therapeutical
      approach for metabolic dysfunction of PCOS. The new guidelines for the management of
      metabolic risk in PCOS strongly recommended that overweight/obese women with PCOS should lose
      weight changing their lifestyle. Although calorie-restricted diets are currently recommended
      to reach the healthy weight, there are still unsatisfied data regarding the best dietetic
      regimen that should be suggested.

      In this study, our purpose is to compare two nutritional protocols in order to find the best
      dietetic approach for improving clinical, metabolic and hormonal outcomes in pcos women.
