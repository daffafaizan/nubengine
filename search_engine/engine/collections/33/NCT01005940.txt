      trial. OSA patients who are unable to tolerate CPAP or refuse CPAP(Continuous positive airway
      pressure) (and who are deemed appropriate by their attending physician for dental device
      treatment of OSA will be randomized to a control group (no MAD treatment) or to active MAD
      therapy.

      Epidemiologic studies suggest that OSA is associated with insulin resistance independent of
      other known risk factors such as obesity. The cyclic intermittent hypoxia in OSA is the
      primary stimulus that leads to insulin resistance, a primary risk factor for the development
      of type 2 diabetes. There is an association between the level of hypoxic stress in OSA and
      insulin resistance.

      The overall hypothesis to be tested is that treatment of OSA with MAD will improve insulin
      sensitivity, increase levels of HMW (High-molecular- weight) adiponectin, and improve
      psychological adjustment.
