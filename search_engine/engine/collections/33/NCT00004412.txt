    
      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to one of
      two treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive arginine butyrate IV over 6-9 hours at night 5
      days a week for 12 weeks, plus concurrent standard local therapy consisting of cleaning,
      saline irrigation, and dressing changes as prescribed by each patient's physician. Patients
      who experience progressive healing receive arginine butyrate 3-4 times a week. Arginine
      butyrate treatment may be discontinued and reinstated following a single 2 week medical
      complication.

      Arm II: Patients receive standard local therapy alone for 12 weeks. Patients randomized to
      arm II may cross over to receive arginine butyrate if no or less than 25% healing is observed
      after 12 weeks.

      Patients whose ulcers have closed by at least 15% per cycle may receive 2 additional 8-week
      cycles of arginine butyrate therapy and are followed for 2 months after healing is completed.
