      long-term clinical outcome scores and radiographic evidence of osteoarthritis . In situ
      fixation of higher-grade SCFE has a low surgical risk and has been advocated by authors who
      believe the deformed hip has the potential to remodel with some restoration of the disturbed
      anatomic axes ; however, the remodeling potential remains controversial . Despite remodeling,
      the head-neck offset will remain abnormal . This is the cause of potential impingement of the
      femoral neck with the acetabular cartilage . Impingement in SCFE has been associated with
      damage of the acetabular cartilage, which may explain the early onset of osteoarthritis after
      SCFE .

      Ganz et al. described a technique of surgical dislocation of hip involving trochanteric flip
      osteotomy and anterior capsulotomy preserving the blood supply to femoral head. The technique
      is based on extensive study of blood supply to the proximal femur. This technique allows us
      to completely dislocate the joint which allows complete access to intra articular pathology
      and allow reduction of the slipped capital femoral epiphysis .
