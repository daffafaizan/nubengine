      mortality. Neonatal early onset sepsis (EOS) diagnosis is difficult due to lack of sensivity
      and specificity markers. Diagnosis is difficults due to lack of sensivity and specificity
      markers. The investigators conduced a restrospectif study to all term born infants born
      between 1 january and 31 December 2013 and hospitalized for suspect EOS.The objective of the
      study was to identify early clinical signs in newborn infants with suspected neonatal sepsis
      to differentiate a likely infection with pathogen bacteria in the gastric suction culture.The
      presence of neonatal symptoms at birth appears to be a useful clinical marker of probable
      neonatal EOS.
