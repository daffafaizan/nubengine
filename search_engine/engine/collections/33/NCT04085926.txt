    
      Data for the primary outcome of 112 participants are needed but the aim is to recruit 150, if
      possible within a reasonable time frame, to take drop-out into account.

      Participants are randomized (blocked randomization, stratified for ulcer site and study
      center) to either treatment with a sealed therapeutic shoe or total contact cast.

      Each participant will be assessed by a cast technician during the treatment period (for ulcer
      healing and skin complications) and be assessed by a physiotherapist on five occasions: at
      baseline, approximately 4 weeks into treatment and 1, 6 and 12 months after treatment end. On
      these occasions the physiotherapist will perform different tests (gait, balance, ankle
      strength and flexibility, bone mass density in heel bone, etc) and participants will answer
      questionnaires and have their physical activity measured for 7 days with an activity monitor.
