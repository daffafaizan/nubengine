    
      Prospective randomized cross over study including all consecutive ventilated patient with
      predicted duration of ventilation > 48 hours, inspired oxygen fraction < 60% and without
      neuromuscular blocking agent.

      Patient were randomized to be ventilated with full closed-loop control or conventional
      ventilation 30 minutes before the first nursing period after inclusion. The ventilator was
      switched in the other mode (conventional or full closed-loop respectively), 30 minutes before
      the following nursing period. Between this two consecutive nursing periods, ventilation mode
      is choosed by the attending physician.

      The primary outcome was the oxygenation measured by pulse oxymetry during the nursing
      periods.
