      this treatment is only effective in 30-45% of patients. Importantly, treatment of ischemic
      stroke is more effective when given within 90 minutes of stroke onset. Means of treating
      patients earlier with more effective therapies are needed.

      Ischemic stroke is a major public health problem, for which effective and accessible drug
      therapies remain limited. Current management of acute ischemic stroke includes treatment with
      a solution called alteplase, which dissolves clots in a cerebral artery. The treatment effect
      of alteplase is much greater if given within 90 minutes of stroke onset.

      As a result, there has been a significant push to take stroke care to the patient in the form
      of the Mobile Stroke Unit (MSU). The MSU is the first designed as a CT-capable ambulance that
      allows assessment and treatment of stroke patients in the pre-hospital setting. In the
      proposed research project, we will undertake a clinical trail investigating the effectiveness
      of a new thrombolytic agent in the MSU, tenecteplase.

      Tenecteplase has been shown to be significantly more effective at improving stroke survivor's
      recovery and opening blocked blood vessels than alteplase in the hospital setting. However,
      it is unknown if earlier administration of tenecteplase is more effective than early
      administration of alteplase.

      The tested agent, tenecteplase, is cheaper, easier to administer (no time-consuming infusions
      required) and more practical for an ambulance delivered therapy than the current standard of
      care alteplase. If tenecteplase results in better clinical outcomes in addition to these
      practical advantages, there is significant scope for improved patient outcomes and cost
      savings.
