    
      This is an open-label, single-center, non-randomized, single-arm, pilot imaging study to
      determine the pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, and tumor targeting of an indium-111
      (111In)-labeled, humanized anti-MUC1 antibody, designated hPAM4 IgG1 in patients with known
      pancreatic cancer. The primary objective of this trial is to examine how changing the protein
      dose will affect these parameters with the intent to determine if a single protein dose can
      be selected to optimize tumor targeting. It is expected that these data will aid in the
      selection of an appropriate protein dose to be used in a Phase I therapy trial with
      yttrium-90 (90Y)-labeled hPAM4 IgG. The secondary objective is to monitor safety.

      Pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, tumor targeting, and dosimetry (modeling for 90Y) will be
      assessed against clinical parameters, such as pre-study PAM4-reactive MUC-1 antigen in the
      serum, tumor size, location, histopathology, immunohistology, and if possible, antigen
      content by extraction of tumor sample.
