      vardenafil (Levitra®, Bayer) and tadalafil (Cialis®, Lilly), have been marketed for the
      treatment of ED. Many considerations should be taken before patients are prescribed with PDE5
      inhibitor medications, which may cause systemic side effects and should not be taken with
      nitrates or alpha-blockers.

      The active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) of TR399 is 5% Vardenafil HCl·3H2O. Non-clinical
      studies have shown that the topical use of TR399 can enhance erection and sexual behavior in
      animal models without causing irritancy and phototoxicity.

      This study is designed as a single-arm and open-label fashion in order to explore the safety
      and PK of TR399 in healthy volunteers, as well as the safety, PK and efficacy of TR399 in
      patients with ED.
