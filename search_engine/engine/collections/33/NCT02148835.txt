    
      Randomized, placebo-controlled, mono-center comparison of two matching groups of sausages
      (active vs. control). The study will be conducted according to Good Clinical Practice.
      Randomization will be computer-generated by the sponsor. Sealed envelopes will be provided to
      the Investigator bearing individual randomization numbers, containing individual
      randomization results. Thus, in case of need, one sealed envelope can be opened to learn the
      randomization result of one patient without overall unblinding.

      Study participants will be requested to ingest approx. 80 g / day of the experimental
      sausages during the day at a time of their convenience. Study participants will be provided
      with the investigational product free of charge. If necessary, the investigational product
      will be shipped to study participants. Study participants will receive the exact amount of
      sausages to complete the study.
