      lower lung function characterized by an obstruction to airflow. COPD is an umbrella term for
      two disease processes: chronic bronchitis and emphysema. It is currently the 4th leading
      cause of death in the United States. Approximately 14 million Americans are known to suffer
      from COPD; however, it is estimated that as many as 24 million Americans may have some form
      of one or both of the diseases (Centers for Disease Control, 2011). The primary risk factor
      for developing COPD is cigarette smoking; other factors include exposure to air pollution,
      occupational dusts and chemicals, and lower socioeconomic status. Poverty has been identified
      as a risk factor for COPD but the aspects related to poverty that increase the risk of COPD
      are unclear (GOLD, 2011). Lower education level and household income has been noted to relate
      to increased severity of COPD (Eisner, Blanc, Omachi, Yelin, Sidney, Katz, et al, 2011). An
      American Lung Association survey found that over half of those diagnosed with COPD reported
      that their condition limits their ability to perform activities of daily living, including
      activities in the home (American Lung Association, 2009). As air pollution can lead to an
      exacerbation of COPD symptoms and precipitate emergency room visits and hospitalization,
      minimizing pollution in indoor air may be a key component of disease management and
      decreasing health care costs.
