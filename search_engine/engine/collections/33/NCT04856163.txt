      evidence on the impact of telelactation on breastfeeding duration and exclusivity and explore
      differences in effectiveness by race/ethnicity. The study is mixed methods, and uses a
      sequential explanatory design in which qualitative interviews are used to explain and
      contextualize findings from the quantitative outcomes analysis. We will recruit 2400
      primiparous, pregnant individuals age > 18 who intend to breastfeed and live in states most
      underserved by IBCLCs. Recruitment will occur via Ovia, a pregnancy tracker mobile phone
      application (app) used by one million pregnant individuals in the U.S. annually. Participants
      will be randomized to: 1) on-demand telelactation video calls on personal devices or 2) ebook
      on infant care/usual care. Breastfeeding outcomes will be captured via surveys and interviews
      and compared across racial and ethnic groups. This study will track participants for eight
      months (including six months postpartum), generating 1) quantitative data on the impact of
      telelactation and differences in effectiveness across racial and ethnic minority groups; and
      2) rich qualitative data on the experiences of different subgroups of parents with the
      intervention, including barriers to use, satisfaction, and strengths and limitations of this
      delivery model.
