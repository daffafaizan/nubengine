      12 weeks (from randomization) plus 30 days of safety follow-up.

      The study has three phases: screening phase (=wash-out period, if required), treatment phase
      and safety follow-up phase.

      Eligible patients will be randomized to either receive glycopyrronium or indacaterol maleate
      and glycopyrronium bromide fixed dose combination or to remain in their baseline therapy, in
      an allocation ratio of 3:1 for each cluster (Groups A, B, C, and D), based on their COPD
      symptoms and baseline treatment:

      Group A: Patients treated with any SABA ( Short-acting β2-adrenergic agonist) and/or SAMA
      (Short-acting muscarinic antagonist) as monotherapy or in free or fixed dose combination
      (FDC) will be assigned to glycopyrronium or will remain in their baseline therapy (3:1) Group
      B: Patients treated with any LABA (Long-acting β2-adrenergic agonist) or LAMA (Long-acting
      muscarinic antagonist) monotherapy and mMRC score =1 point will be assigned to glycopyrronium
      or will remain in their baseline therapy (3:1) Group C: Patients treated with any LABA and
      ICS (Inhaled corticosteroid) in free or FDC will be assigned to indacaterol maleate and
      glycopyrronium bromide fixed dose combination or will remain in their baseline therapy (3:1)
      Group D: Patients treated with any LABA or LAMA monotherapy and mMRC score >1 point will be
      assigned to indacaterol maleate and glycopyrronium bromide fixed dose combination or will
      remain in their baseline therapy (3:1) Due to low recruitment in Groups A and B that would
      lead to a significant delay of trial completion, a protocol amendment was made in order to
      close the recruitment of Groups A and B at the time the randomization in Groups C and D would
      be completed. Recruitment of the Groups C and D continued as originally planned
