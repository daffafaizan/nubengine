      There are many studies that associate vitamin D serum levels in older persons with muscle
      strength, physical performance and risk of fractures and falls. However, current evidence is
      insufficient to make a general recommendation for administrating calcium and vitamin D to
      older persons. The objective of this study is to determine the effectiveness of calcium and
      vitamin D supplementation in improving musculoskeletal function and decreasing the number of
      falls in person aged over 65 years.

      Design:

      Phase III, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of
      already marketed drugs in a new indication. It will be performed at Primary Care doctor
      visits at several Healthcare Centers in different Spanish Health Areas. A total of 704
      non-institutionalized subjects aged 65 years or older will be studied (sample size calculated
      for a statistical power of 80%, alpha error 0.05, annual incidence of falls 30% and expected
      reduction of 30% to 20% and expected loss to follow up of 20%). The test drug containing 800
      IU of vitamin D and 1000 mg of calcium will be administered daily. The control group will
      receive a placebo. The subjects will be followed up over two years. The primary variable will
      be the incidence of spontaneous falls. The secondary variables will include: consequences of
      the falls (fractures, need for hospitalization), change in calcidiol plasma levels and other
      analytical determinations (transaminases, PTH, calcium/phosphorous, albumin, creatinine,
      etc.), change in bone mass by densitometry, change in muscle strength in the dominant hand
      and change in musculoskeletal strength, risk factors for falls, treatment compliance, adverse
      effects and socio-demographic data.
