      reserve because of follicle loss, removal of endometriomas has been associated with poorer
      performance in IVF procedures, and decreased ovarian volumes have also been reported after
      surgery.Ovarian reserve is defined as the functional potential of the ovary which reflects
      the number and quality of the follicles left in the ovary, and is well-correlated with the
      response to ovarian stimulation using exogenous gonadotrophin. Over the years, various tests
      and markers of ovarian reserve have been reported; the static tests include serum markers,
      such as basal FSH, inhibin-B and anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH), and ultrasonographic markers,
      such as ovarian volume and antral follicle count.This study will include 122 patients aged
      between 18 and 35 years who have been diagnosed with endometrioma (unilateral or bilateral)
      and they are candidates for laparoscopic surgery. They will be selected according to
      inclusion and exclusion criteria.they will be randomized into two study groups, one study
      group will undergo laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy, the other study group will undergo
      laparoscopic cyst deroofing.AMH,AFC and ovarian volume will be measured pre-operative and
      post-operative.
