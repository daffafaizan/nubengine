      intraoperative neuromonitoring (NIM 3.0 Nerve Monitoring Systeme (Medtronic Xomed,
      Jacksonville, FL, USA) ) for various diseases. In all patients, each side of the neck
      operated was considered as a separate entity in our study.

      EMG recordings were accomplished with a pair of needle electrodes inserted into the CP and
      mid-portion of the CT muscle that is located on the superior side of the RLN, which were
      plugged into the third and fourth channels of interface-connector box, respectively, at the
      end of the thyroidectomy or lobectomy. The investigators evaluated the innervation pattern of
      the CT muscle in an other study. Therefore the EBSLN is the main supplier of the CT muscle,
      the EMG findings of the CT muscle were used to confirm it, in this study.

      EBSLN, pharyngeal plexus (PP), RLN and vagus nerve were stimulated with a monopolar
      stimulator probe at 1 mA. While stimulating these nerves, the ipsilateral CP muscle was
      visually observed for possible contractions and electromyographic recordings were obtained
      with the 4-channel NIM 3.0 Nerve Monitoring System.
