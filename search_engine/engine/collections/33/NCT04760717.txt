    
      This is a pragmatic, randomized, open-label, blinded-endpoint trial comparing
      spironolactone-containing antihypertensive regimens versus standard antihypertensive regimens
      based on the 2017 AHA/ACC guidelines in intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) survivors.

      This study will randomize a total of 200 patients, 100 of each white and non-white patients,
      between 3 weeks to 6 months after ICH to an antihypertensive regimen with spironolactone once
      daily or standard BP control based on the 2017 AHA/ACC guidelines for 1 year.

      Participants will undergo baseline testing for neurohormonal levels and will be followed for
      12 months with regular assessment of home BP readings. The primary outcome of home systolic
      BP will be measured at 3 months.
