      health status. The SHSQ-25 includes 25 questions. The score of the SHSQ-25 is from 0 to 100.
      Suboptimal health status is defined as the SHSQ-25 score above than 35. The higher scores of
      the SHSQ-25 one gets, the more severity of suboptimal health status he/she has. All
      participants are asked to fill in the SHSQ-25 before and after the intervention. If the score
      decreases after the intervention, it means that the suboptimal health status has been
      improved.
