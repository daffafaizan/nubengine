      lengths of time, can be rendered inadequate for viral suppression by the emergence of drug
      resistant virus, which can include resistance to entire mechanistic classes of drugs. Thus,
      there exists a significant unmet medical need for new highly potent antiretroviral agents
      with novel mechanisms of action. The novel mechanism of action of MPC-4326 suggests that
      MPC-4326 may have utility for the treatment of HIV-1 infected patients failing current
      regimens due to the development of drug resistance.
