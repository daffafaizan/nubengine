      their daily life and which impact spina bifida has on their choices of life. This will be
      done by a survey that will ask questions about different domains in life: demographic
      variables, education, work, social functioning, spare time, housing, mobility, independency
      and quality of life. The survey is based on empirical findings in literature. The quality of
      life questioning is based on the SF36. The survey will be done once during a clinical
      consultation.
