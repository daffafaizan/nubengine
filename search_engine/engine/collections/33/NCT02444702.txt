      seriously suffer from chronic low back pain (CLBP) with referred pain to the legs who are
      likely to respond to certain interventions has become a research priority in the medical
      milieu in general and in physical therapy in particularly.While several classifications have
      been developed to predict success following physical therapy interventions, some have
      methodological flaws and no clinical prediction rules have been created for patients with
      CLBP with degenerative changes of the lumbar spine and referred pain to the legs who are
      likely to require surgery and have successful outcome post-surgery. CLBP is multifactorial
      and morphological findings such as degenerative changes of the lumbar spine may not explain
      the phenomenon in full. The international classification of functioning, disability and
      health allows for a comprehensive description of the patient as a whole and can be used to
      classify patients according to their anatomy, pathology, impairments and capacity One-hundred
      and fifty patients who suffer from CLBP with degenerative conditions of the lumbar spine and
      referred pain to the legs and are candidates for lumbar decompression/fusion surgery will be
      recruited from a physician office at the Meir medical center, department of orthopaedic
      surgery, "Kfar-Saba", Israel. The structure and pathology of their lumbar spine will be
      analyzed in detail from CT and MRI imaging (morphological measurements of their vertebra and
      the intervertebral discs). Another one-hundred and fifty CT and MRI imaging of non
      symptomatic low back group will be taken from the "Meir medical center" in order to
      characterize the symptomatic group and their degenerative changes.
