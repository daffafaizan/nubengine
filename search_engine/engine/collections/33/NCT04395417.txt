      non-inflammatory conditions characterized by collagen degeneration, fibroblast proliferation,
      mucoid degeneration and neovascularization Biological-based treatments can trigger the
      release of cytokines and growth factors from platelets, leukocytes, macrophages and other
      inflammatory cells. These growth factors support neovascularization and the chemotaxis of
      fibroblasts and tenocytes. It stimulates proliferation and collagen remodeling of fibroblasts
      and tenocytes.

      PrT involves multiple injections of a small amount of irritant or sclerosing solution. Common
      irritants include hypertonic dextrose, phenol-glycerin-glucose and sodium morrhuate. PrT
      injection mechanism is as follows; while hypertonic dextrose causes cell rupture through
      osmosis, monosodium morrhuate attracts inflammatory mediators and improves blood flow of the
      diseased tendon.Previous studies have shown benefit of PrT in the treatment of tendinopathies
      HA injection is a treatment method that increases the ability of sliding with its
      viscoelastic properties, reduces tendon surface friction and accelerates regeneration. In
      vitro models suggest that HA can increase collagen I production and accumulation with a
      dose-dependent positive collagen I / collagen III ratio. However, controlled randomised
      studies are still needed.

      Mechanism of action of both PrT and HA is cell proliferation and the healing process of
      tendons, this study was conducted to compare the effect of PrT and HA in chronic lateral
      epicondylitis .
