      are gestational age > 33 weeks and birth weight > 1800 grams, uncomplicated neonatal
      jaundice. The infants should be treated with phototherapy in a cradle for 24 hours, which is
      routine standard of care. Exclusion criteria is haemolytic disease. Total serum bilirubin
      (TSB) is measured before and after 24 hours of phototherapy. The infants are enrolled and
      randomised consecutively by the neonatologist using sealed and opaque envelopes.

      Power calculation based on expected difference in decrease of TSB of 6% between the two
      groups and a significance level of 0.05, showed that 48 infants should be enrolled in each
      group.
