    
      This study is being carried out to see if the drugs MEDI4736, Savolitinib and Tremelimumab
      can be used alone or in combination to reduce the size of tumours in patients with kidney
      cancer.

      The drugs being tested in this study have an anti-tumour effect and have been tested in
      pre-clinical and human studies before. MEDI4736 and tremelimumab work with the immune system
      to help the body fight against tumour cells with immune cells. Savolitinib works to correct a
      faulty signal which causes tumour growth.
