    
      Patients requiring a single implant, presenting severe facial bone loss as a result of
      previous infection, failed socket grafting or trauma, will enter this cross-sectional study.
      Socket reconstruction and simultaneous implant placement will be performed through
      periosteal-guided bone regeneration (PGBR). Implant timing: immediate or delayed. Implants
      will be encased in a customized shield of autogenous cortical bone harvested from an adjacent
      site. A re-entry surgery will be performed at 12-17-weeks to evaluate bone regeneration.
      Peri-implant tissues will be assessed following established success criteria. Implants will
      be evaluated for the presence of Periimplantitis.
