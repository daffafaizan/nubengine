    
      Objectives To investigate the 24 h effects of bimatoprost 0.01% monotherapy on intraocular
      pressure (IOP) and ocular perfusion pressure (OPP).

      Design Prospective, open-label experimental study.

      Setting Single tertiary ophthalmic clinic.

      Participants Sixteen patients with diagnosed primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) or ocular
      hypertension (ages, 49-77 years).

      Interventions Baseline data of 24 h IOP in untreated patients were collected in a sleep
      laboratory. Measurements of IOP were taken using a pneumatonometer every 2 h in the sitting
      and supine body positions during the 16 h diurnal/wake period and in the supine position
      during the 8 h nocturnal/sleep period. After baseline measurements were taken, patients were
      treated with bimatoprost 0.01% one time per day at bedtime for 4 weeks, and then 24 h IOP
      data were collected under the same laboratory conditions.

      Primary outcome measure of nocturnal IOP mean under bimatoprost 0.01% treatment was compared
      with baseline.
