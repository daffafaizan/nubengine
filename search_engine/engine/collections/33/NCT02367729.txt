      system. It is thought to carry signals of discomfort and nausea to the brain where it is
      interpreted. The autonomic nervous system may be in imbalance in patients with functional
      gastrointestinal disorders. By stimulating a branch of the vagus nerve in the outer ear, this
      study aims to improve symptoms and quality of life in adolescents with functional abdominal
      pain with or without nausea.

      Subjects will be randomized into two groups: 1) neurostimulation versus 2) sham. They will
      receive either an active or non-active (sham group) device for 5 days each week x 4 weeks
      total. Pain, nausea, anxiety, quality of life, potential side effects and overall symptom
      improvement will be monitored weekly for the entire study as well as after the study is
      completed.
