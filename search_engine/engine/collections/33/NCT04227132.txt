      deficit of spatial attention orienting that causes unawareness for stimuli located in the
      left hemispace. Recent data show that the execution of concurrent tasks (that is,
      multitasking) can worsen the clinical condition and impact functional recovery.

      The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of an adaptive computer game "Labyrinth"
      previously validated on health population. The videogame is designed for training both
      attention and execution functions as it engages spatial navigation and multitasking. The
      effect of the computer game will be compared to standard computerized exercises used for
      neglect rehabilitation.

      The investigators plan to administer to a sample of 30 stroke patients with SN both Labyrinth
      and standard trainings for 10 sessions each. The two trainings will be delivered in a
      randomized crossover design. Improvements of patients' performance will be registered across
      trainings and in a follow-up test at 1 month, by assessing the severity of SN and functional
      everyday outcomes. The investigators expect that patients' performance will improve following
      both types of training, but with stronger improvement for the adaptive videogame.
