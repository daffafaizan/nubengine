      Secretory Leukocyte Protease Inhibitor (SLPI) peptide as a treatment for impaired wound
      healing states in 60-80 year old subjects who are at greatest risk of delayed wound healing.
      Administration of the drug topically should result in reduced elastase activity and
      inflammation, leading to accelerated matrix deposition and wound healing. Subjects will be
      randomly allocated to one of four possible groups: topical administration of SLPI or placebo
      (wounds excised at day 7 post-wounding) or topical administration of SLPI or placebo (wounds
      excised at day 50 post-wounding). The dose of SLPI will be determined in a dose-finding pilot
      study prior to the main study. Initial 4mm punch biopsies will be made in both upper inner
      arms (two per arm), followed by topical administration of SLPI or placebo. The wounds will be
      left to heal and all four wounds excised at either day 7 (for 50% of the volunteers) or day
      50 post-wounding (for the other 50% of volunteers). The incidence of side-effects, and the
      rate of healing will be determined at these time-points. Successful demonstration of an
      enhanced therapeutic effect may provide a basis for the development of strategies to
      accelerate wound healing in those situations where it is comprised, such as with age and in
      chronic non-healing wounds.
