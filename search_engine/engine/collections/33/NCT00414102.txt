      Daytime symptoms of insomnia include tiredness, lack of energy, difficulty concentrating, and
      irritability. Recent epidemiologic research focusing on the quality of life has identified
      significant insomnia-related conditions that relate to work productivity, health care
      utilization, and risk of depression. Insomnia is associated with diminished work output,
      absenteeism, and greater rates of accidents.

      Ramelteon is marketed for the treatment of insomnia characterized by difficulty with sleep
      onset under the brand name of Rozeremâ„¢.

      This study will be comprised of two groups of subjects, 1) an outpatient group and 2) an
      inpatient group. The inpatient group will be used as reference arm as previously conducted
      studies in the sleep laboratory setting. Study participation is anticipated to be about 50
      days (approximately 1.75 months).
