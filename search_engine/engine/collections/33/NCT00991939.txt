      been recognized that this disorder was responsive to corticosteroid therapy. As
      corticosteroids are easily obtainable and inexpensive, they have become the standard
      first-line therapy for adult patients with newly-diagnosed ITP. Generally, patients are
      treated with prednisone at a dose of approximately 1 mg/kg, or 60 mg/day, and once a response
      is obtained the daily dosage is gradually tapered. While approximately 70% of patients
      treated in this manner respond initially, most will relapse as the corticosteroid dose is
      lowered; ultimately only 15-20% of patients achieve a complete or partial remission of their
      ITP at an "acceptable" dose of prednisone. Recently, several studies have suggested that the
      use of high dose corticosteroids, specifically pulse dexamethasone, may be a more efficacious
      initial therapy for ITP, capable of causing a higher initial response rate and a
      significantly longer duration of remission despite a shorter course of initial therapy.

      This study will compare treatment with 3 courses of high-dose dexamethasone versus treatment
      with prednisone, for patients recently diagnosed with immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP).
      The primary hypothesis is that patients treated with high-dose dexamethasone will obtain a
      more durable remission than patients treated with standard oral corticosteroids. This may
      reflect the ability of high dose corticosteroids to eradicate a sensitive pathogenic lymphoid
      clone that may be transiently susceptible to aggressive immunosuppressive therapy early in
      the course of disease.
