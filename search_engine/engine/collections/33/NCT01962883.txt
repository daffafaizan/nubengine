      efficacy of osteopathic treatment on vestibular symptoms of the post concussed vestibular
      disturbed athlete as determined by the Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI) and the Balance
      Error Scoring System (BESS). Of secondary interest, this study will evaluate the osteopathic
      assessment findings of this population and side effects, positive and negative, associated
      with the osteopathic treatment provided.

      The study will focus on Athletes between the ages of 18-40 who have received a concussion and
      continue to suffer the sequela of symptoms, including vestibular disturbances, a minimum of
      1-month and maximum of 1-year post concussion. A sports medicine physician will screen
      potential participants for inclusion and exclusion criteria and referred to the project as
      appropriate.

      All subjects will receive an initial osteopathic evaluation and baseline BESS and DHI. There
      will be a total of 7 balance tests performed each week for the first 5 weeks and then the
      final at the 8-week mark. Dizziness inventories will be completed daily for the duration of
      the 8-week project. The control group will receive the standard of care, rest, whereas the
      experimental group will receive four osteopathic treatments in addition to rest. The
      experimental group, in addition to completing BESS testing and DHI forms will also account
      for any side effects associated with osteopathic treatments daily following treatments.
