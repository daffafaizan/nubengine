      required for normal functions, but may confer health benefits such as antioxidant actions.
      One can live without phytochemicals, but one may live longer and better with them. The
      phytochemicals in tea have been proposed to inhibit cancer onset via several different
      mechanisms. An obvious question is: Can anti-cancer actions of green tea be duplicated by
      black tea, which in the USA, is consumed more than green tea? The question remains
      unanswered, and will not be addressed by this project since many questions about green tea
      have not been answered yet. The contents of both type teas overlap in flavonoids, but green
      tea has more of the agents thought to be most effective. For example, some of the research
      cited below uses the flavonoid epigallocatechin gallate. Green tea has 5 times more of this
      flavonoid than black tea.

      This study has two purposes. First, a case will be made that green tea may have several
      anti-cancer mechanisms, but this contention is not well confirmed by human intervention
      studies. This case will be made by addressing four questions. Second, justification will be
      given for the choice of mechanisms to be examined in this project's human intervention.
