      microenvironment. The platelet rich plasma (PRP) can improve the repair ability, however, the
      requirement for wound bed preparation is strict, or treatment failure may occur. Umbilical
      cord blood mononuclear cells (MNC) may provide a better repair environment through paracrine
      action. This study aims to investigate the role of MNC in refractory diabetic foot ulcer by
      comparing the combination of PRP and MNC with PRP alone.
