    
      This is a prospective, non-randomized, open label, single-arm multi-center study assessing
      the performance and safety of the V-Wave inter-atrial unidirectional shunt when implanted in
      chronic heart failure patients with both reduced and preserved ejection fraction.

      The V-Wave Interatrial Unidirectional Shunt is designed to enable blood flow in a controlled
      manner from the left atrium to the right atrium in heart failure patients where clinical
      sequelae such as symptomatic pulmonary congestion due to high left atrial filling pressure is
      common.

      The objective of this study, is to assess the safety and performance of the V-Wave System
      when implanted in patients with severe chronic heart failure.

      In addition, this study is designed, in-part, to collect a portion of the clinical data
      needed in support of a US FDA pivotal IDE study application to be submitted at a later date.

      Up to 70 subjects with chronic ACC/AHA Stage C, NYHA functional class III or ambulatory class
      IV heart failure (HF), with reduced or preserved LV ejection fraction, who have a history of
      hospitalization for worsening HF or elevated ambulatory levels of BNP/NT-proBNP, in the
      setting of maximally tolerated guideline-directed HF drug and device therapy, will be
      enrolled in the study.
