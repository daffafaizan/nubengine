    
      Overactive bladder (OAB) describes the symptom complex of urgency, with or without urge
      incontinence, usually with frequency and nocturia.

      The lower urinary tract is innervated by both the parasympathetic and the sympathetic nervous
      system, that act via muscarinic and adrenergic receptors, respectively.

      Antimuscarinics are mainly used for the treatment of patients with OAB, especially women.
      Other than antimuscarinics, a1-blockers have been shown in several clinical reports to be
      useful in treating DO caused by neurological diseases.
