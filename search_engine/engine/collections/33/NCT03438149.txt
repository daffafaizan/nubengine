      cells and that contain membrane and cytosolic elements. Case-control studies have shown that
      platelet-, endothelial- and leukocyte-derived MP levels are increased in OSA. Experimental
      evidence shows that MPs from OSA patients induce endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, and
      vascular hyperreactivity when injected to mice.

      The impact of increased levels of MPs on the cardiovascular prognosis in OSA patient with
      prevalent cardiovascular diseases in unknown.
