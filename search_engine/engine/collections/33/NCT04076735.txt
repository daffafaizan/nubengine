    
      The proposed study is a prospective, randomized controlled trial, involving multiple centers
      across North America, to compare distal femur replacement (knee prosthesis) versus surgical
      fixation as a treatment for geriatric distal femur fracture.

      Patients 65 years of age and older, with closed, displaced ( when the two ends of the bone
      are not lined up straight), comminuted (bone is in many pieces) distal femur fracture, who
      meet the inclusion criteria and agree to participate in the study, will be randomly assigned
      (by chance like flipping a coin) to receive either acute distal femoral replacement or
      surgical fixation.

      The hypothesis is that patients in the acute distal femoral replacement group will have
      superior function, range of motion (full movement potential of a joint), general health
      status, reduced pain, and lower complications when compared to patients in the surgical
      fixation group.
