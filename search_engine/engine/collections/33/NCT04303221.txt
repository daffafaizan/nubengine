      a non-rigid instrument, called the anchor system, on the postural control of women undergoing
      breast cancer treatment. For this purpose, 80 women submitted to breast cancer treatment will
      be invited to participate, divided into four homogeneous groups, determined by the sample
      calculation: women submitted to breast cancer treatment in the age group of 35 to 59 years
      (young adult) with lymphedema (GAJL), women in the same age group without lymphedema (GAJ),
      women in the age group 60 to 80 years (elderly) with lymphedema (GIL), and women in the same
      age group without lymphedema (GI). Cognitive status will be assessed by the Mini Mental State
      Examination. To assess the subsystems responsible for maintaining balance, the Balance
      Evaluation Systems Test (BESTest) will be used, presented in order to guide clinical
      intervention, in addition to the Falls Efficacy Scale -International (FES-I). The
      distribution of plantar pressure and balance will be assessed using baropodometry. For data
      analysis, a normality test and data distribution will be performed, in addition to a
      statistical test consistent with the appropriate intra and intergroup comparisons, with a
      significance level of 5%.
