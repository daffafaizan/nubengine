      Primary

        -  Improve hematologic and gastrointestinal tolerance to cetuximab and irinotecan
           hydrochloride, fluorouracil, and leucovorin calcium (FOLFIRI) in patients with advanced
           or metastatic colorectal cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Increase the effectiveness of this regimen by intensifying the treatment.

        -  Specify the constitutional genetic and genomic tumor parameters that could interfere
           with and predict the toxicity and/or antitumor efficacy of this regimen.

        -  Assess the time to progression.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive irinotecan hydrochloride IV over 90 minutes, leucovorin calcium IV over 2
      hours, and cetuximab IV over 1-2 hours on day 1. Patients also receive fluorouracil IV
      continuously over 46 hours on days 1 and 2. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Pharmacokinetic and pharmacogenetic studies are also conducted.
