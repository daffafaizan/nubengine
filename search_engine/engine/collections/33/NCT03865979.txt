    
      This study will be a multicenter prospective feasibility trial to evaluate the performance of
      the Viz RECRUIT software. This study will enroll subjects evaluated at each center for stroke
      via CT imaging. The Viz RECRUIT software will review the CT and notify a specialist if an ICH
      is detected. It will also evaluate the ICH parameters per study specific guidelines related
      to the ENRICH Trial and notify a specialist if their ICH meets the study inclusion or
      exclusion criteria related to cerebral blood flow volume. If an enrolled subject is
      ultimately included in the ENRICH trial, they will be identified in a prospective cohort of
      subjects exposed to Viz (intervention arm) will be evaluated per the secondary endpoints to a
      cohort of subjects retrospectively from the ENRICH Trial (control arm) which were evaluated
      and enrolled prior to Viz use.
