      of catheterization in both groups of patients in order to check the functionality of the
      communications between the ulnar and radial arteries. The repercussion of each compressive
      method on radial occlusion and artery revascularization will be assessed by eco-Doppler at
      any time. Changes in diameter of arterial lumen of radial and ulnar arteries as a consequence
      of radial occlusion will be done simultaneously of blood flow Doppler measurements. The
      possible impact of radial occlusion on hand mobility will be done using a dynamometer
      designed to evaluate strength (Endurance test) and muscular claudication (Rapid exchange
      test).
