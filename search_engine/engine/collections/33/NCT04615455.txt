      of Ophthalmology, University Hospital of Copenhagen, Denmark. 40 patients with severe aqueous
      deficient dry eye disease (ADDE) due to Sj√∂gren's Syndrome (SS) will be recruited from the
      Dept. of Ophthalmology, Rigshospitalet, and allocated in ratio 1:1 to either injection of
      allogeneic adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ASCs) or placebo (vehicle, Crystore CS10)
      into the lacrimal gland (LG) in one eye. We hypothesize that injection of allogeneic ASCs
      into the LG increases tear production and reduce inflammation resulting in increased ocular
      comfort compared to placebo.
