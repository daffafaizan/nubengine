      Department (EQUIPPED is a multi-component program to reduce the prescribing of potentially
      inappropriate medications (PIMs) to older adults upon discharge from the Emergency Department
      (ED). It has three core components: 1) provider education, 2) Electronic Health Record
      (EHR)-based clinical decision support (CDS) including pharmacy quick order sets to facilitate
      provider order entry, and 3) provider audit and feedback with peer benchmarking. In order to
      inform a Veterans Affairs (VA) system-wide approach to improve prescribing safety for older
      Veterans, the investigators will conduct a study to determine best practices for influencing
      provider prescribing behavior in order to decrease PIMs prescribed for older Veterans at the
      time of ED discharge. The overall goal of this project is to determine which EQUIPPED
      implementation strategy (active or passive feedback) is most effective to reduce prescribing
      of PIMs for older Veterans discharged from the ED.
