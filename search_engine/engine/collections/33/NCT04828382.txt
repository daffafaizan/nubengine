      greatly increased life expectancy in women with CF, but the effects of pregnancy on women
      with CF are yet unknown. It is anticipated that over 90% of the CF population will be on CFTR
      modulators in the next few years. More knowledge about the effects of CFTR modulators in
      pregnancy is needed.

      This is a prospective, multi-center, observational study to follow pregnant women with CF,
      conducted at 40 US sites. Women are enrolled in the first trimester of pregnancy and assessed
      every 3 months during pregnancy and during the first year after delivery, then every 6 months
      for an additional year. Changes in lung function over the course of pregnancy will be
      evaluated based on cumulative CFTR modulator use while pregnant while accounting for other
      factors that may influence changes in pulmonary function: baseline lung function, genotype,
      history of exacerbations, and pre-existing co-morbid conditions.
