      efforts are made in preventing such exacerbations. The standard of care for such
      exacerbations typically involves inhaled beta-agonist therapy and oral steroids. Patients who
      are refractory to these treatments may require intravenous access for the purposes of
      delivering additional medications, including magnesium sulfate. Intravenous magnesium sulfate
      has been shown to be beneficial in moderate and severe acute asthma exacerbations in adults
      and children, and new research indicates a trend toward benefits from nebulized magnesium
      sulfate, even in those with a mild exacerbation of asthma. Delivery of magnesium sulfate via
      the inhalation route is less invasive than the intravenous route, which is preferable in the
      pediatric population. The possible short-term benefits of the nebulized form of magnesium
      sulfate include decreased ED length of stay and prevention of admission to the intensive care
      unit if the patient must be hospitalized for further treatments. The specific aim of this
      study is to evaluate the effect of the addition of nebulized magnesium sulfate to our
      standard emergency department therapy by comparing the change from baseline of asthma scores
      and FEV1 (forced expiratory volume in 1 second) in children with acute asthma exacerbations.
