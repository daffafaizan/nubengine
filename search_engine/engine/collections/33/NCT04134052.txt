    
      Randomized double blind clinical trial. Male and female patients 60-90 years of age scheduled
      in elective surgery under regional anesthesia and sedation.

      The researchers will be double blind and the data analyzer will ignore the drug used ( it it
      should be midazolam or ketamine in an intravenous infusion). The principal investigator will
      limit himself to collecting the questionnaires and following up to 3 months. Simple finite
      randomization in two groups, will be done through envelopes.

      The pre-surgical, post-surgical Mini Mental questionnaire will be applied on the first day, 1
      month and 3 months. During the trans-anesthetic, hemodynamic variables and anesthetic depth
      index measurements will be taken, surgical time, estimated bleeding, use of other adjuvant
      medications, type of surgery and comorbidities will be taken as intervening variables.
