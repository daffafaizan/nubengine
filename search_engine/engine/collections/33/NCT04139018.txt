      investigating the efficacy of timolol gel in the management of epistaxis in adults with HHT.

      The Specific Aims are to determine in adults with HHT-associated epistaxis:

        1. If topical timolol gel is more effective than placebo in reducing the frequency and
           severity of epistaxis.

        2. If topical timolol gel is more effective than placebo in improving hemoglobin levels.

        3. The frequency of adverse events, side effects, and safety profile of topical timolol gel
           delivered to the nasal mucosa.
