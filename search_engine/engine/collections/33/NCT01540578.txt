      OBSERVATIONAL STUDY MODEL: Case-only

      TIME PERSPECTIVE: Retrospective

      BIOSPECIMEN RETENTION: Samples with DNA

      BIOSPECIMEN DESCRIPTION: Fresh and frozen bone marrow cells

      STUDY POPULATION DESCRIPTION: Patients with B-cell acute lymphoblastic samples banked at the
      COG Cell Bank

      SAMPLING METHOD: Non-probability sample

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether we can identify individuals within a specific sub-group of pre-B
      acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients that will eventually recur.

      II. To identify replication-timing changes as a biomarker for further risk prediction.

      III. To identify differences between patients of similar subtype, and choose candidate
      differences to analyze by methods that are compatible with frozen samples.

      OUTLINE:

      Archived cell samples are analyzed for replication timing by flow cytometry, microarray, and
      single-cell fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assays. Replication-timing results
      among cases and controls are also analyzed.
