    
      A prospective study to assess the safety and efficacy of surfactant administration via thin
      catheter using a specially adapted VNscope, originally used for endotracheal intubation and
      adapted for the administration of surfactant without the placement of an endotracheal tube.

      Once neonates present respiratory distress, the adapted scope will be used - clinical and
      outcome measures will be collected to asses the safety and efficacy of the use
