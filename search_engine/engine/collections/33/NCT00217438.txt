      I. Compare the complete response (CR) and near CR rate in patients undergoing autologous stem
      cell transplant (ASCT) using melphalan 280 mg/m^2 or melphalan 200 mg/m^2.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Compare toxicities between patients receiving amifostine and melphalan 280 mg/m^2 or
      melphalan 200 mg/m^2.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      INDUCTION THERAPY:

      ARM I (HIGH DOSE MELPHALAN AND AMIFOSTINE): Patients receive amifostine intravenously (IV)
      over 3-5 minutes on days -3 and -2 followed by high-dose melphalan IV over 15-30 minutes on
      day 2.

      ARM II (LOW DOSE MELPHALAN AND AMIFOSTINE): Patients receive amifostine as in arm I and
      melphalan as in arm I at a lower dose.

      AUTOLOGOUS OR SYNGENEIC PERIPHERAL BLOOD STEM CELL TRANSPLANTATION (PBSCT): At least 20 hours
      after completion of melphalan, patients undergo autologous or syngeneic PBSCT on day 0.

      Patients undergo restaging of the disease between days 80-90. Patients with progressive
      disease are removed from the study. Patients who achieve a CR or near-CR can proceed to
      optional maintenance therapy. Patients who do not achieve a CR or near-CR may undergo
      additional induction therapy as in arm I followed by a second autologous or syngeneic PBSCT.

      Patients again undergo restaging of the disease 80-90 days later. Patients with progressive
      disease are removed from the study. Patients without progressive disease can proceed to
      maintenance therapy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 5 years.
