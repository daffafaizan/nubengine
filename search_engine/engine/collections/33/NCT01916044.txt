      measure of the thickness of the lower segment associated with a rule of decision to reduce
      the foetal and maternal morbidity and mortality in the coverage of the deliveries of the
      women having a history of caesarian: a pragmatic randomized trial

      Aim Evaluation of the efficiency of the ultrasound measure of the thickness of the lower
      segment associated with a rule of decision to reduce the foetal and maternal morbidity and
      mortality in the coverage of the deliveries of the women having a history of caesarian
      Methodology Randomized trial, multicentric, open, in two parallel arms.

      Evaluated treatments:

      Between 36+0 and 38+6 weeks of amenorrhea, the patients will be invited to participate in the
      study. After agreement, the patients respecting the criteria of inclusion and not inclusion
      will be randomized in two groups:

      GROUP A (experimental group) : The ultra sound measure of the thickness of the lower segment
      will be realized in a way standardized by expert sonographers. The patient will be informed
      that in case of measure:

        -  superior at the threshold of 3.5 mm, her will be considered " a low risk " by
           complications and will be encouraged to try a event of the work

        -  subordinate or equal at the threshold of 3.5 mm, her will be considered " at risk " by
           complications and will be encouraged to give birth by iterative elective caesarian.

      GROUP B (control group) : The ultra sound measure of the lower segment will not be realized.
      The mode of delivery will be decided according to the current clinical practice.
