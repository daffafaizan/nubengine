    
      Objective: To identify risk factors for postoperative mortality within 3 days in adult
      patients undergoing emergency surgery and construct a predictive model.

      Methods: This will be a retrospective, exploratory and analytical study. All medical records
      of adult patients undergoing emergency surgery between January 2013 to December 2014 will be
      used to analyze for relevant risk factors using binary logistic regression analysis. A
      predictive model to predict postoperative morbidity within 3 days will be constructed.
