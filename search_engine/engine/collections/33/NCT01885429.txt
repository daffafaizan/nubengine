      concurrently. This constant protein turnover allows the muscle fiber to change its protein
      structure if loading demands or diet changes. The plasticity of skeletal muscle to respond to
      altered loading and contractile patterns is evidence of the capacity for remodeling that a
      fiber can undergo. It is quite well documented for example that mitochondrial content
      increases with endurance-type work. In contrast, heavier loading leads to less change in
      mitochondrial content but increases in myofibrillar proteins. All of the aforementioned
      phenotypic adaptations represent a re-patterning of the muscle's genetic expression patterns,
      protein translation, and processes for breakdown of existing protein structures to 'insert'
      the new proteins. A persistent muscle protein turnover also provides for a constant mechanism
      of protein 'maintenance' by removing damaged proteins and replacing them with new proteins.
      Damage to proteins can come about through oxidation or simply mechanical damage due to high
      forces during lengthening contractions. Regardless of the mechanism the balance between the
      processes of muscle protein synthesis (MPS) and muscle protein breakdown (MPB) will determine
      the net gain, loss, or no change of proteins in the myofiber.
