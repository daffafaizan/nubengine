    
      Hereditary TransThyRetin Amyloidosis (hATTR) is a slowly progressive condition, that is
      transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait and is characterized by abnormal extracellular
      deposits of fibrillar, misfolded proteins (amyloid fibrils) in the body. Amyloid fibrils can
      be deposited in different body compartments, such as the nerves, heart, gastrointestinal
      tract, kidneys and brain, causing severe structural changes. More than 30 proteins can
      trigger the formation of amyloid fibrils, 5 of which can infiltrate the heart and cause
      cardiac amyloidosis.

      One of these amyloidogenic protein is transthyretin, formerly known as prealbumin.
      Transthyretin (TTR) is found primarily in the serum (secreted by the liver) and cerebrospinal
      fluid (secreted by the choroid plexus) and functions as a carrier for the hormone thyroxine
      (T4) and retinol-binding protein (bound to retinol or vitamin A). The destabilization of the
      TTR protein and the formation of misfolded TTR.

      It is the goal of this study to investigate the prevalence of Hereditary
      Transthyretin-related Amyloidosis (hATTR) in a cohort of 5.000 subjects are at risk for
      Hereditary Transthyretin Amyloidosis (hATTR) and subjects diagnosed with hATTR, to monitor
      the clinical status in TTR positive subjects and to establish hATTR biomarker/s.
