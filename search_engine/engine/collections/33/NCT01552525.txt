      overall prognosis. Nitric oxide (NO)-signal transduction plays an important role in mediating
      renal damage. NO is produced by NO-synthase (NOS) with L-arginine as its substrate.
      Endogenous L-Arginine derivatives, asymmetric and symmetric dimethylarginines (ADMA/SDMA),
      inhibit NO-production directly (AMDA) by blocking NOS activity or indirectly (SDMA) by
      blocking cellular L-Arginine uptake.

      It is well known that SDMA and ADMA are markers of renal function (SDMA) and cardiovascular
      risk (ADMA/SDMA) in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Moreover, ADMA and SDMA
      possibly even trigger cardiovascular risk in patients with CKD. However, there is only little
      information about the regulation and the influence of ADMA/SDMA in acute kidney injury.
