      caused by traffic accidents. Thoracic traumas might lead to severe consequences, even though
      less than 50% of them required a surgical revision. Thoracic traumas can be divided in blunt
      or penetrating, according to the presence of open wound in the chest. Blunt traumas are the
      most frequent type of chest trauma with or without rib fractures that might be associated
      with haemothorax, pneumothorax or haemopneumothorax that are the most typical lesions or
      laceration.

      Pleural chest tubes are used to reestablish negative intrathoracic pressure after disruption
      of the pleural space. Chest tube positioning is considered necessary in case of a pleural
      disruption with pneumothorax; intrapleural bleeding causing haemothorax; or in case of
      pneumo-haemothorax .

      The management of pleural chest tubes with primarily under water seal or added suction is the
      subject of debate, and the benefits of one versus the other in regards to duration of air
      leak, amount of time the chest tube is in place, length of hospital stay and incidence of
      complications are unclear.

      All of the previous made us interesting to examine the effect of under water seal alone of
      chest tube in one groups of trauma patients and the effect of both under water seal and
      suction in other group, the investigators think that power of suction will give the patient
      better results with less complications and excellent immediate relief with good quality of
      life, rapid return to normal life .
