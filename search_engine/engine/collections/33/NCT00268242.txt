    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the complete response (CR) rate (CR and incomplete blood count recovery (CRi))
           of patients with acute myeloid leukemia in first relapse treated with gemcitabine
           hydrochloride and mitoxantrone hydrochloride.

      Secondary

        -  Evaluate disease free and overall survival of patients with acute myeloid leukemia in
           first relapse treated with this particular chemotherapy regimen.

        -  Assess hematologic and non-hematologic toxicity associated with this regimen.

        -  Assess laboratory correlates of drug resistance in patients with relapsed acute myeloid
           leukemia.

        -  Assess the percentage of patients receiving subsequent bone marrow transplantation.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study.

      Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 12 hours on day 1 and mitoxantrone
      hydrochloride IV over 30-60 minutes on days 1, 2, and 3. After completion of a single course
      of therapy, patients who achieve a complete response may receive 1 additional course of
      therapy at the discretion of the treating physician.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study.
