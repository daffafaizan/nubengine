      and its change after treatment with 50 SPF sunscreen (S), 4% niacinamide (N), or 0.025%
      retinoic acid (RA). METHODS: Fifty-six lesion of 28 female patients without treatment were
      clinically evaluated, as also the expression of DNA methyl transferases 1 and 3 by real
      time-PCR (polymerase chain reaction amplification), immunohistochemistry and
      immunofluorescence. It was initially quantified and after 8 weeks of treatment with S, RA and
      N. RESULTS: Relative expression of DNA methyl transferases were significantly elevated
      compared with unaffected skin in all subjects indicating hypermethylation of DNA.
      Hypermethylation decreased by S (7 vs 3 times relative expression, p<0.05), RA (7 vs 2 times
      relative expression p<0.05), and N (7 vs 1 relative expression p<0.01) correlated with
      clinical improvement, this was also supported by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence.
      CONCLUSIONS: The investigators found hypermethylation of DNA in melasma lesions.
      Environmental factors such as sun radiation may induce DNA hypermethylation triggering
      hyperpigmentation trough the activation of pathways regulated by epigenetic modifications.
      Thus, decreasing methylation by sunscreen protection and the genetic transcription
      modification through N and RA, may allow their clinical improvement regardless its
      depigmenting effect.
