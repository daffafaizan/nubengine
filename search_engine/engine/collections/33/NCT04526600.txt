      attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Studies from the investigator's laboratory
      and colleagues suggest physical movement can enhance cognitive performance in children with
      ADHD. Hyper-sensorimotor behavior may be related to impaired regulation of arousal in the
      noradrenergic and dopaminergic systems. This project will assess if frequency and
      characteristics of sensorimotor behavior relates to cognitive and emotional response in
      adults with ADHD, in a fine-grained manner, unlike other studies. The investigators will test
      if intrinsic fidgeting (Aim 1) and access to a specially designed fidget device (Aim 2)
      modulates behavioral and physiological response in cognitively and emotionally-demanding
      contexts. The hype of the commercially available fidget devices, its competitors and fidget
      spinners suggest it might, but there is no systematic evidence to inform consumers, a gap,
      the investigators aim to fill.
