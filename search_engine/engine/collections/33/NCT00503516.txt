      institutionalized or not.There are some previous studies that indicates the effect of the
      megestrol acetate in the weight gain of patients with cachexia-anorexia related with
      neoplasia. It seems that the mechanism of development could be the same between these
      patients and patients with dementia. It was described an important role of a group of
      cytokines ( Il-6, leptin, neuropeptide Y, TNFalfa) in the development of this nutritional
      alteration.

      Some previous pilots studies indicates that megestrol acetate has and effect in geriatric and
      dementia patients with a weight loss of at least 5% in the last 6 months.
