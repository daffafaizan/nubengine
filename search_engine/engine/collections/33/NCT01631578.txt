      decreases with advanced age, thus the rate of age-related infertility continuously increases.
      Presently oocyte donation is the only prompt solution for this widespread problem.
      Deterioration of mitochondrial function was suggested as one of the explanations for the
      age-related deterioration of oocyte quality. The supplementation of the ageing oocyte with
      autologous mitochondria from dividing somatic cells can be a possible solution for energetic
      enrichment, without introducing foreign mtDNA.

      We established a non-hazardous clinical grade system to prepare functional autologous
      mitochondria concentrate from the granulosa cells aspirated during oocyte pick up. The
      mitochondrial preparation was examined and found to be non-toxic. The activity of the
      respiratory chain was constant and unaffected by age or ovarian response. Moreover, the mtDNA
      in the mitochondrial preparation was found to be intact in all samples examined, including
      those from older and low responding patients.
