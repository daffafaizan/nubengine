      still need to further optimize therapy to reach the goal of disease eradication for almost
      all patients. In case of imatinib failure, dasatinib and nilotinib are effective treatment
      options after an individualized treatment selection. Although MMR rates of around 30% after 2
      years of therapy are a significant achievement, options that may improve response rates in
      depth are still desirable. Ponatinib is a third generation TKI with very high anti-clonal
      activity in all CML phases. Moreover, it also eradicates most of the known and problematic
      mutations and only very few (compound) mutations may induce ponatinib-resistance.

      Based on its favourable target spectrum, it is expected that Ponatinib may be more effective
      than 2nd line dasatinib or nilotinib in achieving early (i.e., at 6 months) cytogenetic and
      molecular responses in patients after inappropriate response to imatinib, and more effective
      as 2nd line treatment after failure of initial treatment with dasatinib or nilotinib than a
      cross-over between the 2nd generation TKIs. The basic hypothesis underlying therapeutic
      programs in CML is to be able to achieve meaningful and long-lasting suppression of the
      Philadelphia chromosome and breakpoint cluster region-abelson fusion gen (BCR-ABL). Complete
      cytogenetic responses have been associated with improved survival in CML, while major
      molecular responses are associated with improved event-free survival.
