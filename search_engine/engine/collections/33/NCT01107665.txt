      intravenously at a starting dose of 80mg/m2 weekly for 3 weeks followed by a 1-week rest.
      Pazopanib will be administered orally, in a continuous regimen, with a starting dose of 800mg
      daily.

      Approximately 60 eligible subjects will be enrolled over a 24 month period. 21 subjects will
      be entered into the first stage of a 2-stage Simon Minimax design. If there are 3 or more
      responses, 39 additional subjects will be enrolled in Stage 2. The minimum number of
      responses required to move to the second stage, > 3, were noted after the first 9 patients on
      treatment, and the study then proceeded towards the goal of accruing 60 total patients.
      Subjects are permitted to receive supportive care throughout the study including transfusion
      of blood and blood products, treatment with antibiotics, anti-emetics, anti-diarrheal agents,
      analgesics, erythropoietin, filgrastim (Neupogen), or bisphosphonates, when appropriate.
      Subjects should continue treatment on study until objective disease progression is documented
      according to RECIST or withdrawal from the study for other reasons. Subjects discontinuing
      treatment with paclitaxel prior to disease progression should continue treatment with
      pazopanib. Subjects discontinuing both agents prior to progressive disease (PD) will be
      followed for tumor assessment until PD, or until the initiation of a subsequent anti-cancer
      therapy in the absence of documented PD, or until death, whichever occurs first. Subjects may
      continue treatment beyond the time of RECIST-defined progression at the discretion of the
      investigator if the subject is perceived to be experiencing clinical benefit. Overall
      survival will be assessed for 2 years from first study treatment.
