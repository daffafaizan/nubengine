      ovarian cancer, with no germline BRCA mutation detected. Participants will be randomized in a
      1:1 ratio to either alpelisib plus olaparib or single agent cytotoxic chemotherapy
      (paclitaxel or PLD) in this open-label, active controlled study.

      Participants will continue to receive study treatment until disease progression, unacceptable
      toxicity that precludes further treatment, or until discontinuation of study treatment due to
      any other reason. After treatment discontinuation, all participants will enter in the
      post-treatment follow-up period, which consists of a safety follow-up visit and a 9-week
      post-progression visit. Once they complete the post-treatment follow-up, participants will
      then enter the survival follow-up period.
