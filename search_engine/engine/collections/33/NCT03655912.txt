      glasses and the use of electronic devices is effective for amblyopia treatment in children.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to one of three treatment modalities: Group A: eye
      patch on the fellow eye and to near-vision activities (such as reading, drawing, etc) Group
      B: an eye patch on the fellow eye and a electronic tablet Group C: red/green glasses and a
      electronic tablet

      Treatment will be done buy the three groups daily during 2 consecutive hours, and will be
      completed for four months. Children will then suspend the therapy for 2 months, and will be
      reevaluated to determine lazy eye relapses . All groups will be compared to see which
      patients achieved greater improvement on visual acuity and depth perception.
