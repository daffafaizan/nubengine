      avoid secondary ischemic diseases. However, the MAP needed to reach can vary over time based
      on intracranial pressure. Additionally, it is well know that the nurses in the Intensive care
      unit managed multiple patients simultaneously and cannot dedicate 100% of his-her time to
      adjust vasopressor infusion and/or fluid administration. Using a novel automated system can
      overcome this issue and may lead to more time in MAP target than the traditional management.

      All patients will have the same automated system for fluid administration using the EV1000
      monitoring using the AFM mode ( Assisted fluid management). This system will recommend to the
      clinical when to administer a fluid bolus to optimize SV and SVV. So fluid administration
      will be standardized in both groups. The only difference will be the management of MAP.

      The goal will be to compare a treatment period of at least 3 hours during which the patient
      will be under continuous noradrenaline infusion. This treatment time should be within the
      first 48 hours of patient admission in the Intensive care unit.
