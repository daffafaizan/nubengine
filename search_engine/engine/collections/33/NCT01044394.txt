      adequacy of the preparation determines whether complete visualization of the mucosa and
      identification of pathologic lesions is achieved. For reasons that are not entirely clear,
      colonoscopies scheduled in the afternoon have been identified as a risk factor for having an
      inadequate preparation. Standard bowel preparation regimens at BMC include polyethylene
      glycol- electrolyte solutions (PEG-ELS) in full (four liters) and reduced (two liters) forms.
      These laxatives are typically administered either the evening prior to the colonoscopy or in
      "split dose" (a portion the evening before and a portion the morning of the colonoscopy). The
      percent of failed colonoscopies due to a fair/poor preparation in our endoscopy unit is
      17-20%. Our trial seeks to establish the efficacy and safety of a reduced volume PEG-ELS
      laxative given on the day of the colonoscopy.
