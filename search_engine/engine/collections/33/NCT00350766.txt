      to evaluate the effect of the autologous bone marrow mononuclear cell (ABMMC) implant in 300
      Brazilian patients with ST elevation acute myocardial infarction (STEMI).

      Double blind study design was chosen for this trial, based on several phase I and II safety
      trials of intracoronary autologous bone marrow stem cells transplantation, already published.
      The study coordinator committee, supported by the Brazilian Health Ministry, therefore has
      proposed a phase III trial with the purpose of proving the efficacy of this kind of therapy,
      for a population with a high risk of developing heart failure and of death by cardiovascular
      cause.

      Thus, in this protocol we propose a prospective, double blind, controlled and randomized
      trial to evaluate the effect of ABMMC transplantation through intracoronary infusion, on
      systolic left ventricle (LV) function. The main hypothesis of this trial is that patients
      submitted to autologous bone marrow stem cell implant, after 6 months follow up, will present
      a 5% relative increase of the ejection fraction (EF) comparing to control group.
