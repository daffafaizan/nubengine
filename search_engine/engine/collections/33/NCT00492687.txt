        -  Determine the progression-free and overall survival of patients with supratentorial
           malignant gliomas (WHO grade III or IV) receiving radiotherapy with concurrent and
           adjuvant temozolomide, tamoxifen citrate, and carboplatin.

        -  Determine the acute and delayed treatment-related toxicities in these patients.

        -  Determine tumor response in patients with postoperative measurable disease.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, pilot study.

        -  Induction therapy: Patients receive oral temozolomide twice daily and oral tamoxifen
           citrate twice daily on days 1-42 and carboplatin IV over 60 minutes on days 1, 8, 15,
           22, 29, and 36. Patients also receive radiotherapy on days 1-5 in weeks 1-6.

        -  Consolidation therapy: Beginning 4 weeks after the completion of induction therapy,
           patients receive temozolomide, tamoxifen citrate, and carboplatin as in induction
           therapy. Treatment repeats every 8 weeks for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease
           progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 5 years.
