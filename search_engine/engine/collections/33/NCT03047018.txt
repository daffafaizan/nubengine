      overweight. Specifically, this study will look to see if changes in a child's eating habits
      and exercise can help with weight loss. Investigators also want to see how parents feel about
      the program and if they will complete the entire program.

      This is a 24-week, open trial pilot of 20 children (ages 5 to 12 years old) with ASD and
      obesity. Subjects will be enrolled in the CHANGE program, a six-month long intervention
      consisting of 16 sessions. The first 10 sessions occur weekly while the remaining 6 sessions
      occur bi-weekly. Sessions last about 1 hour each. After 24 weeks, subjects will be asked to
      return for follow up assessments at 1, 2 and 3 months later.

      The primary aims of this project are to 1) determine the feasibility of the intervention, 2)
      examine preliminary efficacy, and 3) obtain feedback from parents to improve the
      effectiveness of the intervention and fit for families.
