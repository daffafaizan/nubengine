    
      The study schedule for each patient consists of a screening phase, a treatment phase, and a
      follow up-phase, for an overall individual duration of approximately 18-24 months.

      A minimum of 3 patients will be treated in each patient group (A and B) at each dose level
      and evaluated for the occurrence of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) during the first 6 weeks of
      treatment before consideration will be given to enrolling patients into the next dose level.

      No more than 6 cycles of 225^Ac-PSMA-617 using the dose de-escalation schedule will be
      administered. Patients may receive less than 6 cycles if they have disease progression, have
      withdrawn consent or if, in the opinion of the investigator, have received maximum benefit
      from treatment with 225^Ac-PSMA-617.

      Subjects may also receive supportive care therapy, as determined by the investigative
      physician, however, subjects cannot receive concurrent investigational agents, cytotoxic
      chemotherapy, other systemic radioisotopes, and hemi-body radiotherapy or novel androgen axis
      drugs [NAADs] until completion of treatment with 225^Ac-PSMA-617.
