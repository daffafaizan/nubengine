      acceleration (WBPA) is a new, non-invasive, and promising therapy for a diverse and growing
      list of disorders. During WBPA, patients lie in the supine position on a bed that is capable
      of translating back and forth parallel to the ground, along the head-to-foot axis of the
      patient. Thus, this treatment is best described as a form of "passive exercise." WBPA has
      been shown in previous studies to increase nitric oxide. Increased levels of nitric oxide
      have been shown to improve sleep patterns in other populations. The current pilot study will
      investigate how WBPA will impact upon sleep disturbances in subjects with Parkinson's disease
      who suffer from abnormal sleep patterns. The investigators will record sleep patterns and
      activity levels using a Jawbone U3Â® activity monitor.
