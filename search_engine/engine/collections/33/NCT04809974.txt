      continue to experience symptoms related to infection. Initially thought to be an acute
      illness like the flu, resulting in death for some or full recovery in most, scientists and
      clinicians are now appreciating that substantial numbers of COVID-19 illness survivors
      experience persistent, significant and sometimes disabling symptoms. Variously called
      "Long-COVID," "COVID long-haulers," or "chronic COVID syndrome", some of the most prominent
      symptoms are neurologic and neuropsychiatric, including cognitive impairment ('brain fog'),
      headache, fatigue, muscle aches and weakness, shortness of breath, hair loss and pain, among
      others. In this research study the investigators want to learn about whether taking Niagen
      (also known as Nicotinamide riboside, or NR), a daily supplement containing a form of Vitamin
      B3, can improve recovery of cognitive function, mood, and physical health in individuals who
      were infected with COVID-19 and continue to experience "brain fog" and other neurological and
      physical symptoms. The investigators think that this supplement may help improve thinking
      skills and other symptoms, and improve quality of life, in individuals who had COVID-19.

      Participants will complete the following at baseline and every 5 weeks: 1) a standard
      cognitive battery and subjective cognitive complaints scales; 2) mood measures; 3)
      assessments of physical functioning, as well as of other common Covid-19-related symptoms; 4)
      blood draw; and 5) 2 optional MRIs. Participants will also wear a Fitbit and complete
      questionnaires to assess sleep and physical activity.
