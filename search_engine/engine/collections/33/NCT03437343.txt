      Hospital, Paris, France, during the year 2015.

      This retrospective study used 3D reconstructions from the EOS biplanar radiographic imaging
      system (EOS imaging, Paris, France) to perform leg length measurements before and after THA
      on all included THA patients from 2015 to evaluate surgeon performance in restoring lower
      limb length after THA. Included patients either had hip osteoarthritis or femoral head
      osteonecrosis. Patients were excluded if they were undergoing revision surgery, or had a
      contralateral THA or total knee.

      The performance of the surgeons was judged using the Cumulative Sum control chart (CUSUM)
      method.

      Our objective was to study surgeon performance, measured by their ability to restore the
      initial preoperative length of the operated leg or to equalize the length of the two legs,
      and evaluate the relationships between the quality of life, estimated by the HOOS score, and
      the anatomy of the new hip in standing position using the EOS imaging system.
