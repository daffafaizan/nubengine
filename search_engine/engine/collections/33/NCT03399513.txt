      diffuse large B-cell lymphoma treated with R-CHOEP. However, more than one fourth of patients
      still relapse or show primary progressive disease. The outcome of such patients is poor, in
      particular if first-line therapy contained rituximab. In order to avoid such detrimental
      situations, we seek to further improve progression-free survival and overall survival by
      combining R-CHOEP with ibrutinib.

      Ibrutinib is a first-in-class, orally administered, potent, small-molecule inhibitor of
      Bruton's tyrosine kinase, a mediator of critical B-cell signaling pathways implicated in the
      pathogenesis of B-cell cancers.
