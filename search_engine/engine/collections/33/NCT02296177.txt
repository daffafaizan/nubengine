      efforts should target the healthcare delivery system where these women receive service - the
      so called "safety net". Within the safety net, federally qualified health centers (FQHCs),
      provide comprehensive primary health care services for underserved communities regardless of
      ability to pay, including mammography screening. Our team has successfully pilot tested a
      National Cancer Institute research tested intervention program (RTIP) with underserved women
      and were able to reduce no-show rates from 44% to 19%. In order to accelerate the adoption
      and implementation of our EBI within the safety net, the investigators will use a two-step
      approach based on the consolidated framework for implementation research (CFIR), and
      intervention mapping. The investigators will actively disseminate the EBI through a unique
      breast health collaborative with a wide membership of FQHCs, support implementation through
      training and evaluate the adoption, implementation, sustainment and effectiveness of the EBI.
      The investigators will use a clinic clustered stepped wedge design for implementation in
      FQHCs.
