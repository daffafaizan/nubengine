      congestion, the most significant of which is blood volume analysis. Blood volume analysis
      (BVA) measures how much blood is in the investigator's arteries and veins and is performed by
      using an IV and injecting a small amount of a radioactive material (I 131-labeled albumin).
      The study also involves blood tests, urine tests, blood pressure monitoring, an ultrasound,
      and measurement of lung fluid volume (by way of a vest). There will also be a 30-day
      follow-up phone call to assess symptoms and discuss any changes in medication.
