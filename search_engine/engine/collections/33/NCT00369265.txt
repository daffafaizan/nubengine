      in patients who present with symptoms characteristic of reflux laryngitis. The efficacy of
      Lansoprazole 30 mg bid in healing and improving reflux laryngitis will be determined. For the
      purpose of this study, healed reflux laryngitis will be defined as an improvement or
      resolution of arytenoid erythema and improvement in symptoms. Improved reflux laryngitis will
      be defined as improvement in any two of the following areas: arytenoid erythema; voice
      quality as assessed by the patients or health care provider; or, improvement/resolution of
      related symptoms (throat clearing, cough, etc.). The impact of Lansoprazole 30 mg bid therapy
      on quality of life will be evaluated in a preliminary fashion.
