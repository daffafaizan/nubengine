      I. Following a patient safety lead-in, determine the anti-tumor activity of clofarabine given
      in combination with high-dose melphalan as assessed by 2-year progression-free survival
      (PFS).

      II. Estimate overall survival (OS), cumulative incidence (CI) of relapse/progression and
      non-relapse mortality (NRM) at 100 days, 1 year and 2 years.

      III. Summarize toxicities/complications by organ and severity, including acute and chronic
      graft-vs-host disease (GVHD), and infection.

      OUTLINE:

      CONDITIONING REGIMEN: Patients receive clofarabine intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on days -9
      to -5 and melphalan IV over 30 minutes on day -4.

      TRANSPLANT: Patients undergo allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant on day 0.

      GVHD PROPHYLAXIS: Beginning on day -3, patients receive tacrolimus IV or orally (PO) and
      sirolimus PO once daily with taper per City of Hope standard operating procedure.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up once weekly for 60 days, at
      100, and 180 days, at one year, and then yearly for up to 5 years.
