      of six months of supervised exercise on the spontaneous and phytohemagglutinin-induced
      production of osteoclastogenic cytokines (interleukin-1α, tumor necrosis factor-α),
      anti-osteoclastogenic cytokines (transforming growth factor-β, interleukins 4 and10),
      pleiotropic cytokines with variable effects on osteoclastogenesis (interferon-γ,
      interleukin-6), and T cell growth and differentiation factors (interleukins 2 and 12) by
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The investigators also measured lymphocyte phenotypes,
      and serum markers of bone formation (osteocalcin), bone resorption (C-terminal telopeptides
      of Type I collagen), and bone homeostasis (estradiol, vitamin D2, testosterone, parathyroid
      hormone, insulin-like growth factor).
