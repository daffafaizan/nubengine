    
      Batten Disease is an inherited disorder that causes progressive cognitive and behavioral
      decline in children. There have been no systematic clinical studies of Batten Disease using
      standardized rating instruments with known inter-rater reliability and validity.

      The Batten Study Group developed the Unified Batten Disease Rating Scale (UBDRS), a clinical
      rating instrument used to assess the motor, behavioral, and functional capabilities of
      individuals with Batten disease. Using the UBDRS, study investigators will evaluate
      participants approximately every year to track disease progression. The UBDRS is the primary
      natural history tool, but the study also includes neuropsychological assessment, adaptive
      function, quality of life measures, and other measures to assess the impact of Batten
      Disease. Participants will be examined at the University of Rochester Batten Center, Batten
      Disease Support and Research Association annual meeting, or remotely via televideo.
      Information related to racial and ethnic background, medical history, symptoms, medications,
      and diagnostic testing will be collected.
