      clinics to receive text message reminders of oral hygiene. Four groups of participants will
      be formulated. Group 1 will be the control group and will not receive text messages. Group 2
      will receive messages once a week. Group 3 will receive text message reminders 3 times a
      week. Group 4 will receive daily reminders. At baseline, after 4 weeks and after 8 weeks,
      gingival index and plaque index will be measured at each time point and then compared between
      groups.
