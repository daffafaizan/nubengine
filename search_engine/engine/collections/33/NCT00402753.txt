      in hematological and lymphatic malignancies. These malignancies and their treatment are
      associated with numerous physical and psychological symptoms and severe side effects.
      Physical exercise has been proposed as a promising strategy for the treatment of some of
      these physical and psychological complaints, and various exercise interventions are currently
      available after cancer treatment. To date, promising preliminary results concerning exercise
      programs in PBSCT recipients were published with limited sample size populations. Results of
      musculoskeletal outcomes in PBSCT recipients after cancer treatment are lacking.
