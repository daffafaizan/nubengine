      modified toxicity probability interval (mTPI) design. ST-067 is administered as subcutaneous
      injection once weekly. Pre and on treatment biopsies will be mandated for all patients. There
      will be evaluation of PK and PD effects.

      Phase 2 will evaluate the preliminary efficacy of ST-067 administered at the RP2D to patients
      with the following tumor types. A Simon 2 stage design is used to calculate the sample size
      and early stopping rules will be employed in the event of lack of efficacy in any of the
      cohorts. RECIST 1.1 will be used to assess tumor response every 8-12 weeks.

      Safety will be assessed for each patient throughout the study.
