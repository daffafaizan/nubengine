    
      Study Objective: The overall objective is to evaluate the tolerability/safety and efficacy of
      adding bevacizumab (Avastin®) to standard of care therapy in improving clinical and
      radiologic outcomes of acute optic neuritis and/or transverse myelitis in neuromyelitis
      optica and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders.

      Primary Objective: To compare the clinical and radiographic outcome following acute optic
      neuritis and/or transverse myelitis in NMO/NMOSD in patients who receive 1-2 doses of 10
      mg/kg dose of bevacizumab (Avastin®) in addition to standard medical therapy.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To determine the effect of Avastin on NMO clinical scores (Expanded Disability Status
           Scale, Timed 25-foot Walk and Low Contrast Visual Acuity [LCVA]).

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of a 10 mg/kg dose of intravenous Avastin.

        -  To determine the frequency of adverse events with Avastin in this patient population.

        -  To determine the effect of Avastin on MRI lesion size and extent.

      The duration of the investigation is 1-2 years.
