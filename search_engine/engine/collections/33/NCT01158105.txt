      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for hematological diseases. Chronic graft-versus-host
      disease (cGVHD) is the most serious and common long-term complication of this treatment in
      patients surviving more than 100 days. Some patients are requiring immunosuppressive therapy
      for years. cGVHD is associated with a high degree of morbidity and mortality and remains a
      major cause of late death. When standard treatment with steroids is ineffective or poorly
      tolerated, effective therapeutic options are limited. Patients with uncontrolled cGVHD with
      initial therapy including systemic steroids respond poorly to second line options. Recent
      studies have demonstrated Bortezomib safety in the prophylaxis, and improvement of GVHD
      suggesting its efficacy.This study is done to evaluate the potential of bortezomib in
      treating refractory cGVHD.
