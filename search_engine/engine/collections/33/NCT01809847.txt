      therapy with the antibody ofatumumab in the context of allogeneic HCT. Allogeneic HCT itself
      is not a study intervention and is triggered by the availability of an HLA-compatible stem
      cell donor. The study is divided into an induction part and a maintenance part. During
      induction where the antibody is combined with high dose dexamethasone, the main goal is to
      reduce the tumor load prior to allogeneic HCT. Patients who achieved disease control (CR, PR
      and SD) by the antibody proceed to maintenance therapy with the antibody. Patients with
      progressive disease go off study. The idea behind maintenance therapy is that ofatumumab may
      contribute to tumor control early after allogeneic stem cell transplantation while T-cell
      based graft-versus leukemia effects are still not fully established. External tumor control
      could lower the pressure to taper immunosuppressive drugs early after transplantation and
      could thereby indirectly contribute to better GVHD-prophylaxis. Furthermore, anti-CD20
      antibodies have proven activity in the treatment of chronic GVHD. In summary, the concept of
      a consequent CD20 blockade in the context of allogeneic transplantation could result in
      better leukemic control and better GVHD prophylaxis, which is a highly attractive goal.
