        -  Compare the local response rate in patients with stage II invasive squamous cell
           carcinoma of the true vocal cord treated with hyperfractionation vs conventional
           fractionation radiotherapy.

        -  Compare the acute and late toxic effects of these regimens in this patient population.

        -  Compare the overall and disease-free survival patterns in this patient population
           treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified according to substage (T2a vs
      T2b). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo conventional radiotherapy 5 days a week for 5 weeks followed by
           boost radiotherapy 5 days a week for 2 weeks.

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo hyperfractionation radiotherapy 5 days a week for 5 weeks
           followed by boost radiotherapy 5 days a week for 1.6 weeks.

      Patients with biopsy-proven persistent disease at least 6 weeks after completion of
      radiotherapy undergo salvage surgery with neck dissection (at the discretion of the surgeon).

      Patients are followed at 4 weeks, every 3 months for 1 year, every 4 months for 1 year, every
      6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 240 patients will be accrued for this study within 3.2 years.
