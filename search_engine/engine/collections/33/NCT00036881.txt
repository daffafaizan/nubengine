        -  Determine whether zinc sulfate prolongs the time to onset of altered taste in patients
           with head and neck cancer undergoing radiotherapy.

        -  Determine whether this drug decreases the overall incidence of altered taste in these
           patients.

        -  Determine whether this drug results in fewer radiotherapy treatment interruptions in
           these patients.

        -  Assess the quality of life of patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Patients
      are stratified according to planned radiotherapy dose (less than 6,000 cGy vs at least 6,000
      cGy), estimated amount of oral mucosa in the radiation field (60% or less vs more than 60%),
      age (under 50 vs 50 and over), concurrent chemotherapy (yes vs no), and smoking (yes vs no).
      Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral zinc sulfate 3 times daily beginning the first week of
           radiotherapy.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo 3 times daily beginning the first week of
           radiotherapy.

      Treatment in both arms continues daily during and for 1 month after radiotherapy in the
      absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, weekly during treatment, and then at 1, 2, 3, and 6
      months after the completion of treatment.

      Patients are followed at 1, 2, 3, and 6 months after the completion of treatment and then
      every 6 months for 1 year.
