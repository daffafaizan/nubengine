    
      Clinical and quality of life data will be collected for all treated patient. Based on the
      histological evaluation performed by each participating center, patients will be screened for
      inclusion in one of the four studies, based on the following criteria:

        -  TOPS study only: all patients with A, AB, B1, B2, B3 without areas of carcinoma
           histology, diagnosed during or after 2018, that do not have a fresh tissue sample and
           screen failures of the RELEVENT and BIOTET study;

        -  TRY registry: all patients with TETs diagnosed, treated or followed from 2010 to 2017
           included (retrospective data collection);

        -  BIOTET only: all patients with A, AB, B1, B2, B3 without areas of histology of the
           carcinoma that have a fresh tissue sample;

        -  RELEVENT only: all patients with thymoma B3 and areas of carcinoma and pa-tients with
           thymic carcinoma who do not have a fresh tissue sample.

      Patients with thymic carcinoma or thymoma B3 with areas of carcinoma will receive a
      centralized pathological review of the tumour block or slides and will be screened to
      participate in the Phase II RELEVENT pharmacological study.Histological diagnosis will be
      confirmed before screening.
