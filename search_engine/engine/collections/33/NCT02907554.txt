      an intervention group receiving 2.5 mg/kg of cyclosporine A before organ procurement. In the
      operating theater organs are harvested. Thereafter, harvested kidneys from these patients are
      transplanted to chronic kidney insufficiency patients. The management of transplanted
      patients is performed as usual. According to the pretreatment of the transplant, delayed
      graft function during the first week (need of at least one dialysis session) was evaluated as
      well as kidney function at different timepoints (slow graft function, estimated creatinine
      clearance on day 3 and 7, acute and chronic graft rejection), length of hospital stay and
      mortality during the first year after transplantation.
