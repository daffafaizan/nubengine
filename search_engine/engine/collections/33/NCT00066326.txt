        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose and dose-limiting toxicity of
           17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) when administered with imatinib
           mesylate in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, nonrandomized, multicenter, dose-escalation study of
      17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG).

      Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate on days 1-21 and 17-AAG IV over 1 hour on days 1, 4,
      8, and 12. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of 17-AAG until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, an additional cohort
      of 6-10 patients receives treatment at the recommended phase II dose.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 21-42 patients will be accrued for this study within 1.5
      years.
