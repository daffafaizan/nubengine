      pain mechanisms, which can be extended even after tissue recovery. However, little is known
      about the status of these central pain mechanisms once subjects are fully recovered from the
      tissue injury and pain. This information would help to explain pain conditions in which
      recurrence of the pain episodes is common (e.g low back pain or shoulder pain).

      Pressure-pain thresholds have been widely used in pain research to test the sensitivity of
      the pain system. Additionally, referred pain has been shown as a valid biomarker for the
      sensitization of the pain system.

      The aim of the present study is to investigate pressure pain sensitivity and referred pain
      patterns of individuals with a history of recovered fracture, compared with healthy controls.
