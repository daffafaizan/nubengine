      combination regimen to treat patients with type 2 diabetes. But, treatment with the dual
      combination therapy is often unsuccessful at achieving glycaemic control in patients with
      type 2 diabetes.

      Recently, various oral hypoglycemic agents were developed including dipeptidyl peptidase
      (DPP)-IV inhibitor, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor and new peroxisome
      proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) agonists.

      But, there have been few studies about the glucose lowering effect of these drugs in Type 2
      diabetes patients on the dual combination therapy with a sulfonylurea agent and metformin.

      Hence, the researchers plan to investigate the efficacy and safety of these drugs in
      combination with a sulfonylurea agent and metformin in type 2 diabetic patients.
