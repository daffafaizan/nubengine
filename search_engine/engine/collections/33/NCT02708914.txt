    
      This is a 52-week, phase III trial consisting of two parts:

      Part I is designed as a double-blind, randomized, multicenter, parallel-group study to
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of UB-851 in comparison to EprexÂ® in subjects with renal
      anemia on hemodialysis with a treatment period of 24 weeks.

      Part II is designed as a single-arm, safety evaluation period (from week 25 to week 52) to
      evaluate the long-term safety and immunogenicity of UB-851.
