      trial will be performed in a 2-period, 2-sequence-crossover design with direct switch-over.
      Eighteen (18) healthy subjects of both sexes (balanced distribution intended, but minimum 40%
      of each sex) are intended to be randomised.

      The IMPs will be administered after a light meal as single oral doses of 1500 mg cannabidiol
      (i.e. 5.051 g granules of Test to be dispersed in water or 15 ml solution of Reference) twice
      daily (i.e. every 12 h) over 7 consecutive days.

      Blood sampling will be performed after the 13th administration over 24 h, thereby including
      the 14th administration, in order to characterise pharmacokinetic parameters after multiple
      dosing over a whole day interval.

      Comparison of maximum systemic exposure of Test vs. Reference will be performed under steady
      state conditions by means of AUC144-168,ss, Cmax,144-168,ss, and Cmin,144-168,ss of CBD and
      7-OH-CBD.

      The clinical trial will be performed as a cross-over investigation with intra-individual
      comparison, thus reducing variability of the pharmacokinetic parameters, which is supposed to
      be higher between subjects than within an individual subject.
