    
      TLK199.2102 was a multicenter Phase 2 randomized study to determine the effect of Telintra
      treatment on chemotherapy induced neutropenia (CIN) in patients with non small cell lung
      cancer receiving first-line therapy with carboplatin and docetaxel.

      After randomization, patients in Treatment Arm 1, chemotherapy with carboplatin and docetaxel
      will be administered on Day 1 of each cycle, followed by Telintra at a starting dose of 3000
      mg total daily dose (1500 mg orally, twice daily) on Day 2 until the absolute neutrophil
      count improves as confirmed by two consecutive measurement at least 24 hours apart. In
      Treatment Arm 2 (control arm), chemotherapy alone consisting of carboplatin and docetaxel
      will be administered on Day 1 of each cycle.
