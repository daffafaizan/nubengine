      Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 7th edition, International Union against cancer ( which uses
      TNM staging ) as stage I , stage II of breast carcinoma. Twenty patients of histologically
      proven post lumpectomy/mastectomy cases of carcinoma breast suitable for radiotherapy will be
      enrolled in this study. Patients would be evaluated at the Department of Radiotherapy PGIMER,
      Chandigarh by doing a thorough clinical examination followed by routine investigations which
      will include hemogram, liver function tests, kidney function tests, chest X-ray. Patients
      will be treated by standard rectangular tangential fields.The study will include 20 patients
      with breast cancer post mastectomy or after breast conservative surgery to be treated with a
      radiotherapy dose of 34Gy in 10 fractions over 2 weeks followed by a boost of 10Gy/5#/1wk in
      cases with intact breast. Acute toxicity will be assessed using a RTOG grading system. This
      will be carried out weekly during radiotherapy and for 4 weeks after treatment. If symptoms
      persist the patients will be assessed weekly until their reaction settles to RTOG grade 1 or
      less (Annexure I).

      Statistical analyses The principle end point of the study is an analysis of acute toxicities,
      cosmetic score analysis. Skin, subcutaneous toxicity and cosmetic assessment will be done
      before treatment and then in regular follow up of the study. Chi-square test will be used to
      compare radiation toxicity parameters. Descriptive statistics including mean and standard
      deviation will be obtained for all variables. p values of <0.05 will be taken as significant.
      All tests would be performed using SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences) v.12.0.
