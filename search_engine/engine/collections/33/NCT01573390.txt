      tissue and detecting tissue reflectance at different wavelengths. One major advantage of
      hyperspectral imaging is non-invasive and non-contact detection of tissue functional
      properties. The dual-mode imaging system integrates hyperspectral and thermal imaging
      modalities for simultaneous assessment of cutaneous tissue oxygenation and vascular function.
      This clinical protocol is defined to validate the CWC system on healthy human subjects
