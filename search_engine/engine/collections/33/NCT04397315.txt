      eligibility for the study, written informed consent will be taken after explaining the
      procedure and its associated risks and benefits. Clinical diagnosis of irreversible pulpitis
      will be established based on a history of spontaneous pain or pain exacerbated by cold
      stimuli and lasting for a few seconds to several hours (lingering pain) compared to control
      teeth and which is reproducible using cold testing. Once included, study subjects will be
      randomly allocated to either Complete Pulpotomy group or Partial Pulpotomy group. (Mineral
      Trioxide Aggregate) MTA will be used as pulpotomy agent. A layer of resin modified Glass
      Ionomer liner will be placed over the MTA and tooth will be permanently restored with
      composite resin in second appointment.

      Pain analysis will be carried out preoperatively and postoperatively at every 24 hours till 7
      days after intervention. All the subjects will be followed up for evaluation of success at
      every 3 months from baseline to 1 year.
