      groups (30 patients in each group) to receive caudal block with bupivacaine (0.25%) 1mg/kg
      (group 1) plus tramadol 1mg/kg (group 2) just after the induction of general anesthesia
      without premedication. All children will be assessed for the post operative immune response
      by measuring interleukin 6 and 10 (IL-6 and IL-10) and Tumour Necrosing Factor-α (TNF-α)
      using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique one hour preoperatively and three
      hours after incision.
