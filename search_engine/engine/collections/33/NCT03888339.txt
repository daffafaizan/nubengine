      at the Dental clinic of the University of Valencia to evaluate the influence of 2.5 mm high
      abutments with different shapes (commercially available high abutments vs high abutments with
      modified shape to imitate short abutments) on peri-implant bone loss around bone level
      implants with platform switching in partially edentulous patients that require a fixed
      rehabilitation supported by two implants in the posterior mandible or maxilla and in fixed
      rehabilitation supported by one implant in the anterior mandible or maxilla (from premolar to
      premolar).
