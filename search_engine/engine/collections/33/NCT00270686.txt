      caused by defects of extracellular matrix elements such as collagen, elastin,
      mucopolysaccharides or related biomolecules. The genetic cause of many connective tissue
      disorders has been elucidated, while others are yet to be discovered or further defined.
      While clinical diagnostic criteria have been established for several of the connective tissue
      syndromes, many share features that overlap the known descriptions of other connective tissue
      disorders. Therefore, further characterization and phenotype/genotype correlation is needed
      to adequately diagnose and find treatments for these yet-to-be genotyped disorders.

      An aim of this work is the examination of the cardiovascular, musculoskeletal and
      neurological complications of heritable connective tissue disorders (HDCT) and the natural
      history of these complications. Through mutational analysis for genes known to cause the
      HDCT, as well as identification of new genes, we will assess the relationship between
      specific mutations and their associated disease phenotypes. Through the analysis of tissue
      specimens obtained from patients with HDCT, we will identify the biochemical pathways that
      lead to connective tissue fragility. We will continue to assess the severity, prevalence, and
      pattern of pain and related psychological and quality of life dimensions in HDCT.

      The resulting understanding of genotype/phenotype correlations and biochemical pathways will
      enhance our understanding of connective tissue biology. This knowledge has the potential to
      lead to new treatments for not only patients with HDCT, but also for pathological conditions
      associated with the weakness of connective tissues in aging.
