      involved a total of 174 children at 8 years of age. The results from neurodevelopment
      evaluation by neuropsychological testing, neurological functions rhythms and neuroimaging
      (fMRI and DTI) at 8 years old will be associated to clinical and metabolic data recorded
      during pregnancy.

      As secondary aim, we would discern whether the decrease on DHA levels in offspring of GDM at
      birth is associated to disturbed neurodevelopment at 8 years old.

      The impact of maternal diabetes on placental MFSD2a and children's resolvin and protectins
      derived from DHA will be measured in urine samples at 8 years old.

      Gut microbiota composition and function will be also studied to detect its role in the
      potential disturbances regarding the production of anti-inflammatory mediators.

      A part from the clinical study, we will perform an intervention trial using animal models.
      Gestational rats with diabetes and control rats will be treated with antioxidants and
      adipoRon in order to delay neuro-degeneration in these animals because of the diabetes, as
      well as their influence on MFSD2a levels in placenta and brain. All these studies may provide
      to the industry of valuable information to improve nutritional supplements during gestation
      or infancy to avoid potential delay of cognitive functions in offspring of diabetic mothers.
