    
      Randomized controlled clinical trial of the Mirror Image Movement Enabler (MIME) robotic
      device for shoulder and elbow neurorehabilitation in subacute stroke patients. MIME
      incorporates a PUMA 560 robot that applies forces to the paretic limb during unilateral and
      bilateral movements in three dimensions. Robot-assisted treatment (bilateral, unilateral, and
      combined bilateral and unilateral) was compared with conventional therapy.
