      or following a cardiac surgery with CPB within 72h. Patients must have achieved a hemodynamic
      stabilization confirmed by clinical (no need for intravenous fluids, no significant variation
      of noradrenaline) and non-clinical (trans-thoracic echocardiography, passive leg rise or
      other validated tool) assessment. Included patients will receive 1 to 1.5 mg/kg of
      FUROSEMIDE. Urine output will be measured for 6 hours and compensated by the same volume of
      intravenous crystalloids. Need for RRT will be assess at 2-hour, 6-hour and daily up to day
      7, following the AKIKI-study delayed initiation arm criteria. FURTHER aim to evaluate FST in
      a well-defined prospective cohort of ischemic ATN-related AKI as predictor of need for RRT
      within a week.
