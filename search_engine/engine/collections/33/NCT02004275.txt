      I. To establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for combination therapy
      pomalidomide/dexamethasone/ixazomib. (Phase I) II. To assess whether the combination of
      pomalidomide/dexamethasone/ixazomib improves progression-free survival (PFS) relative to
      pomalidomide/dexamethasone. (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs). (Phase I) II. To analyze type and grade of
      all serious adverse events (SAEs). (Phase I) III. To analyze type and grade of all adverse
      events (AEs). (Phase I) IV. To analyze the reason for and incidence of dose
      modifications/omissions/delays. (Phase I) V. To assess preliminary evidence of clinical
      efficacy. (Phase I) VI. To assess whether the overall response rate (ORR), partial response
      (PR), very good partial response (VGPR), complete response (CR) or stringent CR (sCR) rate
      differ with respect to treatment regimen. (Phase II) VII. To assess the clinical benefit rate
      (CBR: minimal response [MR] + ORR) for pomalidomide/dexamethasone/ixazomib compared to
      pomalidomide/dexamethasone. (Phase II) VIII. To assess the disease control rate (DCR: stable
      disease [SD] + CBR) for pomalidomide/dexamethasone/ixazomib compared to
      pomalidomide/dexamethasone. (Phase II) IX. For those patients achieving a PR or better, we
      will assess whether the combination of pomalidomide/dexamethasone/ixazomib increases the
      duration of response (DOR) compared to pomalidomide/dexamethasone. (Phase II) X. To assess
      whether the combination of pomalidomide/dexamethasone/ixazomib improves overall survival (OS)
      compared to those taking pomalidomide/dexamethasone alone. (Phase II) XI. To assess time to
      next treatment (TNT) for patients taking pomalidomide/dexamethasone/ixazomib compared to
      those on pomalidomide/dexamethasone. (Phase II) XII. To evaluate the safety of
      pomalidomide/dexamethasone/ixazomib compared with pomalidomide/dexamethasone. (Phase II)
      XIII. For patients on the pomalidomide/dexamethasone arm who opt to cross-over to the
      pomalidomide/dexamethasone/ixazomib arm, assessment of response rate (ORR, CBR, DCR), DOR,
      TNT, PFS and OS will be evaluated from date of cross-over. (Phase II) XIV. To determine if
      baseline level of perceived fatigue and overall quality of life (QOL) is associated with OS.
      (Phase II)

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of pomalidomide and ixazomib followed by a
      phase II study.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 4 weeks until disease
      progression and then every 3 months for 3 years.
