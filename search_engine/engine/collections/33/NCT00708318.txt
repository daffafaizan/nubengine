      minute (Treatment A). Subjects then crossed over to Period II.

      In Period II, subjects were randomly assigned to receive either 2 mL (1000 µg fentanyl;
      Treatment B) or 3mL (1500 µg fentanyl; Treatment C) of AeroLEF delivered by nebulization with
      the AeroEclipse BAN. Subjects were instructed to continue inhalation of AeroLEF for
      approximately 1 minute beyond the point of nebulizer sputter to ensure that all aerosolized
      medication was delivered. There was at least a 1 week washout period between study periods.
