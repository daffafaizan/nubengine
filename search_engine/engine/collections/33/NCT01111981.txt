    
      Central Centrifugal Cicatricial Alopecia (CCCA) is an inflammation-induced

      hair loss starting in the central scalp and progressing centrifugally. The

      cause of CCCA is unknown. Early diagnosis and treatment is essential to stop

      or slow the progression of scarring and permanent hair loss. Once scarring

      occurs, the hair follicles are obliterated and the hair cannot regrow. Thus,

      anti-inflammatory medications are used to decrease inflammation. Current

      treatment includes topical and intralesional corticosteroids, oral

      antibiotics, and hair transplantation, all which may take months to years to

      show improvement. There is no evidence-based medicine on how to treat

      primary cicatricial alopecias. Clobestasol Propionate 0.05% Emollient Foam is

      an FDA-approved and marketed topical corticosteroid for the treatment of the

      inflammatory and pruritic manifestations of moderate to severe corticosteroid-

      responsive dermatoses of the scalp. Many studies found the foam to be less

      irritating than the original formulation.
