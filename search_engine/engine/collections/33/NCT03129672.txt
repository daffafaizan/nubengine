      tibia was amputation (1). Currently, however, after the improvement of the chemotherapy
      treatments, potential reconstructions of the area in well studied patients are possible, and
      for that we have a wide range: auto graft, allograft and prosthetic reconstructions (2, 3)

      Is important to know that osteosarcoma still meant the principal diagnosis, followed by the
      Ewing sarcoma and synovial sarcoma, but their malignant potency is lower than when they are
      present in the rest of the body (4, 5, and 6)

      The purpose of this study is to recollect the patients' data followed from different
      institutions and countries that have the criteria for their inclusion in the study (primary
      malignant bone tumor of the distal tibia that underwent block excision of the tumor and
      reconstruction with allograft arthrodesis from the patient management for any of the
      multidisciplinary sarcoma team including in this study).
