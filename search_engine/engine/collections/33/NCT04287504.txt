      and the SavvyCheck Vaginal Yeast Test for vaginal candidosis are superior, equal/comparable
      or inferior to diagnosis on Gram stained smears. The point-of-care-tests are potential tools
      for the adequate diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis and vaginal candidosis in early pregnancy,
      since the prevention of these infections, as well as the infection screening per se, have the
      potential to prevent preterm birth and reduce the rate of late abortion. Point-of-care-tests
      are easy to perform, relatively cheap, and widely available. Routine implementation of the
      tests would be an effective contribution to the reduction of preterm labor and late-onset
      mortality.
