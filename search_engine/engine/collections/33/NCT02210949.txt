      artery bypass grafting operations In addition, female gender, lower body surface area (BSA),
      low preoperative Hemoglobin (Hb), previous cardiac surgery, emergency operation and low
      preoperative creatinin clearance were found to be independent risk factors for receiving Red
      Blood Cells (RBC) units.

      We create a clinical pathway to reduce transfusion of red blood cells by pretreating patients
      with erythropoietin and iron to determine the reduction of number of patients who receive
      blood transfusion perioperatively. Also we want to investigate the decrease in the mean
      number of RBC units received per patient in the perioperative period.
