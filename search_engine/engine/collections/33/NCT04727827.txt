      medicine service guided by HCT clinical pharmacists and Specialty Pharmacy pharmacists using
      preemptive pharmacogenomic (PGx) testing will identify drug-gene interactions relevant to the
      supportive care of HCT subjects. This approach to care may improve symptom management and QOL
      as interpreted via ESAS in adult HCT subjects treated at our institution. With the experience
      of past studies and a customized genetic panel, the investigators will genotype subjects
      prior to transplant and identify actionable drug-gene pairs and utilize these to direct
      supportive therapies. To date no studies have highlighted the significance of incorporating
      preemptive PGx testing to personalize therapy selection and dosing into the management of
      adult HCT subjects as a means of improving QOL and symptom management. The primary aim is to
      estimate the frequency of subjects undergoing PGx testing who receive at least one drug/dose
      selection or modification based on their test results during the study period (from admission
      for HCT to HCT D100). Secondarily the investigators will measure improvement in aggregate and
      individual scores on the ESAS survey and will further use the ESAS in its totality to assess
      the impact of PGx-guided care as compared to pre-implementation/non-PGx driven strategies
      through aggregate ESAS scores, individual ESAS scores, and differences between HCT admission
      (or baseline) and HCT Day 30 scores before and after the intervening program. In the
      outpatient setting the investigators will utilize planned medication reconciliation (with PGx
      guidance) by Specialty Pharmacy Service pharmacists to adhere to PGx-recommendations and
      capture insight into the implementation of this program to share with other practitioners.
      The implementation of this study will personalize pharmacotherapy, improve symptom management
      and QOL in adult HCT subjects treated at our institution, and offer guidance globally in
      supporting the role of the pharmacist in pharmacogenomics (PGx) and management of HCT
      subjects.
