      assigned. Data will be collected in a routine setting on a single occasion during an
      otherwise normal visit at the physician's office or clinic. Participating physicians will not
      perform any medical procedures that are outside of their normal daily clinical practice. All
      treatment decisions are at the sole discretion of the participating physicians and reflect
      their current standard of care
