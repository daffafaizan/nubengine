    
      HEMO-STIM is a prospective multicentric cohort study of subfertile women undergoing ART. It
      is an epidemiologic observational study. All women older than 18 years attending the
      reproductive medicine unit (UMREG, Geneva, HUG or UMR, Lausanne, CHUV) and undergoing an IVF
      have been and will be recruited consecutively and included. The type of stimulation protocol
      used is recorded.

      All measurements (specific haemostasis test with a thrombin generation assay before and after
      adjunction of APC) that are part of the study will be performed in the HUG laboratories in
      order to limit inter-dosage variability.

      The 1st blood test will be performed at inclusion in the absence of any hormonal treatment
      (T1). A 2nd blood test will be performed on the day of ovulation triggering (T2). A 3rd blood
      test will be performed 7 days after ovulation triggering (T3).

      The comparison of different protocols has never been performed and data on the effect of
      antagonist protocols for IVF on haemostasis are lacking. The measurement of intermediate
      biomarkers of thromboembolic risk during different IVF stimulation protocols (agonists and
      antagonists) would allow the comparison of their thrombotic profile and to optimize the
      risk/benefit ratio during ART by prescribing protocols at lower vascular risk, in particular
      in women identified as being at risk for thromboembolic events.
