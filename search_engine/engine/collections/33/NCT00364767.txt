    
      To investigate the effect of moderate alcohol consumption on

        -  enzymes involved in fatty acid oxidation, oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis in
           skeletal muscle

        -  transporters of fatty acids and glucose in fat tissue

        -  post-prandial glycemic response in healthy, lean or overweight, young men

      Design : Open, randomized, partially diet-controlled, placebo controlled cross-over design

      Participants

        -  Description : Healthy, lean and overweight young (18-40 years) men

        -  Number : 20

      Study substances

        -  Test substance : 100 ml whiskey (Famous Grouse, 40% v/v alcohol: â‰ˆ 32 g alcohol)

        -  Reference substance : 100 ml mineral water (Spa blauw)

      Duration: 2 treatment periods of 4 weeks (28 days)

      Test parameters:

        -  Muscle biopsy for activity of 3-hydroxy fatty-acyl CoA dehydrogenase, citrate synthase,
           cytochrome c oxidase

        -  Postprandial glycemic response (glucose, insulin, GLP-1, GLP-2, GIP, glucagon, FFA etc.)

        -  Insulin sensitivity and related factors (oral glucose tolerance test, adiponectin,
           HbA1c)

        -  Liver enzymes (safety)

        -  Body weight

        -  Urinary ethyl glucuronide (compliance)
