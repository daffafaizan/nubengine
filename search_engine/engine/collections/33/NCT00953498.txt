    
      The study will be performed as follows:

      At baseline, before initiating glitazone treatment, clinical data will be recorded and blood
      samples will be obtained for biological measurements (blood glucose, HbA1c, total
      cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, liver enzymes), phospholipase
      A2 measurement and the study of the vasodilatory effect of HDL particles.For this purpose, we
      will study,using rabbit aorta rings,the ability of HDL to suppress the inhibition of
      vasodilation that is induced by oxidised LDL.

      For all the patients included into the study, a treatment by pioglitazone (at an initial dose
      of 30 mg/day) or rosiglitazone (at an initial dose of 4 mg/day) will be given by
      randomization.

      A visit will be performed at week 12, in order to titrate the glitazone dose (up to 45 mg/day
      for pioglitazone, up to 8 mg/day for rosiglitazone)according to HbA1c level and values of
      self-monitoring blood glucose.

      At week 24, the last visit will take place. During this visit, clinical data will be recorded
      and blood samples will be obtained for biological measurements (blood glucose, HbA1c, total
      cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, liver enzymes), phospholipase
      A2 measurement and the study of the vasodilatory effect of HDL particles.
