      methods will be used to increase the understanding of barriers to HIV testing, identify
      promising strategies to increase testing, generate research hypotheses, and design a future
      randomized clinical trial to evaluate HIV prevention targeted to at-risk women in the general
      population in Russia. The qualitative methods include structured interviews and a focus group
      participation to assess women's reasons for being the tested and possible prevention
      strategies. The quantitative methods include observation/recording of women's testing
      behaviors.
