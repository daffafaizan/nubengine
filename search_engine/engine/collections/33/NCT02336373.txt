      experienced a sickle cell disease related complication, or have a score of 80 or lower on the
      PedsQLâ„¢ Sickle Cell Disease Module version 3.0. This questionnaire will be offered to all
      patients with HbSC seen in our clinic that consent to this study. If the patient is sexually
      active, they will be offered birth control. If the patient chooses not to initiate effective
      birth control, they will be tested at their scheduled vist with a urine pregnancy test. If
      the patient becomes pregnant they will be removed from the study.

      The maximum time patients will be on the study is 12 months after starting hydroxyurea
      therapy, with an option to participate in a 2 year observation study following the end of the
      study.

      Patients will be assessed in the clinic every two months after starting treatment.
      Hydroxyurea will be started at 10 mg/kg/day, and increased by 5 mg/kg/day at eight week
      intervals if needed to reach a maximum tolerated dose (MTD). The most common side effect of
      the drug is a drop in infection fighting cells, or white blood cells, so the medication will
      be started at a low dose and the dose will be increased only if it is safe to do so.

      Patients will be asked to allow the investigators to review information from their medical
      records at the start of the study, and throughout the study. If the patient would like to
      participate in the two year follow-up, their records will be reviewed during that period as
      well.
