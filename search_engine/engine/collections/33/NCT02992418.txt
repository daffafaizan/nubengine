      months apart, with the first dose of CYD dengue vaccine administered either concomitantly or
      sequentially with a booster dose of the Tdap vaccine, AdacelÂ®.

      During the conduct of the study, a safety signal was identified which led to the Independent
      Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) recommendation not to vaccinate participants who had never
      been infected by dengue prior to the first injection, i.e., dengue non-immune participants.
      The protocol was amended accordingly but never implemented due to absence of response of
      Health Authorities (HA) from The Philippines.

      After having waited for more than 1.5 years, and as the participants became out of window to
      complete their immunization schedule and the last safety follow-up call (6 months after the
      last dose), the Sponsor decided to stop the trial. Participants only attended a last safety
      follow-up visit to terminate the study and were informed about the end of the study. As a
      consequence, the study was prematurely terminated before injection of the last dose (3rd
      dose) of the CYD dengue vaccine.

      As a consequence of the IDMC recommendations, the main immunogenicity analyses were done in
      dengue immune participants which is not what was planned in the protocol (and this is why the
      primary endpoints are not exactly the same as those defined in the protocol as they were
      finally assessed only in dengue immune participants whereas initially it was planned to be
      assessed regardless of baseline status).

      All participants were assessed for immunogenicity and safety. Safety assessments included
      solicited reactions within 7 or 14 days after each injection, unsolicited adverse events
      within 28 days after each injection, and serious adverse events during the study period.
