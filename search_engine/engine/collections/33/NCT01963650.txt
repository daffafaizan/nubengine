    
      Metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) is an inherited, autosomal recessive disorder of lipid
      metabolism characterized by deficient activity of the lysosomal enzyme, arylsulfatase A
      (ASA). MLD is a rare genetic disease that occurs in most parts of the world. The estimated
      overall incidence of the disease in the western world is approximately 1 in 100,000 live
      births.

      This study is a multicenter, observational, longitudinal study that plans to enroll up to 30
      patients with onset of MLD-related signs and symptoms prior to 30 months of age and who are
      less than 12 years of age. Patients will participate in this study for approximately 114
      weeks (Screening through Follow-up) and will be assessed at defined intervals for disease
      status.
