      "pancreatic clamp" study. During the clamp procedure, glucose (a sugar) and insulin (a
      hormone produced in the pancreas that regulates the amount of glucose in the blood) are
      infused with an intravenous catheter, and blood samples are collected periodically throughout
      the procedure to measure blood sugar levels and the levels of several hormones that are found
      in the body and are related to glucose metabolism. Endogenous glucose production (the
      production of sugar by the liver) will be measured in patients given diazoxide (a medication
      that activates potassium channels in the brain that may affect glucose production in the
      liver through brain-liver signaling), compared with when a placebo is given.
