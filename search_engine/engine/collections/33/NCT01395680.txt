      diagnosed with cancer about 3 months, 3) willing and able to complete own report
      questionnaires. The study is designed as repeated measurement. Considering attrition rate may
      be more than 60%. Therefore, of necessity, the proposed sample size was set at 60 families.

      Data will be collected by a structured questionnaire (a demographic questionnaire and 4
      scales). The study consists of four times of data collection time point as follows:
      approximately 3 month (t1), 6 months (t2), 9 months (t3), and 12 months (t4) after the
      diagnosis of cancer in adolescents. Each participant may take 20-30 minutes to finish the
      structured questionnaire.
