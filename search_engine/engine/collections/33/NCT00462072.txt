      TNFa, which potentiates their differentiation into myeloid effector cells. During their
      migration from the bone marrow to the end organ, these cells express a unique set of genes
      that function to prime these cells to respond to critical differentiation signals.
      Elucidation of this transcriptome through microarray analysis will provide insight into novel
      drug targets and a formal understanding of the biochemical and molecular genetic events
      linking IMIDs. To test our hypothesis, will determine the transcriptome in peripheral blood
      mononuclear cells and isolated monocytes from 20 normal healthy donors, 10 patients with
      psoriatic arthritis, 10 patients with psoriasis, 10 patients with Crohn's disease and 10
      patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The transcriptome will also be examined in inflamed
      intestinal tissue from patients with Crohn's disease, psoriatic skin and synovial tissue from
      patients with rheumatoid and psoriatic arthritis.
