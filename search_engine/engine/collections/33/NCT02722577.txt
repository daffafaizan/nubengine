      adjacent bipolar EGMs (bi-RP method) and unipolar EGM with QS morphology (uni-QS method) for
      identifying successful ablation site, and evaluate the feasibility of enhancing uni-QS
      method's performance by using its morphology characteristics such as descending slope and
      symmetry.
