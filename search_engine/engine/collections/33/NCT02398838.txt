      mg mifepristone. Two days later they took 400 mcg buccal misoprostol, with the option of
      doing so in the clinic or at home. They underwent clinic follow-up 12-15 days after taking
      mifepristone to determine if their medical abortions were complete. The study assessed the
      regimen's efficacy, women's preferences regarding where to administer the medications, and
      the acceptability of buccal misoprostol and of side effects that accompanied women's medical
      abortions.
