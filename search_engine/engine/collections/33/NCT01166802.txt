      (questions), and (2) validating individual items based on their correlation with an objective
      gold standard - the response criterion statistic, B, calculated from a barostat test of pain
      sensitivity. We will perform barostat tests of pain thresholds and other measures of pain
      sensitivity that are based on sensory decision theory analysis in a relatively large group of
      84 IBS patients. Sensory decision theory divides pain perception into two components: a
      perceptual sensitivity index (P(A)) and a response criterion (B). The response criterion is
      sensitive to cognitive and psychological influences on pain perception. We will use this
      index (B) as the gold standard against which to select items for a scale to measure
      hypervigilance for visceral pain. The process will involve (a) pooling items from existing
      questionnaires that seem related to the concept, (b) obtaining additional questions from
      consultants who are experts in visceral perception and psychometric test development, (c)
      identifying the items that show the strongest correlations with the response criterion, (d
      using principal components analysis to reduce the items to the smallest number of
      non-redundant items that predict the response criterion and treating this as a provisional
      questionnaire of hypervigilance, and (e calculating psychometric characteristics of this
      questionnaire.
