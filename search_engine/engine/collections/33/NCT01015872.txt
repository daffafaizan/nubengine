      followed by systemic inflammation and organ dysfunction like cardiovascular diseases.
      Systemic inflammation causes the activation of arachidonic acid metabolism, producing
      prostaglandins (PGs) and leukotrienes (LTs). In addition, significant relationships between
      PGD2 and PGE2 and sleep, PGF2Î± and hypertension, PGI2 and thromboxane and platelet
      aggregation and so on are reported. Therefore, it is hypothesized that many prostanoids
      affect the pathophysiology of SAS. However, the relationships between prostanoids and
      clinical outcomes in patients with SAS are unknown. Although CPAP is the major treatment of
      SAS, the effects of CPAP on prostanoids are not known, either. Thus, the purpose of this
      study is to evaluate those relationships.
