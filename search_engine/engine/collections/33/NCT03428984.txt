      profile of EXPAREL when administered as a posterior intercostal nerve block. Twenty-four
      adult subjects undergoing thoracotomy are planned for enrollment.

      Subjects will be screened within 30 days prior to study drug administration. During the
      screening visit, which must take place at least 1 day prior to surgery, subjects will be
      assessed for past or present neurologic, cardiac, and general medical conditions that, in the
      opinion of the investigator, would preclude them from study participation.

      Subjects will undergo their pre-planned thoracotomy procedure per the institution's standard
      of care. Prior to wound closure, subjects will be given either 40 mL of study drug (20 mL
      EXPAREL expanded with 20 mL normal saline) or 30 mL of study drug (20 mL EXPAREL expanded
      with 10 mL normal saline). Subjects will remain in the hospital for a minimum of 48 hours for
      pharmacokinetic testing and evaluation of safety.

      On Day 14, the subject will complete the study via phone call in order to collect safety
      data.
