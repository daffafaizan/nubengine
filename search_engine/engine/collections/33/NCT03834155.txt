    
      This study aims to (1) Iteratively develop and program a theoretically informed
      technology-based nudge message library for a diverse patient population using multiple and
      iterative N of 1 within subject studies. Investigators will also engage patient, provider and
      health systems stakeholders in designing and refining the messages; (2)Develop a one-page
      decision aid tool to present information designed with principles of shared decision making
      including pros and cons of hospital and home-based rehabilitation. Investigators will engage
      patients, providers, and health systems stakeholders to provide feedback on the information
      sheet (3) Conduct a 2x2 factorial design randomized trial of a) choice and b) nudge messaging
      to improve primary outcome of CR adherence. Secondary outcomes will include enrollment and
      completion of CR, exercise capacity, patient engagement, quality of life, hospitalizations
      and healthcare utilization.Evaluate the intervention using a mixed methods approach and
      applying the RE-AIM (reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance)
      framework.
