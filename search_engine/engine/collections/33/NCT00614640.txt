      has resulted in improved control of viral replication for prolonged periods of time and a
      significant reduction in morbidity. However, when compared to the responses seen in adults,
      children have overall inferior virologic responses. The therapeutic vaccine, DermaVir,
      represents an immunization strategy that targets lymph node dendritic cells. Because of the
      high percentage of naive CD4 cells in children and adolescents, the potential for effective
      new HIV-specific CD4 cell responses may be more achievable in children than in adults. The
      primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of DermaVir in
      children and young adults.

      This study will last up to 61 weeks (up to 13 weeks of treatment with an additional 48 weeks
      for follow-up). Participants will be randomly stratified according to age and dosage. Group 1
      will consist of 8 adolescents and young adults (between ages 13 and 23) and 8 children
      (between ages 6 and 12). Group 1 participants will have one 0.8 ml DermaVir patch and one
      control patch applied on Days 0, 42, and 84. Group 2 will consist of 4 adolescents and young
      adults and 4 children. Group 2 participants will have four 0.8 ml DermaVir patches applied on
      Days 0, 42, and 84. Group 3 will consist of 4 adolescents and young adults and 4 children.
      Group 3 participants will have four 0.8 ml DermaVir patches applied on Days 0, 7, 42, 49, 84,
      and 91.

      There will be 14 study visits for each participant. They will occur at screening and Days 0,
      7, 21, 42, 49, 63, 84, 91, 105, 126, 168, 259, and 427. Screening will occur up to 30 days
      before the first vaccination (Day 0). Medical history and physical exam will occur at all
      visits. Blood and urine collection and an adherence assessment will occur at most visits. A
      urine pregnancy test will occur for females at most visits.
