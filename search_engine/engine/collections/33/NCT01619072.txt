      treatment option for postpartum hemorrhage (PPH). Additional research is needed to
      demonstrate how these findings translate into program effectiveness at lower levels of the
      health care system, including community home births, where access to skilled providers and
      treatment options are limited and misoprostol could potentially have the greatest impact on
      maternal health outcomes. This randomized controlled community treatment trial will assess
      the effectiveness of misoprostol with standard of care (i.e., referral to higher level care)
      vs. placebo with standard of care for PPH treatment at the community level, primarily home
      births attended by primary health care unit staff in Etay El Barood and Kafr El Dawar
      districts (El Beheira governorate), Egypt. This research will help guide decisions on how to
      introduce misoprostol into PPH care programs in different contexts such as primary care
      settings, including community-based home births.
