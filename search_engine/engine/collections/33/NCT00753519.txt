    
      Objective

      To demonstrate cumulative and long-lasting improvement of parkinsonian symptoms by iTBS and
      its safety in PD patients.

      Study population

      Patients (40-80 years of age) with PD, Hoehn and Yahr disease stage of 2 to 4 while off,
      being on a regimen including levodopa with a total dose of medication equal to more than 300
      mg of levodopa, including their dopamine agonist agents, and having problems with walking and
      needing 6 seconds or more to walk a 10-meter distance.

      Design

      Randomized, double-blind, placebo (sham)-controlled study. Enrollment of 30 patients with PD
      in 2 groups (real versus sham stimulation). Performance (8 interventions) of iTBS with large
      circular coil over motor and prefrontal cortex on both sides. Assessment with standard tests
      of motor function over a one-month period.

      Outcome measure

      The primary endpoint is change in gait speed as assessed by the time it takes to walk 10 m.

      Secondary endpoints include changes in bradykinesia as assessed by measuring the time it
      takes to do ten combined hand and arm movements, and in total and motor UPDRS score.
