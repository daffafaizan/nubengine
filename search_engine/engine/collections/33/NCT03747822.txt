      of facial esthetics; therefore deficient chin is considered an annoying defect for the
      patient. Traditional techniques used for correction, which are osseous genioplasty and
      alloplastic augmentation, have some reported complications. These complications include
      hematoma in the floor of the mouth; though a rare complication is considered to be a life
      threatening condition. Also, wound dehiscence, infection, Chin hypoesthesia/dysesthesia due
      to mental nerve injury which occurs in 3.4% to 12% of cases , chin ptosis, lip ptosis,
      drooling, and an increase in lower teeth show due to failure to reattach the mentalis muscle
      to its natural origin on the anterior face of the mandibular body and tooth root damage which
      may occur during the osteotomy. Also bone resorption, implant displacement, infection and
      foreign body reaction were reported as a complication with some alloplastic implants .

      This study aims to avoid the complications of surgical correction of deficient chin by using
      less invasive approach.

      Trial design:

      3 Groups of patients will be assigned to this trial: Study group1: Will use autogenous fat
      augmentation in deficient chin. Study group2: Will use onlay PEEK augmentation in deficient
      chin. Control group: Surgical correction of deficient chin with sliding genioplasty. Trial
      design: Randomized Controlled clinical Trial
