        -  To study the effect of niche mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) exposure on microRNAs (miR)
           expression in pediatric AML at different time points and compare those profiles to the
           miR profiles at baseline.

        -  To focus on four pediatric AML-specific miRs (miR34a, miR538e, miR193e, and miR198)
           which show the most significant differential expression after in vivo niche exposure at
           four months (hematogenous spread).

        -  To determine whether altered miR expression reflects or causes the metastatic invasion
           pattern of AML.

      OUTLINE: Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) samples are implanted
      subcutaneously in NOD/SCID mice. Cells are then harvested at day 0, 1 month, and 4 months
      post-implantation. miRNA is isolated and analyzed by Ilumina MicroRNA Expression Profiling
      single Beadchip. The obtained data is then analyzed by the Illumina Genome Studio Analysis
      Software.
