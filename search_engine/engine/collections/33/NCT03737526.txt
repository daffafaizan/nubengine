      pathologist after fixation. Methods and conditions of specimen measurement are rarely, if
      ever, described in published studies.

      To study the influence of anaesthesia (local by cervical block vs. general or spinal
      anaesthesia) on height and volume of resection specimens in case of conization treatment for
      cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN).

      Prospective observational study of all patients who underwent a first treatment by loop
      electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) for CIN. Height of fresh resection specimens was
      first measured by the operator and then by the pathologist after formaldehyde fixation.
      Volume of fresh specimens was measured in a measuring cylinder by fluid displacement.
