      intra-abdominal infections.

      The specific aims of this trial are:

        1. To characterize meropenem single-dose and multiple-dose PK in subjects with suspected
           and complicated intra-abdominal infections.

        2. To characterize the safety profile of meropenem in the treatment of suspected and
           complicated intra-abdominal infections.

        3. To assess collected efficacy data for meropenem for the treatment of suspected and
           complicated intra-abdominal infections.
