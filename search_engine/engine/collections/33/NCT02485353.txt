    
      Primary objective: rate of complete remission (morphologic complete remission or morphologic
      complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery) Secondary objectives: (1) safety of
      this combination in induction therapy of older patients previously unexposed to intensive
      chemotherapy; (2) progression-free survival; (3) length of stay in hospital for induction;
      (4) 30- and 60-day mortality rate.

      The treatment period will include up to 4 cycles of treatment (induction 1, induction 2,
      consolidation 1, and consolidation 2). In each cycle, the first day of study treatment will
      be considered day 1.

        -  Each cycle will include vosaroxin treatment on days 1 and 4 (total of 2 days) and
           cytarabine treatment on days 1-5 (total of 5 days) followed by a variable interval
           required to achieve hematologic recovery, defined as absolute neutrophil count (ANC) >
           1000 cells/L.

        -  Up to 2 cycles of consolidation treatment may be completed by eligible patients in
           remission (morphologic complete remission or morphologic complete remission with
           incomplete blood count recovery) if safety parameters are met.
