      thereby contribute to impaired microcirculation and organ dysfunction. Supplementation of
      L-citrulline in septic patients will increase NO production without increased arginase
      activity and these effects will be studied on arginine-NO metabolism,improved organ function,
      vascular permeability and microcirculation.
