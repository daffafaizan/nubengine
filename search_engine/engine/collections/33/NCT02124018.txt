    
      1000 asymptomatic post-MI patients>40%, at least 40 days post-MI, revascularized or without
      needing further revascularization (in any case without any evidence of ischemia) will be
      enrolled.

      The patients will be divided into two categories:

        1. Asymptomatic patients with revascularized ST-elevation MI (STEMI) (remaining stenoses in
           non culprit vessels <70%) at 40 days post-MI (when LVEF>40% will be re-assessed)

        2. Asymptomatic patients late (at any time after 40 days) after MI (initially STEMI-NSTEMI
           at discharge Q-non Q) with LVEF>40% right after a negative stress test or right after a
           negative for stenoses control coronary catheterization All patients will undergo
           non-invasive evaluation (ECG, Holter monitoring and 45-min high resolution recording).
           In case they fulfill at least one out of seven pre-specified criteria they will undergo
           programmed ventricular stimulation and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD)
           implantation (if inducible) All patients will be followed-up for 3 years for sudden
           cardiac death and its surrogate (appropriate ICD activation)
