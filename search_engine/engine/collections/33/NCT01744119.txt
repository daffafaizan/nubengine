    
      Vascutek Limited, a world leader in the development of vascular grafts, has combined their
      latest technological developments in polyester textile technology with unique endovascular
      design features to produce Anaconda™, the world's next generation of AAA stent graft systems.
      Intuitive and of a modular design, Anaconda™ is the only repositionable device which also
      features exceptional flexibility. The modular design comprises bifurcate bodies, iliac legs
      and aortic cuffs. Nitinol, an alloy of nickel and titanium, has self-expanding properties and
      forms the top "ring-stent" of the bifurcate body section. The "ring stent" is composed of
      multiple turns of Nitinol wire that provides significantly increased "hoop-strength" enabling
      a conformable and secure haemostatic seal against the vessel wall to be achieved. Nitinol
      hooks located adjacent to the "ring stent" anchor the graft in position thus preventing graft
      migration. The iliac limbs are fully supported with Nitinol and the bifurcate bodies feature
      a distal contra-lateral lumen Nitinol support, which in conjunction with a unique intrinsic
      magnet guidewire system facilitates cannulation of the bifurcate section.

      The system is available in a wide range of sizes thus making it a flexible and adaptable
      stent graft system with the potential to repair diverse patient anatomy.
