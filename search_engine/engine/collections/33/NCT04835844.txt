      procedures for atrial fibrillation (AF). Identifying gaps in prior ablation lines is
      essential to achieve successful outcomes. High density mapping systems have been proposed to
      allow the identification of such gaps with speed and accuracy.

      The MAP-AF study will compare RHYTHMIA vs CARTO in redo ablation of paroxysmal AF with
      assessment of both acute procedural profiles and clinical outcomes.
