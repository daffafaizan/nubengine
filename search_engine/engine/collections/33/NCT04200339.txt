    
      This study seeks to evaluate the psychometric properties of three substance use screening and
      brief assessment tools for adolescents against criterion standard of Diagnostic and
      Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) substance use disorder
      diagnoses in a population of adolescents presenting for any type of visit (i.e. an annual
      health maintenance visit, follow-up, or sick visit) at one of four primary care sites; or,
      for an initial evaluation at a substance use disorders program for youth. The three tools to
      be tested are the Brief Screener for Tobacco, Alcohol and Drugs (BSTAD); Screening to Brief
      Intervention (S2BI) screening tool; and the Tobacco, Alcohol, Prescription medications, and
      other Substance (TAPS) Tool. BSTAD and S2BI were developed specifically for use with
      adolescents and each has been validated in a single trial. These tools use past-year
      "frequency of use" questions to determine risk level for a substance use disorder. The TAPS
      tool includes both screening and brief assessments and while it has been studied more
      extensively in adult primary care patients, its validity with adolescents is not known. For
      youth, alcohol, marijuana and tobacco use, and particularly early initiation, are associated
      with greater risk of substance use disorders, use of illicit drugs, misuse of opioids, and
      opioid use disorders. Thus, identifying and addressing substance use early is an important
      form of prevention that can be delivered in medical care settings for this age group.
