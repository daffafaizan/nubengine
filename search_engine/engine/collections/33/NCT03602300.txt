      proposed commercial manufacturer (Doppel Farmaceutici, Italy). Tablets manufactured by Doppel
      Farmaceutici are intended to be used in subsequent clinical trials and be registered as the
      commercial product. The purpose of this Phase 1, Open-Label, Four-Period, Two-Sequence,
      Two-Treatment, Single Dose, Randomized, Crossover Bioequivalence Study is to assess if
      ravidasvir 200 mg tablets supplied by European Egyptian Pharmaceutical Industries (EEPI) and
      tablets from Doppel Farmaceutici are bioequivalent.

      Primary objectives:

      To compare the rate and extent of absorption for ravidasvir (RDV) when administered as a
      single 200 mg oral dose of the proposed commercial product ("test") produced by Doppel
      Farmaceutici with the clinical trial product ("reference") manufactured by EEPI in healthy
      volunteers, under fasted conditions.

      Secondary objectives To evaluate the safety and tolerability of single oral doses of RDV in
      healthy volunteers.
