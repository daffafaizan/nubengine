    
      70 patients with suspicious oral lichen planus; atrophic and bullous erosive forms will be
      included for conventional clinical examination under incandescent projected light. Using
      biopsy as a gold standard, all patients will be biopsied.

      Blood Samples For all participants, the blood samples will be drawn between 08:00 and 09:00
      AM, after a fasting period of 12 hours, and analysis were performed within 2 hours of the
      sampling. The MPV and other hematologic parameters will be measured in a blood sample that
      will be collected in tubes containing EDTA. Complete blood cell analysis will be performed in
      hematology laboratory, New Kasr Al-Aini Teaching Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Cairo
      University. For reliable MPV measurement, the investigator will standardize the time delay
      between sampling and analysis to <2 hours for all patients.

      Biopsy preparation A surgical biopsy will be performed for histopathological assessment. All
      clinically identified lesions underwent biopsies where specimens will be placed in 10%
      buffered formalin for fixation. Paraffin embedded material will be cut into 4 Î¼m thick
      sections and will be stained with haematoxylin + eosin then submitted for histopathological
      evaluation by a senior oral pathologist blinded to the clinical findings.

      Statistical analysis

      The collected data will be entered through the SPSS version 18.0 software. Sensitivity,
      Specificity, Positive Predictive Value (PPV), Negative Predictive Value (NPV) and Accuracy
      were calculated for MPV. The results will be compared with histopathological results using
      Chi-Square test with p value set as < 0.05.
