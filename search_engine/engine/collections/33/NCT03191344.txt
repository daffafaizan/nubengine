      investigators will establish the Intraoperative Parathyroid Scores System by parathyroid size
      and Blood supply, and recording IPSS, according to certain rules. We expand IPSS, including
      the description of the location of parathyroid after postoperative.Parathyroid hormone and
      calcium were test in d0, d1, d14, d60 post operation. The correlation between Intraoperative
      Parathyroid Scores and PTH calcium were calculated, and ROC curve and logistic regression
      were tested for the prediction value.and after that we further evaluate the relationship
      Between IPSS and calcium supplement time.and Whether IPSS enhance ability of parathyroid
      recognition for clinical doctors.
