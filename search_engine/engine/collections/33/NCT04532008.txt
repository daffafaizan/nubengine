      International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh and a local NGO, we
      recruited 48 depressed rural housewives for the study. Participants were randomized into
      intervention in control groups. The intervention groups (n=24) received 12 sessions of
      evidence based depression treatment, financial literacy education, agricultural training and
      skill building. They opened bank accounts and saved for six months. At the end of the six
      month period, participants who had met savings and attendance requirements received a cash
      transfer of approximately $186, which was used to purchase a productive asset. 22
      participants purchased an agricultural animal, usually a goat; 1 financed a small retail
      business, and 1 leased land to grow crops for sale. Depression scores on the PHD-9 were
      sharply reduced. The study had 100% retention.
