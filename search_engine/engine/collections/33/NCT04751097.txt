    
      Research Question:

      • What is the feasibility of conducting a large scale study to identify modifiable
      musculoskeletal factors, increasing the risk of falls in older adults; that can be detected
      in mobility data collected from a wearable device worn during activities of daily living?

      Primary aim:

      • To collect feasibility data on study processes, resource and management.

      Secondary aims:

        -  Assess the preliminary efficacy of 'Wearable technology' in predicting falls risk in
           older adults during activities of daily living.

        -  Assess the preliminary efficacy of identifying musculoskeletal factors predisposing to
           mobility issues that are associated with or protective against falls.

        -  Assess the preliminary efficacy of specifically treating these musculoskeletal factors
           compared with traditional care?
