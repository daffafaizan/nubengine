      breast cancer to reduce the risk of recurrence and death. Moreover several data support that
      the prolongation of hormonal therapy (i.e. 10 years of hormonal treatment) is associated with
      statistical improved outcome.

      In order to achieve the benefit related to hormonal therapy all women have to be treated
      despite the fact that the data and analyses are unable to differentiate as to whether a small
      prolongation in survival accrues to all women treated or a few patients survive who would
      otherwise have died. Moreover the hormonal therapy is associated with side effects that may
      impact the quality of life of the patients.

      Patients are more likely to accept treatment on the basis of presented relative rather than
      absolute risks and so the question arises as to whether unrealistic improvements in outcome
      are expected by patients.

      The interviews with patients in the proposed trial will elicit the expected gains both in
      terms of survival and life years and will be able to assess the proportion of patients who
      considered an improvement of realistic size was sufficient to justify the treatment and the
      prolongation of the treatment.

      Several studies showed that choices are guided by the personal attitude to react and adapt to
      traumatic events, individual resilience.

      It is important therefore to consider also the influence of these factors on the patients'
      treatment preferences.

      For this reason, besides the elicitation of preferences, resilience and reaction to traumatic
      events will be assessed thorough validated questionnaires.
