      migraine sufferers. Migraine Associated Vertigo (MAV) has a dramatic impact on daily life,
      impacting work, relationships, and even activities of daily living. At the current time, the
      mainstay of therapy for migraine is pharmaceutical intervention, either acute (particularly
      triptans, 2) or preventative. However, this therapy has a delayed effect and can lead to a
      host of side effects.

      In this project we examine a device that has shown promise and might be beneficial for
      treating or improving the course of recovery from MAV. The Otoband is a transcranial
      vibrating system to be placed against the skull, preferably over the mastoid bone, behind the
      ear. To date, the device has only been systematically tested on healthy volunteers and has
      shown improvement of vertigo symptoms during the use of virtual reality systems and road
      motion sickness.

      Individuals identified at Jefferson University medical center with a history of MAV attacks
      will be referred to the Otolaryngology Department where their diagnosis will be confirmed and
      offered to enroll in the study. Participants will be able to take home an Otoband to wear
      when they have MAV attacks. The Otoband will be set at the effective power (proved to reduce
      vertigo symptoms in previous studies) and low power (proved to not impact vertigo symptoms,
      considered as sham device). Participants will have to assay their vertigo symptoms before,
      during and immediately after wearing the Otoband to evaluate the efficacy of the device.
