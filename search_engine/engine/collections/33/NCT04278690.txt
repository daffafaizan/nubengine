      leveraging health literacy approaches and mobile technology to reinforce provider counseling
      and support parent medication management after discharge from the NICU. We will
      adapt/integrate evidence-based strategies studied in less complex populations, for this
      vulnerable group. The HELPix (Health Education and Literacy for Parents) pictogram-based
      intervention, developed by our team, incorporates these strategies, with sizeable
      improvements found in medication knowledge, dosing errors, and adherence in outpatient
      general pediatric settings, but to date, HELPix has not been studied in NICU settings
