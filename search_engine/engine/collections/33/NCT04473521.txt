      4-period, cross-over study to evaluate maximum maxillary bite force in a population of full
      maxillary denture wearers. This study consists of 5 visits (1 screening visit and 4 treatment
      periods including minimum washout period of 2 days between treatment visits). Participant's
      maxillary and mandibular dentures will be assessed for retention and stability using KO index
      and whether they are well made. Participants will be randomized to one of the 4 treatment
      groups i.e. No adhesive, Super Poligrip Free (SPF), Investigational Adhesive and
      Investigational Adhesive + Hot drink arm group and will undergo an oral soft tissue (OST) and
      Oral Hard Tissue (OHT) examination. Participants who will meet all the inclusion and no
      exclusion criteria will continue the study. Participants will complete the BF measurement, KO
      assessment, OST, OHT examination and participants 'perception questionnaire as per the
      schedule.
