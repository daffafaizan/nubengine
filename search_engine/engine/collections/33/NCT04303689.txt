      reactivity and blood pressure is evaluated. Colchicine is a commonly used anti-inflammatory
      medication approved for the treatment of gout, Familial Mediterranean Fever and pericarditis
      in Denmark. The current project idea is based on accumulating evidence in the literature for
      a beneficial role of colchicine treatment in the prevention of cardiovascular disease in
      parallel with novel mechanistic insight from research of the investigators. Recently,
      colchicine was associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease, including reduced
      myocardial infarctions, strokes and acute coronary syndrome. However, none of these trials
      have investigated the effect of colchicine on arterial tone or stiffness, changes to which
      may underlie the reduced risk of cardiovascular disease associated with colchicine. In
      support of thehypothesis that colchicine will improve vascular reactivity, a study in 1985 by
      Lagrue et al. found that daily, low-dose colchicine improved arterial stiffness in a small
      cohort of hypertensive patients. More recently, colchicine was shown to improve arterial
      stiffness in patients with Familial Mediterranean fever supporting a cardiovascular
      protective role of colchicine. Finally, colchicine is also proposed to have anti-inflammatory
      effects in the vascular system.
