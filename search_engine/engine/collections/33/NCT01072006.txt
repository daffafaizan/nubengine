      is unclear as to whether this is related to an inability to focus on relevant information or
      ignore non-relevant information. History of TBI and PTSD are common to returning soldiers
      from OEF/OIF and thus is highly relevant to veteran health care. It is unclear how TBI and
      PTSD separately, and together, affect one's ability to focus attention versus inhibit
      distracting stimuli. This research investigates this issue by use of a working memory
      paradigm with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) that entails the subject being
      instructed to ignore some stimuli and remember other stimuli resulting in discrete biomarkers
      of (1) task-related enhancement of neural processes as well as (2) suppression of
      task-irrelevant neural processes. In this way, the specific aspect of attention in TBI and
      PTSD will be elucidated in addition to exploring whether PTSD and TBI have an additive, or
      even synergist, effect when combined.
