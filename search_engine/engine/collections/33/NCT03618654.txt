    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To investigate the combined effect of metformin and durvalumab on the immune tumor
      microenvironment, specifically with respect to alterations in T cell polarization (Th1/Th2
      ratio) and tumor associated macrophage (TAM) (M1/M2 ratio) as measured by cytokine shifts in
      tumor specimens and peripheral blood.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To investigate the combined effect of metformin and durvalumab on the metabolic
      microenvironment, specifically with respect to alterations in immunohistochemical markers of
      the reverse Warburg effect.

      II. To further characterize the alterations in intratumoral immune cell populations (effector
      T cells [Teff], regulatory T cells [Tregs], tumor associated macrophages [TAMs], and
      myeloid-derived suppressor cells [MDSC]).

      III. To assess changes of the intratumoral immunophenotype and metabolism after exposure to
      durvalumab and metformin by transcriptome analysis using a ribonucleic acid-sequencing
      (RNA-seq) transcriptome analysis.

      IV. To assess the efficacy of combined durvalumab and metformin treatment prior to surgery as
      determined by radiographic response and immune-related response criteria (irRC).

      V. To assess the safety and tolerability of the combination of metformin and durvalumab.
