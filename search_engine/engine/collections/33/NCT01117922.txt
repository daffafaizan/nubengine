      pre-term birth (PTB) at <34 weeks of gestation (GA) over an 18 month period will be
      approached at the time of the postpartum hospital stay. Consenting women will be randomized
      into a usual care group or an interconceptional intervention targeting five risk conditions,
      all of which increase systemic inflammation. Our primary objective in this study is to assess
      the efficacy of our interconceptional intervention on the rate of repeat PTB.

      Participants will be randomized into one of two groups: usual care of interconceptional
      intervention. Those who are randomized into the interconceptional intervention group will be
      targeted for five risk conditions, including smoking, depression, infectious disease burden
      and maternal stress, and achieving an appropriate BMI. It is hoped that by reducing these
      seemingly disparate yet well-known risk conditions, we can reduce PTB and the subsequent
      race/ethnic disparities.
