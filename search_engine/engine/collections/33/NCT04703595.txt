    
      A descriptive cross-sectional pilot study that included 50 non-smoking patients between the
      ages of 30 and 99 years with chronic and / or refractory cough as the only manifestation or
      associated with gastroesophageal reflux.

      All patients will undergo the pertinent studies for the diagnosis of chronic cough, those who
      meet criteria for suspected gastroesophageal reflux will be asked for an esophageal phmetry
      and esophageal manometry, according to the usual clinical practice.

      Peripheral venous blood sample will be obtained for subsequent genetic analysis.

      Vibration sensitivity will be studied in all patients regardless of the presence of mutation.

      Those with alterations in vibratory sensitivity or mutations in RFC1 will be referred to the
      Neurology Service for a complementary neurological evaluation. For the molecular study of the
      DNA sample of the patients, two techniques will be used: standard Polymerase chain reaction
      amplification with primers flanking the intron 2 fragment of the RFC1 gene and amplification
      using Repeated Primed Polymerase chain reaction in 3 independent reactions.
