      gastrointestinal tract bleeding (UGIB). Intravenous (IV) PPI is more commonly used than oral
      form when overt bleeding occurs. Previous study has revealed that oral rabeprazole and IV
      omeprazole achieved similar intragastric pH elevation. It's probable that oral form and IV
      PPI provide equal efficacy in treating mild to moderate UGIB patients.

      This study aims to compare the effect of three-day oral rabeprazole and iv omeprazole on
      bleeding control in patients with mild to moderate non-variceal UGIB. The expected numbers of
      intravenous and oral PPI were 100 respectively.

      All patients presented with black to tarry stool passage or hematemesis and visited our ER
      will be evaluated to recruit into this study. They will receive regular vital sign
      monitoring, laboratory study and nasogastric tube insertion with gastric fluid aspiration.
      Esophagogastroendoscopy and hemostatic procedure if need will be performed within 12 hours.
      Those confirmed to have non-variceal UGIB, stable vital signs and agree to participate into
      this study will be randomized into two groups receiving either oral rabeprazole (20mg bid) or
      iv omeprazole (40mg qd) for three days. The presence of recurrent bleeding within three days,
      in-hospital complication and duration of hospital stay will be recorded and analyzed.

      At the end of this study, we will be able to determine whether patients treated with oral
      rabeprazole and iv pantoprazole have similar re-bleeding or complication rates and
      hospitalization days.
