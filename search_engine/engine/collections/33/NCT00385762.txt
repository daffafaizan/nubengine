      SSRIs on semen parameters. After initial screening semen analyses, subjects will take the
      SSRI paroxetine for five weeks. Serial semen analyses will be obtained while on medication
      and one month after discontinuation of medication. Comparisons between semen parameters on
      and off medication will be used to evaluate the frequency and significance of semen analysis
      changes during SSRI treatment.
