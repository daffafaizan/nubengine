      I. Assess experiences during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic of the
      health-related quality of life (HRQOL) (e.g. physical, emotional, social well-being), and
      other COVID-19-specific domains (e.g. anxiety, social interactions, finances), and the
      associations between COVID-19 experiences and COVID-19-specific distress, HRQOL and clinical
      outcomes of patients who participated in one of three clinical trials.

      II. Examine differences in outcomes between neuropathic pain patients who participated in one
      of two trials of NFB and received NFB, and neuropathic pain patients who participated in a
      non-treatment-related neuropathy study (i.e., who did not receive NFB).

      III. Evaluate the extent to which coping and resilience factors moderate the effects of
      COVID-19 experiences on COVID-19-specific distress, HRQOL and clinical outcomes.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients complete an online questionnaire over 15 minutes about their experiences regarding
      the COVID-19 pandemic including testing, risks of exposure, whether people they know have
      acquired COVID-19, as well as questions on how the pandemic has impacted their quality of
      life.
