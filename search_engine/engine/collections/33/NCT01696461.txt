      successfully mobilized and collected with a sufficient CD34+ cell dose using plerixafor as
      the mobilizing agent, using an intention-to-treat analysis. Donor mobilization following
      plerixafor will be considered successful if â‰¥ 2.0x10e6 CD34+ cells/kg recipient weight are
      collected in no more than two leukapheresis collections.

      All donors receiving plerixafor will be included in the analysis of the primary objective
      based on the intention-to-treat principle.Recipients will be classified into one of the two
      strata, myeloablative or reduced intensity, according to his/her conditioning regimen. The
      target enrollment is 64 donor/recipient pairs, 32 pairs per stratum.
