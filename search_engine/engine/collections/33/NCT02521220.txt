      any effect on clinical status, walking distance, arterial and endothelial function in
      participants with PAD.

      The investigators will use a double-blinded crossover design in which patients serve as their
      own controls. Patients who are enrolled will have two 'treatment' periods of twelve weeks
      with a wash-out period of 4 weeks in between. Patients will be randomly assigned to get
      L-citrulline in the first and placebo in the second period and vice versa.

      After a screening phase of 3 weeks, there will be a 'zero-point' measurement en then the
      first 'treatment' period of 12 weeks starts (placebo or food-supplement). Then there is a
      wash-out phase of 4 weeks after which the second 'treatment' period starts (food-supplement
      or placebo) In both periods, after 2 weeks and at the end of the period, a measurement of
      primary and secondary outcomes will be done: a questionnaire has to be filled out, treadmill
      test and flow-mediated dilation (for vessel function). The follow-up will take another 4
      weeks and will end with a phone call to check for the condition of the patient and possible
      side effects.

      Since every patient gets both placebo and the food-supplement, every patient is his/her own
      control.

      The study was completed with 24 patients in Hannover, Germany, and 25 in Melbourne,
      Australia.
