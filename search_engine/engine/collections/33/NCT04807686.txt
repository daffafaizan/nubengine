      parasitic sound that does not come from the patient's environment can interfere with each
      individual in a variable way, sometimes creating an insurmountable handicap which has not
      known any effective treatment validated to date.

      Lateral Inhibition Therapy (TIL) corrects the patient's hearing by notched amplification on
      the patient's listening soundtrack. This half-octave notch is targeted at tinnitus
      frequencies measured tonal. The device slightly increases the amplification around the notch,
      so that the cerebral cortex compensates for this "gap" in the sound spectrum, masking the
      crippling tinnitus at the same time. This research is based on a new algorithm developed by
      the SIEMENS Company which proposes an attenuation of tonal tinnitus by a TIL by notched
      amplification emitted by the hearing device, object of the study.
