      physical independence in older persons has become a major public health priority. The ability
      to ambulate without assistance is crucial for independent living and it is often the first
      ability to be lost in the process leading to disability. Older people who have impaired
      walking function need more assistance and are more likely to be placed in nursing homes, have
      a higher risk of morbidity, mortality and hospitalisation, and experience a reduced quality
      of life. The ultimate goals of the Sarcopenia and Physical fRailty IN older people:
      multicomponenT Treatment strategies (SPRINTT) project are to offer efficient treatment
      options, based on a multicomponent intervention including physical activity, nutrition and
      information and communications technology, to physically frail, sarcopenic older persons and
      to improve their quality of life. The result will directly contribute to the long-term
      sustainability and efficiency of health- and social-care systems. The conceptualisation of
      physical frailty and sarcopenia (PF&S) as proposed in SPRINTT will promote significant
      advancements over the traditional approaches by enabling the precise operationalisation of
      the condition, a clear identification of the affected population and the rapid translation of
      findings to the clinical arena.
