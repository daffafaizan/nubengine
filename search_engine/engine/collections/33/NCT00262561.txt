      attack and stroke. The medical treatment of these patients include platelet inhibiting drugs,
      usually aspirin, to reduce the risk of ischemic events. Clopidogrel is another platelet
      inhibiting drug, which is prescribed less often, primarily because of the high costs compared
      to aspirin.

      Phenomena of 'resistance' to these drugs have been described by numerous investigators.
      Essentially resistance means that the effect of the drug described is less than expected or
      missing, as measured by various laboratory methods. We do not know which way resistance is
      best described, but it has been described that patients who are 'resistant' to either drug
      are less protected against future heart attacks or strokes.

      Main objectives:

        -  To measure the activity of platelets in these patients during aspirin treatment.

        -  To measure the activity of platelets in a minor population of these patients during
           clopidogrel treatment.

        -  To evaluate the prognostic significance of resistance to aspirin in these patients.

      Methods:

      Platelet activity is measured by the PFA-100 (Dade Behring) and by traditional turbidimetric
      aggregation.

      Endpoints:

      Myocardial infarction, unstable angina, cerebral infarction, transitory cerebral ischaemia,
      sudden deterioration of symptoms, percutaneous or surgical vascular intervention, amputation,
      death.
