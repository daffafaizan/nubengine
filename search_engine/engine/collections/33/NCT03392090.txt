      (DFCI) and DFCI-affiliate at St. Elizabeth's Hospital who are being treated for their cancer.
      The purpose of the study is to test the implementation of a short video, a brief
      questionnaire, and a wallet card designed to help patients understand and articulate their
      goals and preferences when making decisions about their cancer treatment and communicate
      these preferences to their clinicians.

      The short video and brief questionnaire were developed to help patients with cancer think
      about their goals of care and their treatment and information preferences and to prompt
      discussions with their health care team about these preferences. The wallet card is designed
      to help patients remember some key questions that may be useful as they make decisions about
      future treatments

      A pilot test will be completed to assess the feasibility and usability of the revised "More
      Good Days" video, brief questionnaire and wallet card in helping seriously-ill cancer
      patients think about what a good day means to them and test whether these tools can help
      patients to identify and communicate their medical treatment preferences and goals with their
      care team.
