      psychomotor development was evaluated according to the Bayley Scales of Infant
      Development-III (BSID-III) at 2 years CA. An intermediate point was provided at 9 months CA.
      Pediatric standardized assessments and psychologist semi-directive interviews were conducted.
      Parents also completed a self-administering questionnaire relating to the post-traumatic
      stress. The intervention consisted on 20 therapy sessions between 2 and 9 months CA, in order
      to support infants' development, and parent-infant interactions and adjustment.
