      by a rapidly increasing understanding of cancer pathophysiology. Furthermore, OAMs' popular
      ease of administration and potential cost savings has highlighted their central position in
      the healthcare system as a whole. Importantly, these facts have heightened appreciation of
      the unique challenges associated with OAMs use, especially in relation to prescribing,
      dispensing, reimbursement, education, adherence, and comprehensive quality and safety
      assurance. In this regard, the investigators goal is to improve medication adherence and
      clinical outcomes for cancer patients using OAMs through a mobile-enabled, multi-modal
      self-management and educational intervention .

      The intervention seeks to enable patients' self-efficacy to adhere to their medications
      through directed education and coaching, anticipation of symptoms and associated adverse
      events, and closer monitoring with accurate assessment of self-reported outcomes. This
      innovative approach necessarily includes personalizing feedback and management based on
      patients' own treatment regimen, baseline knowledge and elucidated barriers to adherence, and
      holds great promise in improving overall adherence, safety, and clinical outcomes in these
      patients.

      The investigators hypothesize that cancer patients on OAMs who use a mobile-based,
      multi-modal health self-management (M health) intervention designed for extensive patient
      education and symptom management will be better connected to their care team and will develop
      increased competency for self-care which will primarily increase medication adherence and
      improve secondary outcomes measured in this study compared to cancer patients on OAMs who do
      not use the mobile-based intervention.
