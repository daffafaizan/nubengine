      measuring vascular inflammation, which has been previously examined in atherosclerosis using
      68Ga-DOTATATE. To test the hypothesis that SST2 PET imaging can accurately identify LVV,
      patients with active GCA or Takayasu arteritis will undergo vascular 68Ga-DOTATATE or
      18F-fluoroethyltriazole-(Tyr3)-octreotate (FETO) PET-MRI at baseline, with repeat imaging
      after 6 months of treatment. A group of individuals with LVV in clinical remission will also
      undergo SST2 PET imaging. Data from patients with clinically inactive disease will serve to
      confirm tracer specificity for active disease, as well as signal reproducibility. 18F-FETO is
      an alternative SST2 tracer to 68Ga-DOTATATE; the longer half-life and shorter positron range
      of 18F compared to 68Ga may offer several advantages, including wider tracer availability and
      improved spatial resolution when imaging small arteries. All patients will also undergo
      18F-FDG imaging before treatment, where clinically indicated.
