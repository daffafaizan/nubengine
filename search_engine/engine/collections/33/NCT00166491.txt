      ill patients. A number of look-up algorithms based on hourly glucose measurements and
      titrated intravenous insulin have been developed for the intensive care unit (ICU). Despite
      the numerous published algorithms, no study has investigated which algorithm results in
      optimal glycemic control in critically ill patients. The purpose of this trial is to compare
      two institutionally approved intravenous insulin administration algorithms and describe
      subsequent glycemic control. We hypothesize that the protocol that allows for variable
      insulin administration for a given blood glucose (multiple algorithms) will be associated
      with more optimal glycemic control. Optimal glycemic control will be defined by time spent
      within a predetermined blood glucose range. In addition, the number of hypoglycemic episodes
      and mean and maximum blood glucose concentrations will also be measured. This trial will
      determine which insulin infusion algorithm is most effective in terms of glycemic control,
      and allow for standardization of glucose management in accordance with best practice.
