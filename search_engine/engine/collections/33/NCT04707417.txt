      (allo-HSCT). The main objective is to investigate the impact of home care on transplant
      specific variables and quality of life (QoL). The main hypothesis is that home care patients
      will home care patients will have significantly better measured QoL than patients receiving
      in-hospital care during the first 6 weeks after allo-HSCT. The study will be conducted as
      part of routine care at the departement of haematology, Oslo University Hospital.

      There are qualitative and quantitative aspects to the study. The qualitative part involves
      focus groups interviews with patients that have been treated with allo-HSCT and have recieved
      home care and their caregivers.

      In the prospective observational cohort study data will be collected to compare patients
      receiving home care and patients treated in-hospital (control group). Patients in both groups
      wil answer the questionnaire EORTC QLQ-C30 once weekly for 6 weeks. In addition transplant-
      and treatment-specific variables will be collected and compares between the groups.
