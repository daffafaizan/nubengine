      cycles 3, 5 and 7:

        -  Classical, intermediate, nonclassical and Tie2 expressing monocytes.

        -  Regulatory T cells (Treg).

        -  Myeloid Derived Suppressor cells (MDSCs) The variation of the absolute numbers (or
           relative percentages) of the cells in the blood of patients will be correlated to the
           response to treatment assessed according to the RANO criteria.
