      type 2 diabetes. Coffee contains caffeine and several other components that may modulate
      glucose regulation. The chlorogenic acids (CGA) in coffee have been indicated as constituents
      that may help to normalize the acute glucose response after a carbohydrate challenge. The aim
      of this study was to investigate whether two coffee beverages that differ in CGA content due
      to different roasting degrees will affect glucose regulation differently.

      In a controlled crossover trial, 11 healthy fasted volunteers consumed 300 mL of either light
      roasted (LIR) or dark roasted (DAR) coffee, or water, followed 30 min later by a 75-g oral
      glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Blood samples were drawn at baseline, 30, 60 and 120 min.
      Differences in glucose and insulin responses and insulin sensitivity index (ISI) were
      analyzed. The CGA and caffeine contents in the coffees were analyzed using UPLC-MS/MS.
