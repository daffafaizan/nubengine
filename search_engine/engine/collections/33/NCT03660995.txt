      the protocol. Due to the lack of specific standardized tests, the diagnostic of specific
      language-impaired French children is a challenge. Thus, both a battery of standardized and
      non-standardized language tests (assessing the different levels: formal, semantic and
      pragmatic) will be administered to children to establish a profile of weaknesses for each
      child with SLI and to examine the relationships between SLI and procedural learning. DNA
      sampling will be conducted on each child, SLI and control, to allow subsequently the
      molecular analyses in order to run the association comparisons between behavioral data and
      genetic profiles.

      The protocol includes as verbal standardized tests: the Echelle "Vocabulaire en Images
      Peabody" (EVIP;), the "Epreuve de COmpreÂ´hension Syntaxico-SEmantique" (ECOSSE), two specific
      subtests (lexicon and grammar) of the "Evaluation du Langage Oral" (ELO;), and as
      non-standardized tests: a semantic inference task (drawing the meaning of new words from the
      context, and the meaning of predicative metaphors), and a pragmatic inference task
      (understanding of indirect requests, on speakers' intention meaning and on irony). The
      procedural learning skills will be assessed thanks to a serial reaction task, specifically
      adapted for children).

      The complete sequencing of FoXP2 gene, as well as the genotyping of the 44 single nucleotide
      polymorphisms (SNPs), located in the risk haplotypes identified in ATP2C2, CMIP, CNTNAP2
      genes and in the KIAA0319/TTRAP/THEM2 locus, will be conducted.
