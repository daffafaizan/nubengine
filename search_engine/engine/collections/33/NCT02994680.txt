    
      Randomized, controlled field trial of an LPG stove and fuel distribution intervention
      compared to standard cooking practices with open-fire biomass-burning stoves in the homes of
      participating adult women aged 25-64 years. The aim is to determine whether provision of
      cleaner fuels will result in important reductions in household air pollutants and
      consequently in an improvement in cardiopulmonary health outcomes over a one-year period.
      Participants randomly assigned to the intervention arm will receive a free LPG stove and fuel
      delivered to their homes during the one-year intervention period. Participants randomly
      assigned to the control arm will receive a free LPG stove and vouchers that can be used to
      obtain free fuel for an entire year at LPG fuel distribution centers at the end of the
      one-year intervention period. All participants will be followed for a second year to assess
      patterns and impacts of sustained use (intervention arm) and initial adoption (control arm).
