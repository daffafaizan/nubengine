      administered as protein drinks, is capable to influence the plasma lipids positively.

      Consequently, the physiological effects of a mixed diet containing 25 g lupin protein isolate
      per day will be investigated compared to 1) a diet containing 25 g of milk protein as well as
      to 2) a diet with 25 g milk protein and additionally the amino acid arginine supplemented
      daily.

      A double-blinded, controlled, randomized cross-over trial will be performed. Altogether 75
      volunteers with hypercholesterolemia will be divided into three groups of 25 subjects each.
      After a run-in period (baseline), the first group will consume foods with lupin protein
      isolate (group A), the second group will receive the same foods with milk protein isolate
      (group B) and the third group will consume the foods with milk protein and 1,6 g arginine per
      day over a period of four weeks. After a wash-out period of six weeks, the diet will be
      crossed within the three groups for a second intervention period of four weeks. After another
      wash-out period, diet will be crossed within the three groups once again.

      Arginine will be provided as capsule (1,6 g per day = four capsules per day) in one of the
      two groups receiving foods with milk protein. In the other groups (receiving foods with lupin
      protein or milk protein only) four placebo capsules will be served, containing mannitol.
