      in Canada. Current and historical contexts of colonization and racism, disconnection from
      culture and land, as well as intergenerational trauma resulting from the legacy of
      residential schools are social drivers that elevate exposure to HIV among Indigenous peoples.
      Peer-education and arts-based interventions are increasingly used for HIV prevention with
      youth. Yet limited studies have evaluated longitudinal effects of arts-based approaches to
      HIV prevention with youth. The authors present a rationale and study protocol for an
      arts-based HIV prevention intervention with Northern and Indigenous youth in the Northwest
      Territories (NWT), Canada.

      Methods & Analysis: This is a multi-centre non-randomised cohort pilot study using a
      pre-test/post-test design with a 12-month follow-up. The target population is Northern and
      Indigenous youth in eighteen communities in the NWT. The aim is to recruit 150 youth using
      venue-based sampling at secondary schools. Participants will be involved in an arts-based
      intervention, Fostering Open eXpression among Youth (FOXY). Participants will complete a
      pre-test, post-test survey directly following the intervention, and a 12-month follow up. The
      primary outcome is new or enhanced HIV knowledge, and secondary outcomes to include: new or
      enhanced STI knowledge, and increased self-esteem, resilience, empowerment, safer sex
      self-efficacy, and cultural connectedness. Mixed effects regression analyses will be
      conducted to evaluate pre- and post-test differences in outcome measurement scores.

      Ethics and Dissemination: This study has received approval from the HIV Research Ethics Board
      at the University of Toronto (REB: 31602).
