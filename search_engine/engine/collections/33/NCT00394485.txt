      comparison to tiotropium plus placebo in Filipino patients seen in Manila, with moderate
      COPD.

      After a 1-week wash-out period, 6-minute walk test, and St. George's Respiratory
      Questionnaire (SGRQ) will then be administered prior to a run-in period of 1 week wherein all
      patients will be started on tiotropium alone. The patients will then be randomly allocated to
      either of the two arms for a two-week treatment, followed by one week washout, and
      crossed-over to the other treatment for another two weeks. The procaterol or placebo dose is
      given 2 hrs after the tiotropium dose.
