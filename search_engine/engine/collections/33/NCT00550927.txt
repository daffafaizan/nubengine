        -  To determine the recommended phase II doses of enzastaurin hydrochloride and bevacizumab
           that may be safely administered to patients with locally advanced or metastatic
           malignancies.

        -  To characterize the toxicities of enzastaurin hydrochloride and bevacizumab in these
           patients.

        -  To document the antitumor activity of enzastaurin hydrochloride and bevacizumab in these
           patients.

        -  To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of enzastaurin hydrochloride and bevacizumab in these
           patients.

        -  To assess GSK3β as a biomarker relevant to enzastaurin hydrochloride and its correlation
           with clinical outcome in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of enzastaurin hydrochloride and bevacizumab.

      Patients receive oral enzastaurin hydrochloride once, twice, or three times daily on days
      1-21 or days 1-28 and bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1 or days 1 and 15. Courses
      repeat every 21 or 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Blood samples are collected periodically during study for pharmacokinetic evaluation. Samples
      are also analyzed for biomarker (GSK3β) by ELISA.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 30 days.

      National Cancer Institute (NCI) registered this trial with Eli Lilly as sponsor. NCI did not
      update the record. In June 2012, NCI transferred the trial to Lilly's clinicaltrials.gov
      account and Lilly updated the record with the trial status and trial completion dates. This
      trial is not an applicable trial under Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007
      (FDAAA).
