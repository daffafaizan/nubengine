      Considering that multifidus muscles, composed of the spinous transverse rotators muscles and
      spinous transverse multifidus muscles, are fundamental both for the static and for the
      dynamics of the lumbar spine, particularly for the region of L-3, the treatment of this
      musculature with ultrasound-guided percutaneous neuromodulation in patients with nonspecific
      chronic low back pain must have an analgesic repercussion in this nociceptive process.

      Therefore, given that neuromodulation has been considered as a more than effective treatment
      in painful symptomatology and that diverse scientific literature has proven the activity of
      the multifida musculature directly affects the stability and mobility of the lumbar spine, it
      is more than likely interventions with neuromodulative treatments in the multifidus
      musculature at the level of the third lumbar vertebrae have positive results in Non-specific
      Chronic Low Back Pain.
