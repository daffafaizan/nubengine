      allergic diseases. Investigators are interested to know weather qi-tonifying herbal medicine
      is through the changes of gut microbiota to modulate human immunity. In this study, a
      double-blinded, randomized, placebo control design is applied and total 60 perennial allergic
      rhinitis patients will be enrolled in our study. All subjects will be divided into
      Bu-Zhong-Yi-Qi-Tang (BZYQT) and placebo control groups, 40 and 20 subjects each. Subjects of
      BZYQT group will receive capsule of BZYQT, 4gm tid, 12gm a day, while control group will
      receive similar placebo capsule with same scheme. Total 2 months treatment course will be
      done. Gut microbiota will be assayed before and after 2 months treatment. Additionally,
      various parameters for immunologic response will be checked before and after the treatment,
      including the total IgE amount, the ratio of CD4/CD8 of T lymphocytes, the profile of
      cytokine such as IL-10 and IL-12 as well as functional change of dendritic cells and T cells.
      Results will be analyzed statistically including gender analysis. This study will provide the
      evidences of gut microbiota changes and immune-modulatory effects of BZYQT for the treatment
      of allergic rhinitis.
