      (handedness) is largely dependent on the action of a single locus, is to collect samples
      allowing us to map a "handedness gene" via detection of linkage to any of eight potential
      candidate genes/regions or via a whole or partial genome scan. We calculate that a full 300
      marker genome scan of 100 parents and sibling pairs (allowing linkage analysis at 10 cM
      resolution), or the equivalent amount of data from partial scans of 300 families, has a high
      likelihood of allowing us to map the proposed gene. Eligible families, consisting of pairs of
      left-handed siblings plus at least one right-handed parent, were identified during Phase I of
      this study in 1996-1998, with approval from the now-lapsed FCRDC IRB. In Phase II of this
      study, we have collected cheek swab samples for DNA isolation from members of 100 eligible
      families for use in the mapping studies. DNA samples will not be linked back to individuals
      but grouped under a random family code that links to a database with limited information,
      including hand use preference and family structure. In the next phase, we wish to map the
      locus from cheek swab samples we have on hand.
