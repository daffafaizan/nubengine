      for severe disease. Up to 40 patients with symptoms of COVID-19 infection are confirmed by
      Real-Time Reverse Transcriptase (RT)-PCR, will be enrolled in up to 20 investigational sites.
      Once patients are identified and consented, either a double-lumen hemodialysis catheter,
      arteriovenous fistula, or graft must be present for treatment. Patients will receive a four
      to six-hour treatment with the Hemopurifier® extracorporeal therapy daily for up to four days
      until discontinued because of clinical improvement or deterioration or upon the decision of
      the Principal Investigator. The Hemopurifier® will be placed within the extracorporeal
      circuit and with all connections secured, treatment will utilize a blood pump at an initial
      flow rate of 100mL/min. The blood flow rate is to be increased gradually in a stepwise
      fashion over the first minutes to a maximum blood flow rate of 200mL/min. The circuit must be
      continually monitored for blood leaks and blood clotting within the device. If the treatment
      is halted before 4 hours, another device may be connected, and the treatment may be restarted
      with a goal of achieving a minimum of 4 hours of therapy. If the device shows signs of
      clotting or blood leaks, the treatment must be paused, the blood will be returned to the
      patient and a new device will be placed within the extracorporeal circuit. The therapy will
      be resumed with consideration of altering the level of anticoagulation.
