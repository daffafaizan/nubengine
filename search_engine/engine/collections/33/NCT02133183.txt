      I. To evaluate the penetration of sapanisertib (MLN0128 [TAK-228]) across the blood brain
      barrier and achieve a concentration of 70 nM in tissue resected from a contrast enhancing
      region of the tumor in 60% of recurrent glioblastoma (GBM) patients. (Part I) II. To
      determine the ability of MLN0128 (TAK-228) to inhibit TOR complex (TORC)1/2 in the enhancing
      components of the tumor as determined by modulation of RPS6 phosphorylated Ser-235 (pS235) in
      reverse phase protein array (RPPA) assays. (Part II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the penetration of MLN0128 (TAK-228) across the blood brain barrier by
      determining its concentration in tissue resected from a non-contrast enhancing region of the
      tumor. (Part I) II. To assess the plasma pharmacokinetics of MLN0128 (TAK-228) in patients
      with recurrent GBM. (Part I) III. To determine the ability of MLN0128 (TAK-228) to inhibit
      TORC1/2 in the non-enhancing components of the tumor as determined by modulation of RPS6
      pS235 in RPPA assays. (Part II) IV. To assess the ability of MLN0128 (TAK-228) to inhibit
      TORC1/2 by evaluating pharmacodynamics (PD) markers by immunohistochemistry such as pS235,
      pS236, phosphorylated 4E-binding protein (p4EBP), phosphorylated-mechanistic target of
      rapamycin (serine/threonine kinase) (pmTOR), and AKTpSer473. (Phase II) V. To evaluate the
      safety profile of MLN0128 (TAK-228) in pre-operative patients with recurrent GBM.

      VI. To estimate response rate, progression-free survival, and overall survival.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To perform mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) to qualitatively assess the ability of MLN0128
      (TAK-228) to penetrate the blood brain barrier and enter tumor tissue in enhancing and
      non-enhancing regions of the tumor. (Part I) II. To determine ex-vivo sensitivity of tumor
      neurosphere cultures (patient derived cell lines [PDCL]) established from surgical specimens
      to MLN0128 (TAK-228). (Part II) III. To explore the potential association of tumor genotype
      with progression-free survival among patients treated with MLN0128 (TAK-228). (Part II) IV.
      To determine the ability of MLN0128 (TAK-228) to inhibit TORC1/2 as determined by modulation
      of additional TORC1/2 markers in RPPA assays. (Part II)

      OUTLINE:

      PART I:

      COHORT A: Patients receive sapanisertib orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 7-9 days (including
      2-4 hours before surgery). On day 0, patients undergo surgery. Within 45 days after surgery,
      patients receive sapanisertib PO QD. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. If patients do not demonstrate adequate sapanisertib
      tumor tissue concentrations, patients are enrolled in Cohort B.

      COHORT B: Patients receive sapanisertib PO 2-4 hours before surgery on day 0. Within 45 days
      after surgery, patients receive sapanisertib PO once weekly. Courses repeat every 28 days in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PART II: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive sapanisertib PO according to the results from Part I. Patients also
      undergo surgery on day 0. Within 30 days after surgery, patients receive sapanisertib PO
      according to the results from Part I. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients undergo surgery on day 0. Within 30 days after surgery, patients receive
      sapanisertib PO according to the results from Part I. Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 2 months for
      2 years, and then every 6 months thereafter.
