      The primary objective is to assess the proportion of patients who experienced a surgical site
      infection. Surgical site infection is defined as either deep or superficial. The presence of
      tibia infection will be defined by the criteria of CDC.

      Secondary Objective(s):

        -  Proportion of patients with reoperation (secondary procedures)

        -  Bone union (until radiographically healed)

        -  Proportion of patients with complications / Adverse Events related to implant or surgery

        -  Only Subgroup: WOMAC-Score, AOFAS, SF36, EQ5D.

      Hypothesis and Statistical considerations and estimated enrollment:

      We hypothesize that with the use of antibiotic coating implants like the ETN/ UTN-PROtect the
      risk of implant-associated infections and osteomyelitis is reduced in treatment of Tibia
      fractures or in cases of revision surgery in the tibia. In a retrospective manner the
      implanted gentamicin-coated and uncoated tibia nail procedures are evaluated. In the subgroup
      of patients with a currently implanted gentamicin-coated nail the incidence of surgical site
      infection and implant-associated infections will be assessed prospectively.

      This study is exploratory in nature. Therefore, there is no formal statistical hypothesis and
      no formal sample size calculation. Approximately 620 tibial shaft fractures are expected to
      be included in the 12 months enrollment period.

      Data will be analyzed with the use of simple summary statistics. Depending on the volume and
      quality of the collected data, different statistical analyses will be applied. Exploratory
      analyses will be conducted to investigate relationships between the different treatment
      options and the outcomes.
