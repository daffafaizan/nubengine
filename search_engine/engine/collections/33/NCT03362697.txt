    
      Randomized controlled trial, aimed to evaluate the efficacy of Lactobacillus reuteri DSM
      16666/ATCC 55845 & Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938 for the treatment of pregnant women with
      asymptomatic bacteriuria or uncomplicated acute cystitis. As primary outcome we will evaluate
      the number of cases with clinical (symptoms severity) or bacteriological cure in pregnant
      women with uncomplicated cystitis or asymptomatic bacteriuria after 7 days treatment with
      probiotics vs. placebo. As secondary outcome we will evaluate a) rate of recurrence cases in
      each group; b) time to relapse; c) frequency of pyelonephritis; d) birth weight and head
      circumference; d) number of cases of preterm babies (less than 36 weeks of gestation); e)
      frequency of antibiotic as rescue treatment; f) frequency of adverse related events in each
      arm and g) frequency of preeclampsia. Women on active group will receive a combination of at
      least 5*10^8 CFU of Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 16666/ATCC 55845 & Lactobacillus reuteri DSM
      17938, PAC-A and Zinc. Women in control group will receive o Amoxicillin + clavulanic acid
      (500 mg twice daily) for seven days in patients with negative nitrites in dipstick or oral
      nitrofurantoin (200mg twice per day) ror patients with positive dipstick.
