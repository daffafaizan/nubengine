    
      A total of 1160 hypovitaminosis D patients (12 ng/ml â‰¤ serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 < 20 ng/ml)
      without uterine fibroids will be randomly assigned in a ratio of 1:1 to two groups:
      intervention group and control group. The intervention group will receive 1600 IU/d of
      vitamin D3; the control group will receive regular follow-up. Patients will be followed up at
      the same time points for 24 months. The outcome measure is the incidence of uterine fibroids
      in different groups.
