      hemodialysis linked to an increased risk of atherosclerosis and increased bleeding tendency.
      The overall aim of this study is to investigate the underlying causes of the reported low
      vitamin K status and to improve the patients' vitamin K status through diet and supplement.
      The study is divided in 5 sub-trials listed below. Sub-trial 1-4 focuses on determining the
      underlying course of low vitamin K status while sub-trial 5 deals with possible solutions to
      the reported low vitamin K status.

      The analysis method used to determine vitamin K status is dephosphorylated-uncarboxylated
      Matrix-Gla-Protein (dp-ucMGP). Dp-ucMGP is the inactive form of the protein MGP whose
      activation is vitamin K dependent. The dp-ucMGP analysis method is not a direct measure of
      vitamin K status. However, an increased concentration of dp-ucMGP is a manifestation of a low
      vitamin K status and vice versa.

      Sub-trial 1: Intake of vitamin K Aim: To assess the patients' intake of vitamin K.
      Hypothesis: The daily intake of vitamin K is insufficient. Method: Patients are asked to fill
      out a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). The FFQ is based on their intake of different foods
      rich in vitamin K during the last month. To compare the results from the FFQ with their
      actual vitamin K status a blood sample is collected and analyzed to determine dp-ucMGP.
      Participants: 30.

      Sub-trial 2: The influence of dialysis Aim: To examine whether vitamin K status is
      compromised during dialysis. Hypothesis: Vitamin K is removed from the blood during dialysis.
      Method: A blood test is collected before and after dialysis and analyzed to determine
      dp-ucMGP. At the end of the dialysis a sample of the remaining dialysis-water is collected
      and analyzed to determine dp-ucMGP. Furthermore, the patients will be weighed before and
      after dialysis with the purpose of calculating concentrations. Participants: 16 (the analysis
      of the dialysis water is done for five patients at first, if the results are useful the
      analysis is done for every participant).

      Sub-trial 3: Absorption Aim: To investigate whether a decreased absorption can be the cause
      of the low vitamin K status. Hypothesis: Absorption in the intestines is impaired. Method: A
      D-xylose test is performed. The participants are given a dose of 15g D-xylose dissolved in
      water and after one hour a sample of blood is collected to determine D-xylose in serum. Prior
      to this trial the patients need to be fasting.The patients are asked to fill out a FFQ
      concerning their intake of fat during the last month. Participants: 16

      Sub-trial 4: Concentrations of dp-ucMGP is influenced by a low protein intake. Aim: To
      determine if a low protein intake influence the dp-ucMGP analysis method. Hypothesis: The
      analysis method (dephosphorylated-uncarboxylated MGP) is influenced by the patients' protein
      intake. Method: Patients are given a daily protein supplement for 14 days. Before and after
      the intervention a blood test is collected and the concentration of dp-ucMGP is determined
      and compared. Moreover, the patients are asked to fill out a FFQ concerning their intake of
      protein during the last month. Participants: 16

      Sub-trial 5: Intervention with vitamin K Aim: To investigate whether a diet or supplement
      with tablets is best for improve vitamin K status. Hypothesis: If the intake of vitamin K is
      insufficient the diet rich in vitamin K should be sufficient. However, if absorption is
      compromised or vitamin K is influenced by dialysis a larger dose of vitamin K might be
      necessary. Method: This trial lasts for 15 weeks divided in two periods of six weeks and a
      three week wash out period in-between. One period focuses on a diet rich in vitamin K while
      dealing with the possible restrictions on phosphate, potassium and fluid for hemodialysis
      patients. The intervention in the other period consists of a supplement of 360Î¼g
      Menakinon-7/day. Blood samples are collected at the beginning, middle and end of both
      periods. These blood samples are analyzed to determine dp-uc-MGP during the intervention
      period. Moreover, coagulations factor 2, 7, 10, vitamin A and D status and calcification
      propency score analysis will be done as well if the funds allow it. Patients are asked to
      fill out a questionnaire concerning physical and mental wellbeing and the presence of
      bruising at the beginning and end of both periods to determine whether vitamin K has an
      effect. Participants: 24
