      subjects using the Phase Signal Recorder (PSR) prior to coronary angiography to machine learn
      and test an algorithm for detecting the presence of significant coronary artery disease in
      symptomatic adult patient. In addition to this primary objective, machine-learned algorithms
      will be developed and tested to report the left ventricular ejection fraction and to identify
      the location of significant coronary artery disease. The performance of the machine-learned
      algorithm will be evaluated using a comparative paired trial design. In this study, the
      physician will not be provided the results of analysis performed and, accordingly, the
      results of the analyses will not be used to guide treatment decisions for the patient.
