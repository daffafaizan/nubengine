    
      This is a prospective, randomized, single centre trial in the Queen Mary Hospital. We aim to
      recruit 400 subjects [with a minimum of 50 subjects per group] who would be qualified for the
      Hospital Authority (HA)/ Centre for Health Protection (CHP) Mass Vaccination Program for
      2010/2011 TIV. These patients include all elderly at the age of 65 or above and all adult
      patients at the age of 21 or above with chronic illness (or healthcare workers). Subjects
      will be randomly assigned into 4 groups: Group 1 (ID1) to receive a single low-dose
      intradermal injection of 2010/2011 TIV, with a microneedle device. Group 2 (ID2) to receive a
      single higher low-dose intradermal injection of 2010/2011 TIV with a microneedle device.
      Group 3 (IM15) to receive a single full-dose (15ug) standard 2010/2011 TIV delivered
      intramuscularly by conventional needle. Group 4 (INT) to receive a single low-dose
      intradermal injection of 2010/2011 TIV, with Intanza® needle. The 2010/2011 TIV used will be
      Fluzone®, Sanofi-Pasteur for group 3 and Intanza®, Sanofi-Pasteur for group 1,2 and 4.
