      period of about 18 months, studying induction chemotherapy with VELCADE, cyclophosphamide and
      dexamethasone administered on an attenuated dosing schedule to accommodate non-candidates for
      high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplantation - an often frail patient
      population. Maintenance therapy will follow with alternating lenalidomide and VELCADE. All
      patients should receive antiviral (zoster) prophylaxis, and peptic ulcer prophylaxis is
      recommended. Aspirin and/or anticoagulation are left to study physician discretion. All
      patients will be treated with the same experimental regimen. Several novel features are being
      explored: the substitution of cyclophosphamide for melphalan; once weekly AND subcutaneous
      bortezomib instead of standard twice weekly, intravenous dosing; and alternating bortezomib
      and lenalidomide in maintenance. The overarching aim is to preserve efficacy while minimizing
      toxicity and inconvenience to this often frail patient population.
