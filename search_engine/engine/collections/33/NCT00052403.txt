        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose of monoclonal
           antibody anti-anb3 integrin in patients with advanced solid tumors.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the potential anti-tumor activity of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive monoclonal antibody anti-anb3 integrin IV over 30 minutes weekly. Courses
      repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of monoclonal antibody anti-anb3 integrin
      until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose
      preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is
      determined, additional patients are treated as above at that dose level.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 27-33 patients will be accrued for this study within 9-11
      months.
