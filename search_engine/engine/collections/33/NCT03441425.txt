      be effective for learning. According to the literature, by gradually increasing stress and
      emotions, more effective learning can be achieved. However, allowing the simulated patient to
      "die", as a deliberate stressor, is controversial. There is no previous research on the
      educational effect of letting a simulated patient die. We aim to evaluate the effects of
      simulated unexpected death on skill retention, stress levels, and emotions. We hypothesize
      that the occurrence of unexpected death will impact skill retention, and will be associated
      with higher stress levels and stronger emotions.

      Methods After Institutional Research Ethics Board approval, 56 residents and fellows of
      different medical specialties will be randomized to either the intervention (unexpected
      death) or control (survive) group. Participants from both groups will have to individually
      manage a simulated cardiac arrest crisis. In the intervention group, the scenario will end by
      the death of the simulated patient, whilst in the control group the simulated patient will
      survive. Each participant will be immediately debriefed by a trained instructor. Three months
      later, skill retention will be assessed in a similar scenario. Crisis management performance
      of all scenarios will be rated by 2 blinded raters. Biological stress, cognitive appraisal,
      and emotions will be measured during both scenarios.

      Implications The impact of simulated unexpected death on skill retention of residents and
      fellows will provide instructors with evidence to optimize scenario design and approach the
      role of stress and emotions in simulation-based education.
