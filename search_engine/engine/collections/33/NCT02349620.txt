      posterior mandible. Implants with a length of 11.5 and a diameter of 4.5 mm will be inserted
      in both sides. In one side PRF will be instilled after surface treatment with PRF before
      implant placement, while no PRF was added in other side to serve as control group. All
      implants will be followed with stability measurement by means of resonance frequency analysis
      at baseline, and every two weeks up to 3 months. Bone height was measured on medial & distal
      side on standardized IOPA x-rays.
