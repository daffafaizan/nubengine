      respiratory and digestive tracts. The airway tube is elliptical in cross section ending at
      the laryngeal opening. The device contains 2 drainage channels (male and female port)
      proximally that continues into a common distal opening posterior to the distal airway cuff
      bowl. The female port allows a gastric tube to be passed into the stomach, whilst a suction
      tube may be attached to the male suction port offering removal of gastric fluid around the
      upper oesophagus sphincter.
