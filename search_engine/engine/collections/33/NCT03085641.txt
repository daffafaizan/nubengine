    
      Study population: 10 CHF patients with a Left Ventricular Injection Fraction(LVEF)< 45% and
      CSA/Cheyne Stokes Respiration (CSR) (apnoea/hypopnea index (AHI) > 15/hour); with at least
      50% of the total number of events having a central character will be included. Patients with
      other diseases that will influence the respiratory system negatively during sleep i.e.
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD Global Initiative of Obstructive Lung Diseases
      (GOLD) class 3 and 4), neuromuscular diseases and thorax cage deformities, as well as
      patients with CHF and CSA that use another form of treatment for their CSA at the time of
      inclusion, will be excluded.

      Intervention: nHFT will be titrated during a first titration night and used at home during
      the night for 4 weeks consecutively.

      Main study parameters/endpoints:

        1. To investigate the effect of nHFT with and without oxygen in reducing the
           apnoea/hypopnoea index during sleep after 4 weeks use nHFT.

        2. To investigate improvements in oxygen desaturation index, sleep quality and sleepiness,
           physical condition, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), heart beat variability
           (HRV), N-terminal natriuretic peptide (NTproBNP) after 4 weeks use nHFT .

        3. Physiological condition; work of breathing and respiratory drive and measuring
           mouth-throat pressure.
