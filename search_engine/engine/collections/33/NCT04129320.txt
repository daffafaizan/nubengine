      Module Y (enoblituzumab plus MGD013). Enrollment into Modules X and Y, with approximately 30
      patients each, will occur independently in a non-randomized fashion. Data from these modules
      will determine if further evaluation will occur in randomized Module A (Phase 2) and
      randomized Module B (Phase 3).
