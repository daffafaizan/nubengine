      mild to moderate asthma who are on short acting β2-agonist (SABA) alone, on low dose inhaled
      corticosteroid (ICS) (200-400 µg budesonide or corresponding) or on a combination of low dose
      ICS and long acting β2-agonists (LABA). Approximately 60 patients will be randomised in order
      to have 49 completed.

      The primary objective is to demonstrate therapeutic equivalence between Bricanyl Turbuhaler
      M3 and Bricanyl Turbuhaler M2 using bronchoprotective effect. Outcome measure: PC20
      (Methacholine provocative concentration causing a 20% drop in FEV1). The safety objective is
      to compare safety of Bricanyl Turbuhaler M2 and Bricanyl Turbuhaler M3. Outcome measure
      Adverse Events/Serious.

      Study period Q1 2015 - Q1 2016.
