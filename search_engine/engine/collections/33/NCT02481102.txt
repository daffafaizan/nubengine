      enrolled in up to ten (10) centers in the United States. The overall duration of the registry
      is estimated to be 18 months per site. For the patients the registry duration will be from
      the time of procedure until discharge from the hospital, estimated to be approximately four
      (4) days.

      Prior to enrollment, patients will be evaluated on the basis of the latest available data to
      establish eligibility. Eligible patients will be considered enrolled in the registry after
      written informed consent is obtained.

      As EpiAccess is only used for the access portion of the procedure, the safety performance and
      effectiveness endpoints are acute from the time of needle insertion until pericardial sac
      access is achieved. Follow up clinical examinations will be performed according to
      institutional standard of care. No special tests are required for this device.
