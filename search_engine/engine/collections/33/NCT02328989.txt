      countries and in the United States, by 35% between 1981 and 2006. Increased use of medically
      assisted procreation and older maternal age are the two main causes. At the present time twin
      pregnancies represent nearly 20% of premature deliveries. The rate of very premature births
      (< 32-34 weeks) is 7 times higher in twin pregnancies than in singleton pregnancies. As
      prematurity accounts for 75% of neonatal morbidity and mortality, and extreme prematurity is
      the principal cause of neonatal mortality and of brain sequelae in twins, the search for a
      preventive treatment appears as a priority in perinatal medicine. The investigators recently
      showed in a prospective multicenter study that cervical ultrasound at 22 and 27 wks was a
      better predictive investigation of premature delivery < 34 wks than digital examination.[1]
      As there is currently no recommended preventive treatment for prematurity in twin
      pregnancies[2], the 2009 guidelines of the College of Obstetricians leave the teams with the
      option of carrying out systematic cervical ultrasound or not during follow-up
      investigations.[3] Recently in a randomized trial in a population of short-cervix singleton
      pregnancies, the premature delivery rate decreased by 40% in the pessary group compared with
      the usual management group.[4] In a recent multicenter trial (ProTWIN), while therapeutic
      efficacy of the pessary (versus usual management) was not demonstrated in the overall group
      of twin pregnancies, in the short-cervix subgroup (< 25th percentile of the population) the <
      32 wks delivery rate decreased from 29% to 14% (OR= 0.49 (0.24-0.97) and neonatal morbidity
      also decreased.[5] No other trial of pessary use in short-cervix twin pregnancies was
      published today. Recently, in a historical comparison of twins with twin-to-twin transfusion
      syndrome treated with laser, Carreras et al. have showed a decreased rate of preterm delivery
      with the use of pessary in case of short cervix.[6] The investigators wish to set up a
      randomized multicenter study in France in the population of short-cervix twin pregnancies to
      show a potential benefit of the pessary compared with simple surveillance.
