      2005), Edinburgh laterality questionnaire (Oldfield, 1971), IQ test (IQ: PM38, Raven, 1960),
      and the PANSS (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, Kay et al., 1987). Controls will only
      have the first three tasks (cognitive spots Alert and laterality). Then all will perform all
      tasks in successive order (task 1 and task 2). For both tasks, photographs of 20 objects of
      everyday life typical grip with one hand are presented in 4 orientations. The instruction is
      to say if the object is presented upright or inverted; The second task differs from the first
      only by the introduction of a prime: presenting a hand in position "catching" before the
      picture of an object
