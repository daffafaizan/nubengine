    
      Eligible subjects were randomized 1:1 to sorafenib 800 mg daily or matching placebo.
      Progression was assessed every 8 weeks by modified RECIST criteria. Subjects had the option
      to unblind study treatment after progression and to receive open label sorafenib regardless
      of initial treatment assignment. Following discontinuation of study treatment, subjects were
      followed for survival every 3 months in long-term follow-up. Subjects who terminated study
      treatment (either double only or double blind and open label) for reasons other than death,
      lost to follow-up or consent withdrawn entered long-term follow up
