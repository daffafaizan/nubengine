      nonsurgical patients. The current standard of care for monitoring patients at risk for
      bleeding is serial measurement of hemoglobin levels. At present, the photometric
      cyanmethemoglobin method is the most widely used technique for monitoring hemoglobin in the
      lab, and is currently the gold standard. However, this method has potential for delay before
      final results are obtained.

      Immediate hemoglobin measurements are available with portable point-of-care devices such as
      the iSTAT, which can produce a measurement of hemoglobin concentration in less than 1 minute.
      Unfortunately, the accuracy of this device has been reported to vary with hemoglobin level,
      and as such may not be as accurate in detecting blood loss when compared with the gold
      standard of laboratory analysis.

      Recently, a noninvasive, spectrophotometry-based monitoring technology has been developed.
      This novel technology measures the differential optical density of wavelengths of light
      passed through the finger in a method similar to conventional pulse oximetry. While some
      studies have reported that this device appears to be accurate in patients undergoing elective
      surgical procedures, more recent work suggests that this accuracy degrades with increased
      blood loss, lower oximeter signal quality and lower absolute Hgb values.

      We will evaluate the accuracy of point-of-care and non-invasive SpHb measurements and utility
      of continuous hemoglobin monitoring in an intensive care unit setting. If these methods of
      rapid hemoglobin measurement can be validated in patients at risk for ongoing hemorrhage, use
      of this technology may result in earlier detection of ongoing hemorrhage, expedite
      appropriate treatment, and improve patient outcomes.
