      countries, including China. However, due to the review timeline difference in China, full
      enrollment was reached in the main study (NCT01940341) before China was able to participate.
      Therefore, this registration only includes the China cohorts as they were not part of the
      main study analysis. Data for China cohorts were analyzed separately after the main study
      analysis.
