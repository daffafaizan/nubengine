      prosthesis. Post op hip dislocation or hip instability is a common complication which can
      lead to the hip implants being revised. There are many types of hip prostheses manufactured
      with the aim of prolonging longevity of the prosthesis and minimizing postoperative
      complications. One of these is a new generation of dual mobility hip manufactured by Stryker
      Orthopaedics. The Anatomic Dual Mobility (ADM) and the Modular Dual Mobility (MDM) were
      designed to minimize hip dislocation/hip instability and polyethylene wear thus increasing
      the longevity of the hip prosthesis and reducing the number of re-operations for a patient.
      In this study we will be assessing the outcome of the ADM and MDM hip system.
