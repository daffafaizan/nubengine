      severity that may be useful in predicting success in smoking cessation and in development of
      new smoking cessation treatment targets.

      Study population: Four groups will be studied: target group of treatment seeking smokers;
      nontreatment seeking current smokers; never smokers and former smokers. We estimate that we
      will need n=50/group completers to have sufficient power to develop the brain/genetics
      biomarkers.

      Design: This study consists of a 4 group between/within subject design. The experimental
      group will proceed in 4 phases: Baseline (scan 1), peak withdrawal (scan 2), stable on
      e-cigarettes (scan 3), and complete abstinence (scans 4-6). Counseling will start after the
      first scan session and will generally continue weekly until scan 4 (about 12 weeks). After
      scan 4, therapeutic support will be provided at least monthly via phone until completion of
      the protocol. The non-treatment seeking smoker comparison group will be scanned twice; at
      baseline (scan 1) and at peak withdrawal (scan 2). Each of the non-smoking comparison groups
      (non- and Ex-smokers) will be scanned only at baseline (scan 1). Genetic and epigenetic
      markers will be obtained in all groups.

      Outcome measures: Network and multivariate pattern analysis, behavior on a decision making
      task and task based and resting state blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) activation in
      neural circuits relevant to nicotine addiction during fMRI scanning. Secondary outcomes
      include BOLD response comparisons between e-cigarettes and smoking and genetic markers of
      nicotine addiction and relapse susceptibility.
