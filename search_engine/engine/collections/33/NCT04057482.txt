      bacterial vaginosis. The Nugent score is a reliable method for diagnosing bacterial
      vaginosis, but similar to traditional clinical diagnostic methods, it is not equally reliable
      when utilized as a test of cure. This study demonstrated that molecular diagnostic testing
      can be used as a test of cure and this is the first molecular test that can do that.
      Treatment with dequalinium chloride vaginal tablets for 6 days had a cure rate lower than
      expected; only 37% of patients were considered cured one month after treatment.
