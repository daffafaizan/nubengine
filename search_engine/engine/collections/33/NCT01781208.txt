    
      A new technique based on ultrasound, known as Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse (ARFI) imaging
      is performed using standard approved ultrasound machines and transducers. The sound waves or
      impulses are generated in a different pattern and offer information on the stiffness of the
      tissue. This new technique will be evaluated for usefulness in diagnosing different liver
      conditions.
