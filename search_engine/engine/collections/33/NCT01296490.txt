    
      Things the investigators will measure:

        1. Filling out a physical fitness, and overall health form, that indicates all fitness
           activity in the past 3 years, and vitamins and supplements that are being taken.

        2. Fat percentage

        3. VO2 max

        4. Oxidants and antioxidants activity: Super oxide dismutase, Catalase, GSH/GSSG,
           Glutathione peroxide, Glutathione reductase, LDL, conjugated dienes, Plasma
           malondialdehyde. Measurements will be taken before the test, 5 minutes after the test
           and an hour after the test.

      Work plan:

      50 men, at the ages of 20-35 will be recruited. The participants will fill out a form that
      indicates their physical activity in the past 3 years, as well as their vitamin and
      supplements intake.

      The men will run on a treadmill for 10 minutes until exhaustion.

      Blood will be drawn before, 5 minutes after and an hour after the test. Oxidative stress will
      be measured according to the following parameters:

        -  10 ml of blood in citrate tube will be centrifuged and analyzed for: Super oxide
           dismutase, Catalase, GSH/GSSG, Glutathione peroxide, Glutathione reductase.

        -  2 ml of blood with no coagulating factors will be centrifuged and analyzed for: LDL,
           conjugated dienes, Plasma malondialdehyde (TBARS).

      Clinical research:

      Participants will run on a treadmill for 10 minutes until exhaustion. The men will be divided
      into 5 groups according to their VO2 max, comparing the oxidants and antioxidants activity
      between the groups.

      Checking the oxidative stress and VO2 dependency (VO2 is an index for physical fitness).

      Age: 20-35 Sex: Men Inclusion criteria: Healthy men, 2-35 years of age, with 6-24% body fat.
      Exclusion criteria: Smokers, and people who use vitamins and supplements.
