      behavioral weight loss program. The weight loss program places particular emphasis on hunger
      reduction and craving control for both weight loss and prevention of weight regain. The
      program will consist of six videoconference sessions delivered by a qualified coach. Menus
      and other program materials will be available to the participants throughout the study
      period.

      Participants also will be assigned to attend one-on-one "robotic assistance sessions" either
      early or late in the five-week study. During each robotic assistance session, the participant
      will speak with the robot about his/her progress with the weight loss program. The robot is
      programmed to respond to specific issues raised by the participant, but a human operator with
      thorough knowledge of the weight loss program will be available in case the conversation goes
      "off script." This human operator can initiate robot behaviors and prompt verbal responses
      through a text-to-speech interface.

      Data from this study will be used to refine the robot for future use and determine whether
      robotic help can improve a participant's experience in a previously tested weight loss
      program.
