      the Fallopian tubes. This theory has led to the idea of opportunistic salpingectomy as a way
      of decreasing the risk of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). HOPPSA is a national
      register-based RCT, with randomization and follow-up in The Swedish National Quality Register
      of Gynecological Surgery (Gyn/Op).

      HOPPSA aims to study if opportunistic salpingectomy is safe, and if it can reduce the risk of
      EOC.

      PICO P (patients). Women <55 years, undergoing hysterectomy due to a benign reason I
      (intervention). Bilateral salpingectomy at the time of hysterectomy C (comparison). No
      salpingectomy O (outcomes). Primary short term: surgical complications reported according to
      Clavien-Dindo at 8 weeks post-operatively Intermediate term: change in menopausal symptoms
      from baseline to 1 year, assessed with Menopause Rating Scale Long term: ovarian cancer
      assessed through the National Cancer Register Recruitment of 4400 patients is estimated to
      take 4-6 years depending on the participation rate of the Swedish gynecological clinics. Data
      retrieval from GynOp on short and intermediate term outcomes, requiring smaller sample sizes,
      will be done at the end of the recruitment period. If these results, ready available when the
      study recruitment is closed, show that opportunistic salpingectomy does not increase surgical
      complications and menopausal symptoms, women can be advised to undergo salpingectomy to
      potentially minimize the future risk of EOC.
