      it is estimated that up to 75% of them have difficulty adhering to daily oral regimen.
      Long-acting injectable formulation may eliminate this need for daily medication. This is a
      prospective, open-label, multicenter study to determine the long-term efficacy, especially
      symptomatic remission rate of long-acting risperidone microspheres administrered in the
      muscle at 2 week intervals in patients with schizophrenia.

      The patients will receive intramuscular injections either 25, 37.5, 50 mg equivalent of
      risperidone at every 2 weeks for 1 year
