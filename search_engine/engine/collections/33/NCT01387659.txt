      (MPA) that is administered to control kidney graft rejection. Myfortic速 was developed to
      improve MPA-related upper gastrointestinal (GI) side effects by delaying the release of MPA
      until it reaches the large surface of the small bowel. Approximately half of all the kidney
      transplant recipients in the United States have diabetes mellitus. A recent analysis of
      approximately 30,000 kidney transplant recipients included in the U.S. Renal Data System
      showed that 42% of patients had pre-transplant diabetes (1). Moreover, 15% to 20% of patients
      develop diabetes after transplantation, a condition that is commonly known as post-diabetes
      mellitus (1-3). It was previously shown that the rate and extent of MPA absorption is
      minimally affected by diabetes (4). Limited data is available in the current literature on
      Myfortic速 and Simulect速 based therapy in diabetic patients.
