      antiretroviral regimen in a blinded manner. Patients are stratified according to HIV-1 RNA
      level, CD4 cell count, and number of antiretroviral drugs taken prior to study entry.
      Patients and physicians are strongly discouraged from making changes in their antiviral
      therapies for at least 24 weeks post-randomization. After Week 24, changes in background
      antiretroviral therapy are permitted. At 24 weeks post-randomization, patients randomized to
      receive placebo are crossed over to receive open-label tenofovir DF once daily for the
      remainder of the 48-week study. While on study drug, patients are monitored for safety using
      periodic physical examinations and serial laboratory tests. Additionally, changes in plasma
      HIV RNA levels and CD4 cell counts are monitored to assess antiviral efficacy. At the end of
      the 48-week study period, patients are rolled over into extended dosing until tenofovir DF is
      commercially available or Gilead Sciences terminates the study.
