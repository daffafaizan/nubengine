      system 1 trillion dollars annually. Successful management of these conditions critically
      requires patient understanding and engagement. Patients are advised to adhere to medications,
      redesign lifestyles, and navigate the health care system. Most of these care plan items
      require careful instruction and confirmation of shared understanding.

      Mobile health technology has the potential to assist greatly with patient education,
      especially for hospitalized patients. This prospective study evaluates a specific mobile
      technology intervention, an educational and emotionally-engaging video patients watch while
      admitted for a complication related to one of these chronic diseases: Heart Failure,
      Diabetes, COPD, Asthma, Cirrhosis, Atrial Fibrillation, Hypertension.
