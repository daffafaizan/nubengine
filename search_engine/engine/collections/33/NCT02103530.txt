      Standard treatment of AML begins with induction chemotherapy. NCCN guideline recommend to
      assess the treatment response via bone marrow examination approximately 7-10 days after
      completion of induction chemotherapy. However, the possibility of sampling error and risks of
      infection and bleeding are the limitation of bone marrow biopsy.

      F-18 fluorodeoxythymidine (FLT) is a radiopharmaceutical for PET, reflecting the
      proliferation of the cell. F-18 FLT is trapped after phosphorylation by thymidine kinase1,
      whose expression is increased in replicating cells. There have been several studies that
      reported F-18 FLT PET could measure health and proliferation of the bone marrow.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate if F-18 FLT PET/CT is suitable for early response
      assessment of induction chemotherapy in acute myeloid leukemia patients.
