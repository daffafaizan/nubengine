      likelihood of biochemical recurrence (BCR).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To explore the performance of these models in predicting upgrading
      and upstaging prior to surgery. II. To explore the performance of these models in improving
      risk stratification among patients eligible for active surveillance. III. To determine
      whether prostatic massage or surgery raises the count of circulating tumor cells (CTC) in
      post-digital rectal exam (DRE) blood specimens.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive prostatic massage and undergo a digital rectal exam (DRE).
      Laboratory assessments are performed and blood samples are collected for molecular biology
      testing. On the day of the scheduled prostatectomy, a second blood collection is performed
      prior to surgery.
