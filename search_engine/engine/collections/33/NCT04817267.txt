    
      This randomized controlled pilot study will enroll 60 participants, who will be randomly
      assigned to a treatment as usual (TAU) group or a reSET-O+TAU group after being started on
      buprenorphine in acute care settings (e.g., emergency department) and referred to community
      treatment. Study enrollment will last for 3 months after discharge from the acute care
      setting. Participants in the reSET-O+TAU group will be provided with the reSET-O app and will
      be encouraged to engage with the app for the 3 months following discharge from the acute care
      unit. The app works as an extension of cognitive behavioral therapy, providing
      psychoeducation related to opioid use disorder. All participants will be assessed at study
      intake and every month during the 3-month intervention.
