      (infrared, colour, fluorescein angiography) and integrated laser treatment of the retina.
      Besides documentation, precision,safety and patient comfort,the main theoretical advantages
      lie in retina navigation.This randomized, parallel controlled, clinical-trial aims to
      evaluate treatment effect and safety of navigation laser photocoagulation for mild diabetic
      macular edema compared with traditional laser. The primary outcome measures is the
      Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of the participants at 1 year after treatment. Besides,
      the slit-lamp examination, tonometry, funduscopy, and OCT, FFA, ICGA examinations will also
      be compared between different groups to find the advantage of navigation laser .
