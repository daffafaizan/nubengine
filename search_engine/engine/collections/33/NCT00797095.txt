    
      The Health Behaviors in School-age Children (HBSC) survey is the only international survey of
      its type that includes a national survey of adolescent health behavior in the U.S. The U.S.
      HBSC complements the Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) and the Monitoring the Future surveys
      of older adolescents. The aims of the survey are to assess the prevalence of health behaviors
      and identify contextual factors associated with them in a national probability sample of 6th
      to 10th grade students, allowing for trend analyses and cross-national comparisons among the
      40 countries involved in the quadrennial international HBSC surveys. This would be the fourth
      U.S. administration of the HBSC survey, previously administered in 1997/1998, 2001/2002, and
      2005/2006. Because core survey items have remained consistent both nationally and
      internationally since 2001, the 2009/2010 survey would provide essential data for examining
      national and international trends.
