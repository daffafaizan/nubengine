      relapsed or refractory cHL and has also demonstrated efficacy in the first-line treatment of
      cHL in combination with doxorubicin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (AVD) in the phase II GHSG
      NIVAHL trial. A relevant proportion of patients achieved an early metabolic complete
      remission (CR) with anti-PD-1 monotherapy and might not require standard chemo- or
      radiotherapy. Limiting therapy-associated short- and long-term side effects of these
      conventional treatments including impaired quality of life, second primary malignancies or
      organ damage is of utmost importance in the predominantly young cHL patients. This trial will
      hence further reduce treatment intensity and provide a chemo- and radiotherapy-free therapy
      to optimally responding patients.
