      the Driver's Seat: A Roadmap to Managing Student Behavior on the Bus guides transportation
      departments in creating and maintaining a safe, responsible, and positive environment on the
      bus through drivers' use of effective student behavior management techniques. The program
      teaches skills for the bus context based on the principles of positive behavior supports and
      the foundational work of Sprick and colleagues (Sprick, 1990; Sprick, Garrison, & Howard,
      2002; Sprick, Sprick, & Garrison, 1992). In the Driver's Seat was designed as a stand-alone
      DVD-based training program for school bus drivers of elementary schools, using video examples
      presenting real driver and student interactions on the bus. A computer-based program for
      transportation supervisors supplemented the driver training materials and included
      information for supervisors about developing and maintaining department-wide transportation
      policies, as well as an overview of the bus driver training materials and instructions for
      their use.

      The components of the In the Driver's Seat bus driver training program could be implemented
      by a transportation team without the need of an expert and could be used to train new
      personnel or review and refresh veteran personnel's skills. The DVD-based component was
      designed for use by a transportation supervisor or driver trainer in a group setting with
      drivers and augmented the material presented in the drivers' program.
