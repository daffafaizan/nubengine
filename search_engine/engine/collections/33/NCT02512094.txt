      elderly patients needed rehabilitation programs to regain their quality of life during their
      medical treatments. Barthel index is a functional measurement to evaluate rehabilitation
      improvement in chronically-ill patients and also used for evaluation of patient's self-care.
      This index had initially developed to evaluate the self-care of stroke patients which
      comprised of 10 questions about their basic activity of daily living. Barthel index had been
      well-accepted and widely used. Barthel index had been translated into many languages and
      validated in many medical conditions such as spinal cord injury, congestive heart failure,
      pneumonia, etc. However, Barthel index had not been translated into Thai language and
      validated to use in hip fracture patients.

      Hip fractures was usually occured in geriatric patients and there was a trend to increase
      every year. Most of the hip fractures were treated by surgical methods which needed
      postoperative rehabilitation programs to regain their functions. Less than half of the
      patients with hip fracture could regain their functions to preoperative level. Therefore,
      these patients needed a specific questionnaire to evaluate their functions. Barthel index is
      an uncomplicated questionnaire and can be used to evaluate treatment outcome of the patients.

      The purposes of this study were to translate the Barthel index into Thai language and to
      assess validity and reliability of Thai version Barthel index in hip fracture patients.
