      increase their hospital length of stay and the cost of care. These complications are also
      associated with increased mortality. Perioperative tissue hypoperfusion may participate in
      the development of postoperative complications. Hypovolemia is secondary to many factors in
      hip fracture patients (including blood loss, fasting and dehydration) and can result in low
      cardiac output and tissue hypoperfusion. Two single-center, randomized, double-blind studies
      have demonstrated that peroperative fluid titration guided by esophageal Doppler measurements
      of stroke volume could improve patient outcome. Interpretation of these results was that such
      a stroke volume "optimisation" strategy could help the anesthesiologist give more fluids to
      his patient and reduce the risk of hypoperfusion without the risk of congestion, thereby
      reducing postoperative complications and improving patient outcome. We want to test the same
      hypothesis in a multicenter trial to confirm with a high level of proof the usefulness of
      this strategy. If previous results are confirmed, this could lead to a change in current
      anesthetic management of hip fracture patients and potentially have a very important
      economical impact on health costs.Goals : Primary endpoint is to demonstrate that colloid
      (VoluvenÂ®) titration, guided using esophageal Doppler estimation of stroke volume, during the
      surgical repair of hip fracture reduces the incidence of postoperative complications
      (composite criteria). Secondary endpoints in the "optimised group" include : 1) reduced delay
      to walk without help ; 2) increased number of days " out-of-hospital " at 3 months after the
      fracture ; and 3) reduced 1-year mortality.
