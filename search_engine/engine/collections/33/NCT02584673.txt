      receive the procedure with traditional methods and equipment currently in use at Cooper
      University. The test group will receive the same procedure utilizing existing ultrasound
      equipment with the supplemental CAIG system. It is anticipated that 100 patients will be
      included in the study. After each procedure completion times, number of needle repositions,
      and punctures will be recorded along with an "ease of procedure" self-reported qualitative
      metric from the physician performing the procedure.
