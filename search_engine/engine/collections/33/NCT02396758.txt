      (r-tPA) dose-ultrasound treatment time required to achieve the same reductions in thrombus
      burden and associated improvement in physiologic parameters demonstrated in ULTIMA (EKOS 08
      [NCT01166997]) and SEATTLE II (EKOS 09 [NCT01513759]). Results of this study are intended to
      inform the study design for further studies of the Acoustic Pulse Thrombolysis (APT)
      Procedure. Analysis of the first 100 evaluable participants in the United States study
      suggested a degree of equipoise between treatment groups 1, 2 and 3 of the protocol and
      therefore the sample size has been extended and additional sites in the United Kingdom (UK)
      National Health Service included, with a view to adding to the findings of the OPTALYSE study
      from sites in the UK and increasing the number of participants treated by treatment protocol.
