      characterized by elevated TSH, absence of goiter (normal or hypoplastic thyroid gland) and
      normal to very low levels of thyroid hormones. The TSH-receptor (TSHR) gene is located on
      chromosome 14q31 and it consists of extracellular, trans-membrane and intracellular domains.
      Mutation in the TSHR may cause either gain or loss of function of the receptor.
      Loss-of-function mutations are autosomal-recessively inherited and lead to a spectrum of
      phenotypes, ranging from mild euthyroid hyperthyrotropinemia to severe congenital
      hypothyroidism (CH). Insensitivity to TSH depends on both the severity and location of the
      TSHR mutations. Since the first report of familial euthyroid hyperthyrotropinemia caused by a
      TSHR mutation, several cases of loss-of-function mutations of the TSHR have been reported
      however only a few reports on the outcome of patients affected with TSHR mutations. Whether
      the condition of euthyroid hyperthyrotropinemia leads to clinical hypothyroidism, remains
      stable or normalizes over time has yet to be elucidated. We recently described a unique novel
      TSHR-inactivating mutation located at the third extracellular loop that preferentially
      affected the inositol phosphate (IP) pathway in three sisters of Arab-Muslim decent that
      presented with euthyroid hyperthyrotropinemia. Further analysis of the extended family
      revealed additional members with TSHR syndrome phenotype carrying two different TSHR
      mutations. All the affected subjects live in the same town. The aim of the present study was
      to evaluate the clinical course over time, the genotype-phenotype association and the
      frequency of these two different TSHR mutations among the highly consanguineous population of
      the town of Um El Fahem.
