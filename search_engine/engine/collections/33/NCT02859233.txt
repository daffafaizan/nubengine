      Society, as any headache develops within 5 days after a lumbar puncture. It worsens within 15
      minutes after sitting or standing and improves within 15 minutes after lying.

      For preventing PDPH, there are some uncomfortable practices for patients (fluid
      supplementation and bed rest) and expensive for hospital (time spend for information and
      management of fluid intake). Patients are usually advised by nurses. If "bed rest" is not
      effective in prevention of PDPH, "fluid supplementation" is not an advice based on any
      evidence but only on routine. By this trial, the investigators want to evaluate the
      scientific value of this advice by non-inferiority study, in the standard patient care.

      The primary objective of this study is to compare oral hyperhydration (2 liters during 2
      hours after lumbar puncture - the most common routine according to an internal pilot survey)
      versus no advice about the fluid intake to prevent the PDPH. It will be evaluated on the
      occurrence of PDPH in both of the two groups The second objective is to observe the day of
      apparition of PDPH, between day 0 and day 5.
