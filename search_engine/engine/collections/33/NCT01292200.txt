      (small-group video discussion vs. single video mode) on mammography used among Chinese
      immigrant women. The small-group video discussion will be led by trained Chinese community
      health educators and trained bilingual research staff using a standardized structured
      protocol at all sites. In the single video mode, we will mail the intervention materials to
      women to view and/or read at home. We will recruit 974 Chinese women through our strong and
      well-established Chinese community partnerships in the metropolitan areas of Washington, DC
      (Lead PI: Dr. Judy Wang, Georgetown University-GU), New York (Site PI: Dr. Grace Ma at Temple
      University), and southern California (Site PI: Dr. Annette Maxwell, University of California,
      Los Angeles-UCLA). Participants' eligibility are listed under "eligibility criteria". We will
      not enroll US-born Chinese women as they are least likely to face cultural and language
      barriers to mammography and less likely to engage in our small-group discussion, which will
      be conducted in Chinese languages. Also, we will not enroll short-term visitors as our study
      involves four interviews over a 2-year period.
