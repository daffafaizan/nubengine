      using a biomatrix (the Gore&#174; Bio-A&#174; Fistula Plug) in a Phase I study using a single
      dose of 20 million cells. 15 adult patients (age &gt; 18 years) with cryptoglandular fistulas
      will be enrolled. Subjects will undergo standard adjuvant therapy including drainage of
      infection and placement of a draining seton. Six weeks post placement of the draining seton,
      the seton will be replaced with the MSC loaded Gore&#174; fistula plug as per current
      clinical practice. The subjects will be subsequently followed for fistula response and
      closure for 24 months. Study visits are Day 1, Week 2, Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, Week 24, Week
      52, and Week 104. This is an autologous product derived from the patient and used only for
      the same patient.
