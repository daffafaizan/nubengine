      and electronic) to deliver a customized MedlinePlus health information prescription.

      Primary Hypothesis. Individuals in the paper prescription group will be just as likely to
      seek information using MedlinePlus compared with individuals in the group who receive the
      same customized information through an email prescription.

      Secondary Hypothesis. Individuals in the paper prescription group will be just as likely to
      have successful behavioral outcome measures as those in the group who receive the same
      customized information through an email prescription.
