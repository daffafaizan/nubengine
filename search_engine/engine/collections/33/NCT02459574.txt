    
      AVATAR-AF is a multicentre, randomised controlled study comparing a streamlined
      AVATAR-protocol ablation procedure to anti-arrhythmic therapy in patients with documented
      paroxysmal AF who are considered to be failing current strategy for AF. A secondary control
      arm will also compare the AVATAR-protocol to conventional AF ablation. 300 patients who are
      on no prior anti-arrhythmic, 'pill-in-pocket' or taking regular anti-arrhythmics will be
      randomised in a 1:1:1 manner to a treatment strategy of either AVATAR-protocol ablation,
      anti-arrhythmic therapy or conventional AF ablation and followed-up for 1 year.
