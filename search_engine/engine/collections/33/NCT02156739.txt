      I. To compare the specificity of contrast enhanced MRI using a liver specific agent Eovist
      (gadoxetate disodium) versus the combined use of Eovist and an intravascular-extracellular
      agent Gadavist (gadobutrol) for the radiologic detection and characterization of liver
      lesions via clinical stability and follow up imaging.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive gadoxetate disodium intravenously (IV) over 1 minute and undergo MRI.
      Patients then receive gadobutrol IV over 1 minute at the 20 minute mark during MRI.
