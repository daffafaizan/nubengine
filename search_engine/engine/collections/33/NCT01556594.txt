      intranasally or subcutaneously to eighteen (18) male or female participants under fasting
      conditions and following the use of insulin to lower blood glucose. The participants were
      assigned at random to a group that received one treatment for each of the 3 study periods.
      The glucagon administrations were separated by approximately 7 calendar days. For 2
      participants, a single dose of 3 mg NG was administered at the 4th period that was separated
      by at least 21 calendar days from the 3rd period.
