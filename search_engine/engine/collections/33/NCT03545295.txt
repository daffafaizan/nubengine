      demographic and clinical data will be collected from the medical records of the deceased. The
      corpse will be weighed, measured and placed on the autopsy table. Blockade randomization (QLB
      2 or QLB 3) and volume of local anesthetic (10ml, 20ml, 30ml) will be performed for each
      side. Injection in the anterior or posterior plane to the Lumbar Quadrant muscle will be
      performed by anesthesiologists experienced in the technique with ultrasound aid. A colouring
      solution will be used. After confirming the correct needle position, the previously
      randomized volumes will be injected. After the blockage, the corpse will be placed in the
      supine position and will be submitted to autopsy by standard procedure. After removal of the
      thoracic and abdominal viscera, the investigators will verify the dispersion of the local
      anesthetic. Photographic records will be made and the number of levels by which the solution
      dispersed will be annotated, calculating the number of cranial and caudal levels. The corpse
      will then have its autopsy procedure completed, with the placement of the viscera and
      incision closure according to the service standard.
