      Praziquantel (PZQ) to improve the current and future health of pre-school children and
      infants. Praziquantel is cheap, highly efficacious and safe, presenting a realistic
      opportunity of using a pre-existing tool in a modified way to benefit child health and
      development. The study will focus on children aged 3 to 5 years of age, comparing the impact
      of early vs. later treatment with PZQ on the current and future health status of the
      children. By killing worms PZQ stops the morbidity related to the presence of worms and eggs
      such as anaemia, abdominal pain, diarrhoea and blood in the urine as well as induced immune
      responses associated with reduced re-infection rates. Therefore the study will investigate
      the immediate health benefits of treating pre-school children and infants and the effects of
      treatment on re-infection rates.
