      dominant inherited disorder characterized by early onset of hundreds to thousands of
      adenomatous polyps throughout colon. If left untreated, this syndrome may develop colorectal
      cancer (CRC). Polyps from individuals with FAP display inflammatory features associated with
      activation of interleukin (IL) 23/IL 17/JAK/STAT3 pathway. This inflammation is thought to
      contribute to further mutagenesis, culminating in tumor development. Specifically, IL-23 is
      linked to tumor growth and progression in CRC. Guselkumab is a human immunoglobulin
      monoclonal antibody directed against p19 subunit of IL-23, specifically targets IL-23 and
      inhibits its interaction with IL-23 receptor, inhibiting IL 23 specific intracellular
      signaling and subsequent cell activation and cytokine production, which result in less
      inflammation and reduce tumor development. The clinical hypothesis of this study is that
      treatment with guselkumab will reduce rectal/pouch polyp burden compared with baseline in
      active arms compared with placebo. The study is designed to determine if guselkumab has
      clinical activity in colorectum and duodenum, by reducing number of polyps over a period of
      24 weeks. Participants will be randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms (Guselkumab 100 mg
      [milligram] SC [subcutaneous], Guselkumab 300 mg SC, and placebo SC). Efficacy evaluations
      include rectal/pouch polyp burden assessment, biomarker analysis include discrete IL-23
      signaling effector proteins (IL-23R, pSTAT3, Il-17A) and safety evaluations will include
      monitoring of adverse events, laboratory tests, vital sign measurements, and physical
      examination. Safety will be monitored throughout study (up to Week 60).
