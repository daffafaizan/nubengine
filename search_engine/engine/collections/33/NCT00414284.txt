      poor adherence, incomplete absorption, cellular drug pumps or resistance mutations.
      Increasing exposure to protease inhibitors via boosting with ritonavir increases minimum
      blood concentrations, and is a strategy which has been shown to improve suppression of
      virologic replication. Little is known about the pharmacokinetics (PK), tolerability and
      safety of increased doses of LPV/r. The objectives of this 24-week single arm pilot study are
      to assess the PK parameters, safety, tolerability, change in viral load and CD4 counts on
      increased dose (600/150 and 800/200 mg) LPV/r in participants with low level viremia on
      standard dose LPV/r-based ART. Participants will undergo six PK samplings over 12 hours on
      standard dose LPV/r. The dose will be increased to 3 tabs (600/150) BID and blood will be
      sampled for PK after two weeks. If tolerated at 8 weeks, the dose will be increased to 4 tabs
      (800/200 mg) BID and final PK sampling will be performed after two weeks. There will be a one
      time, optional, optimization of background regimen of NRTIs two weeks after the first dose
      escalation.

      Major Eligibility Criteria:

        -  CD4 count: > 50

        -  Viral load: 200-75,000 on two most recent measures

        -  Current treatment: > 16 weeks standard dose (400/100mg BID) LPV/r-based ART (no other PI
           or NNRTI allowed

        -  Prior treatment experience and resistance profile: Up to 20-fold resistance to LPV/r
