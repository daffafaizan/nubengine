      the morning of surgery, on the surgical ward, and repeated in the operating room, before
      performing spinal anesthesia. Spinal anesthesia use hyperbaric bupivacaine (11 mg),
      sufentanil (5 µg) and morphine (100 µg). Prophylactic treatment of hypotension uses a
      continuous infusion of ephedrine (0.6 mg/ml) and phenylephrine (10 µg/ml). Rate of the
      continuous infusion is adapted to keep maternal systolic blood pressure between 95-105% of
      preinduction values. Total dose of ephedrine and phenylephrine infused from spinal anesthesia
      to delivery of the newborn is recorded (about 20 minutes for the estimated time frame).
      Association between stress markers and total dose of vasoactive drugs will be tested with the
      Spearman's correlation coefficient.

      The study is observational. The subjects do receive a therapeutic intervention but the
      investigator does not assign patients to this intervention since this intervention is a
      routine care (spinal anesthesia for planned cesarian section) that would have been performed
      in the absence of the study.
