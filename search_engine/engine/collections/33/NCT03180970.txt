      squamous neoplasia. However, this modality may cause severe chest pain and discomfort owing
      to mucosal irritation.

      This study was to test whether a lower concentration of Lugol's solution can provide
      satisfied image quality of early esophageal squamous neoplasia and has lower mucosal
      irritation.
