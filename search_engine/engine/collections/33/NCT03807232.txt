    
      Rationale:

      Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) after burn injury (post-burn ARDS; pbARDS) is a
      severe complication associated with a mortality of up to 44%. To date, only few studies have
      been published on the clinical course and predictive factors of pbARDS.

      Objectives:

      To characterize the clinical course of pbARDS, to identify relevant predictors, including the
      development of a prognostic score, and to examine outcome parameters such as mortality and
      hospitalization days.

      Methods:

      A retrospective analysis of 400 patients admitted to the Burns Intensive Care Unit of the
      University Hospital Zurich from 2004 to 2009 was performed. Multivariate logistic regression
      was used to determine independent risk factors for pbARDS. A prognostic score was developed,
      which was tested with leave-one-out-cross-validation and Receiver Operating Characteristic
      (ROC) curves.
