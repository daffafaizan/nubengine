    
      This is a multicentric randomized phase III trial comparing conventional radiotherapy with
      concomitant chemotherapy (arm A) versus middle accelerated radiotherapy with concomitant
      chemotherapy (arm B) versus very accelerated radiotherapy alone (arm C) in patients with
      stage III-IV head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). The main end point is the event
      free survival.

      The treatments are

      Bras A : Conventional radiotherapy given once daily, delivering 70 Gy in 7 weeks (5 fractions
      of 2 Gy per week) and chemotherapy: 5FU : 600 mg/m²/d, Paraplatin : 70 mg/m²/d, D1-4 and
      D22-25 and D43-46

      Bras B: middle accelerated radiotherapy delivering 70 Gy in 6 weeks and chemotherapy: 5FU :
      600 mg/m²/d, Paraplatin : 70 mg/m²/d, D1-5 and D29-33

        -  first part : radiotherapy given once daily delivering 40 Gy in 4 weeks and 20 fractions
           of 2 Gy

        -  second part : radiotherapy given twice daily with "concomitant boost" delivering 30 Gy
           in 20 fractions in 2 weeks (1,5 Gy x 2 / day)

      Bras C: very accelerated radiotherapy given twice daily delivering 64.8 Gy in 3.5 weeks in 36
      fractions of 1.8 Gy
