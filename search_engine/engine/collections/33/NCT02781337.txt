    
      This is a Registry that invites patients undergoing colorectal surgery for colorectal cancer.
      Epidemiological data is collected. The Registry includes tumor tissue and blood samples banks
      used to studied different genetic variants and disease-specific biomarkers present in
      patients with Lynch syndrome and others hereditary cancers.

      The aim of this registry is to set up the necessary resources to help basic and clinical
      research projects on colorectal cancer (CRC) within the Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires
      (HIBA) and promote scientific collaborations between the HIBA and other institutions within
      and outside the country.

      To make this project, the following specific goals are proposed:

      Objective 1: Establishment of an efficient algorithm to enroll patients diagnosed with CRC
      from HIBA, through collaboration between the services of Surgery, Gastroenterology,
      Pathology, Oncology, Institute of Translational Medicine and Biomedical Engineering (IMTIB),
      Medical Clinic and Medical Informatics.

      Objective 2: Development of logistics for the connection and expansion of the bank of
      biological samples (DNA, serum) and tumor samples (tissue fixed in formalin, frozen tissue)
      to the CRC.

      Objective 3: Development of computer software to record data about patient enrolled in a
      dynamic way.

      Objective 4: Development of pipelines and create a supervisory committee to regulate the
      future of samples and data obtained through the registry, accord the current standards of
      ethical code, and improve the current collaborations with foreign researchers.
