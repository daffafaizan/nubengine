      NSGCT prior to RPLND, either in the primary setting or in the post-chemotherapy setting. We
      will correlate histopathologic outcomes from the RPLND specimen and clinical outcomes of
      recurrence during follow-up to identify the accuracy of anti-18F-FACBC PET/CT in these
      settings.
