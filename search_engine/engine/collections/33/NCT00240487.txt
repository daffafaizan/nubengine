      microcirculation. NO may have an important role in the pathogenesis of ARDS as well as its
      treatment. NO may be primarily useful in improving matching of ventilation and perfusion in
      the lung. The aims of the study are to attempt to show that NO will improve oxygenation as
      evidenced by improvement in PaO2/FiO2. Secondary aims are to see if the improvement in
      oxygenation allows there to be decreased time on FiO2>0.60, evaluate whether the order of NO
      therapy will have any effect on response, and evaluate the characteristics of patients who
      respond to NO compared to those who do not.

      Subjects will be randomized to receive either nitric oxide first (nitric oxide for the first
      4 hours, then no intervention/no nitric oxide for the next 4 hours) or delayed treatment with
      nitric oxide (no intervention/no nitric oxide for the first 4 hours, then nitric oxide for
      the next 4 hours)..

      Blood gases were monitored once an hour during study participation (total of 8 hours). Final
      PaO2/FiO2 levels will be compared after 8 hours of study treatment in each group.
