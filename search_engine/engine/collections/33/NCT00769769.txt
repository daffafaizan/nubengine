      African Americans than among European Americans. The majority of caregivers for dementia
      patients are family members, who often deal with difficult behavior, agitation, and
      aggressiveness in the people for whom they care. Because of the challenges they face, family
      caregivers for dementia patients are at increased risk of mental health problems,
      particularly depression. Promising research has shown that cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)
      can combat distress in African-American caregivers. One way to deliver CBT is through
      telephone-based interventions, which have been shown to lead to better psychological outcomes
      than routine education and support. This study will create treatment manuals for CBT tailored
      to the needs and preferences of African Americans who care for family members with dementia
      and will develop procedures and strategies for treatment delivery to and retention of members
      of this population. The study will then compare the effectiveness of face-to-face versus
      telephone-based CBT in improving mental health outcomes for African Americans who care for
      family members with dementia.

      Participation in this study will last 3 months. Participants will be randomly assigned to
      receive either face-to-face or telephone-based CBT. Both groups will receive 12 weekly
      sessions of therapy targeting caregiver depression and social functioning over time. Before
      and after treatment, participants will be assessed on measures of depression and social
      functioning through standardized questionnaires given over the telephone. Additional data
      will be collected on social and demographic factors, stressors, caregiver appraisal of
      resources, and use and costs of both mental and physical health care.
