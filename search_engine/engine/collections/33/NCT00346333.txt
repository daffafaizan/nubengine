      prevalence of approximately 1 in 4,000. Patients typically report night blindness and
      difficulty with mid-peripheral visual field in adolescence. As the condition progresses, they
      lose far peripheral visual field. Most patients have reductions in central vision by 60 years
      if left untreated. Vitamin A palmitate, 15,000 International Units (IU)/d and an omega-3 rich
      diet have been shown to slow the progression of this condition among adults with the typical
      forms.(see Archives of Ophthalmology,111:761-772,1993 ; Archives of Ophthalmology 122:
      1306-1314, 2004; Archives of Ophthalmology 130(6):701-711,2013).

      The present study was a randomized, controlled, double-masked trial with a planned duration
      of 5 years.Two hundred and forty adults with the typical forms of RP were assigned to either
      lutein 12mg/d or a control group. Patients in both groups received 15,000 IU/day of vitamin A
      palmitate in addition to the supplement under study. Participants agreed not to know the
      contents of the supplement or their group assignment until the end of the trial. The main
      outcome measurement was the total point score for the 30-2 program of the Humphrey Field
      analyzer (HFA). In addition,the total point score for the 60-4 program ,the total point score
      of the 30-2 and 60-4 programs combined, computer-averaged 30-Hz cone Electroretinogram (ERG)
      amplitude and Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) visual acuity were measured
      annually as secondary endpoints.
