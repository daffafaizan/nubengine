        -  Determine whether computer-assisted, higher-order analysis of participant low molecular
           weight serum proteins can detect distinctive proteomic patterns in participants with
           normal skin vs mycosis fungoides/cutaneous T-cell lymphoma vs psoriasis.

        -  Determine whether these proteomic patterns can distinguish between various stages of
           cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot study.

      Participants complete a general and skin health questionnaire and undergo a whole-body skin
      examination. Blood samples are taken and analyzed for low molecular weight serum proteins by
      mass spectroscopy.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 141-423 participants (47-94 each of healthy volunteers,
      psoriasis patients, and T3 cutaneous T-cell lymphoma patients and 141 T1, T2, and T4 mycosis
      fungoides patients) will be accrued for this study within 3 years.
