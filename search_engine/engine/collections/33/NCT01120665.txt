      changes, affecting not only the reproductive tissues but other systems of women's body.
      Post-menopause period is usually accompanied by an increase in climacteric symptoms, which
      decrease healthy related quality of life. Moreover, many unhealthy changes occur at this
      period of women's life, increasing the risk for metabolic syndrome development, which might
      be due, at least in part, to an increase in insulin resistance and compensatory
      hyperinsulinemia.

      Hormone therapy is indicated as the main treatment to reduce or relief the negative effects
      of menopause. Although many studies have confirmed the possible positive effects of this
      approach on postmenopausal symptoms, its effects on insulin resistance and other metabolic
      syndrome factors remain controversial.

      On the other hand, it's well known that acute and chronic exercises can provide a wide range
      of benefits for postmenopausal women's health, including decrease of insulin resistance and
      symptoms relief.

      In clinical practice, many postmenopausal women are using hormone therapy and are instructed
      to exercise. However, the effects of this association are poorly studied.

      Thus, the main goal of this randomized placebo-controlled trial was to evaluate, in healthy,
      middle age, and hysterectomized postmenopausal women, the single and combined effects of
      physical exercise and oral estrogen use on blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), muscle blood
      flow, and autonomic function measured at baseline conditions and under hyperinsulinemia
      stimulus. Moreover, it also investigated the effects of these interventions on symptoms
      relief and quality of life.
