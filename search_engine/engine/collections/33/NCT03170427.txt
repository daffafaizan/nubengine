      the left arm, two sensors will be placed above the clavicle on each side of the neck, and two
      sensors will bw placed on either side of the thorax at midaxillary line corresponding to the
      level of the xiphoid process. Using a computer- generated sequence of numbers, patients will
      be randomly allocated in one of the two groups: 6 mg (1.6 mL) levobupivacaine + 20 µg
      fentanyl (GL6 group) or 8 mg (2 mL) levobupivacaine + 20 µg fentanyl (GL8 group). Continuous
      spinal epidural anesthesia (CSE) will be performed with patient in sitting position: a
      18-gauge Tuohy needle will be inserted into the L2-L3 interspace using the loss of resistance
      of saline technique to identify the epidural space; a 27-gauge Withacre spinal needle will be
      then placed through the Tuohy needle until the dura mater wwill be punctured and isobaric
      undiluted levobupivacaine plus 20 µg fentanyl was administered. Afterwards, an epidural
      catheter (Espocan, B.Braun, Melsungen, Germany) wwill be inserted 4 cm into the epidural
      space.
