    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the efficacy (as measured by survival and disease-free survival) and toxicity
      of a regimen of busulfan 16 mg/kg and cyclophosphamide 120 mg/kg plus 131I-labeled
      anti-cluster of differentiation (CD) 45 antibody (iodine I 131 monoclonal antibody BC8)
      (delivering a dose of 5.25 gray [Gy] to the normal organ receiving the highest dose) in
      patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in first remission receiving human leukocyte
      antigen (HLA)-identical related peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) transplants.

      OUTLINE:

      RADIOLABELED ANTIBODY: Patients receive iodine I 131 monoclonal antibody BC8 intravenously
      (IV) on day -13.

      CHEMOTHERAPY: Patients receive busulfan orally (PO) every 6 hours on days -7 to -4 and
      cyclophosphamide IV on days -3 and -2.

      TRANSPLANT: Patients undergo allogeneic PBSC or bone marrow (BM) transplant on day 0.

      GRAFT-VS-HOST DISEASE PREVENTION: Patients receive cyclosporine IV or PO every 12 hours on
      days -1 to 50 with a taper to day 180. Patients also receive methotrexate IV on days 1, 3, 6,
      and 11.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 6, 9, and 12 months; every 6
      months for 1 year; and then yearly thereafter.
