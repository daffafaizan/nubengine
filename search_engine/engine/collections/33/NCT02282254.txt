      insulin pump to infuse insulin and a dosing mathematical algorithm to decide on the required
      insulin dosages based on the sensor's readings. A dual-hormone closed-loop strategy would
      regulate glucose levels through the infusion of two hormones: insulin and glucagon.

      The investigators aim to conduct the 1st randomized cross-over trial comparing single-
      hormone and dual-hormone closed-loop strategy to regulate overnight glucose levels. The
      investigators aim to compare the two interventions for 10 hours in two subgroups of adults
      with type 1 diab√®tes. Patients from both subgroups will present documented nocturnal
      hypoglycemia. One subgroup will consist of patients with hypoglycemia unawareness while the
      other subgroup will consist of patients with hypoglycemia unawareness. This study will allow
      to determine if there is a greater benefit of a closed-loop strategy in a higher-risk
      hypoglycemia unaware group.
