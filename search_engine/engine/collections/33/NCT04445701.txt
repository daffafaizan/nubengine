    
      An open-label, multicenter, dose escalation study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and
      PK/pharmacodynamics of AO-176 in adults with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma whose
      disease has progressed following at least 3 prior systemic lines of treatment and must have
      progressed on the final line of therapy received before being considered for this study.

      The study will be conducted in 2 phases; Phase 1 is an ascending-dose study of AO-176
      monotherapy utilizing the classic 3+3 design, with enrollment of 3 patients per cohort and
      expansion of the cohort in the event of a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). Following the dose
      escalation portion and determination of the monotherapy recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), an
      ascending dose escalation study of AO-176 and dexamethasone combined with bortezomib will be
      evaluated utilizing the same 3+3 dose escalation design.

      Phase 2 will evaluate the clinical activity of AO-176 plus dexamethasone and bortezomib at
      the RP2D as determined in Phase 1 Part 2.
