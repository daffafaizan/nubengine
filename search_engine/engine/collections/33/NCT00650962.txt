           electric activity) was responsible for most out-of-hospital cardiac arrest
           patients(80%~90%) in metropolitan Taipei.

        2. Response time in Taipei emergency medical service was longer than 5 minutes.

        3. Bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation rate were relatively low in Taipei.

        4. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation is the only known method to save out-of-hospital cardiac
           arrest patients with asystole/pulseless electric activity. For those suffered from
           ventricular fibrillation/ ventricular tachycardia,previous studies revealed pre-shock
           cardiopulmonary resuscitation may have the potential to improve the outcome.

        5. Study hypothesis: Compared with current standard resuscitative sequence (basic life
           support protocol in Guideline 2005), longer pre-shock cardiopulmonary resuscitation
           provided to all out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients in Taipei may improve the
           outcome of them.
