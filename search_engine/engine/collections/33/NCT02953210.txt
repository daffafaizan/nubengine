      compare intraoperative hemodynamic parameters under two techniques of general anesthesia: The
      primary outcome pain was used for planning the sample size of participants and considered a
      variation of 3 points on VAS (Visual analogic scale of pain). The secondaries outcomes
      nausea/vomiting, sedation, ileus paralytics, urinary retention, time of discharge (PACU) and
      hospital stay, and patient satisfaction will be recorded and analyzed.

      the patients will be allocated from randomized program in one of the two arms.

        1. Based opioid balanced anesthesia propofol, fentanyl, rocuronium and isoflurane

        2. Opioid sparing balance anesthesia with propofol, dexter- ketamine, clonidine,
           midazolan,isoflurane and lidocaine.

      At the end of procedure both groups will receive dexamethasone, ranitidine

      , ondansetron, keterolac IV and local infiltration of bupivacaine on trocar wounds as
      multimodal analgesia.

      General anesthesia opioid free seems to have less side effects than the general anesthesia
      based on opioid this study will compare it.
