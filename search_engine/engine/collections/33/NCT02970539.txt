      oral Oraxol in combination with intravenous ramucirumab. After a screening period of up to 28
      days subjects will be enrolled into the treatment phase of the study. Each cycle of therapy
      will last 4 weeks. Subjects may continue in the study until they experience disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Three to six subjects will be enrolled at each dose
      level. Once the tolerability of a dose level has been determined, an additional 3-6 subjects
      may be enrolled at a higher dose level, to determine the maximum tolerated dose. Safety will
      be monitored through recording of adverse events, serious adverse events, monitoring of
      laboratory tests including hematology, blood chemistry, urinalyses, physical examinations and
      electrocardiograms. Subjects will undergo radiographic assessments for tumor response at
      specified time points. Blood samples will also be obtained in the first cycle of therapy at
      multiple time points for determination of the amount of paclitaxel and metabolites and
      HM30181 in the circulation. After the treatment period, there will be a follow-up period
      during which the subject or family may be contacted every three months for follow-up.
