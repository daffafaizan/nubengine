      developmental, behavioral and medical assessments to better characterize gene-related
      neurodevelopmental deficits. This series of assessments takes place over the course of a
      three-day period. It includes the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS), parent
      interviews regarding developmental history and behavior, a psychiatric evaluation, a
      neurology assessment, as well as a clinical genetic evaluation that includes a physical and
      vitals exam. Affected individuals, as well as biologically related siblings, will also
      undergo a series of sensory assessments, including a research EEG, visual evoked potential,
      and an eyetracking assessment. Family members present for the visit will also be asked to
      provide a blood and/or saliva sample for research genetics.
