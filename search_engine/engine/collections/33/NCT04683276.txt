      (MH) attending outpatient clinic.Eligible eyes were divided into 2 groups based on the
      narrowest diameter of the MH measured by spectral domain optical coherence tomography
      (SD-OCT). MHs from 250 to 400µm were classified as Medium-sized MHs and MHs > 400 µm were
      classified as Large-sized MHs. Within each group, eyes were randomly assigned to either
      small-flap (1-2DD) or large flap (from >2 to 4DD).
