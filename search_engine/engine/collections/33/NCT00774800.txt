      Dose-finding visits were conducted to identify the appropriate dose of Humalog and Humulin-R.
      For each Humalog dose-finding visit, a total of 24 U of rHuPH20 was injected SC per unit of
      Humalog, corresponding to a mass concentration of 18.2 micrograms per milliliter (μg/mL)
      rHuPH20 (at final concentration of 91 U/mL of Humalog). For each Humulin-R dose-finding
      visit, a total of 24 U of rHuPH20 was injected SC per unit of Humulin-R, corresponding to a
      mass concentration of 20.0 μg/mL rHuPH20 (at final concentration of 100 U/mL of Humulin-R).
