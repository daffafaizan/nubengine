      negative outcomes reported such as bleeding, infection rate, cardiac complications, prolonged
      wound healing and patient discomfort. Zero heat flux is a non-invasive method for measurement
      of body core temperature. The aim of this study is to see if this method is comparable in
      terms of correlation, accuracy, precision and practicability to commonly used sublingual and
      nasopharyngeal temperature monitoring. Measurements are performed with the SpotOnÂ® sensor by
      Arizant Healthcare, Inc..
