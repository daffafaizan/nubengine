    
      This study is designed as a prospective, observational in nature, multi-center, single-arm,
      clinical registry to estimate the ischemic burden of angiographically intermediate proximal
      LAD stenosis in clinical practice using the OpSens Medical OptoWire Deux FFR system. Subjects
      with stable angina or unstable angina who are found to have an intermediate proximal LAD
      stenosis on coronary angiography with anatomy amenable to PCI and underwent physiological
      lesion assessment with the OptoWire Deux pressure wire and OCT as part of their routine
      procedures using standard of care techniques will be enrolled. Patients meeting enrollment
      criteria will be offered the opportunity to enroll in this observational registry
      post-procedure. All patients enrolled in this study are expected to be evaluated and treated
      using a standard of care technique. This study will enroll a total of 60 patients at Columbia
      University Medical Center and St. Francis Hospital.
