    
      This is a Phase II, non randomized, non- comparative, open label trial which assess the
      efficacy and safety of lenalidomide, adriamycin and low dose dexamethasone combination (RAD)
      in 45 newly diagnosed patients with symptomatic multiple myeloma as well as to collect
      information regarding the effect of this regimen on angiogenesis and bone remodeling of the
      study population. The recruitment period is estimated for 5 months while the treatment period
      and the follow up period 4 months and 1 month respectively. During the treatment initiation
      visit the response to the combination RAD according the International Myeloma Working Group
      (IMWG) criteria will be evaluated, biochemical markers of bone metabolism and angiogenic
      cytokines will be measured as well. IMWG Response evaluation will be repeated the day 1 of
      each treatment cycle as well as at the response evaluation visit. Finally biochemical markers
      of bone metabolism and angiogenic cytokines will be measured once more at the end of
      treatment visit.
