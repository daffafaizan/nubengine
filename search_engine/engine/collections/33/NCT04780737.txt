      Patients were divided into two arms: PC and OC. Propensity score matching was performed,
      reporting the d value. The primary outcome was the re-hospitalization rate for any cause. The
      secondary endpoints were the re-hospitalization rate for biliary stone disease (BSD), the
      mean number of re-hospitalization (any cause and BSD), the complication rate (all and
      severe), and the total costs. A P-value < 0.05 was considered significant, and NNT< 10 was
      considered clinically relevant.
