      cases of retinal detachment. However, it will cause various problems for permanent tamponade,
      such as keratopathy, glaucoma, cataracts, and silicone oil emulsification3. In addition,
      silicone oil has the potential to cause retinal toxicity. Moreover, the gravity and
      mechanical pressure of the silicone oil on the retina may influence retinal blood flow and,
      and the presence of silicone oil in the vitreous cavity may block the oxygen exchange between
      the retinal surface and the vitreous humor, resulting in the metabolic disturbance of the
      retina. In this study, the investigators utilized a noninvasive measurement (Oxymap,
      Reykjavik, Iceland) to evaluate the effect of silicone oil tamponade on oxygen saturation and
      diameter in retinal vessels in complicated retinal detachment cases.
