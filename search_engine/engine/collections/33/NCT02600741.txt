    
      This is a randomized, open-label, parallel group study of patients with schizophrenia,
      schizoaffective disorder, or schizophreniform disorder and their caregivers. Study will
      consist of a paired patient and caregiver. Patients will receive routine treatment, which may
      include oral antipsychotics or paliperidone palmitate, as directed by their treating
      physician. Caregivers for patients whose routine treatment is paliperidone palmitate will be
      randomized to receive either a study-provided caregiver psycho-education and skills training
      or usual caregiver support. Caregivers for patients whose routine treatment is oral
      antipsychotics will be randomized to the same Study Groups: Study Group 1: Study-provided
      caregiver psycho-education and skills training. Study Group 2: Usual caregiver support
      (caregiver support that is customarily provided by the study site, if any).
      Patients-caregiver pairs will be followed for up to 12 months following baseline assessment.
      Cumulative number of treatment failures over 12 months will be assessed primarily.
