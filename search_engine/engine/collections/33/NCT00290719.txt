    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Evaluate the pathologic response (complete and partial) in patients with resectable
           esophageal or gastroesophageal junction cancer treated with neoadjuvant gefitinib,
           cisplatin, irinotecan hydrochloride, and radiotherapy followed by surgical resection.

      Secondary

        -  Assess the safety and toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Evaluate objective tumor response in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the rate of complete resection in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine surgical morbidity and mortality in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.

        -  Induction phase: Patients receive oral gefitinib once daily on days 1-14. Patients with
           stable or responding disease proceed to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy.

        -  Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy: Patients receive gefitinib as in the induction phase
           beginning in week 4 and continuing through the last day of radiotherapy. Patients also
           receive cisplatin IV over 1 hour and irinotecan hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days
           22, 29, 43, and 50 and undergo radiotherapy once daily, 5 days a week, for 5 weeks
           (total of 25 doses).

        -  Surgery: Within 4-8 weeks after completion of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, patients
           with stable or responding disease undergo an esophagectomy and lymph node dissection.
           Patients with a progressive or unresectable disease are removed from the study.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued for this study.
