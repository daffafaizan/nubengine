      a decongestant such as phenylephrine but it is the 'hot drink' formulation that is often an
      attraction to the patient in deciding on which formulation of a cold medicine to purchase and
      use. Hot drinks have been used to relieve the symptoms of acute respiratory infections such
      as colds and flu for hundreds of years and are found in the traditional medicines of
      countries throughout the world. The idea of using a hot drink to treat colds and flu appears
      to originate from a perceived link between exposure to cold and chilling and the onset of a
      respiratory infection. In order to combat the cold exposure many traditional remedies use a
      warming and soothing drink or application of a warming ointment . Despite the widespread
      folklore that hot drinks are an effective treatment for colds and flu, and the use of hot
      drink formulations for many current common cold medicines, there appears to be no evidence
      base in the medical literature supporting the efficacy of this common treatment for common
      cold. The aim of the present study is to obtain new knowledge about the effects of hot drinks
      on nasal airway resistance and other symptoms of common cold.
