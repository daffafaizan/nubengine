      therapy for a burgeoning population that presents with end-stage renal disease. Although
      organ donation has become a national priority, the gap between the number of patients
      awaiting a kidney versus the number of available kidneys continues to widen exponentially. In
      many countries within the European Union, utilization of "donation after cardiac death" (DCD)
      kidneys is steadily increasing, expanding the donor pool by > 50%. Given the high incidence
      of cardiac deaths in the US, aggressive pursuit of the DCD kidney pool could potentially
      reduce waitlist periods to months, if not days. Risk for delayed graft function (DGF) with
      the attendant risks for increased recipient morbidity, chronic allograft nephropathy and
      increased medical costs has however tempered DCD kidney utilization in this country.
      Development of strategies that limit normothermic reperfusion injury, promote renal repair,
      reduce the incidence and/or duration of DGF and improve long-term outcome can greatly enhance
      acceptance and recruitment of DCD kidneys. The study is designed to evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of an intravenously administered drug in recipients of kidneys from DCD donors who
      are risk for developing DGF. This trial is unique in that it compares drug versus placebo
      outcome in kidney recipients from the same donor with direct evaluation of function
      (creatinine clearance) in the graft.
