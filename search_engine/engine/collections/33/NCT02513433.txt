      agents can be used via epidural route for both intra-op and post-op analgesia.

      Among the drugs used nowadays are Lignocaine, Bupivacaine, Levobupivacaine and
      Ropivacaine.However Bupivacaine usage is not free from side effects.

      The claimed benefits of both Levobupivacaine and Ropivacaine are reduced cardiac toxicity on
      overdose and more specific effects on sensory rather than motor nerve fibres.

      Ropivacaine, an analog of Mepivacaine, is one of the long acting amide anaesthetic agent
      similar to Bupivacaine in chemical structure and anaesthetic function. It is a first
      enantiomer-specific compound, which has a reduced risk of cardio toxicity, neuro toxicity and
      rapid recovery of motor function. Levobupivacaine is the pure S (-)-enantiomer of
      Bupivacaine, and in recent year has emerged as a safer alternative for regional anaesthesia
      than its racemic parent.
