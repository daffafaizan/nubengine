    
      Subjects for this study will be adults with type 1 diabetes who use an insulin pump for
      diabetes self-management.

      Subjects will be admitted to the clinical research center in the morning in the fasting
      state. Subjects will have several admissions. During the initial two admissions, subjects
      will receive either pizza-low fat or pizza-high fat, covered with insulin doses calculated
      from their usual insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio. Study subjects in whom the bolus did not
      provide adequate insulin coverage for pizza-high fat will then undergo an additional 1-5
      admissions during which they will receive the pizza-high fat meal with progressively
      increasing insulin doses until â‰¥ 90% of all postprandial glucose values are within the target
      range 80-180 mg/dL.
