      study analyses were novel and exploratory, they required extensive analyses by study team and
      external experts. As a result of this analysis it was determined on 21-July-2014 that the
      data from Cohort 1 were sufficiently definitive and that enrollment of Cohort 2 would not be
      justified. Since this decision resulted in the LSLV for Cohort 1 becoming the LSLV for the
      study, the full data analysis and reporting is not projected to be complete within 12 Months
      of LSLV. The final analysis and final reporting is planned to be completed on 18-Feb-2015.
      Results for this data are anticipated to be released in April 2015.
