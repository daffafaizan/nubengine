      the phase I part is to determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of adoptive SARS-CoV
      2-specific T cells by evaluation of safety and tolerability.

      In the phase II part, the primary objective is to gain first data on efficacy of adaptive
      therapy with adoptive SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells. This will be a randomized, prospective
      feasibility trial.

      All study patients at WHO ordinal scale â‰¥ 5 will receive the current SoC for treatment of
      Covid-19. Currently this is remdesivir (loading dose 200mg i.v. on day 1, 100mg maintenance
      dose day two to five (up to day 10), dexamethasone 6mg once daily p.o. or i.v. up to day 10
      and a subcutaneous thromboembolism prophylaxis with low molecular-weight heparin. Due to the
      dynamic of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, SoC treatments are underlying rapid changes and are
      continuously developed. Therefore, SoC treatment as defined at the time of respective IMP
      dosing, will be administered.

      The adoptive SARS-CoV-2 specific T cells are suspended and formulated in 50 ml of platelet
      additive solution and will be administered intravenously within 15 min to 30 min.
