    
      A double-blind placebo controlled trial of gabapentin in the setting of an ambulatory
      surgical abortion center where patients receive either the routine intravenous sedation,
      local cervical anesthesia plus 600mg of gabapentin one hour prior to surgery vs. the same
      regimen plus placebo one hour prior to surgery. Our primary outcome measure will be
      post-operative validated pain scores using a 11-point visual analog scale (VAS). Secondary
      measures will include nausea and vomiting during, after and 24 hours after the procedure. A
      second and third pain assessment using VAS will be made at 30 minutes and at 24 hours
      postoperatively.
