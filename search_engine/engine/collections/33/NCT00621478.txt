      children in status epilepticus (SE) and provide recommended doses that are commonly used.
      However, unlike diazepam, lorazepam is only FDA-approved for treatment for SE in patients
      over 18 years of age. Despite this fact, many experts support the use of lorazepam over
      diazepam in pediatric SE. Increased duration of action, increased effectiveness in
      terminating SE, and a lower incidence of respiratory depression have been cited as potential
      advantages of lorazepam over diazepam. However, data to support firm recommendations for one
      medication over another are lacking. Thus, either diazepam (FDA-approved) or lorazepam can be
      considered first-line agents for pediatric SE, and the physician's choice of agent depends on
      local practice patterns and individual treatment styles. In the prehospital (Emergency
      Medical Services) setting, diazepam is commonly chosen because of a longer shelf life without
      refrigeration.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the differences in efficacy and safety between
      these two commonly used benzodiazepines, as requested by the FDA under the Best
      Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, using the Exception from Informed Consent provided by the
      FDA.
