      during pregnancy. The study team plans to investigate role of AT2 in modulation of vascular
      function/dysfunction using vessels isolated from the omental biopsies by examining for the
      evidence of fetal vascular dysfunction mediated by decreased expression of AT2 in
      preeclampsia using vessels isolated from the placentas.

      Study Population: The study will include pregnant women. The pregnant women will participate
      in the omental tissue collection, placenta collection, and the medical record review.

      The study is expects a maximum enrollment of 70 pregnant women. This is because 32 omental
      biopsies and 32 placentas are required to meet proposed statistical considerations. Subjects
      have the option of providing just one or both of the specimens. There is a possibility as few
      as 32 subjects could be enrolled and a maximum of 64 subjects could be enrolled to meet this
      requirement. There is an additional 6 subjects enrollment built into the enrollment number to
      allow for replacement of subjects based on lack of clinical data in some subjects, failure of
      tissue viability and hence experiments.

      This required enrollment (32) is divided into two cohorts based on the diagnosis of
      preeclampsia: 16 of each type of specimen in which the woman was diagnosed with preeclampsia
      during her pregnancy, and 16 of each type of specimen in which the woman was not diagnosed
      with preeclampsia during her pregnancy. Additionally, each cohort of 16 will be divided into
      two groups based on gender of the fetus, 8 male fetuses and 8 female fetuses
