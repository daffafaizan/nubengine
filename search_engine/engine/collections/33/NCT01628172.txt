      order to assess suitability for catheter-based renal sympathetic denervation. A renal
      angiogram is an x-ray study of the blood vessels in the kidney to evaluate for blockage, and
      abnormalities that could be affecting the blood supply to the kidney. It is performed by
      injecting contrast dye through a catheter (a tiny tube) into the blood vessels of the kidney.
      The study doctor will assess whether the renal arteries are suitable to receive
      catheter-based renal denervation.

      Both groups will receive sedation or anesthesia prior to the beginning of the procedure.

      The first group will undergo catheter-based sympathetic renal denervation. Renal Sympathetic
      Denervation is a procedure that uses a catheter probe inserted into the renal (kidney) artery
      that deactivates the nerves that are linked to high blood pressure.

      The second group will only receive renal angiography without the delivery of ablative energy.
