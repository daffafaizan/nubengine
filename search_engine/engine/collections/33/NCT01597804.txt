      I. To investigate whether gynecology surgical patients using a Bathing Bundle using
      chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) 4% skin prep solution (Intervention Group A) have a lower
      incidence of surgical site infection (SSI) than patients treated with the current standard of
      care (patient's choice of antibacterial soap). Standard of care results will be based on
      historical information gathered on Roswell Park Cancer Institute (RPCI) gynecology (GYN)
      patients prior to July 1, 2010 (Historical Control Group B).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo preoperative preparation with the "Bathing Bundle" comprising CHG 4% skin
      prep solution and disposable wash cloths to bathe or shower with the night before and morning
      of surgery.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 2 years.
