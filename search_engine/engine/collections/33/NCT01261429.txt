    
      A key secondary objective of the study will be to determine the efficacy of 24 weeks (6
      months) of nilotinib treatment as measured by the non progression rate (Complete response +
      Partial Response + Stable disease according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumours
      - RECIST version 1.1) in patients with progressive or relapsing PVNS/TGCT who cannot be
      treated by surgery.

      This key secondary objective was defined for the purpose of a further analysis (not described
      in this protocol) which will pool the data of the PVNS study with those of a similar
      concomitant study conducted in the US and Australia.

      The other secondary objectives will be:

      To evaluate the efficacy of nilotinib according to:

        -  The objective tumour response rate (Complete response + Partial Response according to
           RECIST version 1.1) after 12 weeks of treatment

        -  The duration of treatment response

        -  The best overall response obtained during the study

        -  The progression-free survival (PFS)

        -  The time to progression (TTP)

        -  The time to treatment failure (TTF)

        -  The proportion of patients with an operable tumour after nilotinib exposure according to
           investigator evaluation

        -  The description of concomitant treatments use

        -  The correlation between trough levels of nilotinib and objective tumour response To
           assess the safety of nilotinib for PVNS/TGCT patients

      An exploratory objective of the study will be to study the relationship between the objective
      tumour response and the following tumour characteristics (tissues collected in a prior
      surgery, or by biopsy, upon specific acceptance by the patient; if no tissue is available in
      the prior surgery, a biopsy will be done at visit 2):

      Presence of COL6A3/CSF1 fusion gene Presence of M-CSF, CSF1R, KIT, PDGFRA and B on
      immunohistochemistry Presence of phosphorylated c-fms on tumour samples Activation of the
      PI3K/Akt/mTor pathway, presence of activating mutations of ras, and other potential molecular
      alterations
