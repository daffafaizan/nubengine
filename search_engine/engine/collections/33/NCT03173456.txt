      randomized controlled trial designed to compare the efficacy of five oral analgesics: 5 mg
      oxycodone + 325 mg acetaminophen, 5 mg hydrocodone + 300 mg acetaminophen, 30 mg codeine +
      300 mg acetaminophen, 400 mg ibuprofen + 1000 mg acetaminophen, and 800 mg ibuprofen + 1000
      mg acetaminophen for the treatment of patients with acute musculoskeletal pain. The primary
      outcome is the between treatment group difference in change in patients' rating of pain
      intensity one hour after ingestion of the study medication. Secondary outcomes include: 1)
      the between treatment group difference in change in patients' rating of pain intensity two
      hours after ingestion of the study medication; 2) difference in proportion of patients who
      receive rescue medication; 3) difference in proportion of patients who would choose to take
      the study medication again if they returned to the ED with similar pain; 4) difference in
      proportion of patients who experience side effects.
