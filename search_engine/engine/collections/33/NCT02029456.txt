      Thrombolytic therapy (TT) is required in patients with massive PE. PE has a high mortality
      but the in-hospital all-cause case mortality rates were lower in unstable patients who
      received TT than those who did not. However, it was reported that minority (nearly 30%) of
      unstable patients received thrombolytic therapy. The reason that majority of unstable
      patients failed to receive thrombolytic therapy is unclear. The higher rates of complications
      including the life threatening bleeding may be a reason of reluctance in the use of TT.

      The lungs are the only organ receiving the entire cardiac output. Therefore, they are the
      point of convergence for the entire molecules of the thrombolytic agent, independent from the
      route of administration. So that lower doses of the TT might be effective in PE, with the
      additional benefits of enhancing its safety profile. The percutaneous endovenous intervention
      for deep venous thrombosis has suggested an exquisitely favorable pulmonary response to
      low-dose thrombolysis. The aim of the present study was to assess the effects of low-dose
      (25mg) prolonged administration (in 6 hours) of tissue type plasminogen activator (tPA) on
      in-hospital mortality and outcomes in patients with massive PE.

      The primary end points consisted of in hospital all cause mortality, major complications,
      pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular dysfunction. Secondary points are all cause
      mortality, pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular dysfunction at 6 month.
