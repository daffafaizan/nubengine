      metastasis and prognosis in invasive-breast-cancer patients who received neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy before surgery. The model is built based on breast MRI signatures extracted and
      analyzed via deep machine-learning algorithm methods. Invasive breast cancer patients undergo
      multiparametric MRI at baseline, then undergo multiparametric MRI after received neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy for at least 4 cycles as planned. After the surgery, responses to neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy are determined according to the histopathologically examination of the
      surgically resected specimens. After completion of treatment procedure, patients are followed
      up for 5 years.
