      direct laryngoscopy was performed as usual and airway characteristics noted. Patients were
      randomly assigned to tracheal intubation by either the Airway Scope (n=50) or the Macintosh
      laryngoscope (n=50). Intubation was performed from a table positioned at the height as the
      operating table, thus simulating intubating on the ground. Overall intubation success rate,
      time required for intubation, the number of attempts required for successful intubation, and
      airway complications related to intubation were recorded.
