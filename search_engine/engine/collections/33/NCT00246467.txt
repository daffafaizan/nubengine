    
      Plague is an infection occurring in small rodents and mammals caused by the gram-negative
      bacterium Yersinia pestis (Y. pestis). Transmission from rodent to man is usually by a flea
      vector leading to the characteristic swelling of the lymph nodes draining the region of the
      bite, followed by a septicaemic illness (classic bubonic plague). Human-to-human transmission
      can occur via droplet nuclei spread by coughing of patients with bubonic or septicaemic
      plague who have developed pulmonary lesions (pneumonic plague). However, cases of pulmonary
      transmission have also been described from household pets. In pneumonic plague symptoms of a
      respiratory infection develop first followed by an acute onset septicaemic illness. In the
      military context, the likely exposure is via the inhalation route, as a Biological Warfare
      Agent (BWA), and therefore protection against pneumonic plague is the paramount requirement.
      This is a phase 1, parallel group, single-blind study of 105 healthy adult aged 18-55,
      randomly assigned to one of the three cohorts and will receive the same dose of vaccines (2x)
      and then re-randomized at 6 months to receive either a third dose or placebo, in order to
      determine the safety and tolerability associated with different primary immunization doses of
      recombinant IM plague vaccine (rF1 and rV) antigen proteins for optimum safe dose, assess
      responses (both antibody and cell-mediated) following immunization, investigate the
      correlation between cell-mediated and antibody titers and to assess the duration of the
      immune responses to antigens following a third dose.
