      primarily targets the Axl and Mesenchymal-Epithelial Transition (MET) receptors. Sitravatinib
      is an orally-available, potent small molecule inhibitor of a closely related spectrum of
      receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) including MET, Axl, MERTK, VEGFR family, PDGFR family, KIT,
      FLT3, Trk family, RET, DDR2 and selected Eph family members. Mocetinostat is an orally
      administered histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor. Nivolumab is a human IgG monoclonal
      antibody that binds to the programmed cell death-1(PD-1) receptor and blocks its interaction
      with programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) and PD-L2, releasing PD-1 pathway-mediated
      inhibition of the immune response including anti-tumor immune response. Combining an
      immunotherapeutic PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitor with an agent that has both immune modulatory
      and antitumor properties could enhance the antitumor efficacy observed with either agent
      alone.

      The study will begin with a lead-in dose escalation evaluation of two dose levels of each
      investigational agent in combination with nivolumab. Following completion of the lead-in dose
      escalation, enrollment into the Phase 2 study will proceed.
