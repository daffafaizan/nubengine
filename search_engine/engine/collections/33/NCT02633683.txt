      allowed to enroll in the open-label extension (OLE) study (XP110), thereby providing exposure
      to HORIZANT for up to 48 weeks. Enrolled patients will take open-label HORIZANT 600 mg
      tablets once a day at approximately 5 PM with food, beginning at Week 0 of the OLE study up
      to and including Week 36. After the end of the treatment period, a follow-up visit will be
      included 14 days (± 3 days) after the last dose of HORIZANT. Patients will visit the clinical
      site on 6 different occasions, including a follow-up visit 14 days (± 3 days) after the last
      dose of study drug.
