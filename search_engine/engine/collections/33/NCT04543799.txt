    
      The main outcomes of this pilot study can be summarised as:

        -  Using a previously unused methodology to assess whether ADT may negatively affect
           patterns of sleep quality

        -  Identifying sleep micro/macrostructure changes in prostate cancer patients receiving ADT

        -  Comparing the novel methodology with results obtained previously through standard
           methods

        -  Providing statistical underpinnings, such as sample size calculations, for a full
           interventional trial

        -  Highlighting the most appropriate non-pharmaceutical interventions to be tested in the
           full interventional trial
