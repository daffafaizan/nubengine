      older HIV+ AA and Whites. 1b: To explore differences in domain-specific neurocognitive
      impairments between older HIV+ AA and Whites. Aim 2a: To explore the relationship between
      sleep health and neurocognitive function. 2b: To explore the relationship between sleep
      health and cART adherence. 2c: To explore mediation effects of cART adherence between sleep
      health and neurocognitive function. This is the first study to explore racial disparities in
      sleep health and neurocognitive function, using EEG/ERP metrics, among older HIV+ adults.
      There are two phases in this study: Phase I which consists of neurocognitive testing and
      sleep assessments with actigraphy, and Phase II which consist of a 20-30 min EEG.
      Measurements of electrical brain activity will be captured while participants engage in an
      Attention Network Test which measures executive function, attention, and speed of processing.
