        -  Determine the toxicity of intraperitoneal hyperthermic chemoperfusion with oxaliplatin
           in patients with stage IV peritoneal surface malignancies from primary colorectal or
           appendiceal cancer.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in perfusate, normal peritoneum, and
           peritoneal surface tumors in these patients.

        -  Evaluate the expression of proteins involved in the apoptotic and stress-inducible heat
           shock protein pathways (e.g., Fas, TRAIL, DISC components [FADD, TRADD, FLIP, and
           caspase 8], mitochondrial proteins [Bax, Bak, Bcl-2, Bcl-X_L], and heat shock proteins
           [HSPs 27, 40, 70 and 90]) before and after drug therapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a nonrandomized, open-label, dose-escalation study.

      Patients undergo gross tumor resection on day 1. After tumor debulking, patients receive
      oxaliplatin over 2 hours by intraperitoneal hyperthermic chemotherapy (IPHC).

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients in each stratum receive escalating doses of oxaliplatin until the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at
      which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. At least 6 patients are
      treated at the MTD.

      Patients undergo blood and tissue sampling before and after IPHC for pharmacokinetic studies
      and for evaluation of proteins involved in apoptosis and heat-shock-mediated cell death
      (e.g., Fas, TRAIL, FADD, TRADD, FLIP, caspase 8, Bax, Bak, Bcl-X, and heat shock proteins 27,
      40, 70, and 90).

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for at least 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients will be accrued for this study.
