        -  Determine the therapeutic activity of lurtotecan liposome in patients with metastatic or
           loco-regionally recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.

        -  Determine the objective response, duration of response, and time to progression in
           patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the toxicity profile of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the possible pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship of this drug in
           these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to presence of a
      target lesion in a previously irradiated field (within vs outside).

      Patients receive lurtotecan liposome IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats
      every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 6 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 38-72 patients (19-36 per stratum) will be accrued for this
      study.
