      / intervention and cardiac complications. Following each visit, the cardiac complications
      will be captured as well as the mortality.

      Every GUCH patient coming for a visit in one of the specialized organisation participating to
      the registry will be asked to participate. After signing the informed consent form, the
      patient data will be coded and captured in a web-based data base (secuTrialÂ®).

      Pooling the data from the different centres will enable a nation wide register to be
      established. More robust data on the size and composition of the GUCH population will be
      obtained. Also long term prognosis of specific patient group will be derived.
