    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate the efficacy of single agent veliparib (ABT-888) (NSC 737664) in breast cancer
      (BRCA) carriers with metastatic breast cancer based on response rate (Response Evaluation
      Criteria In Solid Tumors [RECIST] criteria).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To conduct subset analysis on BRCA1 versus (vs.) BRCA2 and hormone receptor status.

      II. To evaluate progression-free survival of patients on single-agent ABT-888. III. To
      further describe the safety and tolerability of ABT-888 (NSC 737664) as a single agent and in
      combination with carboplatin for BRCA-associated breast cancer.

      IV. To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of ABT-888 (NSC 737664) alone and in combination with
      carboplatin.

      V. To assess the relationship between the level of poly adenosine diphosphate (ADP) ribose
      polymerase (PARP) inhibition by ABT-888 and biomarkers of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage
      in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC's) and in tumor.

      VI. To explore the relationship between biomarkers of drug effect and progression-free
      survival.

      VII. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of the combination of carboplatin and ABT-888 in
      patients who have failed single agent ABT-888.

      VIII. To conduct subset analysis on BRCA1 vs. BRCA2 and hormone receptor status.

      OUTLINE: This s a dose-escalation study of veliparib. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2
      treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive veliparib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-21.

      ARM II: Patients receive carboplatin intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1 and
      veliparib as in Arm I.

      In both arms, treatment repeats every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3-6 months.
