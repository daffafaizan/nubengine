      relapse the median overall survival is less than a year. No targeted therapies are currently
      available for this subgroup. Compared to other breast cancer subtypes, the percentage of
      tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) is significantly higher in TNBC. Given the durable
      responses induced by the immune checkpoint inhibitor nivolumab in other advanced solid
      cancers, immunotherapeutic approaches, such as blockade of PD-1 by nivolumab may be the key
      to treat TNBC. Moreover, since classical anticancer agents can stimulate immune effector
      cells, the investigators hypothesize that short-term induction treatment with radiation,
      doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide or cisplatin induces an anticancer immune response resulting in
      synergistic activity with nivolumab.
