      donors, who meet the eligibility criteria to donate. Then this plasma will be inactivated by
      riboflavin and UV based photochemical treatment (Mirasol technology - Terumo BCTÂ®), in order
      to add more transfusion security to the procedure. Finally, it will be transfused to CoViD-19
      patients hospitalized in any of the participating clinics. There are currently no reported
      significant adverse events associated with this therapy. Have been published two serial cases
      reports,more evidence is necessary to standardize the treatment.
