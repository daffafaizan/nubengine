      injection into osteoarthritic joints for the treatment of osteoarthritis. Preclinical
      investigations have demonstrated that Hylan G-F 20 can favorably affect chondrocyte
      metabolism and recent clinical studies [Ann Rheum Dis. 2004 May;63(5):478-82; Osteoarthritis
      Cartilage. 2005 Mar;13(3):216-24] provide support for a disease-modifying effect of Hylan G-F
      20 therapy. This study will utilize dGEMRIC imaging of patients with knee OA to assess the
      effects of Hylan G-F 20 therapy on cartilage in vivo over time. Delayed Gadolinium Enhanced
      MRI of the Cartilage (dGEMRIC) permits a quantitative assessment of GAG distribution within
      intact cartilage in vivo. Since dGEMRIC is noninvasive, the technique may be useful to
      non-invasively monitor the influence of various treatments on hyaline cartilage.
