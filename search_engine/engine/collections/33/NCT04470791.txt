      inflammatory process. However, the efficacy of local cryotherapy as a coadjuvant in snakebite
      treatment with F(ab')2 antivenom is unknown.

      Objective: Determine the effect of local cryotherapy as a coadjuvant in patients with
      snakebite treated with F(ab')2 therapy venom.

      Material and methods: Subjects with snakebite envenomation accident grade II, according to
      the Christopher-Rodning classification, were enrolled from the Clinical Toxicology Service of
      the Hospital Juárez de México. One group of patients received F(ab')2 antivenom therapy
      (antivipmyn®) plus local cryotherapy, and another group received only F(ab')2 antivenom
      therapy.
