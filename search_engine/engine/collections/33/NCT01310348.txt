      regulated. Vibration can also effectively enhance muscle strength and power. Previous studies
      have shown that vibration increases muscle electromyographic (EMG) activity. Attempts to
      explain vibration-induced increases in EMG activity were based on the tonic vibration reflex.
      Tonic vibration reflex activates the muscle spindles, thereby enhancing the excitatory drive
      reflex of the alpha motoneurons. On the contrary, it was shown that the vibration treatment
      did not enhance the muscle spindle sensitivity and led to presynaptic inhibition of muscle
      spindle group Ia afferents. As an alternative to tonic vibration reflex, the recently
      described bone myoregulation reflex has been suggested to potentially explain the increased
      muscle strength and electrical activity induced by vibration. Based on the bone myoregulation
      reflex, bone is sensitive to mechanical stimuli and can send mechanical input signals to
      central nervous system and so can neuronally regulate the muscle activity.

      The cyclic mechanical loading to the bone stimulates the osteocytes. According to bone
      myoregulation reflex, the more the osteocytes are stimulated by the cyclic mechanical
      loading, the increase occurring in the muscle strength and activity may be more. The rate of
      osteocytes stimulated by vibration may be determined with serum sclerostin level. Sclerostin,
      the protein product of the SOST gene, is an osteocyte-specific cysteine knot-secreted
      glycoprotein that is a potent inhibitor of bone formation. Sost/sclerostin levels have been
      reported to be reduced by mechanical stimulation.
