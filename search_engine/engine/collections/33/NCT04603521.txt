      disease which may produce lifestyle limiting symptoms or even death. Medication can sometimes
      be of benefit, but surgical intervention with septal myectomy has been an alternative
      intervention. The experience with this surgery at NIH provides a unique opportunity to
      evaluate the long-term success of this operation.Dr. Andrew G. Morrow was the originator of
      this operation and performed over 200 septal myectomies at NIH starting in 1960. Reviewing
      the results of his experience will provide important information regarding the benefits of
      this intervention in these patients.
