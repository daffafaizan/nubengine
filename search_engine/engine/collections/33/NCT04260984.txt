      the wrist. It often interferes wrist and thumb movement, and may affect activity of daily
      life. It is caused by overuse and impaired gliding of the abductor pollicis longus (APL) and
      extensor policis brevis (EPB) tendons at the styloid process of the radius. It is associated
      with postpartum baby care, or jobs or hobbies that involve repetitive hand and wrist motions.
      The most effective treatment is corticosteroid injection into the tendon sheath of the
      conjoined tendons of APL and EPB. Over the past few years because of advancement of
      sonography in the musculoskeletal system, ultrasound (US)-guided intra-sheath injection has
      become popular, and it has been proved to improve the accuracy of placement of needle tip in
      the tendon sheath, however, studies comparing the effect and side effects of US-guided
      corticosteroid injection with palpation-guided injection for de Quervain's disease have never
      been reported before. The purposes of this study are to compare the effectiveness and side
      effects of US-guided and palpation-guided corticosteroid injections for de Quervain's
      disease.

      The investigators plan to recruit 70 patients with de Quervain's disease, half of them will
      be randomly assigned into US-guided injection group, and the other half into the
      palpation-guided injection group. Each subject will receive one shot of injection and each
      subject will expect to fill in the evaluation form at baseline, and at 1 week, 3 months, and
      6 months after the injection. Statistics will be performed after completing the patients'
      treatment and evaluations.
