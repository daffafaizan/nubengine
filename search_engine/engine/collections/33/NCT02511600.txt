      decortication as planned. Participant will sign a separate consent for this procedure that
      explains the risks.

      At the time of participant's surgery, sutures and staples are used to help correct air leaks,
      which is standard.

      Then, participant will be randomly assigned (as in the flip of a coin) to 1 of 2 study
      groups. This is done because no one knows if one study group is better, the same, or worse
      than the other group:

        -  One group will have Progel® added to the surface of the lung before closing the chest.

        -  The other group will have talcum powder added to the surface of the lung before closing
           the chest.

      Participant will have an equal chance of being in either group.

      During the surgery, air leaks will be checked electronically and that information will be
      recorded.

      After surgery, participant will be asked to rate their pain on a pain scale of 0-10.
      Participant will be asked to complete this pain scale 3 times each day while they are in the
      hospital.

      Length of Study Participation:

      After participant's surgery and their air leak is resolved, their participation in this study
      will be over.

      This is an investigational study. The Progel® surgical sealant is FDA approved for the
      control of air leaks during lung surgery. It is investigational to compare the surgical
      sealant with the standard-of-care (talcum powder) to learn if it can reduce the number of
      days in the hospital after surgery.

      Up to 48 participants will enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.
