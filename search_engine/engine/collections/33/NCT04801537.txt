      production of heat because they are not able to generate an adequate shivering response.
      Under the condition, environment temperature should be given to protect an infant from cold
      stress and cold injury, even NEC.

      Therefore, the setting of the optimal environment temperature is a key focus in neonatal
      ward. Here, the investigators suggest a hypothesis that environment temperature should be set
      to keep warmth of extremities temperature and infant's body temperature is between 36.7-37.3
      centigrade.

      In the present study, the investigators will test the hypothesis.
