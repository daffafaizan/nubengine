    
      This is a prospective observational study conducted to (1) characterize the patients who
      receive DUPIXENT速 for AD in a real world setting with respect to their medical history,
      socio-demographic and disease characteristics, and prior and concomitant treatments of AD;
      (2) characterize real world use patterns of DUPIXENT速 for AD (eg, most commonly used regimens
      by line of therapy, reason for initiation of new treatments, concomitant therapies, treatment
      durations and reasons for discontinuation and/or switching); (3) assess the long-term
      effectiveness of DUPIXENT速 in AD patients in a real world setting; (4) assess comorbid atopic
      conditions, patterns of use and effects of treatment in comorbid atopic conditions in
      patients who receive DUPIXENT速 for AD; and (5) collect safety data on study participants
