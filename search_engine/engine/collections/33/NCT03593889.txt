      consequences and high societal costs. Early intervention and prevention can be effective in
      addressing the problem. The challenges in implementing early intervention and prevention
      within the existing service platforms, however, are threefold: (1) fragmented services; (2)
      reactive services; and (3) stigma and low awareness. These challenges resulted in the current
      service overload and mismatch, which will be compounded by rapid population ageing and mental
      health workforce shrinkage. The study can address these challenges by (1) realigning existing
      mental health and elderly services; (2) productive ageing for outreach and engagement; and
      (3) building up capacity of a preventive network in the neighbourhood. This pilot project
      therefore combines models of collaborative stepped care and productive ageing, with
      systematic education programmes, to empower the neighbourhood in providing effective early
      intervention and prevention for elderly depression. In the four representative pilot
      districts of Kwun Tong, Sham Shui Po, Kwai Chung, and Tseung Kwan O, community mental health
      and elderly services will collaborate to deliver a stepped care service protocol for
      preventing and detecting elderly depression. In 3 years, this project will deliver six
      programmes: (1) social services staff training; (2) peer supporters certificate training; (3)
      outreach and engagement activities for at-risk older adults; (4) standardized prevention and
      early intervention service; (5) community education programmes; and (6) public awareness and
      public education activities. This will produce a mature service model tested in one-fifth of
      the districts in Hong Kong with different demographic and service characteristics; create a
      strong team of Peer Supporters and Social Workers in Elderly Mental Health with clinical
      competence in preventing elderly depression and promoting elderly mental wellness;
      significantly raise public and neighbourhood awareness and care for elderly mental wellness;
      reach out and serve 2,880 at-risk older adults and 960 depressed older adults; and provide
      evidence on the social impact of the model for further service rollout.
