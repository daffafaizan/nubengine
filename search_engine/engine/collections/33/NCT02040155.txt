      radiation dose to a very small and well-specified target within a patient with cancer. Yet
      there is no current convenient, inexpensive, real time method of confirming the radiation
      dose delivered. There is no current monitoring or fail-safe device for radiation oncologists
      and their patients if the radiation dose becomes too high, especially to radiation sensitive
      organs, or conversely if the target receives too little dose.High dose-rate(HDR)
      brachytherapy is a highly advanced radiation-based cancer treatment, where a very small
      radioactive source, Iridium-192, is placed in or near the tumor through a catheter or
      channel. This provides a high radiation dose to the tumor in 5-15 minutes with a precise
      location, while minimizing radiation exposure to surrounding tissue and organs. This protocol
      will determine the feasibility of using a novel nano-material based fiber-optic dosimeter
      (nanoFOD) device, with dimensions less than 1 mm wide, to measure real-time, pin-point,
      in-vivo radiation dose given during radiation therapy treatments. The size of the device
      allows placement through a catheter or channel near areas of interest, or within already
      placed brachytherapy delivery catheters.
