      been compared in several trials for procedural sedation. However, none of clinical trial has
      enough number of patients to clarify the conclusive differences among sedatives. Thus,
      pooling all available studies together systematically by network meta-analysis for GI
      endoscopic procedure may provide a better understanding of efficacy and safety of sedatives.
      Therefore we would like to conduct a network meta-analysis to analyze the outcomes of GI
      endoscopy by using the most recently-published interventional trials.
