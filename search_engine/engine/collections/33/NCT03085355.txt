      associated exercises and pain neurocience education improves pain and function in individuals
      with chronic non-specific neck pain

      Design: a randomized single blind controlled pragmatic trial will be conducted trial.
      Patients (n=40) with non-specific neck pain will be randomized to receive 1) osteopathic
      manipulative treatment and exercise and and pain neurocience education (n=20) or 2) exercise
      alone and pain neurocience education (n=20). Participants will receive 8 treatments during 4
      weeks. Clinical outcomes will be obtained at 1 week, four weeks and 24 weeks after end of
      treatment.

      Methods:

      The primary outcome will be pain measured by 11-point numerical pain rating scale. The
      secondary outcome will be disability measured by the Neck Disability Index, range of motion
      measured by Cervical Range of Motion device, Pressure pain threshold measured by electronic
      algometer, global perceived effect, Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire and pain catastrophizing
      scale
