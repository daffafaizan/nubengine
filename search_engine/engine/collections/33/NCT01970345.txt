      barrier and has beneficial effects on synaptic development by promoting neuronal cell
      survival, synaptic maturation, and synaptic plasticity. IGF-1 is effective in reversing mouse
      and neuronal models of Rett syndrome and Phelan McDermid syndrome, both single gene causes of
      ASD and may therefore be effective in treating autism spectrum disorders (ASD) more broadly.
