      groups: bottom-up approaches (neurodevelopmental, sensory integration, mental imagery,
      cognitive stimulation, perceptual-motor/kinesthetic training...) and top-down approaches
      (task-oriented approach, neuromotor task training, occupational performance coaching, the
      CO-OP approach). Although bottom-up intervention approaches have existed for several years
      longer than top-down approaches, in general, top-down intervention approaches have shown
      better results.

      In the latest work with post-stroke adults with objective cognitive impairment, the data
      indicate the relevance of CO-OP in improving performance and satisfaction, attention,
      inhibition and flexibility or apathy.

      This study aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of the CO-OP approach in adult post-stroke
      patients in chronic phase, specifically on planning function, through the Single Case
      Experimental Design methodology by randomized intervention (3 patients) over 6 weeks of
      treatment and 10 weeks of evaluation.
