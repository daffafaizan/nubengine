      afflicted by this condition. Studies on WC have been hampered by the lack of objective,
      validated rating scales. In this study, we will test and validate new instruments to rate WC;
      the WC impairment scale (WCIS) and a new disability scale (WCDS).We will also collect
      exploratory data about biomechanics of the hand.

      Study population: The study population will consist of 20 subjects. Ten patients with WC and
      10 age and handedness matched HVs will constitute the study population.

      Design: 10 patients with WC and 10 age- and handedness-matched HV will be videotaped while
      writing. The WCIS scores will be given to each subject by four blinded raters (Drs. Mark
      Hallett, Barbara Karp, Katherine Alter, and Camilo Toro) based on the videos. The patients
      will complete the WCDS. In addition, each individual will be asked to repeat some basic
      elements of the scale while writing on the screen of a tablet PC, and on the surface of a
      detached digitizing tablet in order to generate high temporal and spatial resolution pen tip
      position samples for further numerical analyses and scoring. The biomechanics of the hand
      will be measured using a published scale.

      Outcome measures: Using the WCIS, inter and intra-rater reliability, internal consistency
      (Cronbach s alpha) face validity, and reproducibility will be measured in addition to other
      secondary outcomes. The ease of use by the raters will be assessed for each subject.
      Reproducibility of writing on tablet, writing on paper placed on a writing tablet, and
      writing on a tablet PC will be assessed. Finally, biomechanics of the hands of patients with
      WC will be compared with those of the unaffected healthy volunteers.
