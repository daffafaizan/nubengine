      dose (MTD)/recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) for the combination of LJM716 and alpelisib,
      followed by an open-label, randomized Phase 2 part to compare anti-tumor activity of
      LJM716-alpelisib combination versus physician's choice of second-line therapy (paclitaxel,
      docetaxel, irinotecan). However, the phase 2 part was not conducted as the study was
      terminated early due to limited anti-tumor activity with LJM716-alpelisib combination
      observed in phase 1b.
