    
      This is a Phase II randomized, controlled, two-arm, open-label, multicenter study comparing
      the safety and efficacy of tositumomab and iodine I 131 tositumomab to tositumomab for the
      treatment of chemotherapy-relapsed or refractory low-grade or transformed low-grade B-cell
      NHL.

      Treatment Arm A: Subject will undergo 2 phases of study. In the first phase, termed
      "dosimetric dose", subjects will receive tositumomab (450 mg) followed by tositumomab (35 mg)
      that has been trace labeled with 5mCi) Iodine-131 tositumomab. Whole body gamma camera scans
      will be obtained on day 0, day 2, 3, or 4, and day 6 or 7 following the dosimetric dose.
      Using the dosimetric data from three imaging time points, a subject-specific dose of iodine I
      131 tositumomab to deliver the desired total body dose of radiotherapy will be calculated. In
      the second phase of the study, termed "therapeutic dose", subjects will receive unlabeled
      tositumomab (450mg) followed by iodine tositumomab (35mg) labeled with the subject-specific
      dose of iodine I-131 to deliver a whole body dose of 75 cGy to subjects. Subjects with
      platelet counts of 100,001 - 149,999 cells/mm3, will receive 65 cGy and subjects who are
      obese will be doses based on 137% of their lean body mass. Subjects will be treated with
      either saturated solution potassium iodide (SSKI), Lugol's solution, or potassium iodide
      tablets starting at least 24 hours prior to the first infusion of the Iodine-131 tositumomab
      (i.e., the dosimetric dose) and continuing for 14 days following the last infusion of
      radiolabeled tositumomab (i.e., the therapeutic dose).

      Treatment Arm B: Subjects will receive the same amount of unlabeled tositumomab (450 + 35 mg)
      administered over the same time-frame as Arm A on the study Days 0 and 7 (the day 7 dose may
      be delayed but no longer than 14 days after the first dose).

      Crossover treatment Arm B: Subjects in Arm B may crossover and receive Iodine-131 tositumomab
      following progression of their lymphoma if they still fulfill the protocol inclusion
      exclusion criteria (except exclusion criteria#12) and are HAMA-negative.
