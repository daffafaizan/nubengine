      BrainPath® Approach (i.e., MIPS) and a medically managed cohort. The integrated surgical
      approach includes a combination of available technologies, including the FDA-cleared NICO
      BrainPath® for non-disruptive access and NICO Myriad® to achieve the goal of maximum clot
      evacuation. The medically managed cohort will be treated according the Clinical
      Standardization Guidelines (CSG) as adapted by Emory University from the 2015 AHA/ASA
      Guidelines for the Management of Spontaneous Intracerebral Hemorrhage. Clinical efficacy will
      be determined by demonstrating a 10% improvement in functional outcome, as determined by a
      blinded-assessment of the 180-day utility-weighted modified Rankin Scale (mRS).

      Data suggests improved mortality rates and potential functional benefits of surgical ICH
      evacuation. The methodology proposed for this trial was tested in a preliminary series of 39
      patients treated for supratentorial spontaneous ICH and retrospectively reviewed (Labib et
      al.). These results were replicated in a single center retrospective series of 18 patients
      (Bauer et al.). Despite positive results of both studies and the widely accepted benefit of
      the BrainPath Approach (i.e., MIPS) for subcortical lesions, stronger evidence supporting the
      use of these techniques in ICH is needed for the technique to become universally validated.
