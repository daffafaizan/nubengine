      I. To evaluate the safety and toxicities of a treatment regimen consisting of rituximab
      (intravenously [IV]) the day prior to methotrexate (intra-arterially [IA]), and carboplatin
      (IA) in conjunction with blood-brain barrier disruption (BBBD) and delayed sodium thiosulfate
      (IV).

      II. To demonstrate, adding a monoclonal antibody and carboplatin to methotrexate BBBD, that a
      45% rate of complete response (CR) within the first 3 months of treatment is achieved, while
      excluding a CR rate as low as 30%.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To estimate the response rate (counting all CRs), the two-year overall survival and the
      two-year event-free survival, as baselines for subsequent trials.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive rituximab IV over 5 hours on day 1, mannitol IA, methotrexate IA over 10
      minutes, and carboplatin IA over 10 minutes on days 2 and 3. Patients then receive sodium
      thiosulfate IV over 15 minutes at 4 and 8 hours after carboplatin. Treatment repeats monthly
      for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 2 months, then every 2
      months for 2 years, every 6 months for 1 year, and then annually for at least 2 years.
