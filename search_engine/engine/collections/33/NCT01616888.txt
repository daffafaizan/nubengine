      legs or feet and slowly wounds that can affect patients' quality of life and increase the
      risk of leg amputation and death. Both conventional balloon angioplasty (CBA) alone and CBA
      plus bare metal stents are the current primary endovascular therapy to treat PAD. However,
      exaggerated neointimal hyperplasia leading to in-stent restenosis is associated with CBA.
      Paclitaxel coated balloons have been recognized to be safe and effective for the treatment of
      coronary in-stent restenosis, which the investigators hypothesize to be applicable in
      femoropopliteal cases.
