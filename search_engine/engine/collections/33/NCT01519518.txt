    
      HEAT-PPCI is a single-centre prospective, dual-arm, open-label, randomised controlled trial
      comparing two antithrombotic agents in patients undergoing PPCI. All patients presenting to
      the PPCI service at Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital will be assessed for trial
      eligibility. The patients will be allocated by randomisation in equal proportions to the two
      treatment groups receiving UFH (70 units/kg prior to the procedure) or bivalirudin (bolus of
      0.75 mg/kg prior to the start of the intervention, followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg/kg per
      hour for the duration of the procedure).

      Pre-Specified Subgroup Analyses

        -  Subgroup analyses looking at the impact of access site comparing radial versus femoral
           route

        -  Assessment of the outcomes in diabetic patients receiving oral hypoglycaemic or insulin
           therapy versus all other patients

        -  Comparing the outcomes in patients < or â‰¥ 75 years of age

        -  Type of p2y12 receptor inhibiting antiplatelet agent (Examples: clopidogrel, prasugrel,
           ticagrelor)

        -  Patients with impaired LV function versus normal LV function

        -  Patients managed with actual or attempted primary PCI versus no immediate PCI procedure
           attempted

      PLATELET FUNCTION SUBSTUDY A substudy will be performed to assess indices of coagulation and
      platelet function studies comparing the impact of heparin or bivalirudin therapy on
      coagulation status at the end of the PPCI procedure. This study will be performed on all
      patients treated between the hours of 0800 and 1600, Monday to Friday. A single blood sample
      taken at the time of general blood sampling for routine clinical screening will be analysed.
