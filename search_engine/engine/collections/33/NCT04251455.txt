      will eventually need health-care attention. Patients with TMJ osteoarthritis (OA) or chronic
      inflammatory arthritis (CIA) are not that common, prevalence numbers are lacking. These TMJ
      diseases or dysfunctions can severely affect the patients' well-being because of local pain,
      chewing problems, psychosocial impact, amongst others. Treatment is primarily non-invasive to
      its character where orthotic splint, physiotherapy, medication, or other treatments can be
      evaluated. Patients who do not respond to these efforts might have surgery. Arthroscopy is a
      minimal invasive intervention with a described success rate from 50-90%. From the patients',
      the society and the surgeons' point of view, better individual pre-operative prognostication
      is valuable. TMJ disc displacement, OA and CIA is not fully characterised in terms of
      aetiopathogenesis. There are studies investigating components of extra cellular matrix and
      cytokines TMJ. The multitude of proteins still not studied may contribute in an unknown
      fashion to new insights in aetiology and to new treatment opportunities. The aim of the study
      is to characterise synovial tissue, synovial fluid, and clinical parameters and relate them
      to the specific TMJ diagnosis but also to each others. A secondary aim is to relate the
      outcome of surgery to both clinical and tissue variables in order to determine if there are
      factors that might function as predictors of outcome. A tertiary aim is to investigate if
      patients who suddenly develops disc displacement without reduction (DDwoR) without any prior
      signs or symptoms from the TMJ differs in their tissue or clinical characteristics compared
      to patients who develops DDwoR after having prior signs or symptoms from the TMJ.
