      corticosteroid or other anti-inflammatory agent to treat ocular inflammation and improve
      patient comfort. If left untreated, inflammation of the eye may result in further ocular
      complications including scarring, vision loss, or blindness. Although the exact dosing
      regimen is physician-dependent, patients are typically prescribed a topical corticosteroid
      for a period of 2-4 weeks following surgery, being tapered over the course of delivery as the
      inflammation subsides. Topical anti-inflammatory agents are usually administered multiple
      times per day, particularly in the early period following ophthalmic surgery. Continuing
      efforts in drug development aim to identify alternatives to ophthalmic corticosteroid use,
      due to their well-known local and systemic negative side effects.
