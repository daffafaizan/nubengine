           Tyrosine kinase inhibitor -TKI(including imatinib, dasatinib and nilotinib) for more
           than 5 years, and patients with BCR/ABLIS continuous negative in the last 18 months were
           randomly admitted to maintain the original effective TKI by half or stop taking .

        2. Q-pcr detected BCR/ABLIS in peripheral blood once every month, once every two months
           after half a year, and continuously monitored for 12 months.

        3. If the patients detected molecular recurrence (loss of MMR, BCR/ABLIS > 0.1%), the
           original dose of TKI should be administered again.
