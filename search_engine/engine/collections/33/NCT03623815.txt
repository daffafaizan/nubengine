      transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a potential effective treatment for
      depression through restoring a left/right imbalance in frontal brain activity (Boggio et al.,
      2008; Loo et al., 2012) and improving top down control of anxiety responses.

      An initial exploratory study was carried out in 2012 (Ironside et al 2015) to examine the
      effects of tDCS on emotional processing in healthy volunteers using a range of tasks and
      questionnaires. Using a dot probe task, which measures attention to happy or fearful faces,
      it was found that tDCS has the potential ability to reverse an attentional bias to fearful
      faces seen in the placebo group. This indicates that anxiety responses may be modified using
      tDCS and therefore this follow on study seeks to further explore the role of tDCS in trait
      anxiety and investigate the neural correlates of this with fMRI.

      The present study uses behavioural and neuroimaging results to examine how tDCS affects
      emotional processing relevant to trait anxiety. A within-subjects design increases the power
      of the study, given limited resources to carry out extensive neuroimaging. Our working
      hypothesis is that tDCS may alter activity in cortical regions relevant to attentional
      control and anxiety.

      The findings of this study will be used to determine parameters for future patient studies,
      involving participants with generalized anxiety disorder or major depression. The ultimate
      aim, explored through further studies, is to understand and improve how tDCS might be used in
      the treatment of these disorders.
