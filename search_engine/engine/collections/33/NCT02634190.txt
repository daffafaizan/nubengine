    
      The study is conducted in the areas of Tuebingen, Freiburg and Saarbruecken in Germany. In
      total, 10.000 ThinPrep速 LBC cervical samples were collected from June 2009 to May 2012.
      Liquid based cytology (LBC) was performed by a central laboratory in Saarbruecken. Human
      papilloma virus (HPV) testing with the HR HPV HC2速 test and APTIMA速 HPV Assay were performed
      at the Section of Experimental Virology, Institute of Medical Virology, University Clinic of
      Tuebingen, Germany (UKT).

      Within a follow-up phase women who tested positive in any test at baseline will be monitored
      over a period of 10 years.

      Study close out visit: In addition, approximately 5 years after baseline ThinPrep速 LBC
      cervical samples will be collected from a random sample of 4000 study participants who tested
      triple negative at baseline for determination of the longitudinal negative predictive value
      (NPV) and HPV related disease after a 5 year period. Women who tested positive in any test
      will undergo colposcopy.
