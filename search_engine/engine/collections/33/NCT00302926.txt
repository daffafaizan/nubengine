      Previous epidemiological studies have associated elevated levels of acute phase proteins,
      mainly C-reactive protein, with cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and cardiac death. Levels of
      several cy-tokines and acute phase proteins as CRP, haptoglobin and fibrinogen have been
      found associated with elevated body fat and the risk of diseases associated to the metabolic
      syndrome.

      Method:

      Thirty-six otherwise healthy obese subjects (BMI: 34.23.2 kg/m2, age: 43.410.5 y)
      participated in a 20-week controlled dietary intervention divided into 4 periods. Weight
      reduction was induced by an 8-week low caloric diet (LCD) (3.4 MJ/d) followed by a 4-week
      weight stable maintenance program (M1). Subsequently, they underwent another 4-week LCD (4.2
      MJ/d) followed by a final 4-week weight stable maintenance diet (M2). Blood samples and
      anthropometrical measures were assessed at baseline and after each of the four periods (8,
      12, 16 and 20 weeks).
