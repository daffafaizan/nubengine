    
      This is a phase II trial with a parallel-group design, consisting of a drug-free run-in phase
      (phase 1), followed by a placebo controlled double-blind phase (phase 2). Patients will
      receive either R093877 0.5 mg b.i.d., 1 mg b.i.d. or 2 mg b.i.d. or placebo for a period of
      12 weeks.

      Phase 1 is a run-in period of 4 weeks duration, during which the bowel habit is documented
      and the existence of constipation confirmed. At the start of this period all existing
      laxative medication is withdrawn and patients will be instructed not to change their dietary
      habits, in particular their fiber intake during the trial. Patients will enter the
      double-blind phase if constipation has been shown to be present during the run-in period.

      If the definition of constipation was not met during the 4 weeks of the run-in period, the
      patient will be considered ineligible for the double-blind period.

      Phase 2 is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase, in which patients will be
      treated for 12 weeks with either 0.5 mg, 1 mg or 2 mg of R093877 or placebo given twice daily
      (one capsule is taken before breakfast and one is to be taken before the evening meal).

      Patients admitted to the double blind treatment period will be randomly allocated to one of
      the 4 treatment arms.
