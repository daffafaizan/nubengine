      essentially show the distribution of the inhaled gas inside the lungs. Measurements can be
      performed on these images to provide additional information that can be related to pulmonary
      function.

      Participation will involve at least two study visits. During the first visit, participants
      will provide written, informed consent, and undergo eligibility screening. Study drug
      administration, use of the investigational devices, and MR imaging for this study will be
      performed at the 3T Research MRI at the Thunder Bay Regional Health Sciences Centre (TBRHSC).
      Pulmonary Function Tests (PFTs) will be performed at TBRHSC by a Registered Respiratory
      Therapist (RRT) and an MR Tech will be present for the duration of participant scans.

      Participants will be placed in the MRI with the appropriate chest coil wrapped around them
      like a vest. Several inhalation procedures will be carried out during scanning. Participants
      safety will be closely monitored throughout the entire study.
