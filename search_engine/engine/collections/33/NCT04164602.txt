      5-year survival rate of only about 6%. The disease usually pertaining no symptoms at the
      early phase, this might be one of the causes why it is discovered at a relatively late,
      inoperable stage - in most of the cases. The success of reducing the high mortality rate of
      pancreatic cancer could depend on the significant development of early diagnosis and also
      prevention programs. As the lifetime prevalence of pancreatic cancer is only 1.39%, screening
      through the whole population would be extremely expensive and difficult to manage. It would
      be recommended for all the individuals at high risk for pancreatic cancer to be examined.
      Patients newly diagnosed with diabetes have an approximately 8-fold risk for developing this
      type of cancer, compared to the average population. In addition to this age is also known as
      an independent risk factor for the pancreatic cancer. Recently there has been a biomarker
      panel identified, which may distinguish between pancreatic cancer and chronic pancreatitis in
      patients, with high sensitivity and specificity. The aim of this study is to accomplish the
      early diagnosis of pancreatic cancer, in patients over 60 years of age with newly diagnosed
      diabetes mellitus using a specific biomarker panel. Only patients with type 2 diabetes are
      meant to be included. Diabetes is classified by determining C-peptide levels, representing
      the endogenous insulin synthesis, also detecting glutamic acid decarboxylase (GADA)
      antibodies, the autoantibody against the pancreatic islet cells. The early diagnosis of
      pancreatic cancer could be the way to enable efficient cure for the patients.
