      maintenance is generally poor. The researchers urgently need new information regarding the
      most cost effective programme(s) for maintenance of weight loss. This study will recruit 200
      women and compare two approaches for providing support: one with intensive health
      professional support, the other peer group support facilitated by a research nurse with
      frequent 'weigh- ins'. The researchers will also compare two different diets one a high
      carbohydrate, high fibre, low glycaemic index diet versus one relatively high in
      monounsaturated fat and protein and low in glycaemic load.
