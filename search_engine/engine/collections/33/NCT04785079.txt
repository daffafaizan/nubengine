      intervention. Graston Â® technique is a form of IASTM that requires completion of a
      certification course and utilizes specific stainless-steel tools. IASTM has been found to
      improve range of motion, pain and patient reported function in pathological individuals. One
      method by which these improvements are thought to occur is by increasing blood flow.
      Increased blood flow brings nutrients and oxygen to the area and is thought to contribute to
      tissue remodeling. There is very limited research investigating blood flow changes following
      IASTM. In order to measure blood flow changes following IASTM, doppler ultrasound may be
      used. There are no studies to our knowledge quantifying changes in blood flow following IASTM
      using ultrasound. Power doppler approximates perfusion by detecting a frequency shift from
      movement of red blood cells and color is then encoded proportionally to the number of red
      blood cells. Power doppler imaging quantification (PDIQ) is a feature of musculoskeletal
      ultrasound (MSK) that compares the number of color pixels and the intensity of color within
      these pixels to grey scale pixels within a given image. The aim of this study is to determine
      if there is an increase in blood flow in the trapezius, plantar fascia and medial arch of the
      foot measured following IASTM. Blood flow was measured by using PDIQ ratio in the doppler
      setting of MSK ultrasound.
