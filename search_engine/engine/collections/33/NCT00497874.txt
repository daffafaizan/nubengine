      depression. However, there is a lack of interventions for individuals who are not willing to
      seek help or follow through with treatment recommendations. This is the first
      population-based intervention for depression that is appropriate for individuals in all
      stages of change-not merely the minority who are prepared to take action. Two primary care
      samples were included: 1) patients at risk for or experiencing depression but not involved in
      or planning treatment (Untreated Sample), and 2) patients newly prescribed antidepressant
      medication (Antidepressant Sample). Patients from both samples were randomly assigned to
      receive the intervention consisting of telephone assessments, a stage-based workbook, and
      three individualized, computer-generated reports mailed to the home (n=443), or usual care
      (n=459). Primary outcomes, assessed at 9 months, were change in depression severity, reliable
      and clinically significant change in depression severity, stage of change for using effective
      methods or prevent or reduce depression, onset of major depression if experiencing only
      subclinical symptoms at baseline, and medication adherence. The study design included an
      examination of whether the intervention effect was moderated by primary care sample, baseline
      use of effective methods to prevent or reduce depression, and level of depression.
