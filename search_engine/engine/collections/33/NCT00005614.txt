      women with metastatic breast cancer. II. Evaluate the quality of life in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 1 hour weekly for 7 consecutive weeks in an 8
      week course. Treatment then continues weekly for 3 consecutive weeks in 4 week courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Quality of life is assessed prior to
      treatment and then every 12 weeks. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, then
      every 6 months until year 5, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study over 2 years.
