      examination of a population's social norms pertaining to sex, dating, and alcohol- use.
      Studies show that the social norms surrounding these behaviors can be risk factors that
      increase the likelihood that certain high-risk men will perpetrate sexual assault.

      Among college-age men, research on social norms has been used to inform the development of a
      sexual assault prevention program that positively impacts high-risk men. A hallmark of this
      approach is its exploration of the climate of a given population with regard to sex, dating
      and alcohol-use, and its use of data gathered to inform the development of a sexual assault
      program. Researchers have yet to study the effectiveness of this approach in the U.S. Army.

      It has been well documented that sexual assault in the Army carries a significant threat to
      the readiness of the force. As such, the Army continues to make strong and laudable efforts
      to reduce sexual assault. However, there remains a need to better understand how young
      at-risk men behave in the social situations where sexual assault can occur and what they
      subjectively believe about these behaviors in order to effectively reduce perpetration.

      In order to fill this gap, the investigators propose to implement a sexual assault prevention
      program by using social norms and bystander approach concepts via surveys, interviews and
      group workshops. The data and feedback from this research have the potential to produce
      insight that could help leaders and the investigators more effectively promote health in male
      Soldiers' dating and sexual relationships.
