      in the insular cortex of patients with an oxaliplatin induced neuropathy. Other objectives
      will assess the correlation between metabolite concentrations in the insular cortex and
      frequency / intensity of pain and neuropathic symptoms, cold and heat-induced pain and
      comorbidities (anxiety, pain, quality of life).
