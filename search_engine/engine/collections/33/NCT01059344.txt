      mainly in Europe and Asia. Approved dosages for the treatment of active UC are between 2.4
      and 4.8 g/day in analogy to the approved 400 mg dosage form. The present trial is planned to
      generate efficacy data to support the safe use of a 4.8 g/day dose of the 800 mg dosage form
      in a well defined population of patients with mildly to moderately active UC. In keeping with
      the EMEA UC guideline the study will have a placebo-controlled 6 weeks induction treatment.
      After 6 weeks, treatment success will be evaluated using the modified UC disease activity
      index as primary efficacy measurement.
