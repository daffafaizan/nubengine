    
      The current study aims to investigate the following issues:

        -  Changes in cognitive activation patterns under therapy with the typical neuroleptic
           haloperidol as compared to the atypical antipsychotics amisulpride and olanzapine

        -  Relationship of these changes in activity to psychopathological, neuropsychological and
           pharmacotherapeutic variables (e.g. drug plasma level) as well as to certain biological
           markers (HVA, prolactin)

        -  Relationship between diffusion anisotropy as an indicator for structural connectivity
           and cognitive activation patterns under antipsychotic treatment
