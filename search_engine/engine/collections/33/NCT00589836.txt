      variety of cardiac pathologies.

      Simple and inexpensive methods for measurement of LV torsion could facilitate more widespread
      investigation of LV torsion, which might reveal significant relationships between torsional
      alterations and clinical outcomes and eventually lead to routine clinical application.
      Recently, Doppler tissue imaging (DTI) has been shown to accurately reflect myocardial
      velocity24,25 with better temporal resolution than MRI.26 Investigators hypothesize therefore
      that DTI might be used for quantification of LV rotation and torsion of the human heart. The
      purpose of the present study was to examine the accuracy of a novel method with DTI for
      quantifying the LV torsion in humans and tagged MRI as the reference standard.
