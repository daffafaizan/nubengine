      Primary

        -  Compare pain response at 4 and 12 weeks post-treatment in patients with localized
           metastatic bone pain treated with single-dose ibandronate vs single-dose local
           radiotherapy .

      Secondary

        -  Compare the quality of life of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Correlate urinary markers of osteoclast activity (pyridinoline and deoxypyridinoline)
           with the clinical outcome of patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label, crossover, multicenter study. Patients are
      stratified according to primary tumor type and participating center. Patients are randomized
      into 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive a single dose of local radiotherapy to the site of pain
           (8Gy/1f).

        -  Arm II: Patients receive a single dose of ibandronate IV over 15 minutes. Patients who
           do not achieve a partial or complete response at 4 weeks crossover to the alternate arm.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline and then at 4 and 12 weeks. Pain is assessed at
      baseline, at 4, 8, and 12 weeks, and then at 6 months.

      Patients are followed at 4, 8, and 12 weeks and then at 6 and 12 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 470 patients (235 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
