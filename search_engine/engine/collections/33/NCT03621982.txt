      expansion part.

      The duration of the study participation for each patient is defined as the time from the date

      The study will include a Screening Period (of up to 21 days), a Treatment Period (with cycles
      of 3 weeks for a Q3W dosing regimen), and a Follow-up Period (approximately every 12 week
      visits) for up to 1 year after treatment discontinuation
