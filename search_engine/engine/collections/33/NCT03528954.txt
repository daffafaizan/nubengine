      prior conducting the study. Subjects were given informed consent before enrolling the study
      and randomized into two groups; propofol and control. Non-invasive blood pressure monitor,
      electrocardiogram (ECG), pulse-oxymetry, and capnograph were set on the subjects in the
      operation room. Induction and maintenance of anesthesia will use sevoflurane. Mechanical
      ventilation will be given to maintaining end-tidal carbon dioxide 35 to 40 mmHg. After
      surgery, patient will be given intravenously 15mg/kg acetaminophen, 0.05mg/kg neostigmine,
      and 0.02 mg/kg atropine. Patient will also be given propofol 0.5 mg/kg on propofol group
      while no propofol will be given on control group. 30 minutes after patient was admitted to
      post-anesthesia care unit, patient will be evaluated for emergence agitation using Aono scale
      and Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium scale. The incidence of emergence agitation,
      hypotension, and desaturation will be treated accordingly.
