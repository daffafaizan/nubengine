      who are scheduled for elective hydrocelectomy and/or hernia repair. At Beaumont Health
      System, post-operative pain management in children is managed either via oral/parenteral
      opiates and opiate adjuncts, surgeon-administered field blocks (instillation of local
      anesthetics in the general area of incision), or via regional techniques (spinal, epidural,
      or peripheral nerve blocks). We have designed this study to determine if there is improved
      qualitative and quantitative post-operative pain control in patients receiving TAP block
      versus intraoperative peri-incisional, surgeon administered field block. Once informed
      consent has been given, each patient will be randomized (like flip of the coin) to either
      Transverse Abdominis Plane Block (TAP Block)or surgeon administered anesthesia.
