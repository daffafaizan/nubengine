      squamous or adenosquamous carcinoma of the cervix when treated with intravenous tirapazamine
      plus intravenous cisplatin. II. Evaluate the unconfirmed complete and partial response rates
      of these patients, as well as, the nature and degree of toxicity associated with this regimen
      in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive tirapazamine intravenously over 2 hours and then, following a 1
      hour rest, receive cisplatin intravenously over 1 hour. Courses are repeated every 21 days.
      Treatment continues for 6-10 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxic effects or disease
      progression. All patients are followed every 6 months for 2 years, then annually thereafter
      until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study.
