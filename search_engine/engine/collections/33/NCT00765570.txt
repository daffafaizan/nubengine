      by adding a single dose of 15 Gy grid radiotherapy. To accomplish this, patients with large
      bulky tumors in the lung, abdomen or pelvis will be randomized to receive either standard
      palliative radiation or palliative radiation plus a single fraction of grid radiation. Tumor
      response, pain relief and duration of response, and pain control will be monitored. Toxicity
      of treatment will also be followed. The hypothesis of this study is that grid radiation will
      produce a significant improvement in tumor response and pain control that produces no further
      increase in acute or late toxicity.
