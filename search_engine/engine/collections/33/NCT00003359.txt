      patients with advanced refractory cancer on a 28-day schedule and establish a dose for
      further study. II. Evaluate the safety and dose limiting toxicity of T138067 sodium in these
      patients. III. Determine the pharmacokinetic parameters after a single intravenous dose of
      this agent in these patients. IV. Obtain safety data and preliminary efficacy information
      after repetition of single doses of T138067 sodium in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open label, dose escalation study. Patients receive T138067 sodium by IV
      over 3 hours. Patients may be retreated every 4 weeks for up to 6 courses (6 months total) in
      the absence of disease progression or dose limiting toxicity (DLT). At least 3 patients are
      treated at each dose level in the absence of DLT. The maximum tolerated dose is defined as
      the dose level where 2 of 3-6 patients experience DLT.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 3-24 patients will be accrued into this study.
