      host disease. The first is the obvious immunologic attack on the colonic epithelium of the
      recipient. Once this immunologic attack has been abated the recipient is left with a colonic
      mucosa that is devoid of microvilli and has a smooth intestinal boarder. This is frequently
      subject to superinfections from bacteria all of which cause the diarrhea to continue.
      Researchers only endpoint to measure clinical response of immunosuppression is the resolution
      of diarrhea. The human recombinant keratinocyte growth factor stimulates the growth of
      colonic epithelium. The growth of colonic epithelium will in turn probably ameliorate some of
      the diarrhea associated with graft versus host disease.
