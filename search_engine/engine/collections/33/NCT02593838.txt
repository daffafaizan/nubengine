      a single ultra low dose CT scan will be performed to look for late enhancement of potentially
      scarred myocardium. Together with the contrast agent co-injection of the clinically indicated
      tracer 99mTc-Tetrofosmin will be performed for later scintigraphic perfusion evaluation.
      After stress perfusion imaging CT rest perfusion imaging will be performed in a similar
      fashion. After acquisition of CT rest perfusion images scintigraphic stress and rest image
      acquisition will be performed as in daily clinical routine with an additional administration
      of 99mTc-Tetrofosmin resting dose if necessary.

      CT stress and rest perfusion will be compared to the clinically indicated and well
      established SPECT examination.
