    
      Up to 5 cohorts of 8 subjects each (up to a total of 40 subjects) will be enrolled. The 8
      subjects within each cohort will be randomized 6:2 to receive multiple IV doses of TP-271 or
      placebo. Study drug will be administered IV once daily on the morning of Days 1 through 7
      following an overnight fast (minimum 8 hours). The planned doses for study drug for Cohorts A
      - E are 0.5 mg/kg TP-271 or placebo, 1.0 mg/kg TP-271 or placebo, 2.0 mg/kg TP-271 or
      placebo, 2.5 mg/kg TP-271 or placebo and 3.0 mg/kg TP-271 or placebo respectively.

      During the Screening period (Days -28 to -2 prior to the subject receiving TP-271 or
      placebo), each subject will be assessed for eligibility. Each subject must sign and date the
      ICF prior to undergoing any study-related procedures.

      All cohorts will follow the same study design. On Day -1, subjects will be admitted to the
      study unit and eligibility confirmed. On Day 1, eligible subjects will be enrolled and
      randomized to receive either TP-271 or placebo and will receive the assigned drug from Days 1
      through 7. Subjects will be required to stay at the study unit from Days -1 through 11 to
      assess safety and obtain the required PK samples. On Day 11, subjects will be discharged from
      the study unit. A final safety assessment will be performed once between Days 14 and 20, 7 to
      13 days following administration of the subject's final dose of study drug.

      After all 8 subjects in a cohort have completed study procedures through Day 11, the
      Principal Investigator and the Sponsor's Medical Monitor will evaluate all blinded safety and
      plasma PK data to determine whether any criteria that would require a meeting of the Safety
      Monitoring Committee (SMC) are met. If no such criteria are met, the study may proceed to the
      subsequent cohort at the next higher dose of TP-271 without consulting the SMC.
