    
      The etiology of pulmonary fibrosis is unknown. Analyses of blood, genomic DNA, and specimens
      procured by bronchoscopy, lung biopsy, lung transplantation, clinically-indicated
      extra-pulmonary biopsies, or post-mortem examination from individuals with this disorder may
      contribute to our understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms of pulmonary fibrosis. The
      purpose of this protocol is to procure and analyze blood, genomic DNA, and specimens by
      bronchoscopy, lung biopsy, lung transplantation, extra-pulmonary biopsies, or post-mortem
      examination from subjects with pulmonary fibrosis. In addition, blood, genomic DNA,
      clinically-indicated extra-pulmonary biopsies, as well as bronchoscopy and post-mortem
      examination specimens may be procured and analyzed from relatives of subjects with hereditary
      forms of pulmonary fibrosis; blood, genomic DNA, and bronchoscopy specimens may be procured
      from healthy research volunteers.
