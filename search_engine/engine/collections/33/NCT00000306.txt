      dextroamphetamine sulfate (sustained release) as an adjunct in concurrent cocaine and opiate
      dependent patients. All subjects will receive methadone. For the treatment of cocaine
      dependence, subjects will receive one of 2 doses of dextroamphetamine (15 or 30mg) or
      placebo. After 4 weeks of treatment the dose level of dextroamphetamine is doubled (30 or
      60mg). This dose is maintained for 20 weeks; during which subjects attend twice weekly visits
      to the clinic and receive weekly cognitive behavioral therapy. Follow up evaluations will be
      conducted out to 3 months post treatment. Subjects will be assisted in transferring to
      Houston area methadone clinics to maintain treatment for opiate dependence following
      treatment completion.
