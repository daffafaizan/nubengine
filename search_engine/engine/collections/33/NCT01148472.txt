      pleasure, disturbed sleep or appetite, low energy, feelings of guilt or low self-worth, and
      poor concentration. The lifetime prevalence of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) in community
      samples is 10-25% for women and 5-12% for men. Depression may become chronic or recurrent and
      lead to substantial impairments in an individual's ability to take care of his or her
      everyday responsibilities. At its worst, depression may lead to suicide. Depression is
      recurrent in 75-80% of patients and becomes chronic in 15-20% of depressed patients.

      The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have become the leading class of
      antidepressants throughout the world. The efficacy and safety of SSRIs in the treatment of
      depression has been demonstrated in several clinical trials. With respect to safety, the
      studies show an advantage for the SSRIs over the older antidepressants. If the prescribing
      physicians are to make a well-founded judgement in their choice of drug factors like
      efficacy, safety, quality of life, and health economics must be taken into consideration. The
      primary aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of escitalopram with that of the
      serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) duloxetine in the treatment of MDD.
