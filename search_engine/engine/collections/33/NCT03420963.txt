      I. Determine the safety, maximum tolerated dose and/or recommended phase II dose of cord
      blood-derived expanded allogeneic natural killer cells (expanded allogeneic cord donor
      natural killer [NK] cells) following chemotherapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the persistence of adoptively-transferred cord NK cells after solid tumor
      directed chemotherapy.

      II. Preliminarily define the antitumor activity to adoptively transferred NK cells following
      the study preparative regimen in the confines of a phase I study.

      III. Determine the immunophenotype and function of the infused NK cell product. IV.
      Preliminarily evaluate for any correlate of phenotype, killer cell immunoglobulin-like
      receptor (kir) haplotype, and function with overall response.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of cord blood derived allogeneic NK cells.

      Patients receive cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) once daily (QD) over 30 minutes and
      etoposide IV QD over 60 minutes on days 1-5 in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. Patients
      then receive cord blood derived allogeneic NK cells IV on day 8.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3-4 days, and then every
      week for 30 days.
