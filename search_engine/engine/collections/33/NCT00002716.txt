        -  Compare the efficacy, toxicity, and cost of hepatic artery infusion of floxuridine,
           leucovorin calcium (CF), and dexamethasone vs IV fluorouracil and IV CF after resection
           of primary disease in patients with hepatic metastases secondary to colorectal cancer.

        -  Compare the quality of life of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Measure the level of thymidylate synthase present in liver metastases, and correlate
           these levels with objective response and survival in patients treated with these
           regimens.

        -  Assess the p53 mutations, and correlate findings with objective response and survival in
           patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      center, percentage of liver involvement on CT scan or MRI (less than 30% vs 30% to under
      70%), prior chemotherapy (none vs adjuvant chemotherapy comprising fluorouracil (5-FU) and
      leucovorin calcium (CF) or 5-FU, CF, and levamisole (LEV) completed at least 1 year before
      study vs adjuvant chemotherapy comprising 5-FU with or without LEV completed at least 6
      months before study), and synchronous disease (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2
      treatment arms.
