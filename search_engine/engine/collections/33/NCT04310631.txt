      characterized by retinal telangiactasias, numerous yellowish exudates in the subretinal
      space, macular edema, hemorrhages and, in advanced end-stage, by exudative retinal
      detachment.

      Ranibizumab is a vascular endothelial growth factor antagonist represent an efficacy
      treatment acting on vascular hyperpermeability. The optical coherence tomography and optical
      coherence tomography angiography represent novel and non-invasive diagnostic techniques that
      allow a detailed analysis of retinal and vascular features. The study evaluates the changes
      in optical coherence tomography and optical coherence tomography angiography parameters at
      baseline and after three monthly injections of Ranibizumab in Coats disease.
