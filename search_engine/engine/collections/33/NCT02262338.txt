    
      This is a sequential, open-label, dose escalation, multi-dose study in adults with Hunter
      syndrome. Two dose levels, assuming tolerability, are planned sequentially, with safety data
      from the previous cohort being reviewed prior to escalation to the next higher dose cohort.
      Subjects will receive weekly doses of AGT-182 for 8 weeks if ERT-naive or agreeing to a
      6-week ERT washout, or for 13 weeks if currently taking ERT and not agreeing to washout.
