      central nervous system [1]. Magnesium deficiency is associated to an increased activation of
      these receptors, and to an increased sensitivity to pain in animals. Spinal cord is the site
      of sensitization of pain, mainly mediated by the NMDA receptors, and intrathecal magnesium
      may have anti-hyperalgesic effect when administered intrathecally [2]. As intrathecal
      magnesium has already been used in humans for treatment of eclampsia, we stated that it could
      also improve postoperative analgesia and reduce the need for auto-administered morphine if
      given (50 mg of magnesium sulfate) with the intrathecal anesthetic drugs (bupivacaine and
      sufentanil) injected for orthopedic surgery.
