      program, in combination with protein supplementation, for older individuals with RA. The
      exercise protocol in this study is distinctive because it combines dynamic and isometric
      (static) resistance exercise performed on specialized equipment that can accommodate the
      range of motion limitations frequently encountered in the older RA population. This study
      will also begin to evaluate if additional benefit can be achieved with daily protein
      supplementation
