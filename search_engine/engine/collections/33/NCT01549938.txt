      Primary The group treated with vitamin D3 will have a significantly lower frequency of
      symptomatic respiratory tract infections than controls.

      Secondary

        1. Among persons with detected viral colonisations of the nasopharynx, treated persons will
           have a lower frequency of symptomatic respiratory tract infection resultant than
           controls.

        2. Treated group will have significantly less severe symptomatic RTIs than controls.

        3. Treated group will have significantly shorter symptomatic RTI durations than controls.

      For the pilot, a cohort of 32 healthy young adults satisfying inclusion criteria will be
      randomised to cholecalciferol supplement or identical placebo and evaluated daily for the
      occurrence of RTI symptoms and evaluated weekly for the presence of respiratory colonisation
      by relevant pathogens using nasopharyngeal swab and polymerase chain reaction using selected
      pathogen-specific primers. This pilot will demonstrate the logistic feasibility of the
      proposed study design and provide preliminary data which will inform a larger study to be
      undertaken next year.
