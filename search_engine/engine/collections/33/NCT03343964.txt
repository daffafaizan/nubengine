      sequelae. Careful post-injury management is crucial in optimizing their recovery. Seizures
      are a frequent complication. They are associated with worse outcome and require prompt
      intervention. However, they are often subclinical and are only detectable by gold-standard
      conventional electroencephalography (cEEG); a costly, complex monitoring device that is not
      readily available 24/7 in many pediatric intensive care units (PICUs) and can only be
      interpreted by neurologists. On average, PICUs obtain only 1-2 cEEG reports per day from
      neurologists and this can lead to significant delays in seizure identification and treatment.
      Amplitude-integrated EEG (aEEG) is a compressed form of real-time cEEG monitoring that can be
      added to cEEG monitoring. It is more easy to interpret and can be taught to PICU providers
      with limited training. It is a promising complementary tool that could help PICU physicians
      identify subclinical seizures and treat seizures more promptly. This could significantly
      improve the global outcome of this vulnerable population.
