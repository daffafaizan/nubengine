      blisters and erosions due to skin fragility. There are 4 different subgroups, based on the
      location of the skin cleavage area. The most frequent subgroup is the simplex form,
      consisting predominantly of the localized form (localized epidermolysis bullosa simplex:
      LEBS). The incidence of LEBS was estimated at between 1/318.000 and 1/35.000. The disease
      starts early in infancy by the occurrence of blisters and erosions located on soles,
      secondary to frictions during the walk. The phenomenon is worsened by heat and sudation. LEBS
      is due to mutations in keratin genes. Life expectancy in LEBS is normal but the quality of
      life is significantly impaired due to permanent skin pain and limitation of everyday
      activities (walking, sports). There is no effective or curative treatment. Patients must
      limit the frictions, protect the skin and use plasters in case of skin lesions.

      Botulinic toxin has an agreement for the treatment of axillary hyperhidrosis and has been
      shown to be also effective on palms and soles. The efficacy of botulinic toxin in plantar
      lesions of LEBS has been reported in the literature (one case report and a short
      retrospective series of 6 patients) but there is no proper study.
