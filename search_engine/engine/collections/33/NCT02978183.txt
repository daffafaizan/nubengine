    
      The study is a multi-center, double-masked, randomized, placebo-controlled, modified
      conjunctival allergen challenge (CAC) model. The primary endpoints of ocular itching and
      conjunctival redness will be evaluated at the subject's final visit. Subjects who meet
      inclusion criteria will be randomized to one of two treatment groups (1:1). Randomization
      will be stratified by average post-CAC itching scores at baseline.

      Subjects will be evaluated at baseline and on Days 6, 7 and 8.
