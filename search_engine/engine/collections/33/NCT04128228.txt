      equal gender) including alcohol use disorder (AUD) patients with and without early trauma,
      and healthy controls with and without early trauma. General study procedures include
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scan(s), eight weeks of outpatient treatment,
      and a follow-up phase. During the fMRI session, participants will engage in a task involving
      the viewing of stress, alcohol, neutral pictures using a well-validated sustained emotion
      provocation task, while their brain and stress hormone data are concurrently collected.
      Controls will participate in a single fMRI session at baseline, and AUD patients will
      participate in two fMRI sessions before and after outpatient treatment. Subsequently after
      the scan(s), all participants will be prospectively followed for daily monitoring of stress,
      alcohol, and health related behaviors using a smartphone app. Controls will be followed for
      30 days. AUD patients will be followed for 90 days, which includes face-to-face interviews at
      14, 30, 90 days in addition to daily monitoring using a mobile app.
