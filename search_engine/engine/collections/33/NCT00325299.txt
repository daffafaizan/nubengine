      magnesium deficiency aggravates the hepatic damage caused by alcohol. One study on chronic
      alcoholics suggested that magnesium supplementation over six weeks decreases abnormally high
      activities of three enzymes related to liver function: serum gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT),
      aspartate-aminotransferase (ASAT) and alanine-aminotransferase (ALAT), and increases muscle
      strength [4]. These results were, however, significant at the 5% level only when a 1-sided
      test was applied. It seems that magnesium supplementation may improve liver recovery after a
      drinking bout, but the evidence is not yet strong enough to warrant clear recommendations for
      clinical practice. Magnesium deficiency may also be one of the symptoms of depression and may
      aggravate hypertension. The primary purpose of the present randomized, parallel group, double
      blind trial is to see if oral magnesium supplementation will decrease elevated GGT enzyme
      activity in alcoholic patients immediately after they had been treated for alcohol
      withdrawal. The secondary aims are to find out whether supplementation decreases the activity
      of ASAT and ALAT enzymes, increases muscle strength, decreases blood pressure and decreases
      depressive symptoms among these patients.
