      I. To evaluate the effects of lithium on functional and mucosal anatomic recovery in the
      small or large bowel of patients with acute GVHD.

      II. Functional recovery will be evaluated according to changes in clinical manifestations of
      gastrointestinal GVHD. III. Mucosal anatomic recovery will be evaluated by review of results
      from clinically indicated endoscopic evaluations.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the tolerability of lithium administration in allogeneic hematopoietic cell
      transplant recipients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral lithium carbonate once or twice daily. Treatment continues for
      up to 8 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
