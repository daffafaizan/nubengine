      proliferation of abnormal smooth muscle-like cells (LAM cells) in the lungs, which leads to
      cystic destruction of the lung parenchyma, in the axial lymphatics, resulting in
      lymphangioleiomyomas, and in abdominal angiomyolipomas, primarily in the kidneys.
      Lymphangioleiomyomas may cause abdominal distension and compress abdominal organs, producing
      obstipation, bladder obstruction and neurological deficits. Leakage of chyle may be
      responsible for ascites and pleural effusions. The lymphangioleiomyomas may change in size
      during the day. This variation in tumor size may be due to increased chyle formation or
      alterations in lymphatic flow. These studies however, were not performed with research
      subjects who were fasting. Our hypothesis is that the ingestion of food increases chyle
      formation and lymphatic flow, which in turn increases the size of the lymphangioleiomyomas.
      The aim of this study is to test this hypothesis. We propose to conduct a study in 30 LAM
      patients who have lymphangioleiomyomas to determine whether the ingestion of food, by
      increasing chyle formation and lymphatic flow, increases the size of the
      lymphangioleiomyomas.
