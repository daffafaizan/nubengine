      increase the amount of rehabilitation therapy performed. This study will measure the
      rehabilitation dose, as measured by the duration of the rehabilitation session and the number
      of exercises performed by the patient. The study hypothesis is that patients in the
      MindMotionPRO group will spend more time performing rehabilitation exercises than in the
      Self-Directed Prescribed exercises group. The effectiveness of the MindMotionPRO versus
      Self-Directed Prescribed Exercises will also be measured, based on the change in
      rehabilitation performance measures. The cost-effectiveness will be measured by the resource
      utilization, as defined by the time spent by the therapist providing the rehabilitation
      session.
