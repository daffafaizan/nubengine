      I/II study in 60 HIV+ individuals with HAND. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of
      four groups: 1) fluconazole 100 mg every 12 hours orally per day, 2) paroxetine 20mg every
      evening orally per day, 3) fluconazole 100mg every 12 hours orally per day and paroxetine
      20mg every evening orally per day and 4) placebo.

      Primary Aim: To obtain preliminary data to evaluate the efficacy of fluconazole and/or
      paroxetine to decrease CSF lipid and protein markers of oxidative stress [CSF ceramide and
      (C18:0 levels) and 3-nitrosylated proteins].

      Secondary Aims:

      i) To evaluate the safety and tolerability of fluconazole and/or paroxetine in HIV+
      individuals with HAND ii) To evaluate the effect of fluconazole and/or paroxetine on
      neurocognitive performance in HIV+ individuals with HAND iii) To evaluate the effect of
      fluconazole and/or paroxetine on functional performance in HIV+ individuals with HAND iv) To
      evaluate the CNS penetration of fluconazole and paroxetine after 24 weeks of treatment v) To
      obtain preliminary data to evaluate the efficacy of fluconazole and/or paroxetine to improve
      abnormal imaging markers as measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and arterial
      spin labeling
