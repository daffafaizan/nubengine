      certain bacteria, viruses, or specific pathogens could be detected in bronchoalveolar lavage
      fluid (BALF) in some patients, and these pathogenic microorganisms may be the cause of COP.
      Specimens were obtained by conventional methods (sputum, blood, BALF or lung puncture fluid)
      for microbiological detection. Due to the influence of the quality of acquired specimens,
      specimen preservation and transportation which were influenced by external factors, many
      patients did not get good test results, which affected the diagnosis and subsequent treatment
      of patients. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) which could determine hundreds of thousands to
      millions of DNA molecules in parallel at one time, and efficiently sequence or fragment of
      pathogenic microorganisms. NGS had greatly improved the detection rate of pathogenic
      microorganisms. This study aimed to screen pathogenic microorganisms in BALF and lung
      puncture fluid of COP patients by NGS, and further clarify the correlation between occurrence
      of COP and pathogenic microorganisms.
