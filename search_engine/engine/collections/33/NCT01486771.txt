    
      Primary Objective:

      To further establish the efficacy of intravitreal pegaptanib injections in the regression of
      retinal neovascularization secondary to high-risk PDR, as compared to standard panretinal
      photocoagulation (PRP)

      Secondary Objective:

      To maintain the regression of PDR after the induction phase with intravitreal pegaptanib
      injections administered at 12-week intervals, as compared to standard PRP

      To maintain the regression of PDR after the induction phase with retinal photocoagulation
      applied to areas of ischemia (Selective Laser Photocoagulation), as compared to standard PRP

      To evaluate the rate of recurrence of neovascularization after 6 intravitreal pegaptanib
      injections

      To determine if intravitreal pegaptanib will reduce the area and/or volume of concomitant
      diabetic macular edema, as assessed by leakage on fluorescein angiography (FA) and/or optical
      coherence tomography (OCT)

      To determine if intravitreal pegaptanib injections maintain or reduce the loss of
      best-corrected visual acuity
