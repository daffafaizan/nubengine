      of both the active drug and placebo is detailed below. The physician and the patient will
      both be blinded. Patients will be instructed to take three capsules daily in the morning.
      Each capsule of the drug contains 450 mg of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), the active
      component. Thus, three capsules daily will result in 1350 mg daily of EPA. They will be asked
      to return to the clinic after 8 weeks of therapy for a follow-up hsCRP.
