      with high PDL1 expression compare to weak and no expression populations.

      There is not for the moment a standard test to determine a relevant target population.
      Preliminary data showed that around 25% of the NSCLC population may have a high PDL1
      expression and may have a greater benefit of anti PDL1 therapy. But in fact limited data have
      been published in European populations on the clinical and pathological characteristics (high
      PDL1 expression) compared to the weak expression and no expression populations. More over the
      prognosis rule of a high PDL1 expression in NSCLC is not definitive, with some studies
      indicating it is a positive prognostic factor while other studies showing that it is a
      negative prognostic factor.

      To understand if there are differences in terms of prognostic between advanced NSCLC with
      high and low/no expression of PDL1 is a major challenge for the future management strategy of
      these patients. The results of this study should helps to elaborate new guidelines for this
      population. Therefore is also important to had data's on the natural course of the disease in
      these population for building cost effectiveness models of new immune therapies.
