        -  Evaluate the benefit of daily, active, open-label rTMS in Part 1 non-responders.

        -  Evaluate the benefits of bi-weekly, active, open-label maintenance rTMS treatment for
           Part 1 responders over the course of 12 months post acute treatment.

        -  Evaluate, by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) at 3 Tesla(3T),
           neurometabolic biomarkers at the beginning and end of each study phase.

             -  Define regional specificity [anterior cingulate (AC) and left dorsolateral
                prefrontal cortex (L-DLPFC)] of cerebral metabolites (i.e. glutamate and glutamine)
                in adolescent depression.

             -  Study whether specific neurochemical resonances are associated with response,
                remission, and/or maintenance of improvement of clinical depressive symptoms when
                rTMS is used to treat adolescent depression.
