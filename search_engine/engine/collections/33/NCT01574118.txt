      (PTSD) which, modifies an already proven psychotherapy for PTSD by adding two new components
      and modifying several others. The goal of the study is to determine whether this experimental
      treatment outperforms the well-established standard treatment. Individuals between the ages
      of 18-65 with chronic PTSD are randomly assigned to one of three psychotherapy conditions:
      (a) brief enhanced exposure therapy; (b) standard prolonged exposure therapy; and (c) delayed
      standard exposure therapy. All study participants undergo a phone and face-to-face screening
      assessment to determine study eligibility and baseline (pretreatment-Week 0) symptom
      severity. Upon completing treatment, participants undergo three additional assessment visits
      (Week 6, Week 10, and Week 22). During each of these outcome assessment visits, participants
      complete a structured clinical interview and a battery of computer-administered
      questionnaires.
