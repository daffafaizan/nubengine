      century,the rate of cerebral palsy has remained at 2 to 2.5 per 1,000 live births. A high
      percentage of children with cerebral palsy have difficulty keeping up with the handwriting
      demands at school. The neurological impairments in children with cerebral palsy frequently
      limit the functionality of these children taken in to account the upper limbs variables. It
      should be interesting to describe a clinical profile based on this assessment.
