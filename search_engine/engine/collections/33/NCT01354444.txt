      AD taking carvedilol compared to placebo treatment as evidenced by the Hopkins Verbal
      Learning Test (HVLT). cerebrospinal fluid levels of AÎ² oligomers in early AD, will be
      measured in participants receiving carvedilol treatment when compared to placebo treatment.
      Adverse effects will be monitored in participants receiving carvedilol when compared to
      placebo.

      To assess adverse events, routine chemistry and hematology studies, vital signs, and
      electrocardiographic parameters before and after 6 months randomized placebo-controlled
      double-blind treatment with carvedilol at a target dose of 25 mg daily, comparing 25 early AD
      participants taking carvedilol vs. 25 early AD participants taking placebo.
