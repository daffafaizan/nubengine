      dementia-a global epidemic. Cognitive Stimulation Therapy (CST) is the only
      non-pharmacological therapy recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care
      Excellence for improving cognition for mild to moderate dementia. However, there is little
      guidance on how to maximise cognition for severe dementia. Advanced Cognitive Stimulation
      Therapy (ACST) will be the first evidence-based complex intervention for moderate to severe
      dementia developed within the Medical Research Framework and building upon CST's key
      principles. This feasibility randomised controlled trial (RCT) aims to 1) translate and adapt
      ACST for the Chinese population; 3) evaluate the feasibility of Advanced Cognitive
      Stimulation Therapy - Hong Kong (ACST-HK). A sample of 32 participants will be recruited,
      where 16 will be randomly allocated to ACST, and 16 to treatment as usual (TAU). Data will be
      collected pre and post the 7-week intervention period. Improving the cognition and QoL for
      people with moderate to severe dementia is vital because dementia's prevalence is projected
      to reach 152 million by 2050, resulting in excessive excess disability. Developing an
      intervention targeting Chinese-the largest aging population-is also novel and allows ACST-HK
      to impact internationally from its infancy.
