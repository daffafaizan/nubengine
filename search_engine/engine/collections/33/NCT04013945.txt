    
      This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group trial in 70
      healthy adult male and female subjects between 20 and 50 years. The primary objective is to
      assess whether Superba Boost krill oil administered at a dose of 1 g per day for 12 weeks (84
      days) has a positive effect on the TEWL, skin hydration and elasticity. At screening, the
      subjects must have TEWL values of >10 g/m2/h and <24.9 g/m2/h when measured by a TEWAmeter,
      i.e. within the range defined as normal and healthy skin. The change in omega-3 index,
      defined as EPA and DHA as percentage of total fatty acids in red blood cells, will be
      measured and correlated to the changes in the skin parameters.

      The study consists of 4 visits: the screening visit (V1), baseline visit / week 0 / Start of
      treatment (V2), Interim / Week 6 (V3) and week 12 / end of treatment (V4) . In this study,
      subjects must have a low habitual consumption of fatty fish and seafood, defined as a
      frequency of twice per month or less will be recruited. Each subject must fulfill all
      inclusion criteria and will not be allowed to meet any of the exclusion criteria.
