      Primary

        -  Determine the incidence of engraftment, defined as achieving donor-derived neutrophil
           count > 500/mmÂ³ by day 42, in infants with high-risk acute myeloid leukemia, acute
           lymphoblastic leukemia, or myelodysplastic syndromes treated with a non-irradiation
           containing myeloablative conditioning regimen comprising busulfan, fludarabine, and
           melphalan followed by double umbilical cord blood transplantation (UCBT) with two
           partially HLA-matched units.

      Secondary Objectives

        -  Determine the incidence of transplant-related mortality (TRM) at 6 months after UCBT

        -  Evaluate pattern of chimerism after double UCBT

        -  Determine the incidence of platelet engraftment at 1 year after UCBT

        -  Determine the incidence of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) grade II-IV and grade
           III-IV at day 100 after UCBT

        -  Evaluate the developmental outcome after UCBT

      Transplant Related Objectives

        -  Determine the incidence of chronic GVHD at 1 year after UCBT

        -  Determine the survival and disease free survival at 1 and 2 years after UCBT

        -  Determine the incidence relapse at 1 and 2 years after UCBT
