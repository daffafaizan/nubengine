      and sclerotherapy are invasive and can result in local recurrence and complications. We
      sought to assess the effect of 20 weeks of oral sildenafil on reducing lymphatic malformation
      volume and symptoms in children. Seven children (4 boys, 3 girls; ages 13-85 months) with
      lymphatic malformations were given oral sildenafil for 20 weeks in this open-label study. The
      volume of the lymphatic malformation was calculated blindly using magnetic resonance imaging
      performed before and after 20 weeks of sildenafil. Lymphatic malformations were assessed
      clinically on weeks 4, 12, 20, and 32. Both the physician and parents evaluated the lymphatic
      malformation in comparison with baseline. Sildenafil can reduce lymphatic malformation volume
      and symptoms in some children. ( J Am Acad Dermatol 2014;70:1050-7.)
