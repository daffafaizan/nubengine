      testing of the newborn screening blood to identify children at increased genetic risk of type
      1 diabetes. This study will enrol newborn babies whose mothers have given consent to
      additional testing for the newborn blood screening (routinely performed when the baby is
      approximately 5 days old).

      Women will be approached by research staff in the second or third trimester of pregnancy (â‰¥18
      weeks gestation) when attending for antenatal care. At this point, the study will be
      discussed with the woman and if interested a patient information sheet will be provided as
      well as the opportunity to ask questions. If they agree to participate, a qualified member of
      the research team will take written informed consent. This consent will allow a) completion
      of a questionnaire and b) prospective consent to use the surplus neonatal screening blood
      sample for genetic testing.

      The punch from the blood sample will analysed for the child's risk of type 1 diabetes. If
      found to be at high risk (>10%) they will be contacted by a member of the clinical study team
      to discuss the results and invite them to participate in a phase II prevention trial.
