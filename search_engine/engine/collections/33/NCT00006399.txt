      aging after menopause and in decreasing the incidence of Alzheimer's disease (AD). On a
      molecular level, EST has effects on a variety of cholinergic neuronal and receptor-mediated
      mechanisms that may be responsible for these beneficial effects. These neurons have critical
      relevance for the development of age-related cognitive changes and dementing disorders.
      However, little is known about the clinical relevance of EST-cholinergic interactions, either
      in normal aging or in AD.

      The primary goal of this study is to test the hypothesis that three months of administration
      of EST to 1) normal post-menopausal women, and 2) female patients with mild-moderate AD who
      are concurrently treated with anticholinesterase therapy (donepezil), will positively change
      or blunt the negative and behavioral effects of drugs that block central cholinergic
      receptors (both muscarinic and nicotinic). Participants will be blindly placed on EST or
      placebo for three months each. After each three month period, they will be cognitively
      assessed after receiving single doses of the cholinergic antagonists scopolamine and
      mecamylamine. These results will have direct implications for the use of EST in
      post-menopausal women as well as interactive treatment with cholinergic drugs for AD.
      Researchers plan to recruit a total of 45 women (30 healthy, and 15 patients with AD).

      NOTE: This study is only recruiting participants with Alzheimer's Disease at this time.
