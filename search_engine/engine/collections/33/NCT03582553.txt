      In order to explore the mechanisms by which naringenin may increase energy expenditure and
      improve glucose metabolism in humans, it is of vital importance that the safety,
      tolerability, and bioavailability of naringenin are evaluated, when administered to humans.
      This study tests the safety of four doses of a citrus extract of naringenin and measures
      serum concentrations of naringenin at the 150 mg and 600 mg doses over a period of 24 hours,
      and at the 300 and 900 mg doses at four hours after subjects have been given the respective
      doses of naringenin.
