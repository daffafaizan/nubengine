      (PG) clinic, Children's Hospital, London, Canada. Methodology: After a 4 week run in period,
      60 children aged 5-18 years, meeting Rome 3 inclusion criteria for abdominal pain associated
      FGID will be recruited to the trial. After informed consent, the participants will be
      randomized to either a standard treatment or lifestyle modification (dietary elimination)
      group in the ratio of 1:1. IgG testing to food antigens will be completed in both groups
      using a commercially available specific IgG ELISA-based multiple food allergen panel but will
      ONLY be disclosed for the lifestyle modification group. The patient will receive specific
      advice by a dietitian to exclude a maximum of two food items from his/her diet for 4 weeks.
      Children will be followed-up in PG clinic at 4-weekly intervals for 16 weeks. At every clinic
      visit, Diary of food intake, Abdominal Pain Index (API) and Quality of Life (QOL)
      questionnaire will be completed by both child and parent. The standard therapy group will
      receive conventional treatment for Abdominal Pain (AP) as per usual practice at the PG
      Clinic. Response is defined as more than 50% improvement in frequency and severity of
      abdominal pain. At each follow up visit, non-responders will cross over to the other arm of
      the study. At the end of the trial, non-responders in either group will continue to receive
      conventional treatment in the PG Clinic. Responders will be discharged back to their family
      physicians. Data will be analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics, version 22.0.
