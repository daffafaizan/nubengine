      behavioral risk, and increasing adherence to medications to control hypertension, diabetes,
      lipids. Yet, there exists a huge science to implementation gap to adopt these widely
      recognized beneficial medicines and lifestyle changes. Those most in need remain unable to
      actualize the benefits of science, due to lack of knowledge, perceived complexity, literacy
      challenges, limited time by poorly communicating doctors in crowded clinics and essentially,
      failure by regional scientists to translate Western science in creative resonant ways that
      enable wider uptake.

      In this randomized double blind translational implementation study, we will study the
      effectiveness of the implementation tactic of delivering enabling stroke education and risk
      reduction to literacy and numeracy challenged Pakistani stroke survivors and their
      caregivers, via short films teaching stroke recognition, healthy habits, medication adherence
      and self-care. These 5 minute films , using a 'show me not tell me ' approach, will be
      replayed in tablets, and shown to all stroke patients in the intervention arm. The primary
      objective of this study is to answer the research question - Does video based education given
      to stroke patients (with mild to moderate disability) and their caregivers before discharge,
      and during follow up, improve adherence to therapy and control of three major risk factors
      (Diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidemia) at twelve months post index stroke?
