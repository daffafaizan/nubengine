      the other, non-deafferented hand. This phenomenon, recently identified in our laboratory,
      represents an adaptive, behaviorally important consequence of deafferentation. It
      demonstrates that acute loss of sensory input from one hand results in rapid improvement of
      skills in the remaining hand. The first experiment in this protocol seeks to identify
      cortical regions activated in association with this improvement in tactile spatial acuity. In
      the second experiment, we will determine the effects of transient inactivation of focal
      cortical regions on this behavioral gain. While the first experiment will characterize brain
      regions activated in association with this performance improvement, the second experiment
      will provide information on the functional role of these regions. Understanding the
      substrates that mediate this behavioral gain may be important for the design of strategies to
      enhance them.
