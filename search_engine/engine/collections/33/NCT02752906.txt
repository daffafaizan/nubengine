    
      Healthy adolescents and adults who had received 1 dose of a quadrivalent meningococcal
      Conjugate vaccine 4 to 10 years previously were randomized to receive either 1 dose of
      MenACYW Conjugate vaccine or licensed MenactraÂ®. All participants underwent immunogenicity
      assessment at baseline (pre-vaccination) and post-vaccination and were also evaluated for
      safety up to Day 180 post-vaccination. In addition, a subset had an additional blood sample
      collected at 6 days post-vaccination for immunogenicity assessment.
