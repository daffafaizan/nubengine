        -  To investigate the potential benefit of post-operative radiotherapy with vs without a
           combined and adjuvant treatment consisting of short-term androgen suppression for
           improving the biochemical progression-free survival of patients who have undergone
           radical prostatectomy for stage I-III prostate cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to institution,
      pathological stage (pT2R1 vs pT3R0 vs pT3R1), Gleason sum (≤ 3+4 vs ≥ 4+3), and WHO
      performance status (0 vs 1). Within 3 months after radical surgery, patients are randomized
      to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo post-operative conformal external beam irradiation for 6.5
           weeks.

        -  Arm II: Beginning between days -5 to -3, patients receive an antiandrogen for 2-4 weeks.
           Beginning on day 0, patients receive leuprolide acetate subcutaneously once (6-month
           depot) and undergo conformal external beam irradiation 5 times weekly for 6.5 weeks.

      Patients undergo quality of life assessments periodically.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for 5 years and
      then yearly thereafter.
