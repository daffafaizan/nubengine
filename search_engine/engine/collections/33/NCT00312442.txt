    
      This is a multicentre, open labelled, phase II/III, 6-month clinical trial with an additional
      follow-up at Month 12, aiming to determine the efficacy and tolerability of the
      WST09-mediated VTP treatment. This treatment consists of an I.V. infusion of WST09 (2 mg/kg),
      in combination with per-cutaneous interstitial illumination using laser light (wavelength at
      763nm) delivered through optical fibres positioned through the perineum in the prostatic
      lobes.

      Patients who are eligible to participate in the study must have a clinically diagnosed
      positive biopsy of the prostate (up to stage T2b-N0-M0) diagnosed after external radiotherapy
      or temporary brachytherapy (no seeds), and present with increasing PSA levels on three
      consecutive occasions (at least 3 months apart) post-radiation treatment.
