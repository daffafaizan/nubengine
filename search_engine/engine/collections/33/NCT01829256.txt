        1. Using an innovative telehealth approach that is potentially scalable with demonstrable
           efficacy in reducing antecedents of kidney disease, including poor blood pressure,
           glucose, and lipid control

        2. Enrolling demographically diverse patients from local primary care clinics to allow
           applicability of our results to the general US population within existing delivery
           systems; and

        3. Targeting patients with moderate DKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate between 45-90
           ml/min/1.73m2 with evidence of diabetic nephropathy) and uncontrolled HTN (blood
           pressure â‰¥140/90 mm Hg), accounting for about 20% of all patients with diabetes who
           disproportionately suffer from end-stage renal disease (ESRD), cardiovascular events,
           and death.
