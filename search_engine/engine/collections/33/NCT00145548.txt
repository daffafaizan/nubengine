      own control. The sponsor may attempt to include the data from this study in the statistical
      analysis of the pivotal study. This proposal shall be evaluated at the conclusion of the
      pilot study.

      PATIENT POPULATION Patients with severe emphysema are eligible to be screened for enrollment
      in this study. In this initial pilot study, eligible subjects will have severe,
      heterogeneous, predominantly upper lobe emphysema, as defined by the American Thoracic
      Society (ATS) 1 and the NETT Research Group.2

      These subjects also will be patients who have been screened as potential candidates for LVRS,
      but who have been excluded from surgical treatment due to a failure to satisfy the inclusion
      and exclusion criteria established by the NETT Research Group for LVRS.2 Patients also will
      be able to tolerate a flexible bronchoscopy procedure.

      Patients who have been screened and accepted for a lung transplant procedure or LVRS, and are
      currently registered or scheduled for such a procedure, are not eligible for enrollment in
      this pilot study.

      Patients with an FEV1 < 20% predicted and either homogeneous emphysema or DLCO < 20% will be
      excluded from enrollment in this pilot study.3

      Patients will be screened and enrolled until up to 115 subjects have undergone treatment with
      the IBV System. Up to 15 clinical centers will be selected to enroll and treat subjects.
