      psychiatric hospital in Botswana. The hospital population is representative of the culturally
      diverse Botswana nation because patients with severe mental illness from the entire country
      are admitted to the hospital. Forty participants (40) will be recruited and randomized to
      receive the Brief Relaxation, Education, And Trauma HEaling (BREATHE) intervention or
      treatment as usual.

      The intervention will be delivered by the Principal Investigator who has received training
      from the intervention developer. Supervision will be provided telephonically.

      The BREATHE intervention will be delivered weekly for each participant for a total of three
      weeks and 4 participants will be enrolled per group resulting in a total of 5 groups. The
      estimated period of intervention delivery and data collection is therefore expected to last
      for a period of ~15 weeks.

      Outcomes such as anxiety, depressive and PTSD Symptoms, and knowledge about PTSD will be
      assessed before participants receive the intervention, weekly (following each treatment
      session), month one and month three after treatment completion. Assessment of feasibility and
      acceptability will be done at treatment completion with the intervention group. Participants
      on the control arm will receive outcome measures at the same time points as those receiving
      the intervention. The investigators will utilize an objective assessment of skin conductance
      which has been shown to be greater in individuals with PTSD than in individuals without PTSD
      and similarly increased during a trauma interview in individuals with PTSD compared to
      individuals who do not have PTSD.
