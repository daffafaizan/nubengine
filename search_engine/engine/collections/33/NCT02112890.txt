    
      A random sample of subjects constituting adolescents and young adults (≥10 - ≤25 years of
      age) will be selected from the total population that participated in the Encuesta Nacional de
      Salud y Nutrición (ENSANUT) 2012 in Mexico.

      Data (through structured questionnaires and interviews) and stored serum samples of the
      selected subjects obtained from the ENSANUT 2012 will be used in this study. A subset
      database will be designed by the National Institute of Public Health (NIPH) for the purpose
      of this study. Extracted data and laboratory results of the selected subjects will be
      captured in this database.
