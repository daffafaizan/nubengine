      associated with side effects including insulin resistance and changes in body fat
      distribution. Changes in body fat distribution associated with HIV antiretroviral medications
      may result in increased fat in the abdomen, neck, and upper back, which is often called
      central fat deposition. HIV antiretroviral medications may also result in loss of fat in
      legs, arms, and face, which is often called peripheral fat atrophy.

      This study will obtain preliminary data on the effect of 12 weeks of metformin on insulin
      sensitivity and hepatic and peripheral muscle fat in HIV-infected persons with insulin
      resistance and central fat deposition. Similarly, this study will obtain preliminary data on
      the effect of 12 weeks of pioglitazone on insulin sensitivity and hepatic and peripheral
      muscle fat in HIV-infected persons with insulin resistance and peripheral fat atrophy.

      This study involves taking a drug that has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) for use in humans for a period of 3 months.
