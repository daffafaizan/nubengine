      enucleation surgery patients who underwent surgery with general anesthesia (GA), single-shot
      retrobulbar block, or retrobulbar block combined with GA. The primary outcome included
      postoperative pain upon arrival at and discharge from the PACU, analgesic consumption and
      rescue analgesia. Secondary outcomes was time to discharge from the postanesthesia care unit
      (PACU) as well as GA and opioid-related side effects and retrobulbar block- associated
      neurological complications. The investigators speculated that patients who received an
      retrobulbar block before GA had less postoperative pain, and reduced analgesic requirements
      when compared with patients who received GA Only or retrobulbar block alone.
