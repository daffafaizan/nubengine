      of ASP3772 will be administered on Day 1 as an injection into the right or left thigh muscle
      at one of three dose levels. The participants randomized to PCV13 will receive a single
      intramuscular injection of the approved dose of PCV13 into the right or left thigh muscle.
      All participants will remain at the study site for approximately 30 to 60 minutes following
      vaccination in order for study site personnel to evaluate any immediate reactions, if needed.
      The participant's parent/legal guardian will observe for reactions, including daily body
      temperature measurements and tolerability assessments, from Day 2 through Day 7 and record
      observed events in the electronic diary device.

      All participants will have study visits on Day 7 (+ 1 day) and Day 30 (± 5 days)
      post-vaccination. The Day 7 visit may be conducted on site or by telephone call.The
      end-of-study visit will occur on Day 180 (± 14 days), which will be a safety follow-up by
      telephone call.
