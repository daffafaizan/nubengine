      significantly affect their quality of life. Several changes occur in the brains of
      Parkinson's disease patients. The hallmark change is a loss of a neurotransmitter ("chemical
      messenger" between brain cells) called dopamine. To alleviate Parkinson's disease symptoms
      doctors prescribe dopamine replacement therapy, for example Sinemet (levodopa). Although
      effective for some of the symptoms, it typically does not sufficiently alleviate balance and
      gait problems. This study focuses on other changes in the brain that occur in Parkinson's
      disease that may contribute to balance and gait problems. In particular we will be looking at
      another neurotransmitter called acetylcholine. In some Parkinson's disease patients we see a
      loss of acetylcholine in the brain. In previous studies we have shown that this loss of
      acetylcholine is related to impaired balance and gait function in Parkinson's disease. In
      this study we will take a closer look at this finding.
