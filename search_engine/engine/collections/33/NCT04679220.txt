      the study. The sample size was calculated based on the clinical success rate (100% retention
      rate at 3 years) of posterior class I restorations restored with nanofilled composite
      observed in a previous study.28 According to several parameters including a significance
      level of 5%, the power of the test was calculated to be 80%, and equivalent limit of 15%.

      sample size was set totalizing 35 subjects.
