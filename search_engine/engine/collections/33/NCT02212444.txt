      population. It affects over 1 million people in the USA equating to ~0.2 million in the UK.
      It is characterized by severe pain felt on the plantar aspect of the heel around the plantar
      fascia origin which is significantly thicker than normal.

      Usually conservative treatment comprises a referral to physiotherapy and provision of
      orthotics. Physiotherapy consists of teaching a home program of calf and plantar fascia
      stretches in addition to weight management and footwear advice.

      Orthotic management includes the provision of off-the-shelf orthotics or customised
      orthotics. Some studies of customised orthoses demonstrate significant improvements in foot
      pain related function at 3 and 12 months in people with plantar fasciitis compared to a sham
      intervention. However, a systematic review of the randomised controlled trials found no
      evidence to support their use on short or long term foot pain, pain related function or
      disability.

      Dynamic elastomeric fabric orthoses (DEFOs) have been successfully used in a variety of
      patient groups. The plantar fasciitis DEFOs is a custom-made close-fitting sock of
      elastomeric construction. It is worn next to the skin where the sock can exert an external
      torsional, compressive, and supportive effect, thus positively influencing the biomechanics
      of the heal.
