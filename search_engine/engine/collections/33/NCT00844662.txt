      imbalances (high levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH), bone disease, formation of calcium
      deposites in the body and blood-vessel disease.

      Current guidelines indicate that blood phosphorous levels should be maintained between 1.13
      to 1.78mmol/L in patients who receive haemodialysis.

      The purpose of this study is to establish the non-inferiority of magnesium iron
      hydroxycarbonate to sevelamer hydrochloride in lowering serum phosphate in haemodialysis
      patients treated for 3 months. Additional objectives: (1) to determine the safety of
      magnesium iron hydroxycarbonate after short term (3 months) and long term (6 and 12 months)
      treatment, (2)to determine the efficacy of magnesium iron hydroxycarbonate after long term
      treatment (6 and 12 months) and (3) To compare the effects of magnesium iron hydroxycarbonate
      and sevelamer hydrochloride on measures of mineral metabolism, albumin, pre-albumin and iron
      status after short term (3 months) and long term (6 and 12 months) treatment.
