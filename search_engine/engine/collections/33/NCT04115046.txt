    
      This study has been designed as prospective, single center, single arm, consecutive, blinded,
      pilot study conducted in a post-market setting using commercially available devices to
      evaluate the effectiveness of Endoscopic Ultrasound with ShearWave Elastography to estimate
      hepatic fibrosis in patients with chronic liver disease. It is anticipated that the data from
      this study will support the need for additional clinical trials. All consenting, eligible
      patients reporting for an ultrasound and/or liver biopsy for evaluation of fibrosis meeting
      the inclusion criteria will be consecutively enrolled into the study and assigned a unique
      study identification number. A total of 52 subjects will be enrolled and treated at a single
      study site in the US. Enrollment is expected to be completed within 6 months. Each subject
      will undergo both procedures (FibroScan and EUS with SW Elastography), End of study will be
      reached after pathology results have been obtained (within a week of the initial procedure).
