      acceptability, and efficacy of the SHARE-Chronic Conditions psycho-social intervention. The
      project will adapt the SHARE intervention, for use with dyads facing the challenges of
      chronic conditions. The six-session SHARE-CC program will be implemented and evaluated using
      a randomized controlled trial with 240 participants in northern Ohio, the San Diego and San
      Francisco Bay areas in California, and New Jersey.

      The SHARE-CC intervention addresses the need for a structured approach that targets both
      members of a care dyad and empowers them to be actively involved in current and future care
      planning. It has great potential to not only improve psychosocial outcomes for families, but
      to also impact healthcare decision-making and utilization.

      Persons with chronic conditions and their caregivers will be interviewed prior to (Time 1)
      and after participating (approximately 4 months post-Time 1) in the SHARE-CC intervention or
      PWCC control group.
