      pain is still an important issue in its recovery period. After VATS procedure, intravenous
      patient controlled analgesia (IV PCA) is being used for pain control. However, the side
      effects of IV PCA are nausea, vomiting, sleepiness, and urination difficulty which interrupt
      the early recovery. It is established that pre-emptive local bupivacaine injection is more
      economical, has almost no side effects, and finally, it is effective for the postoperative 24
      hours. The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether pre-emptive local bupivacaine
      injection is a better alternative pain control modality than the conventional intravenous
      patient controlled analgesia.
