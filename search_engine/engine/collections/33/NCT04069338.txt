      lithotriper machines (the Storz Modulith LX-F2 and Dornier Delta III) in patients who are
      undergoing shockwave lithotripsy (SWL) as the primary management of their urinary stone.
      Patients record pain score on day of operation and post-operative day 1, and are followed for
      1 month until they receive standard of care imaging at 1 month post-operatively.
