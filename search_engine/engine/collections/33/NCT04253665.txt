      their daily tasks. The teaching provided by nurses during hospitalization is essential care
      to prepare them to manage their health at home. Nevertheless, there is often a gap between
      professionals' belief that the teaching they have provided to patients has met their needs,
      and patients' perceptions of the relevance of the teaching content to their home situation.
      The time available to conduct this teaching is also short during the hospital stay and there
      is limited knowledge about how to adapt this teaching for patients who must manage multiple
      chronic conditions at the same time. Thus, there is a real need to develop and test a new
      teaching nursing intervention to prepare for the return home that takes into account the
      unique and complex needs and characteristics of patients with multiple chronic conditions.
      Tailoring teaching to seniors' life situation and level of activation (i.e., knowledge,
      skills and confidence in managing their health) would best meet the needs of these patients
      for managing their health at home. An intervention that takes these characteristics into
      account has been developed and will be tested in this study.
