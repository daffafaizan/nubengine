      an Energy Conservation + Problem Solving Therapy (EC+PST) intervention delivered over the
      telephone, to evaluate the acceptability of the intervention, and to assess the
      appropriateness of the outcome measures. The secondary aim was to evaluate the preliminary
      intervention effect on fatigue impact, activity performance, and participation in daily
      activities in post-cardiac arrest (CA) adults with chronic fatigue.
