    
      Non-interventional prospective multicentre cohort study to determine a predictive score for
      the occurrence of osteochimionecrosis of the jaws after invasive oral surgery in patients who
      have received at least one of the following molecules as part of chemotherapy with malignant
      bone disease (multiple myeloma or bone metastasis of a solid tumour):

        -  Biphosphonates: ZOLEDRONATE (ZOMETA®), PAMIDRONATE (AREDIA®, OSTEPAM®)

        -  Anti-angiogenic: DENOSUMAB (XGEVA®), BEVACIZUMAB (AVASTIN®), RITUXIMAB (MABTHERA®,
           RIXATHON®, TRUXIMA®), SUNITINIB (SUTENT®), PAZOPANIB (VOTRIENT®), AXITINIB (INLYTA®),
           CARBOZANTINIB (CABOMETYX®, COMETRIQ®), SORAFENIB (NEXAVAR®)

      The study protocol is based on the post-operative clinical and radiographic follow-up of
      patients. 3 consultations are scheduled:

        -  1 week after surgery

        -  1 month after surgery

        -  3 months after surgery

      The following information should be noted at each follow-up consultation:

        -  Appearance of gingival and mucosal tissues : normal or inflammatory physiological state

        -  Description of possible bone exposure: size, colour, spontaneous or induced bleeding

        -  Description and assessment of local pain

        -  Description of a local infection

        -  Results of a bacteriological sample in case of suppuration

      The patient's participation in the study ends:

        -  at the end of one of the consultations at 1 week and 1 month as soon as
           osteochimionecrosis of the jaws is diagnosed by the investigating physician

        -  at the end of the consultation at 3 months otherwise

        -  in the event of the patient's death during the study

        -  in the event of the patient's renouncement to participate in the study The patient's
           participation period is therefore a maximum of 3 months.
