        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of imatinib mesylate when administered with
           irinotecan and cisplatin in patients with extensive stage small cell lung cancer.

        -  Determine the effect of imatinib mesylate on irinotecan metabolism by the cytochrome
           p450 system in these patients.

        -  Determine the response rate, time to progression, and survival of patients treated with
           this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of imatinib mesylate.

      Patients receive irinotecan IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15 and cisplatin IV over 60
      minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive oral imatinib mesylate once or
      twice daily beginning on day 22 of course 1 and continuing until disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of imatinib mesylate until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at
      least 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 18 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-18
      months.
