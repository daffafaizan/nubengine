      1000 mg FDC tablet). SYR-322MET is being tested to assess whether its pharmacokinetic
      properties (how it is processed by the body) are affected when administered as a FDC compared
      to administration of alogliptin and metformin alone. This study will look at lab results in
      people who take SYR-322MET.

      This crossover study will enroll approximately 24 participants. Participants will be randomly
      assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of two treatment sequences. All
      participants will receive both treatments over two periods; the order of receipt will be
      determined by the randomization code. All participants will receive the following study
      medications by the end of the study:

        -  Alogliptin 12.5 mg + Metformin 1000 mg as individual tablets

        -  SYR-322MET (alogliptin 12.5 mg and metformin 1000 mg fixed-dose combination [FDC]
           tablet)

      This single center trial will be conducted in Russia. The overall time to participate in this
      study is up to 63 days. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic including two
      4-day periods of confinement to the clinic, and will be contacted by telephone 14 days after
      last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.
