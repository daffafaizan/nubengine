      almost uniformly costly and time-intensive, blunting dissemination of intervention and
      stymying opportunities to make scalable, population-level impact. One promising solution to
      this problem is a new class of evidence-based treatments, single-session interventions
      (SSIs), which have shown remarkable efficacy in treating a range of other developmental
      psychopathologies. No study to date has examined SSIs in youth with ASD, which, if even
      marginally effective, could dramatically reduce the cost and expand the public health impact
      of accessible intervention options for ASD. This study offers the first pilot randomized
      controlled trial (RCT) of whether an SSI shown to reduce internalizing problems in
      typically-developing youth may improve core and co-occurring symptoms of ASD.
