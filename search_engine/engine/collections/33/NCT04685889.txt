      applied to teeth with MIH, while the healthy teeth received no treatment (control).

      Group I : Icon® resin infiltration treatment was performed on 58 permanent central teeth with
      MIH and evaluated before; immediately after; and 1, 3, and 6 months after the procedure.

      Group II (Control Group): No treatment was performed on healthy teeth. However, similar to
      the treated teeth, 58 healthy permanent central teeth of the same individuals were evaluated
      before; immediately after; and 1, 3, and 6 months after the procedure.

      Lesions were evaluated before, immediately after, and 1, 3, and 6 months after treatment.
      Mineralisation degree of MIH lesions was evaluated using DIAGNOdent Pen, changes in the
      lesion colour and lesion size were evaluated using VITA EasyShade and the cross polarization
      technique, respectively.
