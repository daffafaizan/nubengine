      antivirals, causes significant morbidity and mortality (about 24,000 deaths each year in the
      United States alone). The influenza virus that emerged in 2009 (A/California/07/2009 H1N1)
      caused fewer deaths (12,000 flu-related deaths in the U.S.) but in contrast to seasonal flu,
      nearly 90% of the deaths with the 2009 H1N1 occurred among people younger than 65 years of
      age. Although there are four currently licensed anti-influenza medications (amantadine and
      rimantadine, oseltamivir, and zanamivir), previous studies have not demonstrated conclusively
      to what extent these medications affect influenza viral shedding. This study will evaluate
      whether oseltamivir modifies the viral shedding during the treatment of uncomplicated
      influenza in an adult population and also assess methods to detect viral replication in the
      upper respiratory tract.

      Subjects who presented with an influenza-like illness without any risk factors for severe
      disease were screened for the study. Those with a confirmatory test for influenza (rapid
      antigen or polymerase chain reaction [PCR]) were randomized in a 1:1 manner to receive a
      blinded study treatment consisting of either the oseltamivir or placebo for 5 days. Clinical,
      virologic, and laboratory assessments on Days 1, 3, 7, and 28 were used for both safety and
      efficacy analysis.
