      Santa Fe de Bogotá University Hospital as a participating centre. It is intended, under a
      prospective cohort methodology, to identify, analyze and compare predictive factors of the
      clinical course of COVID-19 in patients with baseline diagnoses of rheumatological or
      autoimmune diseases with the intention of establishing well-founded parameters that
      contribute to the improvement in terms of strategies of prevention, management and prognosis;
      benefiting both directly treating physicians and patients, as well as indirectly a health
      system that is predicted to be pushed to the limit as time passes.
