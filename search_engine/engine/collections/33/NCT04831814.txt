      optical magnification of up to 65x in near focus (NF) compared with 52x in normal standard
      focus (SF) with the simple push of a button of the endoscope to be interchangeable between NF
      and SF. There were few studies comparing diagnostic accuracy between NF and SF in the
      diagnosis of colorectal polyps. So, our aim of the current study is to compare accuracy of NF
      NBI compared with SF NBI in the optical diagnosis of neoplastic and non-neoplastic polyp and
      the accuracy of NF NBI versus SF NBI in distinguishing serrated adenoma from hyperplastic
      polyp in sessile lesions using histologic evaluation as the gold standard.
