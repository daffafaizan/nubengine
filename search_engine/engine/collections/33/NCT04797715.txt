      they will be treated with AXS-05 and monitored for a treatment response. Patients who
      experience a treatment response during the stabilization period will then be randomized into
      the double-blind treatment period, in a 1:1 ratio, to continue treatment with AXS-05 or to
      switch to placebo, for up to 26 weeks or until a relapse of agitation occurs.
