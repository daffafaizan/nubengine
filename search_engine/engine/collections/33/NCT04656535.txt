    
      This is a phase 0/I exploratory study. Patients at first or second recurrence of glioblastoma
      will be enrolled. The study will be divided into two cohorts: Cohort A (safety cohort) and
      Cohort B (surgical patient cohort).

      Cohort A: Eligible patients will be sequentially enrolled to receive intravenous AB154
      combined with AB122 (N=6). AB154 will be given at a dose of 10 mg/kg and AB122 will be given
      at a dose of 240 mg (flat).

      Cohort B: Expansion surgical cohort. The purpose of cohort B is to provide an additional
      safety evaluation of AB154 + AB122 as well as tissue and blood for exploratory ancillary
      studies investigating the effects of AB154 + AB122 in the tumor and tumor microenvironment. A
      total of 40 patients will be enrolled in this cohort.

      Following completion of cohort A, patients who are candidates for surgical resection for
      management of tumor progression (i.e. need for diagnostic confirmation or tumor debulking)
      will be enrolled prior to surgical resection, and initiate study treatment approximately two
      weeks prior to the resection.

      Patients will be randomized to one of the four treatment arms and initiate treatment prior to
      surgery, according to treatment assignment.

      The pre-surgical dose (neoadjuvant treatment) will be double-blinded. A total of 10 patients
      will be allocated to each one of the following groups in a blinded fashion, approximately two
      weeks before surgery:

        -  B1 (N=10): AB154 single agent (10 mg/kg) + placebo

        -  B2 (N=10): AB122 single agent (240 mg) + placebo

        -  B3 (N=10): AB154 (10 mg/kg) +AB122 (240 mg)

        -  B4 (N=10): Two placebo infusions

      Following surgery, all patients (N=40) will initiate treatment with the combination of AB154
      and AB122.
