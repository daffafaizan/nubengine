      vitiligo, which is suitable for treating large areas with good cosmetic results. The ReCell
      Autologous Cell Harvesting Device (Avita Medical Europe Limited, Cambridge, UK) is a device
      which, compared to other forms of autologous epidermal cell suspension grafting, is easier in
      use showing similar results. With this device an epidermal cell suspension is created from a
      split skin graft, usually taken from the hip region. Currently, conventional ablative (full
      surface de-epidermisation) laser treatment in different laser settings is used as
      pre-treatment to prepare the acceptor site for transplantation. There is no evidence for the
      laser settings used and no studies are available on the use of a fractional laser as
      pre-treatment in autologous cell suspension grafting using ReCell (ReCell grafting). The
      investigators hypothesize that more superficial conventional ablative laser treatment and
      fractional ablative laser treatment are as effective as the current pre-treatment, whereas
      these treatments are less invasive, provide faster healing and prevent side effects like
      persisting erythema and scars. Furthermore, infiltration anaesthesia is not necessary with
      these less invasive treatments.
