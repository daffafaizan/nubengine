      protein. Affected individuals cannot make a blood clot effectively and suffer from severe
      bleeding episodes. Repeated bleeding episodes, specifically into joints, can cause chronic
      joint disease and lead to disability. This research study will test the safety of giving an
      affected individual a normal factor IX gene which can produce factor IX protein in his body.
      We will give the normal gene for factor IX by using an inactivated (not able to function)
      virus called "the vector." The vector used in this study was developed from an
      adeno-associated virus that has been changed so that it is unable to cause a viral infection
      in humans. This inactivated virus was further altered to carry the factor IX gene and to
      locate within liver cells where factor IX protein is normally made.
