      for cyclic leg loading. Erigo now also includes Functional Electrical Stimulation to optimize
      active neuromuscular stimulation. It allows for protected gradual verticalization and
      mobilization based on patient tolerance and progress. It has been shown to improve
      orthostatic tolerance, cerebral blood flow and muscle strength.

      Prospective Randomized Controlled Trial will compare two groups. The patients that meet
      inclusion criteria will be randomized into either the treatment group or a control group.
      General ICU mobility guidelines consist of scaled activity related to the patients'
      stability. The control group will get the general ICU mobility treatments and the treatment
      group will have one mobility treatment replaced with the Erigo treatment.
