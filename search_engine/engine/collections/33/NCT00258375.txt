      Primary

        -  Determine the efficacy of OGX-011 and docetaxel, in terms of objective tumor response
           rate, in women with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the tolerability and toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the time to progression and overall survival of patients treated with this
           regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, nonrandomized, multicenter study.

      Patients receive OGX-011 IV over 2 hours on days -7, -5, -3, 1, 8, and 15 of course 1 and on
      days 1, 8, and 15 of all subsequent courses. Patients also receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour
      on days 1 and 8 of all courses. Treatment repeats every 21 days* for up to 10 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      NOTE: *Course 1 is 28 days in length and all subsequent courses (courses 2-10) are 21 days in
      length.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 4 weeks and then periodically
      until disease progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 42 patients will be accrued for this study.
