    
      objective : the Bristol stool form scale (BSFS) is inadequate for non-toilet trained
      children.

      The Brussels Infant and Toddler Stool Scale (BITTS) was developed, consisting of 7 photograps
      of diapers containing stools of infants and toddlers. We aimed to evaluate inter-observer
      reliability of stool consistency assessment among parents, nurses and medical doctors using
      the BITTS.

      Method :

      In this multicenter cross-sectional study (2016-2017), Bitts photograps were rated according
      to the BSFS. The reliability of the BITTS was evaluated using the overall proportion of
      perfect agreement and the linearly weighted K statistic.

      What is known :

        -  reliable assessment of stool consistency is important for evaluating children's
           defecation pattern and diagnosing gastrointestinal disorders.

        -  the reliability of the Bristol Stool Form Scale, developed for adults, has been debated
           for young children who are non-toilet trained and wear diapers

      To get validation of the BITTS :

        -  a non-toilet trained child makes stool in diaper

        -  caregiver scores the aspect of the stool according to the BITTS

        -  caregiver takes a picture of the diaper

        -  after 1 monts she rescores the picture according to the BITTS
