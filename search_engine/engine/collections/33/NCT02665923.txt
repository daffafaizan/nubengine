      patients presenting for elective procedures at CHONY. These patients will undergo one
      ultrasound prior to their elective procedure after induction of general anesthesia.

      The second part of the study involves serial ultrasounds over several visits. Healthy
      newborns in the Newborn Nursery will be recruited to conduct this study. The initial pilot
      period will study a total of 50 healthy newborns who will be given formula feeding of known
      volume, and then serial ultrasound imaging of gastric antral volume will be performed until
      gastric emptying. Study willl perform follow up of these newborns at two later time intervals
      (between ages 4-6 months, and 9-12 months). The purpose of follow-up is to evaluate whether
      there are age-related changes in gastric emptying.
