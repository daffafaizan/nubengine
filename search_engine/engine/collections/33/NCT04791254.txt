      cancers, in some patients, directly leading to death. Poor fitness, in terms of reduced
      muscle mass (sarcopenia) or physical performance, is associated with higher treatment
      toxicity and poor treatment outcomes.

      However the relationship between different markers of nutritional status and body composition
      with fitness is not fully understood. It is also not known what impact dietetic interventions
      have on the reduced survival seen in patients with weight loss at baseline.

      Finally, the underlying interaction between the neuronal-enteroendocrine-hypothalamic axis
      that regulates appetite is poorly understood but believed to be impaired in patients with
      upper GI cancers because of a number of altered mechanisms.

      Therefore the rationale for this study is to prospectively investigate the outcomes of
      patients undergoing standard dietetic interventions alongside treatment for their advanced
      gastrointestinal cancers, and to further characterise the relationship with body composition.

      A number of patients will be enrolled in a sub-study investigating the
      neuronal-enteroendocrine-hypothalamic axis.

      The hypothesis is that proinflammatory cytokines produced by the tumour can not only affect
      appetite directly through the vagal and the central melanocortin system but also indirectly
      though the enhanced EEC activity; either through increased number or increased function.

      In this study, the investigators will explore and compare the pattern and levels
      (pre-prandial and post prandial) of the pro-inflammatory cytokines and gut hormones between
      stage-standardised anorexic and non-anorexic cancer patients and age-matched healthy
      controls.
