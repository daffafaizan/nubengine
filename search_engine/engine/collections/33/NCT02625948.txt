      multicentre, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, prospective, investigator-led,
      clinical trial of tranexamic acid within 6 hours of intracerebral hemorrhage in patients with
      contrast extravasation on CTA, 'the spot sign'. ICH patients within 6 hours of symptom onset,
      with the spot sign as a biomarker for ongoing hemorrhage, and no contraindications for
      antifibrinolytic therapy were enrolled in TRAIGE. The patient with a spot sign will be
      randomized to receive either the active treatment or placebo, the patient with no spot sign
      will be given regular treatment as observation. The trial is anticipated to complete in 36
      months from the first subject recruitment , with 240 subjects recruited. A Data and Safety
      Monitoring Board (DSMB) will regularly monitor safety during the study. The trial has been
      approved by IRB(Institutional Review Board) /EC(Ethics Committee) in Beijing Tiantan
      hospital, Capital Medical University.
