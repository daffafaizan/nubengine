      (ERA) patients in China, who are naïve or shown insufficiency response or intolerance to
      DMARDs. The participants plan to be treated with iguratimod alone, or along with methotrexate
      (MTX)/ hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) / prednisone (Pred) step by step if participants are in
      medium or high disease activity (DAS28≥3.2). The efficacy and safety of 6 month Iguratimod
      treatment in RA and ERA patients will be evaluated with DAS28-ESR and other disease activity
      indices.
