      outcomes in behavioral health-related disorders is Motivational Interviewing (MI). MI is
      strongly rooted in the client-centered therapy of Rogers (1951). Its relational stance
      emphasizes the importance of understanding the client's internal frame of reference and
      displaying unconditional positive regard for the client. Motivational interviewing can thus
      be defined as a client-centered, directive method of therapy for enhancing intrinsic
      motivation to change by exploring and resolving ambivalence. MI manifests through specific
      strategies, such as reflective listening, summarization, shared decision making, and agenda
      setting.

      Adolescent participants exposed to motivational interviewing in conjunction with usual care
      (diet and exercise program) are expected to endorse greater self-efficacy, report increased
      engagement in healthy behaviors, demonstrate a decrease in body weight and report improved
      psychological outcomes. While motivational interviewing has been shown to increase adults'
      motivation to make healthy behavior changes, few adolescent studies have demonstrated this
      effect.
