      angiographically from the iliac arteries to delineate penile vasculature. Significant
      obstructive atherosclerotic disease of the deep penile arteries may be present in impotent
      males. The etiology of erectile dysfunction is multifactorial and may involve vascular
      disease, endocrine disorders, neurologic disease, prescription medications, psychological
      issues and/or trauma in any given patient. Vascular disease in patients with erectile
      dysfunction may be due to trauma, congenital anomalies, or atherosclerosis.
