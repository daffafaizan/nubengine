        -  Determine whether conventional or implant supported dental prostheses and current
           surgical reconstructive procedures restore oral function and quality of life to
           pre-cancer surgery levels in patients with early oral cancer.

      OUTLINE: Patients complete a series of objective and subjective functional tests,
      questionnaires, and baseline examinations. Within 1-5 days, patients undergo the composite
      resection, including reconstructive surgery for the mandibulectomy group. Patients in the
      maxillectomy group receive an immediate maxillary surgical obturator. Approximately 6 weeks
      after ablative surgery, some patients receive radiotherapy for 5-7 weeks.

      Patients receive 2-4 implants at 12-16 weeks after completion of radiotherapy or 8-16 weeks
      after ablative surgery. Patients then receive conventional dentures at 4-22 weeks after
      implant surgery. Implants are exposed during 27-48 weeks after placement and abutments
      connected for fabricating dental prostheses. Approximately 8 weeks are needed to fabricate
      the implant supported prosthesis.

      Patients complete quality of life and other questionnaires prior to and at 8-21 weeks after
      surgery, 16 weeks after conventional denture insertion, and then 16 weeks after implant
      supported prosthesis insertion.

      Patients are followed every 6 months for at least 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 62 patients (22 requiring maxillectomy and 40 requiring
      mandibulectomy) will be accrued for this study within 42 months.
