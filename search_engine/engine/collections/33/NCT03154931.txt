    
      This study will be a randomized clinical trial with two parallel groups, with two models of
      treatment: Group 1 - Control Group - will receive CBT Supportive Group (CBT-SG) and Group 2 -
      Experimental Group - will receive Compassion Focused Therapy (CFT-G). Will be attended in
      total, the maximum of 80 patients, with 40 patients in each arm (CBT-SG versus CFT-G). Both
      groups will be formed by at least eight patients and a maximum of twelve patients who receive
      eight weekly sessions with an hour and a half each session, and the total duration of
      treatment will be eight weeks. The groups will be closed, that is, after the start will not
      be permitted to input any more participants. The experimental group (CFT-G) will be
      structured and the control group (CBT-SG) will be unstructured, and free format.

      All patients will be assessed through self-report scales, within three distinct phases:
      Assessment I - Initial (before therapy); Assessment II - Final (after therapy); Assessment
      III - Follow-up (after 3 months of therapy ending).

      All groups will be led by a principal therapist and co-therapist. All sessions will be
      recorded for later evaluation of the researcher responsible for the research.
