      symptom relief in patients with desmoid tumors. II. Determine the safety of this regimen in
      these patients. III. Determine the quality of life of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified by gender. Patients receive oral toremifene daily until
      complete or maximal response in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Patients achieving maximal response undergo complete resection of all lesions, if feasible.
      Nonsurgical candidates with severe or life-threatening disease not achieving partial or
      complete response or symptom relief at 12 months may continue on toremifene at the discretion
      of the study chairperson. Patients with stable disease who do not undergo surgery may
      continue on toremifene for a maximum of 12 months at the discretion of the treating
      physician. Patients who continue to experience symptom relief at 12 months may continue on
      toremifene at the discretion of the study chairperson. Quality of life is assessed at
      baseline and at 2 and 6 months. Patients are followed every 8 weeks for 4 years and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24-72 (12-36 per stratum) will be accrued for this study.
