      dysfunction in individuals with AS and compare individuals with AS to healthy individuals .
      In the light of these studies, the investigators thought that the sexual function of partner
      of individuals with AS may also be affected negatively. In the literature, no previous study
      examines the sexual function of partner of individuals with AS. Therefore, the aim was to
      determine the sexual function of partner of individuals with AS and to compare with healthly
      adults of the same sex.
