    
      Patients with decompensate heart failure (NYHA III-IV) and in need of intravenous inotrop
      support and who fulfil all inclusion and no exclusion criteria will be randomised into the
      study in proportion 1:1. Although stratification will be done so patients treated with
      beta-receptor blocker carvedilol will be divided the same between the study groups.

      All patients will receive infusions in parallell, one of the groups will receive active
      product (levosimendan or dobutamine) and the other will receive placebo (double-dummy
      technique).

      Catheterisation for measurement of hemodynamic parameters will be performed according to
      routine methods at the clinic. The measurements of the hemodynamic variables will start 30
      minutes before start of study drug infusion and will be finished 48 hours after start of
      infusion. The most important variables during the measurements is Cardiac Index (CI)and
      Pulmonary Capillary Wedge Pressure (PCWP).

      Parallel registration will be done on ECG, blood pressure, blood frequency, central venous
      pressure, and lung artery pressure. Heart failure and other clinical symptoms will be
      registered continuously during 48 hours. Blood samples will be taken intermittent to record
      the blood values. Cogent rules for decreasing/increasing of the dose can be found in the
      study protocol, likewise rules for interruption or stoop for infusion.

      Registration of side-effects will be done continuously. The recommendation for treatment for
      known side effects could be found in the protocol (section 5.3.4) and the protocol should be
      available during the study procedure.

      One month after the study the patients will be followed up with a very careful examination
      and also of the amount of visits and reason for visits to hospital during the past 30-35
      days.
