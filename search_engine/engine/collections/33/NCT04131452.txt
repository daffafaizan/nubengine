      conducted to compare success rates between fresh and frozen embryo transfers. However, most
      studies have not taken into consideration women's quality of life, sexual life and
      psychological state in comparing fresh embryo transfer with frozen embryo transfers. These
      all parameters are confounding factors that may influence the success of embryo transfer. The
      purpose of this study is to compare women's quality of life, sexual life and psychological
      state using validated forms between those undergoing fresh embryo transfer and those
      undergoing frozen embryo transfer. The following forms will be used: expanded version of the
      inventory of depression and anxiety symptoms (IDAS-II), Beck Anxiety inventory (BAI), Short
      Form Survey (SF-36) and Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI. This study can provide evidence
      regarding the association between women's quality of life, sexual life and psychological
      state and embryo transfer success.
