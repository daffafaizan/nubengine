      (physical examination, ECG, biology) with transthoracic Â± transesophageal echocardiography in
      each center. If the patient is considered not eligible for surgery by the heart-team and is
      not included in a clinical trial, the investigator informs the patient of the existence of
      the registry and verifies that it does not express opposition to the use of its clinical
      data.

      In each participating center, demographic information, clinical, laboratory,
      echocardiographic and treatment options will be collected and reported in an electronic case
      report form (e-CRF). Each center will be responsible of patient monitoring, including phone
      call at 6 months and a medical visit at 1 and 2 years. Transthoracic echocardiography will
      also be performed at 1 year and 2 years.
