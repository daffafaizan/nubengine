      assessing the analgesic efficacy and safety of T-62 in subjects with postherpetic neuralgia
      (PHN) and its associated pain. Up to 20 centers in the United States will participate in the
      trial. Two doses of T-62 and placebo will be evaluated in parallel design. Approximately 130
      subjects will be enrolled to complete approximately 100 subjects. Each subject will complete
      a 7-day Screening Period , a 28-day Treatment Period, and a 14-day Post-Treatment Period.
      Each subject will complete 8 clinic visits over the course of the study during which
      procedures and assessments of safety, efficacy, and protocol compliance will be performed.
