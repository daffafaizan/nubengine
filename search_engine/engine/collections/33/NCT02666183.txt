      depression, health status) for distant care givers (DCGs) of patients with advanced cancer
      who are randomly assigned to either the full intervention arm (Closer), the video-only
      intervention arm (Video-C Only) or the control group (Web-Only). the goal is to determine
      which is most efficacious in improving outcomes over time for these caregivers. In addition,
      this study will examine the indirect effects of each arm of the intervention on DCG outcomes
      over time as well as explore the nature of relationships between patient and DCG distress,
      anxiety and depression over time.

      The specific research questions include:

        1. Is there a difference in DCG outcomes (anxiety, distress, depression, health status)
           over time between caregivers in the Closer, Video-C Only, and Web-Only groups,
           controlling for DCG demographic variables?

        2. Are there significant indirect effects of Closer, Video-C Only, and Web-Only on DCG
           outcomes (anxiety, distress, depression, health status) over time, controlling for DCG
           demographic variables?

        3. Are there significant relationships between DCG distress, anxiety, depression and health
           status and patient distress, anxiety and depression over time?
