      morbidity. In Europe, in-hospital mortality exceeded 7% in patients with coronary artery
      disease and in those with congestive heart failure. Within 30 days of non-cardiac surgery
      procedures, 8% of patients will suffer a major cardiovascular event.

      Immunological processes, increased recruitment and infiltration of innate and adaptive immune
      cells into atherosclerotic lesions, have been shown to drive perioperative atherosclerotic
      lesion progression and plaque destabilization and are thought to promote plaque rupture. When
      classical monocytes are activated to inflammatory non-classical monocytes, the membrane-bound
      cell surface protein CD14 is released into circulation. In plasma, soluble CD14 (sCD14) is
      cleaved by lysosomal proteases. The N-terminal 13kDa fragment constitutes sCD14 subtype
      (sCD14-ST), also called presepsin. Presepsin has been established as a marker for early
      identification of patients with systemic infections. Recently, presepsin has been proposed as
      a biomarker for preoperative risk prediction in cardiac surgery. Our preliminary results in a
      limited number of patients suggest that presepsin is associated with major adverse
      cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events after non-cardiac surgery as well with all-cause
      mortality. Presepsin might have a test characteristic superior to conventional risk
      assessment on the basis of the revised cardiac risk index (RCRI), high-sensitivity cardiac
      Troponin-T (hs-cTnT) and N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP).

      Preoperative presepsin quantification might help to identify non-cardiac surgery patients
      prone to experience perioperative major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events.
