    
      Chronic portal vein thrombosis (PVT) is a rare disease, affecting young patients,
      characterized by permanent obstruction of the portal vein trunk causing portal hypertension.
      In 60-70% of cases it is related to high risk, moderate or mild prothrombotic risk factors.

      Accordingly, there are 2 types of complications from PVT :(i) gastrointestinal haemorrhage
      related to portal hypertension; and (ii) recurrent thrombosis.

      Recurrent thrombosis its most dreaded complication as it may lead to intestinal infarction
      with a related mortality of 20-60% and a high risk of intestinal insufficiency.

      Gastrointestinal haemorrhage related to portal hypertension occurs in 20% patients/year. It
      is less frequent in patients treated with medical or endoscopic prophylaxis for variceal
      bleeding.

      Retrospective data shows that anticoagulation does not worsen the prognosis, and may
      conversely improve it. Thus, in patients at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding due to portal
      hypertension and a mild or moderate risk of recurrent thrombosis, the benefit-risk ratio of
      anticoagulation therapy is unclear.

      The aim of this open randomised trial is to assess the efficacy of Xarelto 15mg/day, a new
      oral factor Xa inhibitor, in the recurrence of thromboembolic event and the risk of major
      bleeding compared to an untreated group in patients with chronic portal vein thrombosis
      without high risk thrombophilia.

      This is a national, multicentric, interventional study. 17 french centers already agreed to
      participate.

      296 patients will be included on a 3 years period with 2 to 4 years treatment period. All
      data will be collected after informed consent will be obtained.
