      in ALF. Ammonia is normally produced in the gut and transformed by the liver into urea. As
      the liver fails, ammonia increases in the systemic circulation and enters into the brain. The
      result of a rapid rise in ammonia or related compounds in the cerebral circulation is hepatic
      encephalopathy (HE), a reversible neuropsychiatric condition that ranges in severity from
      mild impairment in attention, to delirium, the development of cerebral edema, coma and death.
      This is a Phase 2a, multi-center, open-label study, conducted in two cohorts in patients
      diagnosed with acute liver failure/acute liver injury (ALF/ALI) who meet inclusion/exclusion
      criteria. This study is designed to provide data on OCR-002 with regards to

        -  the effect on circulating ammonia levels in patients with acute liver failure with and
           without impaired renal function at different doses after single and continuous infusion

        -  safety and dose tolerability as well as

        -  providing data on the metabolites, glutamine and phenylacetylglutamine in this patient
           population.

      It is anticipated that this early efficacy, safety, tolerability,
      Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) and dose-ranging study will lead to a Phase 3
      development program for the use of OCR-002 in the treatment of hyperammonemia due to ALF. No
      clinical outcome measures will be formally studied because of the small sample size.
