    
      This is a prospective, multi-center, non-randomized and noninterventional post-market release
      study. Subjects will participate in 2 phases with each phase requiring the subject to use the
      continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) pump over the course of the study. During the
      study, subjects and parent or legal guardian will be trained to wear the glucose sensor in
      the abdominal area for 3 days to transmit real-time (RT) data to the pump. The duration of
      each study phase is approximately 6 months.
