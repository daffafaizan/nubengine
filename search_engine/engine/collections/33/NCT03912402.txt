      cycles of BCD-100 in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy and bevacizumab or until
      unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Patients who have demonstrated a positive
      antitumor effect (stabilization of the disease, partial or complete response) and who have no
      signs of unacceptable toxicity could continue to receive up to 12 cycles of maintenance
      therapy of BCD-100 in combination with bevacizumab or until unacceptable toxicity or disease
      progression.
