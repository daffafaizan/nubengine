      medication doses of dextro-amphetamine sulfate to placebo in the treatment of cocaine
      dependence. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the four following dosages of
      dextro-amphetamine sulfate: 0 mg, 40 mg, 60 mg, or 80 mg. Participants will undergo a 2-week
      stabilization period followed by a 25-week study period. The study period will include
      administration of the stable medication dose for 21 weeks, followed by 1 week of dose
      reduction, and then 3 weeks without medication. All participants will receive weekly
      cognitive behavioral therapy and electrocardiograms. Participants will be given the option to
      participate in a voluntary plasma blood draw during Weeks 4, 8, and 20 and will be scheduled
      for follow-up assessments at Months 1 and 3 post-treatment.
