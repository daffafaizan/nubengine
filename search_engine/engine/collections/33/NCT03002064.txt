      endemic in many parts of the world, particularly in the developing countries, including
      China. Histologically, esophageal cancer can be classified as adenocarcinoma and esophageal
      squamous cell. carcinoma (ESCC) which is the most common histology in Asia. For locally
      advanced or metastatic ESCC patients, chemotherapy can improve overall survival (OS) and
      progression free survival (PFS). There is no standard first-line chemotherapy for ESCC
      patients. Cisplatin (DDP) plus fluorouracil is the most common used combination with a
      response rate of 25-35%. Previous studies showed that the combination of paclitaxel with
      cisplatin had good tolerance and efficacy to esophageal carcinoma. This is a prospective
      randomized control phase III clinical trial to compare the efficacy and safety between
      docetaxel/cisplatin and 5-Fu/cisplatin as the 1st line treatment in advanced or metastatic
      esophageal carcinoma patients.

      Sample size:

      This is a non-inferior study. The planned sample size was 358 patients, allowing for a 10%
      dropout rate and assuming the median progression free survival was 5.5 months in the
      experimental group and 4 months in the control group with a hazard ratio of 0.727, α=0.05,
      β=0.2. The planned enrolled time was 36 months and 12 months of follow up. The ratio between
      control and experimental group is 1:1.
