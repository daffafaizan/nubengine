      impaired endothelial function has been reported to be associated with an increased mortality
      risk in those subjects. Although systemic exercise training has been demonstrated to improve
      endothelial dysfunction in patients with CHF, elderly patients with severely impaired
      exercise capacity could not engaged in usual exercise training using ordinal ergometer. Those
      patients are able to join stretching or very light resistance training. On the other hand,
      passive pedaling using strength ergometer has been reported to be useful in patients with
      severely impaired exercise capacity, but the safety and the efficacy of passive pedaling on
      endothelial function in old patients with CHF has not been previously reported.
