    
      This is randomized control trial aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a DID compare to the
      standard education approach in order to help the patients with Type 1 diabetes to estimate
      the carbohydrate in their food and adjust insulin doses. It involves individuals with Type 1
      diabetes who are not habitually using carbohydrate counting. They should be testing their
      blood sugar levels at least 3 times a day, using multiple daily injections of short-acting
      and long-acting insulin analogues, with HbA1c between 7.5% and 10% and are familiar with the
      use of mobile phones and possess a personal SIM card.

      Patients will be randomized to the standard education programme run for 4 full days over a 4
      week period or to the DID programme run as three 2-hour sessions over a two-week period.

      The DID is a novel software programme installed on the patient's mobile telephone. It
      facilitates the communication between the dietitian and the patient by using SMS text
      messages, so that the dietitian can monitor glycaemic control and suggest adjustments if
      necessary. It can be described as a little computer, where the patient can record their blood
      glucose value, the amount of insulin injected and the amount of carbohydrate consumed.
