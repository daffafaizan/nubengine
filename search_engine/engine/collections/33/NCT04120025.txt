      diaphragm appears to have the ability to control reflux. Other studies have had positive
      results but from extensive training of outpatients. Our population comes from ambulatory
      outpatients from family medicine at MCJ. After consent they fill out a reflux disease
      questionnaire (RDQ) a valid instrument for measuring symptoms of reflux. Subjects are
      educated on the basic concept of the study and then instructed in isolated diaphragm
      contraction breathing. once they are proficient they are asked to continue this program 3 x
      10 repetitions, 3 times per day supplemented by 10 more repetitions after each meal to reduce
      post prandial symptoms.

      Follow up is done at 1, 3 and 6 months and includes reassessment via the RDQ and an
      assessment of estimated volume of exercise compliance.
