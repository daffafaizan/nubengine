      increases the hearing in terms of speech intelligibility in quiet and noisy conditions, in
      patients who have no further benefit of their conventional hearing aid. The quality of life
      of these patients will be evaluated as well as the tolerance of the middle ear implant after
      6 months.

      Design of the study: 420 patients with mid or severe hearing loss will be included. They will
      have for 3 months the best conventional hearing aid adapted to their hearing loss. The first
      84 patients who will not have a benefit of this hearing aid, will be randomised in two
      groups. The patients of the first group will be operated as soon as possible, the surgery of
      the patients of the second group will be delayed by 6 months. The whole duration of the study
      is 48 months.

      Evaluation criteria: Audiological testing (pure-tone hearing thresholds, speech comprehension
      in quiet and noise), and subjective evaluation using self-assessment scales will be performed
      before and 6 months after the implantation in the two groups.
