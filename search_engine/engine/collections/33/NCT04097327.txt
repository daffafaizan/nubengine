      with water. Ectoin® Dermatitis Cream 7% (EHK02) is able to build an Ectoin® Hydro Complex on
      the skin providing an effective protection against external stress factors, stabilizing the
      skin barrier and moisturizing the dry skin. In former studies, it has been shown that it can
      be used for the symptomatic treatment of atopic dermatitis. This study should confirm the
      efficacy and safety of EHK02.
