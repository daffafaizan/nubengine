      Sweden based on a feasibility/pilot study that was conducted during fall 2014 co-created
      palliative care educational intervention through seminars for professionals in nursing homes.
      Due to a more significant amount of drop-outs compared with expected (and for not receiving
      the total amount of applied foundation), the plan needed to be revised. The knowledge-based
      palliative care intervention was conducted as a non-blinded control trial, implemented over a
      six-month period in 30 nursing homes in two different counties in the south of Sweden (County
      A and County B). The data collection was made in two sequential periods in each county.
      First, the intervention was implemented in ten nursing homes in County A (Kronoberg County
      from April 2015), while ten nursing homes in County B served as a control group. Then, County
      B implemented the intervention (Sk√•ne county from April 2016), and ten new nursing homes in
      County A, which had not received the intervention, were chosen as a control group. After the
      two sequential time periods were data from one intervention and one control group analysed.
      The selection through voluntary participation resulted in a mixture of both larger and
      smaller nursing homes in the two counties, as well as both from urban and rural areas.

      Every seminar group met once a month and included different professions (unit manager,
      district nurse, assistant nurse, and other staff i.e. occupational therapist and
      physiotherapist). There were 5 meetings in each nursing home during a period of 6 months.
