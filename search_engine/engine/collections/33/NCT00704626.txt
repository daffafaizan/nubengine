      proteins and 2) to other molecules including cytoskeletal proteins such as rapsyn in diseases
      of the nervous system.

      5cc of serum will be obtained from patients with multiple sclerosis and other autoimmune and
      inflammatory diseases of the nervous system including myasthenia gravis and transverse
      myelitis and from patients with other neurological diseases. Standard methodology to assure
      safe handling of serum will be used. Diluted serum will be tested for specific reactivity
      with heat shock proteins (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) as well as with other antigens
      in a standard ELISA as well as immunoblot.

      Buccal swab will also be obtained in conjunction with each blood draw. Rapsyn and other
      cytoskeletal proteins will be extracted from Torpedo californica electric organ by means of
      differential centrifugation followed by alkali extraction. For the ELISA, a standard
      titration curve will be obtained for a positive control serum as previously determined.
      Negative control sera will be obtained from individuals with other degenerative neurological
      diseases. Titers of test serum will be determined as the dilution that generates a positive
      result that is two standard deviations from the mean of the background. Positive ELISA
      results will be confirmed by immunoblot. Patients may be tested at one time point only. If
      the serum is positive for specific antibody binding, additional serum samples may be obtained
      and retested up to 8 more times approximately 3 months apart. Correlation with severity of
      clinical findings and specific antibody titer will be made. Severity of clinical findings
      will be determined by the neurological exam done by the investigator.
