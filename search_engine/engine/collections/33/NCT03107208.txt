      with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and the incidence of T1D is increasing. A frequent complication in
      DKA management that is associated with in-hospital mortality and longer hospital stay is
      hyperglycemia; specifically rebound hyperglycemia (defined as a serum glucose greater than
      180 mg/dL) within 12-24 hours after correction of the DKA. Rebound hyperglycemia increases
      the patient's risk of re-developing DKA. Few adult studies suggest that giving the
      long-acting insulin analog (glargine or LantusÂ®) early in the management of DKA (i.e. while
      still receiving intravenous insulin) can reduce rebound hyperglycemia without an increased
      risk of hypoglycemia and result in a smoother transition from intravenous insulin to
      subcutaneous insulin. This has not been well-studied in children to date. In this study the
      investigators want to determine whether giving glargine early in DKA management in children
      results in reduced rebound hyperglycemia without an increased risk in hypoglycemia. The
      investigators will do this by randomizing participants in DKA to either receive glargine
      early in the management of DKA (study group) or after resolution of DKA (control group); the
      latter is currently standard-of-care. Additionally, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM)
      systems have not been studied in a pediatric population with DKA. These devices measure blood
      sugar levels every 5 minutes and provide a great deal of information about blood sugar
      control patterns over many days. Not only will the use of CGM in this study provide
      meaningful information regarding blood sugar patterns during DKA treatment, it will also
      broaden the investigators knowledge of whether CGM is a feasible and accurate tool to use in
      this setting.
