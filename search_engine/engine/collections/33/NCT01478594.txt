      progression were to be completed within 28 days prior to first study drug administration,
      approximately every 8 weeks for the first 18 months and then approximately every 12 weeks
      until the patient showed progressive disease (PD) per the investigator, withdrew consent, was
      lost to follow-up or died. Per the original protocol, all patients were to be contacted by
      the study site every 12 weeks for survival following the end-of-treatment visit until death
      or for no more than 3 years after the end-of-treatment visit.

      The interim futility analysis was conducted in December 2013, based on a pre-specified
      analysis cutoff date of 13 September 2013. The study was brought to a close as specified in
      the protocol due to the results of the interim futility analysis and only those participants
      who were deriving benefit (per the treating physician) from their current treatment remained
      on study until one of the discontinuation criteria was met.

      Given the early closure of the study, no updated or additional efficacy analyses were
      performed after the interim analysis. A biomarker analysis was conducted in January 2014,
      based on the data from the cutoff date of 13 September 2013. The safety analysis was updated
      with a new cutoff date of 28 February 2014.
