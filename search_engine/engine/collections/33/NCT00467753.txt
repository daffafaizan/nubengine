      vs. placebo in childhood/adolescent autism. This is a twelve-week study involving twenty
      subjects between the ages of five and seventeen with a diagnosis of autism. Subjects will
      receive a psychiatric and medical evaluation by the study psychiatrist to see if she/he has
      any psychiatric or medical illnesses that would interfere with their ability to participate
      in this study. These evaluations may take up to an hour to complete. In addition, subjects
      will be asked to participate in a psychiatric interview designed to determine the child's
      diagnosis and current problem areas. The subject's parent will also be asked to fill out
      psychiatric questionnaires. The interview and questionnaires may take up to 4 hours to
      complete.
