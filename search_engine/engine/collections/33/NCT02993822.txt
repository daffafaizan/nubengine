    
      A multi-center, double-blind, randomized, parallel group, placebo-controlled dose range study
      in subjects with chronic refractory cough (CRC).

      Doses of orvepitant (10 mg/day, 20 mg/day and 30 mg/day) and placebo will be investigated in
      four parallel groups.

      Each group will compromise of approximately 61 subjects, randomized 1:1:1:1 (approximately
      244 subjects in total).

      All subjects will enter a three-week screening period to determine eligibility. Eligible
      subjects will be randomized at the Baseline/Day 1 visit and enter a 12-week double-blind
      dosing period. During this period there will be four visits at Weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12. There
      will be a final safety follow-up visit at Week 14.
