    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the feasibility, safety and toxicity of treating patients with NY-ESO-1 specific
      cellular adoptive immunotherapy in myxoid/round cell liposarcoma (MRCL) and synovial sarcoma
      patients receiving autologous cluster of differentiation (CD)8+ NY-ESO-1 specific T cells
      following cyclophosphamide conditioning.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the antitumor effect and persistence of adoptively transferred CD8+
      antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) lines following cyclophosphamide conditioning.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) on days -3 and -2. Patients receive
      NY-ESO-1-specific T cells IV on day 0.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 8 weeks.
