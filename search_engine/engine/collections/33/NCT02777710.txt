    
      This study will be a 2-part Phase I study comprising a dose-finding escalation part (to
      determine MTD/RP2D, safety and PK) followed by an extension part at RP2D. In the
      dose-escalation part, successive cohorts of 3 patients will receive Pexidartinib (given
      orally every day at escalating doses, five dose levels possible, Plexxikon), in combination
      with Durvalumab (given IV every 4 weeks at a fixed dose of 1500mg, AstraZeneca). The dose
      escalation scheme will be done using a Likelihood Continual Reassessment Method (CRML). After
      each new cohort of 3 patients is evaluated, model will be fitted and results will be
      discussed in a teleconference between the investigators, the sponsor, representatives of
      AstraZeneca and Plexxikon, and the statistician who will decide of the next dose to be
      assigned to the next cohort (Dose Escalation Meetings). In both parts, patients will continue
      to receive study drugs as long as they experience clinical benefit in the opinion of the
      investigator or until unacceptable toxicity including DLTs or symptomatic deterioration
      attributed to disease progression as determined by the investigator after an integrated
      assessment of radiographic data and clinical status or withdrawal of consent. If a DLT or a
      toxicity meeting the DLT definition but occurring outside of the DLT period, resolves to
      Grade â‰¤2 or the patient's baseline level within 14 days after toxicity onset, dosing may be
      resumed if agreed by the Sponsor at the same DL. The extension part will comprise two
      independent cohorts of patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC cohort) or colorectal
      adenocarcinoma (CRC cohort) and biopsiable disease, and will allow the assessment of
      anti-tumor activity based on a Gehan design allowing to quickly identify treatments with low
      efficacy.
