      intervention to maximise patient outcomes. This can be achieved through accurate risk
      stratification in the emergency department (ED). Sarcopaenia refers to an age-related loss of
      skeletal muscle mass and strength with major physiologic and clinical ramifications. This
      study evaluates sarcopaenia as a radiological risk stratification tool to predict in-hospital
      mortality of splenic abscess patients.

      99 adult patients at four training and research hospitals who had undergone abdominal
      contrast CT scans in the ED with the final diagnosis of splenic abscess from January 2005 to
      December 2015 were recruited. Evaluation for sarcopaenia was performed via calculating psoas
      cross-sectional area at level of L3 and normalising for height. Univariate analyses were used
      to evaluate the differences between survivors and non-survivors, with subsequent logistic
      regression analysis to assess odds ratio of sarcopaenia with respect to in-hospital
      mortality. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was plotted to determine
      predictability of sarcopaenia, with its corresponding sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy
      rate calculated.
