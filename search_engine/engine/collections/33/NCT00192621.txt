      changes in the way that fat is laid down on the body. This results in fat loss from some
      parts of the body, with fat deposits at other sites, giving a characteristic look known as
      "HIV associated lipodystrophy" or HIVLD. With these changes, there are also abnormalities in
      glucose and fat metabolism (collectively termed metabolic abnormalities). In HIV negative
      populations, these metabolic changes are associated with an increased risk of developing
      cardiovascular disease (CVD). The aim of this study is to investigate if changes in the
      body's handling of fats and glucose occur with a short course of treatment in HIV negative
      subjects and if these correlate to an increased risk of CVD.
