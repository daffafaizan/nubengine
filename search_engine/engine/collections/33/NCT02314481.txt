      and predicted neo-antigens on the anti-tumour activity of anti-PDL1 immunotherapy.

      It will examine how clonal dominance and intratumour heterogeneity influence outcomes after
      treatment, offering a unique opportunity to decipher mechanisms of resistance to
      immunotherapy with anti-PDL1. These data will help improve future study design by developing
      greater understanding of patient selection for immunotherapies in patients with NSCLC. The
      relationship between intratumour heterogeneity and cfDNA/CTCs will also be explored in DARWIN
      II, which may develop tools for patient selection and monitoring to be examined further in
      future studies. Results from DARWIN II will help to identify a biomarker for anti-PD-L1
      therapy which could be used for patient stratification in future phase III trials of
      molecules targeting this T-cell inhibitory checkpoint. DARWIN II will also provide
      preliminary data on efficacy of MPDL3280A, which could be used to design randomised studies.

      This is a multicentre non-randomised phase II study based on patients with relapsed NSCLC,
      who have provided a biopsy sample at the time of relapse.

      The study arms:

        -  Arm 1: Patients without an actionable mutation - MPDL3280A (atezolizumab) monotherapy or
           in combination with chemptherapy

        -  Arm 2: BRAFV600 - vemurafenib

        -  Arm 3: ALK/RET gene rearrangement - alectinib

        -  Arm 4: HER2 Amplification - trastuzumab emtansine
