      non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) with relatively high incidence in China. Radiotherapy alone for
      stage IE/IIE diseases has good response rate but with high relapse rates, ranging from
      20-50%. The combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy improved the long-term survival for
      patients with stage IE/IIE diseases. But the optimal treatment schedule has not been
      established. This study is designed with four cycles CAPA induction immunotherapy, followed
      by 50-56Gy radiotherapy as an approach for stage IE/IIE ENKTCL. The efficacy and safety of
      this treatment will be measured.
