    
      1. Patients with dense breast will be examined for the detection of breast cancer by
           imaging studies.

        2. The imaging including digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT), physician-performed bilateral
           whole breast ultrasonography will be performed according to a standard
           protocol.Interpretation will be conducted independently and classified according to the
           Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) by experienced radiologists.

        3. Definitive information about the presence of malignancy will be obtained by biopsy
           directed by the imaging method best depicting the lesion with 14-g or 11-g needle
           devices or needle localized excision. The absence of breast cancer was determined by
           means of biopsy, the absence of positive findings on repeat imaging and clinical
           examination, or both at follow-up.

        4. The diagnostic yield of digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) compared to ultrasonography
           will be assessed.
