      (i.e. pamidronate or zoledronic acid) or subcutaneous denosumab for at least 3 months.
      Baseline patient characteristics will be recorded and screening serum PTH (to rule out
      primary hyperparathyroidism) and vitamin D (25OH-vit D) will be recorded. In order to fulfill
      the study objectives, serum will be taken for CTX (fasting morning blood sample), P1NP and
      BSAP as well as for the optional translational studies (e.g. MMP and TIMP levels). Optional
      urine will be taken for NTX. Questionnaires will also be completed for symptoms (Brief pain
      inventory (BPI) [26] and FACT-BP [27]) and analgesic use (converted into an oral
      Morphine-equivalent dose). The serum, urine and questionnaire data will be collected at:
      baseline, weeks 4, 8, and 12. In addition, toxicity information and questions about the
      occurrence of skeletal related events will be performed at baseline, weeks 4, 8 and 12. At
      baseline and week 12 the patient will also have a bone marrow aspirate and trephine biopsy
      performed from the posterior iliac crest. These specimens will be used for ER, PR and Her2
      analysis (by FISH) and markers of apoptosis (TUNEL) and proliferation (Ki67) and also for
      optional translational studies providing tumour cells are present.
