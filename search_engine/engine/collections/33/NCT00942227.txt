      represent distinct sub-groups of patients, most studies have not attempted to narrow their
      inclusion criteria beyond loose definitions of 'acute' or 'chronic' symptoms. While these
      studies seem to indicate that traction interventions will be of little benefit when
      administered to large groups of patients without a prior attempt to select which patients are
      most likely to benefit, they are not sufficient to preclude the possibility that a subgroup
      of patients may benefit substantially from the intervention. Recent preliminary studies
      suggest a there exists a subgroup of patients with LBP that is likely to benefit from
      traction.

      The two primary aims of this study are:

        1. Determine the validity of the previously-identified prediction criteria to identify
           patients highly likely to benefit from the addition of traction to a standard physical
           therapy intervention.

        2. Compare the overall effectiveness of addition of a traction component to a standard
           physical therapy intervention.
