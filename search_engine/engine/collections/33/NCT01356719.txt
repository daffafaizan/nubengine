        1. Develop an appropriate bedside scoring method for describing the position and
           orientation of a tracheostomy tube tip when viewed endoscopically from a standardised
           position

        2. Secondary aims

             -  Correlate the endoscopic views of the tracheostomy tube with the trans-laryngeal
                views.

             -  Is it possible to predict the trans-laryngeal view from the endoscopic view.

             -  Does the position of a tracheostomy tube tip change when the patient is
                repositioned following percutaneous tracheostomy (when viewed endoscopically)

             -  Equipment training: Compare the number of supervised endoscopies required to
                consistently achieve the required standardised view

        3. Primary outcome

           - Determine the scoring system with the best inter-rater agreement as defined by
           weighted kappa and intra-class correlation coefficients.

        4. Secondary outcome

           - Assess correlation between the best scoring system (chosen by above) with the
           translaryngeal view

        5. Tertiary aim - Assessment of training: Determine the number of attempts required to
           obtain adequate standardised views. This will be a manikin based assessment to
           demonstrate competence in performing the endoscopies for the study before any procedures
           are undertaken on patients.
