      Objectives:

        -  Primary objective: To evaluate if canakinumab 150mg every 8 weeks can induce and
           maintain clinical remission in patients with the Schnitzler syndrome.

        -  Secondary objectives:

             -  To test if canakinumab 150mg can induce a complete clinical response at Day 7.

             -  To assess if addition canakinumab 150mg given at Day 7 for patients demonstrating
                only a partial response can induce a complete clinical response at Day 14.

             -  To evaluate if canakinumab 300mg every 8 weeks can maintain clinical remission in
                those patients who required canakinumab 150 mg additional dose on Day 7 and
                achieved clinical remission at Day 14.

             -  To evaluate the safety of canakinumab treatment in patients with the Schnitzler
                syndrome.

             -  To assess the changes in C-reactive protein (CRP) levels during the treatment
                period.

      Study rationale:

      Although no standard therapy has been established for the Schnitzler syndrome, given the
      rarity of this auto-inflammatory syndrome, reports on the use of Anakinra, a synthetic analog
      of the endogenous interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, have been encouraging. However, side
      effects (including local infusion site reactions and neutropenia) and the need for daily sc
      administration have hampered its use. The anti-interleukin-1-inhibitor canakinumab may
      constitute an effective and more convenient alternative.
