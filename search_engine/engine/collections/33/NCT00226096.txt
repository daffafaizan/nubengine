      approximately 2-3 million people worldwide each year. About one third of people with ICH die
      early after onset and the majority of survivors are left with major long-term disability.
      Administration of activated recombinant human Factor VII has been shown to limit haematoma
      expansion in randomised controlled clinical trials; however, future clinical use of this
      agent may be limited by a short therapeutic time window, contraindication in patients at risk
      of thromboembolism and high cost. Currently, no acute medical therapies have been shown to
      alter outcome in ICH and the role of surgery remains uncertain.

      Blood pressure (BP) levels are strongly and positively associated with the incidence of first
      and recurrent stroke and there is definite evidence that BP lowering reduces stroke risk.
      Although BP levels are commonly elevated after stroke onset, particularly in ICH, the effects
      of BP lowering treatment in the acute phase of stroke remain unknown.

      The study aims to establish the effectiveness of a management policy of early intensive BP
      lowering on death & disability in patients with primary ICH compared to current
      guideline-based management of high BP in the clinical setting.
