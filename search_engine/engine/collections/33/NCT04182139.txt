      preventing injuries by increasing performance and increasing joint flexibility. Kubo et al.
      suggest that the potential mechanism of decreased risk of injury with increased flexibility
      is a change in the viscoelastic properties of the muscle-tendon unit. Muscle fibers and
      tendons contain proprioceptors. These receptors provide information about joint angle, muscle
      length and muscle tension. There are two stretch-related proprioceptors that transmit
      information to the central nervous system about muscle tension. These receptors are muscle
      spindles (respond to changes in the length) and golgi tendon organs (respond to changes in
      the tension). For this reason, interactions between muscle tension, muscle-tendon unit,
      viscoelasticity and proprioceptive tissue (muscle spindles and golgi tendon organ); it
      becomes important when you think about how stretching exercises affect proprioception,
      flexibility and increase or decrease of joint range of motion. In the literature, four
      stretching parameters have been defined as important to influence the potential for
      increasing or decreasing the flexibility of a joint: intensity, duration, frequency and
      stretching position. The focus of this study we plan on is the intensity and duration of
      stretching.

      Exercise warming exercises before sportive activity and cooling exercises afterwards are
      widely suggested and applied. Determining the relationship between stretch severity and
      duration and viscoelastic properties and proprioception will contribute to the effective
      creation of training programs.
