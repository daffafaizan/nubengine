    
      Subjects with mild to moderate hyperkalemia (i-STAT potassium levels between 5.0-6.5 mmol/l,
      inclusive) will be randomized 1:1 in a double-blind fashion to receive placebo or SPS (15g),
      administered tid with meals for 48 hours. Subjects will come back to the clinic on Study Day
      9 for an End of Study (EOS) visit. Adverse experiences will be recorded.

      Blood potassium levels will be evaluated by both i-STAT and the Local Laboratory prior to the
      first dose on Study Days 1 and 2, 1, 2, and 4 hours after the first dose on Study Day 1, 1
      and 4 hours after the first dose on Study Day 2 and prior to breakfast on Study Day 3, after
      48 hours of treatment.

      Subjects who have i-STAT potassium levels > 6.5 mmol/l on Study Day 1 at the 4 hour post Dose
      1 time point will be withdrawn from the study and will receive standard of care. If the
      i-STAT potassium value is between 6.1 and 6.5 mmol/l at the 4-hour post Dose 1 draw, subjects
      will be kept in the clinic for another 90 minutes post Dose 2 and another blood draw will be
      taken and an ECG will be performed. If the i-STAT potassium level is â‰¥ 6.2 mmol/l at this
      time point, the subject will be discontinued from the study and standard of care will be
      instituted. If the i-STAT potassium level is < 6.2 mmol/l, and the ECG does not show any of
      the ECG withdrawal criteria (see below), the subject will continue in the study.
