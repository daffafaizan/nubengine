      cytokines by spleen lymphocytes and up-regulate regulatory T cells, thereby inhibiting the
      secretion of interferon-γ(IFN-γ) induced by lymphocytes and Tumor Necrosis Factor(TNF)
      induced by macrophage.

      Animal models and preclinical studies have shown that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were
      implanted into inflammatory lung tissues after infusion, which significantly improved the
      clinical manifestations and histopathological lesions caused by acute lung injury.
      Mesenchymal stem cells inhibited the effects of interleukin-1 (IL-1) through regulatory T
      cells (CD4 + CD25 + FOXP3 + Treg cells) and by antagonizing the expression interleukin-1
      receptor (IL1-RA). Mesenchymal stem cells significantly down-regulated pro-inflammatory
      factors by inhibiting the expression of IL-1, TNF and IFN-γ in lung tissue, and up-regulated
      anti-inflammatory factor by enhancing the expression of IL -10 and regulatory T cells,
      respectively, thereby dampening the inflammatory response.
