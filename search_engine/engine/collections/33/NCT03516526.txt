      concentrations, will not result in radiological or clinical disease activity in completely
      stable RRMS patients treated with natalizumab. Adult patients with RRMS with no evident
      disease activity during the last 12 months of natalizumab infusions with a minimum treatment
      of 12 months wil be included. Before subsequent natalizumab infusions, serum concentrations
      will be evaluated. If the concentration exceeds 15Î¼g/ml the dose interval will be extended
      with a week to a maximum of eight weeks. Patients will get regular brain MRI scans and
      clinical follow-up.
