      advocate the use of combination chemotherapy with a platinum-based chemotherapy combined with
      etoposide. No other regimen has consistently shown a benefit over this combination. NECs do
      not respond to treatments usually applied in other neuroendocrine tumours such as
      somatostatin analogues and interferon. In contrast to metastatic neuroendocrine tumours with
      a low Ki67, debulking surgery and surgery for liver metastasis is generally not recommended.
      Cisplatin /carboplatin and etoposide is established as standard treatment of advanced disease
      based on two small retrospective studies showing a response rate between 41- 67% and median
      survival of 15-19 months. In the current trial we propose an alternative treatment for a
      subgroup of patients with GEP-NEC based on new data, with the intention to improve response
      rates and clinical benefit rate without increasing toxicity
