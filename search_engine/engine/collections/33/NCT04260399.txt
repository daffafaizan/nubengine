      invited to participate. Patients who consent to participate will be asked to complete
      pre-procedure questionnaires including an assessment of their level of procedural anxiety.
      Subsequently, patients will be randomized to receive either lavender aromatherapy or saline
      aromatherapy (placebo) during their procedure. Post-procedural levels of anxiety will then be
      assessed. Changes between pre- and post-procedural anxiety will be compared between the
      treatment and placebo control groups.
