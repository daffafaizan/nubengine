      specimens from HIV-infected pediatric patients previously enrolled on NCI protocol 88-C-0219,
      a phase I/II study of 2', 3'-dideoxyinosine (ddI). In the original study serum p24 antigen
      was used as the direct measurement of viral quantitation. Advances in understanding of HIV
      pathophysiology have demonstrated that HIV-1 RNA level as measured by quantitative RNA PCR is
      a far superior molecular tool for assessing viral replication and burden in vivo. Analysis of
      clinical, HIV-1 RNA and CD4 responses will be performed to identify patients with discordant
      surrogate marker responses to therapy, defined as: improvement in immunologic parameters in
      the setting of virologic non-response or failure. Correlation will then be made with short
      and long term clinical outcomes.

      Following the initial analysis to identify patients with discordant responses, selenium
      levels, viral genotypic and phenotypic profiles of resistance to ddI, and in vitro viral
      fitness will be examined. These biologic parameters have recently been determined to
      potentially play an important role in clinical, immunologic and virologic HIV-related
      outcomes. Parameters will be examined in subsets of patients with the following surrogate
      marker response profiles: a.) immunologic and virologic responders; b.) immunologic and
      virologic non-responders; and c.) discordant immunologic and virologic responders. Specimens
      from the ddI monotherapy study were chosen for this analysis because a substantial body of
      clinical and immunologic data is available on patients up to 7 years.
