      (COPD) and 80 healthy volunteers. Laser doppler examination will be adopted to assess the
      microcirculatory characteristics of meridian phenomenon for Heart and Lung meridians in the
      physiology/pathological state. Moreover, the site specificity for the meridian-visceral
      association and surface-surface association between the Heart and Lung meridians will be
      investigated.Primary outcomes will be blood flow curve and blood perfusion
      units(PU).Furthermore, this study will build standardized techniques and schemes for
      detecting the microcirculatory characteristics of meridian phenomenon for Heart and Lung
      meridians. The results of this study could also provide scientific foundation for traditional
      meridian theories.
