      many years. Recent research indicates that stress has a strong negative impact on pregnancy
      rates in women undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF). In addition, stress is the most
      common reason given by women who voluntarily terminate treatment.

      In a recent study, women who participated in a group mind/body treatment program had higher
      pregnancy rates than control subjects. The impact of an online stress management program has
      never been studied in the infertile population. An online intervention would be far more
      accessible for many infertility patients.
