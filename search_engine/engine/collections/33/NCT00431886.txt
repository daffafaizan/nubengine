      criteria were myocardial infarction (MI) with ST elevation, unstable vital sign, uncontrolled
      arrhythmia, renal dysfunction, hypersensitivity to contrast media and pregnancy. Patients
      were allocated into 3 categories based on history, physical exam, and electrocardiogram: 1)
      definite angina with uncertainty of regarding MI (high risk), 2) probable angina
      (intermediate risk), 3) low likelihood of angina (low risk), and then randomized to either
      receive MDCT immediately (MDCT group), or not (control). We compared diagnostic accuracy,
      length of stay in ER, admission rate, and major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and clinical
      diagnosis in 1 month after discharge from ED.
