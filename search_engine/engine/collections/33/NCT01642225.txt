      Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) infusion is one of several novel approaches to decrease
      antibody levels for highly sensitized kidney transplant candidates [1, 2]. This approach can
      potentially give a chance of kidney transplantation to end-stage renal failure patients who
      could never receive transplantation because of high levels of antibodies and persistent
      positive crossmatches to all potential kidney donors. Many transplant centers have used this
      strategy in order to increase transplant rates of highly sensitized patients with various
      levels of anti-HLA antibodies. However, the responses to the treatment seem to be different
      in each patient and factors affecting treatment outcome have yet to be determined.
