      vaccine treatment or saline placebo in a 4:1 ratio, such that each cohort will include 20
      subjects who receive active vaccine (Groups A, B, C, D, F and G) and 5 subjects who receive
      placebo (Group E).

      Subjects will be followed for all AEs, including SAEs and non-serious AEs, from the time of
      each vaccination through 30 days following the second vaccination (Day 60Â±5). After Day 60,
      subjects will be contacted via telephone on a monthly basis (approximately Days 90, 120, 150,
      180, and 210) and asked about the occurrence of SAEs and SNMCs.
