      the study groups: IMRT or PBT. Randomization means that you are put into a group by chance,
      like flipping a coin. Neither you nor the research doctor will choose which group you will be
      in. You will have an equal chance of being placed in either group. Randomization makes the
      study better from a scientific point of view because it helps ensure that patients receiving
      IMRT and proton therapy are similar. You will be receiving only one type of radiation, either
      IMRT or PBT throughout your participation in the study.

      Before you begin radiation therapy you will have a pelvic CT scan in order to design your
      radiation treatment. Doctors will use information gathered from these scans to plan the best
      way to deliver radiation to your tumor.

      Both types of radiation therapy will be given once a day for 5 days (no weekends or holidays)
      for up to 9 weeks. Both IMRT and PBT will require that you lie on a table for less than 15
      minutes to obtain your treatment.

      During each visit you will be asked questions about your general health and specific
      questions about any problems that you might be having and any medications you might be
      taking. You will also undergo a physical exam and complete some quality of life
      questionnaires.

      After your radiation therapy you will have follow up visits at 3,6,9,12,18,24,36,48 and 60
      months.
