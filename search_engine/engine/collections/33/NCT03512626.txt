    
      PURPOSE: To present the outcomes of hybrid multifocal and monofocal intraocular lenses (IOL)

      SETTING: Parc de Salut Mar, Universidad Pompeu-Fabra - Autónoma, Barcelona, Spain.

      DESIGN: Prospective clinical trial.

      METHODS: Consecutive patients with bilateral cataract were included. Phacoemulsification with
      randomized implantation of either a monofocal IOL (AR40e, AMO-Abbot 30 Laboratories Inc.
      Abbot Park, Illinois, USA) or multifocal IOL (OptiVis™, Aaren Scientific, Inc, Ontario, CA,
      USA) was performed by the same surgeon and under the same conditions. Over a 3-month
      follow-up, the main outcome measures were uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA),
      corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA), uncorrected intermediate visual acuity at 60 cm
      (UIVA), distance-corrected intermediate visual acuity (DCIVA), uncorrected near visual acuity
      at 33 cm (UNVA), distance-corrected near visual acuity (DCNVA), spherical equivalent (SE),
      contrast sensitivity (CS), presence of dysphotopsia, use of spectacles and patient
      satisfaction with the test VF-14 (Visual Function Index) .
