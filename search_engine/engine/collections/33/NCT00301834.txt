      Primary

        -  Determine the engraftment rate with reduced toxicity ablative conditioning regimen
           comprising alemtuzumab, fludarabine, and busulfan followed by allogeneic stem cell
           transplantation in pediatric patients with stem cell defects, marrow failure syndromes,
           hemoglobinopathy, severe immunodeficiency syndromes (nonsevere combined immunodeficiency
           disorders), myelodysplastic syndromes, or myeloid leukemia.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the acute reactions, incidence of infections, and rate of immune
           reconstitution in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

        -  Conditioning regimen: Patients receive alemtuzumab IV over 6 hours on days -12 to -10,
           high-dose busulfan IV over 2 hours 4 times daily on days -9 to -6, and fludarabine IV
           over 30 minutes on days -5 to -2.

        -  Allogeneic stem cell transplantation: Two days after the completion of conditioning
           regimen, patients undergo allogeneic bone marrow, peripheral blood stem cell, or
           umbilical cord blood transplantation on day 0. Patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF)
           subcutaneously beginning on day 5 and continuing until blood counts recover.

        -  Graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis:

             -  Most transplantations (bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell transplantation):
                Patients receive cyclosporine IV continuously beginning on day -1 until at least
                day 50 followed by a taper at either 2 months, 9 months, or 1 year in the absence
                of GVHD. Patients also receive methotrexate on days 1, 3, and 6.

             -  Umbilical cord blood transplantation: Patients receive cyclosporine as in most
                transplantations, and methylprednisolone IV twice daily on days 0-21 followed by a
                weekly taper.

      After transplantation, patients are followed periodically for up to 20 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 35 patients will be accrued for this study.
