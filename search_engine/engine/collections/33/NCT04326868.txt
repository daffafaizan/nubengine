    
      A Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial (RCT) cohort study, to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of three benzimidazole derivates drug (Albendazole, Mebendazole, Albendazole
      Mebendazole, and Albendazole-Pyrantel) to treat major STH in school aged children from
      Lambaréné and surroundings. After obtaining informed consent from parents or guardians, stool
      samples will be collected, for infectious status. If positive the participant will be treated
      with either drug combination. The efficacy and SNP frequencies will be assessed at weeks 3
      and 6 post treatment

      Description of study population Children of school and preschool age (2 to 17 years old)
      living in Lambaréné and the surrounding areas are eligible. The choice of school and
      preschool-aged children is based on the fact that they constitute the main population at risk
      of infection. In addition, most of the resources available for public health interventions in
      many endemic areas of soil-transmitted helminths target this group as a cost-effective method
      for reaching a large part of the population.

      The previous analysis of patient cohort reported a success rate of 61% multispecies
      prevalence amongst children in the study area and considering a significance level of 95%
      confidence interval (α =5%) and a minimum power of 80%, the investigators will have to
      include a total of 255 participants in the study
