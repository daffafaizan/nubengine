      phase (3 months dose could be increased based on the presence of hypoglycemia during OGTT).
      After completing Month 3, patients were switched to pasireotide LAR for 3 months (up to Month
      6). The core phase of the study was completed at the end of Month 6. Patients were allowed to
      enter the 6 month extension phase if they experienced benefit with pasireotide LAR treatment.
