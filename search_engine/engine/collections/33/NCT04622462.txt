      risk assessment for progression to cancer is dysplasia grading by histopathology. With
      significant overlap between dysplasia grades and high inter- and intra-observer variations,
      dysplasia grading alone has been shown to be inadequate as a prognostic tool. To investigate
      the utility of the S100A7 immunohistochemistry signature-based assessment - STRATICYTE - in
      the early diagnosis of invasive oral cancer, a prospective multi-center observational study
      was designed with specimens obtained from community-based practices.

      Methods: Patients that qualify to enroll in the study will be assessed for both standard of
      care histopathological assessment for dysplasia grade and STRATICYTE risk assessment, and
      followed for up to 60 months (from initial biopsy) to determine the outcome of their oral
      lesion(s).
