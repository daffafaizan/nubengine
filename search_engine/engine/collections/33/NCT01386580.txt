    
      This is a Phase I/IIa, multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation study. The study will be
      conducted in 6 phases: "2B3-101 single agent dose-escalation phase", "a 2B3-101 with
      trastuzumab dose-escalation phase", "a Breast cancer brain metastases study-expansion
      phase","a Recurrent malignant glioma study-expansion phase", "a Melanoma brain metastases
      study- expansion phase" and "SCLC brain metastases study-expansion phase"

      2B3-101 single agent dose-escalation phase.

      In the 2B3-101 single Agent dose-escalation phase, female and male patients with solid tumors
      and brain metastases or recurrent malignant glioma will be enrolled. Patients will be
      assigned to a dose level cohort. - The starting dose will be 5 mg/m2, which is equal to 1/10
      of the human equivalent dose of the LD10 of 2B3-101 in rats. A "3+3" dose-escalation design
      will be used. The study will investigate sequential cohorts consisting of 3-6 patients to be
      enrolled and treated at the applicable dose level. Planned dose levels for subsequent cohorts
      are 10, 20, 30, mg/m2 and steps of 10 mg/m2 thereafter. For more information on the dose
      escalation design and the increments, please see the dose escalation criteria section.

      There will be no intra-patient dose escalation. Each treatment cycle consists of 21 days.
      Patients will receive a single IV dose of 2B3-101 on day 1 of each cycle. In order to
      minimize the risk of infusion reactions 5% of the total dose of 2B3-101 (in mg) should be
      infused slowly over the first 30 minutes. If tolerated, the infusion may then be completed
      over the next hour for a total infusion time of 90 minutes. Blood samples will be taken on
      day 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 and 11 of cycle 1 and day 1, 8 and 15 of cycle 2 to assess the PK profile
      during the first 2 cycles. The dose limiting toxicity (DLT) observation period for each dose
      level will be cycle 1 (day 1 to day 21). Patients who do not complete the DLT observation
      period (cycle 1) for other reasons than a DLT will be replaced.

      Once the MTD of 2B3-101 as single agent has been determined, the study will continue to the
      breast cancer brain metastases and recurrent malignant glioma dose expansion phases.

      2B3-101 in combination with trastuzumab dose-escalation phase

      In the 2B3-101 in combination with trastuzumab dose escalation phase, only patients with
      HER2+ breast cancer and brain metastases will be enrolled.

      The patients will be assigned to a 2B3-101 dose level cohort. - The starting dose of 2B3-101
      will be 40 mg/m2 every 3 weeks. This dose has been selected based upon safety information
      from patients treated with 2B3-101 at this dose level, as well as upon previous treatment
      with PEGylated liposomal doxorubicin in combinations trastuzumab (Chia et al 2006).

      The dose-escalation will be conducted in steps of 10 mg/m2 up to the MTD level determined for
      2B3-101 as single agent. The trastuzumab dose will remain fixed to a loading dose of 8 mg/kg
      at day 1 and 6 mg/kg every 3 weeks at the subsequent cycles throughout the determination of
      the MTD. Enrolment of HER2+ patients breast cancer patients in the "2B3-101 in combination
      with trastuzumab dose-escalation" phase of the study will be allowed in parallel with the
      determination of the MTD of 2B3-101 as single agent. A "3+3" dose-escalation design will be
      used. Thus, the study will investigate sequential cohorts of 3-6 patients, who will be
      enrolled and treated at the applicable dose levels.

      No intra-patient dose-escalation will be allowed. Each treatment cycle consists of 21 days.
      All patients will receive a single IV dose of 2B3-101 on day 1 of each cycle. In order to
      minimize the risk of infusion reactions 5% of the total dose of 2B3-101 (in mg) should be
      infused slowly over the first 30 minutes. As long as 2B3-101 is well tolerated, the remaining
      95% of the infusion could thereafter be administered over the next 60 min, resulting in a
      total infusion time of 90 minutes. The infusion of trastuzumab will then follow 30 minutes
      after the completion of the 2B3-101 infusion. Blood samples will be taken on day 1, 2, 3, 5,
      8 and 11 of cycle 1, on day 1, 8 and 15 of cycle 2 and if applicable on day 1 of cycle 3 and
      day 1 of cycle 4 to assess the PK profile of 2B3-101 during the first 4 cycles. The dose
      limiting toxicity (DLT) observation period will be cycle 1 (day 1 to day 21) at each
      individual dose level. Patients who do not complete the DLT observation period (cycle 1) for
      other reasons than a DLT will be replaced.

      Breast cancer brain metastases expansion phase.

      In the breast cancer brain metastases expansion phase, each treatment cycle consists of 21
      days. Patients will receive a single IV dose of 2B3-101 on day 1 of each cycle. In order to
      minimize the risk of infusion reactions 5% of the total dose of 2B3-101 (in mg) should be
      infused slowly over the first 30 minutes. If tolerated, the infusion may then be completed
      over the next hour for a total infusion time of 90 minutes. Blood samples will be taken on
      day 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 and 11 of cycle 1 on day 1, 8 and 15 of cycle 2 and if applicable on day 1
      of cycle 3 and on day 1 of cycle 4 to assess the PK profile during the first 4 cycles.

      Recurrent malignant glioma expansion phase.

      In the recurrent malignant glioma expansion phase, each treatment cycle is 28 days long.
      Patients will receive a single IV dose of 2B3-101 on day 1 of each cycle. In order to
      minimize the risk of infusion reactions 5% of the total dose of 2B3-101 (in mg) should be
      infused slowly over the first 30 minutes. If tolerated, the infusion may then be completed
      over the next hour for a total infusion time of 90 minutes. Blood samples will be taken on
      day 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 and 11 of cycle 1, day 1, 8 and 15 of cycle 2 and if applicable on day 1 of
      cycle 3 and on day 1 of cycle 4 to assess the PK profile during the first 4 cycles.

      SCLC brain metastases study arm of the expansion phase

      In the SCLC brain metastases study arm of the expansion phase, each treatment cycle is 21
      days long. Patients will receive a single IV dose of 2B3-101 at MTD determined for 2B3-101 as
      single agent on day 1 of each cycle. In order to minimize the risk of infusion reactions 5%
      of the total dose (in mg) should be infused slowly over the first 30 minutes. As long as
      2B3-101 is well tolerated, the remaining 95% of the infusion could thereafter be administered
      over the next 60 minutes, resulting in a total infusion time of 90 minutes. Blood samples
      will be taken on day 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 and 11 of cycle 1, day 1, 8 and 15 of cycle 2 and if
      applicable on day 1 of cycle 3 and on day 1 of cycle 4 to assess the PK profile during the
      first 4 cycles.

      Melanoma brain metastases study arm of the expansion phase

      In the melanoma brain metastases study arm of the expansion phase, each treatment cycle is 21
      days long. Patients will receive a single IV dose of 2B3-101 at MTD determined for 2B3-101 as
      single agent in the dose escalation phase on day 1 of each cycle. In order to minimize the
      risk of infusion reactions 5% of the total dose (in mg) should be infused slowly over the
      first 30 minutes. As long as 2B3-101 is well tolerated, the remaining 95% of the infusion
      could thereafter be administered over the next 60 minutes, resulting in a total infusion time
      of 90 minutes. Blood samples will be taken on day 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 and 11 of cycle 1, day 1, 8
      and 15 of cycle 2 and if applicable on day 1 of cycle 3 and on day 1 of cycle 4 to assess the
      PK profile during the first 4 cycles.

      For all stages a patient will stay on treatment until disease progression, unacceptable
      toxicity, or discontinuation for any other reason.
