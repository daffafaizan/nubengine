      for a few years on the regulation of the inhibitors of the HMG CoA reductase (statins). These
      drugs initially address to the quantitative anomalies Lipoproteins of low density (LDL
      cholesterol). The objectives laid down by the national recommendations (obtaining a plasmatic
      rate < 1gr/l in coronary secondary prevention or among patients at the high vascular risk) or
      international, implies their broad regulation with the waning of the coronary syndromes. It
      can exist in addition among many patients of the qualitative or quantitative anomalies of the
      Lipoproteins of High density (HDL-c) whose correlation to the coronary risk was beforehand
      largely shown. The anomalies of HDL-c are not very sensitive to the hygieno-dietetic rules.

      To intervene on the plasmatic levels of the lipoproteins is thus essential with the
      improvement of the forecast of the proven coronary patients.

      The investigators know since the beginning of the years 1980 (work of Furchgott and Moncada)
      that the endothelium is a powerful integrator of the vascular risk, in particular in its
      aspect of regulation vasomotrice.

      Methods of investigation of the endothelium were developed on the coronary floor or the level
      of the peripheral arteries to analyze the vasomotricity endothelial dependent. Among these
      methods the study of the vasomotricity on the level humÃ©ral is validated, largely used and
      correlated in many tests with the forecast of the patients presenting a high vascular risk.
