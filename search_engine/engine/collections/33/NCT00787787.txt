      I. To determine the progression-free survival of patients with unresectable or metastatic
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated with sunitinib and capecitabine.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the overall survival, response rate by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
      Tumors (RESIST) criteria, alpha fetoprotein (AFP) response, survival at one year, and safety
      and tolerability.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive sunitinib malate orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21 and capecitabine
      PO twice daily (BID) on days 1-14. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence or disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for up to 2
      years.
