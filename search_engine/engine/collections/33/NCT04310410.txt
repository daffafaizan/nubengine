      functioning of patients with advanced cancer. Pain palliation may be improved by including
      magnetic resonance image guided high intensity focused ultrasound (MR-HIFU) in addition to
      External Beam Radiotherapy (EBRT). For this purpose, feasibility and optimal logistics of the
      combined treatment need to be evaluated.

      Objective: The PRE-FURTHER project aims to evaluate the feasibility of the combined EBRT and
      MR-HIFU treatment for relief of metastatic bone pain, and to optimize the combined treatment
      logistics.

      Study design: The PRE-FURTHER study is a prospective case series, stage I and IIA study
      according to the Innovation, Development, Evaluation, Assessment and Long term evaluation
      (IDEAL) recommendations. 6-10 patients will receive MR-HIFU treatment following standard
      EBRT.

      Endpoints: The main outcome of this study is the feasibility of the procedure, in terms of
      planability as well as patient-tolerability of the combined treatment within a short time
      frame (3 hours - 4 days interval). In addition, pain relief and safety of the combined
      procedure will be monitored.
