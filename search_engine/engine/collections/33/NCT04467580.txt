      [18F]FDG for activated inflammatory cells.

      [18F]FDG PET/CTperformed on latest digital PET/CT cameras and recordings focused on the
      abdomen could help quantify intestinal inflammation in patients with abnormal entero-MRI, and
      differentiate inflammation and fibrosis on a joint PET/CT and MRI , in patients with
      complicated Crohn Disease intestinal stenosis.

      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) indices are used to assess the upgradability and activity of
      CD and try to predict response to treatment, in particular Nancy's MRI score for digestive
      inflammation.

      An inflammation index (FILM-i) and a fibrosis index (FILM-f), based on this MRI/PET analysis,
      will be developed and validated to develop personalized medicine in patients with stenosing
      CD. Indeed, these indices will guide the therapeutic choice, in particular for the
      biotherapies prescription or the need to operate these patients.
