           therapy for breast cancer. Participants will receive chemotherapy with paclitaxel every
           week for 12 weeks. They will begin to receive trastuzumab at the same time they begin
           paclitaxel. Once they have completed the 12 weeks of paclitaxel and trastuzumab, they
           will receive trastuzumab every 3 weeks or weekly for 40 weeks.

        -  Participants will be followed with routine assessments such as physical exam and vital
           signs every 3 months for the first year, and then every 6 months for years 2-5. Then we
           would like to keep track of the participants medical condition by calling them on the
           telephone once per year.
