    
      In Phase I, the study will follow a "3+3" design to determine the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) of EF-009 implanted surgically in patients with pancreatic cancer. The MTD is defined
      as one dose level (cohort) below the dose in which dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) were
      observed in â‰¥ 33% of the participants.

      Phase IIa is a single arm study with up to 12 subjects in order to test the hypothesis that
      the MTD of EF-009 will increase the overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS)
      in patients with borderline resectable and unresectable pancreatic cancer. The number of
      EF-009 implanted will be based on the MTD dose determined in the Phase I portion of the
      study.

      In both the Phase I and Phase IIa portions of the study, subjects will be evaluated for
      response every 8 weeks after EF-009 wafer implantation for up to 2 years, by CT, PET/CT or
      MRI (per treating investigator's discretion) using the same method as at baseline. Tumor
      measurements will be assessed based on the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
      guidelines version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1). The total study duration for each subject consists of
      screening, treatment, and extended follow-up period and survival follow-up period.
