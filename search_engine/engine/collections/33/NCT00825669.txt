      is not agreeable. Part of the patients may present portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT) after
      resection. PVTT might further increase the pressure of portal vein and lead to upper
      gastrointestinal bleeding and worsening of hypersplenism which will endanger the life of the
      patients. PVTT also plays the centre role of recurrence and metastasis of HCC. There is no
      standard treatment available now for PVTT yet. TACE is mostly often used to treat the PVTT.
      We aim to compare the effects of TACE and TACE plus laser ablation for treating patients with
      PVTT.
