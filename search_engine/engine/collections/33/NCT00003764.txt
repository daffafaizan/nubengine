        -  Compare the efficacy of fludarabine with or without cyclophosphamide in terms of
           complete remission rate and overall survival in patients with previously untreated B
           cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).

        -  Compare the toxicities of these 2 regimens in this patient population.

        -  Determine whether the expression of proteins specifically implicated in the regulation
           of DNA damage induced apoptosis of lymphoid cells (i.e., p53; mdm2; GST; Bcl-2; Mcl-1;
           Bax; p27; and caspase-3) correlates with response to chemotherapy in these patients.

        -  Determine whether there is a relationship between clinical response or resistance and
           differential expression of genes in the CLL cells either at initiation of therapy or
           following relapse and progression.

        -  Correlate mutations in immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region genes with clinical
           response or resistance in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to stage
      of disease (O-II vs III-IV). Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive fludarabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1-5.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive fludarabine as in arm I plus cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on
           day 1.

      Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months until disease
      progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 280 patients will be accrued for this study over 2 to 2.5
      years.
