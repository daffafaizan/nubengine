           for radiation treatment. Doctors will use the information gathered from these scans to
           plan the best way to deliver radiation to the tumor.

        -  Participants will receive treatment as an outpatient at the Francis H. Burr Proton
           Center located at the Massachusetts General Hospital.

        -  Not everyone who participates in this study will receive the same amount of proton
           radiation therapy. The length of time and amount of radiation that the participant will
           receive will depend on the type of germ cell tumor they have and the stage of the their
           disease.

        -  Radiation treatment will be given once a day, 5 days a week (Monday-Friday), for 4-8
           weeks depending on the condition of the participant's disease.

        -  During each week of proton radiation therapy, participants will have a physical exam and
           be asked questions about their general health and any problems they might be
           experiencing.
