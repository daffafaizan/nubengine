    
      Approximately 120 subjects will be randomized to receive either enteric-coated (EC)
      LYC-30937-EC 25 mg PO once daily (QD) or matching placebo PO QD for the duration of 8 weeks.
      Randomization will be stratified based on previous exposure to anti-tumor necrosis factor
      (TNF) agents such that at least 50% of the randomized subjects will be anti-TNF na√Øve .

      The study will consist of 3 phases:

        -  screening phase: up to 4 weeks

        -  double-blind placebo-controlled phase treatment: 8 weeks

        -  post-treatment follow-up: 2 weeks

      Eligible subjects will be randomized at Week 0 (Study Day 1) to either LYC-30937-EC 25 mg or
      placebo. Screening will occur from Study Days -28 to -1. Randomization and first dosing will
      occur at Week 0/Study Day 1. Double-blind study visits will occur at Weeks 2, 4, and 8, with
      the last dose at Week 8/Study Day 57. Subjects will return at Week 10 for a post-treatment
      safety follow-up visit.
