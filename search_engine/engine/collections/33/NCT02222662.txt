      control groups begin treatment five months after the treatment groups begin.

      All children will be tested on three occasions in the first year: prior to beginning
      treatment, and five and twelve months later. Results will be shared with parents at the end
      of each year. Testers will remain blinded as to which group is currently receiving treatment.

      There is no cost to parents for participation in this research study. Families meeting the
      eligibility criteria will be accepted into the study on a first-come, first-served basis.
