      carry the OPMD mutation. Subjects fulfilling the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be
      enrolled and followed prospectively at regular intervals to determine the natural history of
      this disease. Measures of muscle function and swallowing will be made at baseline and at
      follow-up visits to measure natural clinical progression.
