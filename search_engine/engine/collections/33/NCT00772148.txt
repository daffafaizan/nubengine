      transplant patients to demonstrate the pharmacokinetics and safety of once-daily treatment of
      LCP-Tacro tablets and twice-daily Prograf capsules in the first 2 weeks after live
      transplantation. The study also compared the efficacy and safety of LCP-Tacro and Prograf
      over an additional 50 weeks after liver transplantation. Eligible patients were randomized
      (1:1 ratio) within 72 hours after transplantation (graft reperfusion) to receive either: 1)
      LCP-Tacr tablets orally once daily (QD) in the morning, with an interval of 24 +/- 1 hours
      between dosed, starting at 0.07 to 0.11 mg/kg (the starting daily dose for African-American
      patients was 0.09 to 0.13 mg/kg), or 2) Prograf capsules in 2 equally divided morning and
      evening doses, starting at 0.10 to 0.15 mg. Subsequent doses of study medications were to be
      adjusted by the investigator according to local practice to maintain a target whole blood
      tacrolimus trough level of 5 to 20 ng/mL thought Day 14. Twenty-four-hour pharmacokinetic
      assessments were performed on Days 1, 7 and 14; additionally whole blood tacrolimus trough
      levels for statistical analysis were measured on Days 2, 3, 4, 7, 10, 12, 12, 42, 90, 120,
      180, 270, and 360. Physicians could also perform tacrolimus trough levels at other times at
      their discretion. On Day 360, the patients were placed on maintenance immunosuppressive
      regimen determined by their treating physician. Following completion of the third and final
      pharmacokinetic assessment on Day 14, patients entered the maintenance phase (Days 15 to 360)
      of study and remained on their assigned study medication until Day 360. Visits for safety
      assessments and tacrolimus trough levels during the maintenance phase were on Days 42, 90,
      120, 180, 270 and 360.

      Immunosuppressive therapy after the conclusion of the study was to be administered at the
      discretion of the patient's population.
