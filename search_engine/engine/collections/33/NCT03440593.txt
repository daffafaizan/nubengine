      parenteral nutrition will be randomly allocated to one of the aforementioned groups.
      Demographic information, parameters obtained from the ventilator, muscle measurements through
      ultrasonography, and clinical information, such as time spent on the mechanical ventilation,
      time spent in ICU and in the hospital will be collected. Participants will enroll in the
      study upon admission to the ICU until one of the following occurs-patient is extubated,
      discharged from the ICU, or death with a maximum of 14 days of ICU admission. Upon inclusion,
      IC will be assessed at baseline in all patients and then twice weekly. Bedside
      ultrasonography of the diaphragm and quadricep muscle thickness will be performed upon
      enrollment of the study (within 3 days of MV and within 1 day of study enrollment) and
      repeated every 3-5 days with a minimum of twice weekly while on the MV. Severity of illness
      score (APACHE IV), cause of sepsis, ventilator data, such as average tidal volumes and
      plateau pressures, cumulative and equivalent doses of sedatives (propofol, midazolam,
      lorazepam) and analgesics (fentanyl, hydromorphone) will be collected. Presence of delirium
      during ventilation, based on ICU-CAM scores will be included, as well.
