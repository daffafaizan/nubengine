      The health impact of disordered breathing during sleep among middle-aged and older men and
      women in the general population had not been well studied, and the need for treating
      relatively mild degrees of sleep-disordered breathing was unknown in 1994. The study was the
      first population study which examined the effect of sleep-disordered breathing on these
      health outcomes. The study sought to establish the prevalence of clinically important
      sleep-disordered breathing among middle-aged and older men and women and to provide
      quantitative data to serve as the basis for selecting patients for screening and deciding
      which patients might benefit from therapeutic intervention.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      The study evaluated the hypothesis that clinically inapparent sleep-disordered breathing was
      associated with blood pressure elevation, impairment of health-related quality of life, and
      depression. The study used the Veterans Administration Normative Aging Study (NAS)
      population, which consisted of approximately 1,700 community-dwelling-men who returned for
      examination every three years. Respiratory function was assessed during sleep among these men
      and their wives using a validated method for home sleep monitoring. Blood pressure,
      health-related quality of life, and depression score were also assessed in the home. The
      potential associations of sleep-disordered breathing with hypertension, impaired
      health-related quality of life, and depression were evaluated, and the possibility that these
      relationships differed between men and women was examined.

      The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the "End Date" entered in
      the Protocol Registration and Results System (PRS) record.
