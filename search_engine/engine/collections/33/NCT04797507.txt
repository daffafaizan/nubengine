      squamous cell cancer(ESCC) patients progressed after 1st systematic treatment are treated
      with SHR-1210 and Anlotinib. SHR-1210 was given intravenously(200mg d1 Q2w), combined with
      Anlotinib orally, 12 mg d1-14 Q3w. The hypothesis: The objective response rate in SHR-1210
      combined with Anlotinib can reach 40% as second-line or above treatment of advanced or
      metastatic ESCC patients. The primary endpoint is objective response rate (ORR) and the
      secondary endpoint is disease control rate (DCR), overall survival (OS), progression-free
      survival (PFS), and safety of this regimen.
