      care unit (ICU). Blood loss contributes to anemia which is highly prevalent in the ICU and is
      associated with major adverse cardiovascular outcomes and death. Red blood cell (RBC)
      transfusions to correct anemia also have significant health risks.

      Using a stepped wedge cluster randomized trial design, the specific aim of the STRATUS study
      is to evaluate whether the routine use of small-volume blood collection tubes reduces RBC
      transfusion compared to standard-volume blood collection tubes in adult ICU patients.
