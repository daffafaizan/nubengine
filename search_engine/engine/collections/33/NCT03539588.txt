      electrical stimulation is more effective in decreasing pain and disability in individuals
      with sub-acute and chronic low back pain (LBP) than with trigger point dry needling alone.
      The investigators are using a within subjects randomized crossover study that will recruit 30
      active duty military personnel or beneficiaries from William Beaumont Army Medical Center and
      all associated clinics. The investigators hypothesize that individuals with LBP will exhibit
      larger improvements in pain and disability when receiving trigger point dry needling with
      intramuscular electrical stimulation than when receiving trigger point dry needling alone.
