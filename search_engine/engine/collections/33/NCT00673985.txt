      and effectiveness of the Edwards Lifesciences self-expanding stent system.

      Phase 1 consists of a prospective, multi-center, non-randomized study with a peri-procedure
      endpoint. Phase 2 consists of a prospective, multi-center, randomized study with a 30-day
      primary safety endpoint and a 6-month primary effectiveness endpoint.
