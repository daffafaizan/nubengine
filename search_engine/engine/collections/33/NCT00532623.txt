    
      This is an open-label, randomized, two-arm, parallel group phase II study. Eligible patients
      will be randomized to each of the two treatment regimens, one of which is gemcitabine and
      vinorelbine combination therapy (Group A) and the other is gemcitabine monotherapy followed
      by vinorelbine monotherapy (Group B). Patients In group A monotherapy will receive
      gemcitabine and vinorelbine in combination, while patients in group B will receive
      gemcitabine monotherapy until the evidence of disease progression followed by vinorelbine. A
      total of 82 patients will be enrolled in this study. Patients will be randomized after
      stratified according to the number of prior chemotherapy including adjuvant chemotherapy and
      visceral disease. No maximum number of cycles is pre-determined. Patients may continue on
      study therapy until documented treatment failure.

      Patients in group A who discontinue study therapy will proceed to the post-therapy follow-up
      phase of the study. Patients in group B who discontinue study therapy while treated with
      gemcitabine will proceed to receive vinorelbine on disease progression. Patients on
      vinorelbine who discontinue study therapy will proceed to the post-therapy follow-up phase of
      the study. Further treatment upon discontinuation of study therapy is at the discretion of
      the investigator.

      A two arm, open label phase II study without control is appropriate for exploring the
      efficacy of gemcitabine with concurrent or sequential vinorelbine in this patient population
      and for evaluating and characterizing toxicities of two treatment approaches, qualitatively
      and quantitatively. The purpose of randomization in this phase II study is to diminish the
      possible impact of selection bias on treatment outcome and thus on interpretation of efficacy
      and safety data.
