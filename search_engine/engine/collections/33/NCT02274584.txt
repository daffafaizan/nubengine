      disease. Innovative therapy is urgently needed. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-modified T
      cells have demonstrated unprecedented successes in treating even late stage cluster of
      differentiation antigen 19 (CD19) positive B cell malignancies. Besides CD19 lymphomas, many
      lymphomas are CD30 positive and therefore, CD30-CAR T cells may prove to be effective in
      treating such patients. We have developed several generations of CD30 CARs. Preclinical
      studies have demonstrated effective killing of CD30 target cells. In this study, two versions
      of CD30 CARs, both of which are 4th generation CARs with a self-withdrawal mechanism
      (FKBP-iCasp9), will be evaluated in CD30 lymphoma patients. The primary goal is safety
      assessment including cytokine storm response and any other adverse effects. In addition,
      tumor targeting and disease status after treatment will also be evaluated.
