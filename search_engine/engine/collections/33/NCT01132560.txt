    
      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To validate the prognostic utility of a new ductal breast carcinoma in situ (DCIS)
           genomic score and the Oncotype DX Recurrence Score® assay in tissue samples from
           patients with DCIS enrolled on clinical trial ECOG-E5194.

      OUTLINE: RNA extracted from archived tissue samples are analyzed for gene expression profile
      by Oncotype DX Recurrence Score® assay (a reverse transcriptase-PCR-based assay).
