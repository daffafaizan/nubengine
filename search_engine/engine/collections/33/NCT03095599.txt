      influenza viruses evolve continuously, which means that people can get infected multiple
      times throughout their lives. Therefore the components of seasonal influenza vaccines are
      reviewed frequently (currently biannually) and updated periodically to ensure continued
      effectiveness of the vaccines. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommended that influenza
      vaccines for use in the 2016-2017 northern hemisphere influenza season contain the following
      viruses:

        -  NYMC BX-35 reassortant of B/Brisbane/60/2008 (B)

        -  NYMC X-179A reassortant of A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)

        -  NYMC X-263B reassortant of H3/A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 (H3N2)

      Among circulating influenza B viruses, there were 2 distinct lineages. The
      B/Brisbane/60/2008-like viruses were from the influenza B/Victoria lineage and represented
      the predominant circulating influenza B virus. The preclinical evaluation was conducted with
      all 3 lots of seasonal vaccine used in the Phase 1 study.The Phase 1 study of the IVACFLU-S
      that was completed in March 2016 identified no safety concerns and demonstrated the vaccine
      to be highly immunogenic. Given the promising findings, the current study proposed to expand
      on the safety data of the vaccine, to confirm the immunological findings, and by including
      individuals up to age 60 to seek regulatory approval for indication in nonelderly adults
      based on the Vietnam MOH Guidance on Clinical Trial of Influenza Vaccine serological criteria
      for assessing seasonal influenza.

      Phase 2 was conducted at 1 site (District Health Center of Ben Luc, Long An, Vietnam).
      Subjects were from two age groups: 18-45 years and 46-60 years. Vaccine safety was determined
      by the Protocol Safety Review Team (PSRT) and approved by Vietnam Ministry of Health (MOH)
      before starting Phase 3.

      Phase 3 was conducted at 2 sites: District Health Center (DHC) of Ben Luc, Long An, Vietnam;
      and DHC of Long Thanh, Dong Nai. Subjects were from two age groups: 18-45 years and 46-60
      years. Both safety and immunogenicity were assessed.
