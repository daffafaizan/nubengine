    
      CAEB1102-300A is a multi-center randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of pegzilarginase in patients with ARG1-D. This study will
      consist of a screening period; a randomized, double-blind treatment period; a long-term
      extension; and a follow up visit for final safety assessments.

      Subjects will be randomized to treatment following completion of all screening assessments
      and confirmation of study eligibility in a 2:1 ratio to receive weekly IV infusions of
      pegzilarginase plus individualized disease management (IDM) or placebo plus IDM during the
      24-week double blind treatment period. After completion of the 24-week double-blind treatment
      period, each subject will enter the long term, open-label extension, the first 8 weeks of
      which are blinded. During the long-term extension, all subjects receive pegzilarginase plus
      IDM. After 8 weeks of the LTE study, patients have the option to receive treatment by
      subcutaneous administration (SC).
