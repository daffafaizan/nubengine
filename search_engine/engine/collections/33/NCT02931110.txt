    
      Part 1 of the study will evaluate the safety and pharmacology of a range of CBL0137 doses
      administered IV in participants with previously treated lymphomas, including diffuse large
      B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), follicular lymphoma (FL), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), Hodgkin
      lymphoma (HL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL), or multiple
      myeloma (MM). Cohorts of 3 to 6 subjects will be sequentially enrolled at progressively
      higher dose levels of CBL0137 using a standard 3+3 dose-escalation design. An additional 6
      participants may be accrued at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or at the recommended dose
      (RD) to confirm CBL0137 safety and pharmacology as a prelude to further clinical evaluation.

      Part 2 of the study provides cohort expansion to further explore the safety, pharmacology,
      and clinical activity of CBL0137 monotherapy in participants with specific previously treated
      hematological cancers, including DLBCL, FL, MCL, HL, CLL/SLL, acute lymphoblastic leukemia
      (ALL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and MM. Twelve evaluable participants with each disease
      type may be enrolled.
