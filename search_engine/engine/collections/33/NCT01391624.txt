      are components of cellular membranes, guaranteeing their fluidity and their functions of
      separating intracellular and extracellular means and transporting several substances to and
      from cellular microenvironment.

      Modern theories profess that lack of omega 3 fatty acids in western diets may be the cause of
      several deletery changes in neuronal physiology, which may cause or make worse several
      pathological conditions, such as depression, mood instability, and drug craving. The role of
      serotonin as the main lacking component in the conditions is well documented, and it is
      thought that omega 3 is important in the synthesis, transportation, and ultimately the
      activity of this neurotransmitter.

      Out theory states that supplementation with these acids can restore normal neuron balance,
      improving the condition of chocolate craving patients.
