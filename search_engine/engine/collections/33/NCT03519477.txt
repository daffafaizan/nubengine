      responsible for more re-admissions (23.5% at 30 days) in the United States than the 2nd and
      3rd leading causes combined. Inadequate medication reconciliation both on admission and
      discharge from the hospital is a significant cause of medical error. In one study of
      cardiovascular patients, 44% believed they were taking a medication they were not, and 96%
      were unable to recall at least one medication they were taking. In the same study patients
      omitted on average 6.8 medications from their medication list. Medication optimization
      through improved adherence and reconciled medical records has been postulated to
      significantly improve admission and 30-day hospital readmission rates.

      Sano has developed a blood-based comprehensive medication monitoring tool that identifies and
      quantitates 235 prescription drugs and drug metabolites. It does not detect illicit drugs.
      This tool, which produces an output report designated the 'Patient Medication Profile', is
      designed to be used with clinical decision support to improve medication adherence, reduce
      medication errors, and optimize medication therapy. For heart failure patients, the
      investigators hypothesize that deploying the Patient Medication Profile with clinical
      decision support at key points of treatment intervention will A) improve medication
      adherence, B) identify and reconcile significant discrepancies in the medication list, C)
      result in reduced hospital admissions, and D) result in better overall patient outcomes.
      These outcome expectations are relative to usual care for heart failure patients.
