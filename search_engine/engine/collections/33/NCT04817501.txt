      populations as liquid biopsy markers in tumors of the female reproductive system (breast
      cancer, endometrial cancer, and ovarian cancer).

      Phase I study:

      Determination of different populations of CTCs in blood and ascitic fluid (if any) prior to
      treatment.

      The main objectives of the study:

        1. To assess the presence and number of different CTC populations at different time points
           (before biopsy and before surgery) using multicolor flow cytometry.

        2. To assess the relationships between different CTCs populations prior to treatment
           initiation with the effects of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and the risks of recurrence and
           metastases.

        3. To assess the molecular profiles of different CTCs populations in the blood and in
           ascitic fluid.

      Additional research tasks:

      To compare the multicolor flow cytometry results with the data of ultrasound, CT and/or MRI,
      serum tumor markers, and immunohistochemical studies in patients with breast cancer,
      endometrial cancer, and ovarian cancer Methodology: Open-label, exploratory, single centre
      study. Blood and ascitic fluid collected from subjects (if available)
