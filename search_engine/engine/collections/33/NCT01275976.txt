      with complications, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiple organ
      dysfunction syndrome (MODS). The injury itself, but also the additional fixation procedure
      give a release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, in particular interleukin (IL)-6. This results
      in an aggravation of the initial systemic inflammatory response, and will cause in some
      patients an increased risk on the development of inflammatory complications, like ARDS and
      MODS. Which can lead to higher morbidity, mortality and prolonged hospital stay.

      Various strategies, such as damage control orthopedics, have been proposed to prevent these
      complications. Another strategy is to decrease the inflammatory reaction caused by the
      surgical procedure, and by interventions focused on inhibition of the innate inflammatory
      response. This will lower the risk of complications.

      A promising candidate is the endogenously produced serum protein C1-esterase inhibitor
      (C1-INH). This protein is an acute phase protein, produced by the liver in response to
      inflammatory conditions. C1-INH is a major inactivator of the complement system, but
      important additional anti-inflammatory properties have been demonstrated. A previous study of
      from our laboratory showed that administration of the drug C1-INH significantly reduced the
      concentration of circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, during human
      experimental endotoxemia. Treatment with C1-INH has been proven to be safe in treatment with
      humans, even in high dosages and in pregnant patients with C1-INH deficiency.
