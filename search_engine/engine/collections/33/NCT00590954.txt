    
      This is a phase II study of the small molecule inhibitor perifosine (NSC 639966, D21266,
      KRX-0401) in the treatment of patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and other
      recurrent malignant gliomas. The goal of the phase II study is to determine efficacy as
      measured by the progressionfree survival rate after 6 months of treatment. Secondary goals
      include determination of molecular and metabolic effects of perifosine by tissue analysis and
      PET imaging.

      In addition, when cytoreductive surgery is recommended as part of the standard of care at
      study entry, patients will be considered for a "surgical arm." In this case, patients will
      receive perifosine for 5-10 days before surgery during which tumor will be aliquoted both for
      diagnostic purposes and for molecular effects of the drug in vivo and for analysis of drug
      penetration into tumor tissue.
