      osteoarthritis of the knee and determining disease modifying effects of TG-C. This study is
      intended for the treatment of patients with KL Grade 2 and 3 osteoarthritis and OARSI JSN
      Grade 1 and 2. Assessments will be made on both the symptomatic effects of pain (VAS),
      function (WOMAC), and Quality of Life (SF-12) as well as the physical effects (JSW, MRI
      evaluations of whole knee joint organ tissues and structure) and biochemical biomarkers. This
      is a placebo-controlled study, TG-C will be compared to normal saline as a control.
      Additionally, this protocol is designed to evaluate the safety of TG-C. Safety will be
      evaluated by observation of the injection site for irritation or other effects, the incidence
      and severity of adverse events, and changes in physical examination findings, radiographic
      criteria, and laboratory tests. Patients will be followed for 24 months for both safety and
      efficacy with annual cancer surveillance questionnaires through 15 years post dosing for
      subjects who do not enroll in the Long Term Safety study.
