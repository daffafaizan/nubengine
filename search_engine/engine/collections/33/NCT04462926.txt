    
      This is a diagnostic accuracy prospective, single-centre, open-label, single group assignment
      interventional study.

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of
      [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT in detection of primary tumor and extraprostatic disease (lymph node,
      soft tissues spread or bone metastases) in men newly diagnosed with prostate cancer at
      intermediate or high-risk.

      The secondary objective of this study is to compare the diagnostic accuracy of
      [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT to the diagnostic accuracy of conventional imaging mpMRI (with or
      without CT of the lower abdomen and Bone scan) in the prostatic bed and extra prostatic
      disease in men newly diagnosed with prostate cancer at intermediate or high-risk.

      To evaluate association between [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT uptake value (SUVmax and SUVmean) and
      aggressiveness of prostate tumor (e.g. PSA serum level and Gleason Score).
