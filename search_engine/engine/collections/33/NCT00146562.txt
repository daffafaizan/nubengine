    
      -  Patients will receive chemotherapy every 2 weeks for up to 8 cycles (spread out of
           approximately 16 weeks, total) of treatment. On the day of chemotherapy treatment
           patients may receive an injection of darbepoetin alfa in addition to chemotherapy if
           their red blood cell count is below normal levels.

        -  On the day after chemotherapy treatment, patients will receive an injection of
           pegfilgrastim. There is one pegfilgrastim shot given per treatment cycle, for a total of
           8 injections. Once the patient has finished chemotherapy and the last of the
           pegfilgrastim shots, their participation in this trial will be complete.

        -  While on this study the following procedures will be performed: a physical exam will be
           done every 2 weeks, vital signs will be done every 2 weeks, and blood tests every 2
           weeks.

        -  This study also involves a Quality of Life Questionnaire done at the beginning of study
           treatment, at 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, and 1 year after starting the study
           treatment.

        -  Patients will remain on this study unless they experience unacceptable side effects from
           any of the treatment drugs.
