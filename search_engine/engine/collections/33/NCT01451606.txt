      fibroids, and adhesions. Surgical treatment of the pathology often relieves the pain, but a
      significant number of women continue to have pain, even after visibly successful surgery. One
      model explored in this study is that in some cases of chronic pelvic pain, the central
      nervous system has changed in its processing of pain-related signals, requiring a therapy
      directed to the Central Nervous System (CNS) to effectively treat the pain. This model has
      been supported in studies of other chronic pain conditions, such as fibromyalgia and
      migraine. This study will seek to determine whether the analgesic effectiveness of duloxetine
      is related to the pain state of the individual.
