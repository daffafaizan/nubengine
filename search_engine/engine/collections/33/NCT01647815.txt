      veins with the subclavian artery, the brachial plexus and the pleura, and assess the depth of
      the vein to the skin. Specifically, the following will be assessed:

        -  the depth of the vein (mm)

        -  the length of the minor axis (mm)

        -  the length of the major axis (mm)

        -  artery-vein distance (mm)

        -  vein-pleural distance (mm)

        -  the distance of the brachial plexus (mm)
