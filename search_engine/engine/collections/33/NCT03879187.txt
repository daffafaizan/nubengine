      high-fat overfeeding. We determined whole-body glycaemic control, glucose kinetics, skeletal
      muscle insulin signalling, and markers of skeletal muscle microvascular function. Stable
      isotope tracers were used to assess the rate of appearance of glucose from the gut, liver
      glucose output and whole-body glucose disposal. Insulin signalling was determined by Western
      blotting of skeletal muscle tissue. Microvascular function was assessed through the use of
      quantitative immunofluorescence microscopy. These measurements were performed both
      postabsorptively and following the ingestion of 50 grams of glucose + 15 grams of protein.
