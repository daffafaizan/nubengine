      generation sequencing platform (OncoScreen Plus panelTM) using ctDNA collected from
      peripheral blood samples of gastric cancer patients. For HER2 positive patients, samples will
      be collected at baseline, first surveillance after treatment and disease progression. For
      HER2 negative patients, samples will be collected at baseline as negative control.
