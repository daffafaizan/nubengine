      as a screening examination in peri-, or post-menopausal female patients with an intermediate
      likelihood of coronary artery disease (CAD) based on risk factors to identify patients at
      higher risk of experiencing future cardiac events.Female patients who are able to adequately
      exercise will undergo a symptom-limited exercise echocardiogram. Patients who are unable to
      adequately exercise or are predicted to be unable to exercise adequately (because of
      orthopedic/neurologic limitations, lung disease or debility), will perform dobutamine stress
      echocardiography. All patients will receive DEFINITY at rest and stress to enhance wall
      motion assessment.
