      are also some regulations and recommendations by healthcare executives and government
      officers such as wearing masks, social distance, staying at home, lockdowns, and so forth. On
      the other hand, there could be other social, economic, and health-related factors in the
      society level that discriminate between countries significantly in terms of having
      considerable differences regarding both the frequency and mortality of Covid-19. The aim of
      the present study is to find out these social, economic, and health-related factors that
      could explain some significant portion of Covid-19 cases and deaths worldwide.

      This study involves 171 countries of which required datasets are commonly available in the
      UN, Worldometer, and WHO. The investigators will obtain macro-scale indicators like
      non-communicable disease data from WHO (who. int), social and economical indicators from UN
      (un.org) and Worldbank (worldbank.org), and Covid-19 data from Worldometer
      (https://www.worldometers.info).

      The investigators will conduct statistical data analysis and create predictive models in
      order to determine indicators. The investigators will also consider that possible different
      models for explaining Covid-19 Cases and mortality in both common and different estimators
      could explain the variations in countrywide deaths and cases.
