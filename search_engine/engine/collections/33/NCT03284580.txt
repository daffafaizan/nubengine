      perform activities of daily living at home.

      For this reason, these patients need the support of a caregiver. Caregivers of post-stroke
      patients often have also problems with their quality of life because of the care that they
      must provide. These problems appear mainly during the support tasks in the activities
      performed at the patient's home.

      The objective of the present study is to evaluate the effectiveness of two home-based
      ergonomic intervention programs compared to a control group on the quality of life of
      caregivers of post-stroke patients
