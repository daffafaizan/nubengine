    
      This is a Phase 2a, single arm, open-label, multi center exploratory study to determine the
      effects of sotatercept (ACE-011) plus standard of care (SOC) in adults with WHO functional
      class III pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).

      All eligible participants will receive standard of care (SOC) plus sotatercept (ACE-011) at a
      starting dose level of 0.3 mg/kg SC for Cycle 1 and escalating to 0.7 mg/kg at cycle 2 for
      the remainder of the treatment period. Participants will be required to attend clinic visits
      once every three weeks for the 24 week Treatment Period and once every three weeks for the 18
      month Extension Period to perform one or more protocol specified evaluations. Evaluations
      include hemodynamic measures collected during right heart catheterization (RHC) with invasive
      cardiopulmonary exercise test (iCPET), and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MR), 6-minute
      walk distance (6MWD), pharmacokinetic parameters, pharmacodynamic parameters, anti-drug
      antibody testing, and adverse events.
