      function of various body systems including the brain, muscles, joints, heart, blood vessels
      and other body areas. Unlike clinical MRI imaging, scientific applications often utilize
      techniques that either requires de-novo development or modification of existing research or
      commercially available protocols before implementation in clinical studies. The proposed
      protocol is intended to allow MRI scanning on human subjects for the development and
      refinement of MRI scanning procedures before implementation in larger scale clinical National
      Institute on Aging (NIA) research studies. We will evaluate a variety of MRI pulse sequences
      on normal volunteers and individuals with a variety of medical conditions to determine
      optimal protocols for use in normal volunteers and patient populations. In addition,
      participants can be recruited and scanned to provide additional data for already approved NIA
      studies.
