      patients with locally advanced oral cancer still result in only 50-60% cure rate, leaving a
      substantial group of patients who will develop a local recurrence or distant metastases with
      minimal curative salvage treatment options. Treatment with anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibodies
      (mAbs) has shown promise in patients with recurrent/metastatic head and neck squamous cell
      carcinoma (r/m HNSCC). This supports the hypothesis that including treatment with anti PD-1
      mAb nivolumab could improve the outcome for patients with locally advanced oral cancer
      resulting in a higher cure rate. Response rate with nivolumab was below 20% in unselected
      patients with r/m HNSCC. Therefore, biomarkers for response are urgently needed. Tumor PD-L1
      immunohistochemistry (IHC) was shown to be related to nivolumab response but cannot be
      reliably used for patient selection. Temporal and spatial heterogeneity of tumor PD-L1
      expression (within and between tumor lesions) might be responsible for its suboptimal
      predictive value as biomarker of response. Therefore there is a need to further evaluate
      tumor PD-L1 expression as predictive biomarker, as well as exploring alternatives. Serial PET
      imaging with [18F]BMS-986192 (anti-PD-L1 tracer) and [18F]-FDG has the potential to provide
      whole body information of the patient over time, at baseline as well as on treatment and
      represents a biomarker for toxicity and efficacy. In addition, we will investigate the
      immunophenotype of the patient and tumor, as well as the presence of neoantigens and other
      potential other biomarkers such as plasma vesicle miRNAs.
