      Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaire and pain intensity) prior to
      randomization.

      Participants were introduced in an Excel database in order of arrival and were randomized
      into 2 equal groups by an automatic program (Group A : Whale orthotic. Group B Colditz
      Orthotic). The same low temperature thermoplastic material was used for both orthoses (Orfit
      Colors NS 2.0 mm, micro perforated/ Orfit Industries, Wijnegem, Belgium). The orthoses were
      custom -fabricated for each patient by a hand therapy clinician experienced in orthopedic
      cases.

      Both groups of patients received identical orthotic wearing instructions. Patients were asked
      to use the orthosis during the nighttime and also during daytime ADL's for three to four
      hours per day. Each patient was also provided with a data collection sheet in order to
      control treatment adherence. All patients were asked to report any discomfort when using the
      orthosis. The orthosis was the only treatment intervention received by the participants. No
      therapeutic exercises, modalities or other complementary treatments were offered to the
      patients in order not to interfere with the individual effectiveness of the orthosis.
      Patients were contacted by telephone a week after and were ask about pain intensity. Three
      months after first evaluation, participants were cited in hand therapy clinic in order to
      collect again outcomes measurements.
