      preventive strategy against macrovascular as well as microvascular diseases are warranted
      because of higher cardiovascular risk in diabetic patients even without history of
      atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases. Benefit of lowering low density lipoprotein (LDL)
      cholesterol down to 70 mg/ml in Caucasian patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) has
      been well established but not in Asian patients with lower risk of myocardial infarction and
      higher stroke risk. Intensive lowering blood pressure for cardiovascular outcome in diabetic
      patients and patients with CAD has been recommended in several guidelines without firm
      evidence. Risk and benefit of intensive blood pressure and LDL control should be evaluated in
      Japanese diabetic CAD patients by pragmatic randomized controlled trial.
