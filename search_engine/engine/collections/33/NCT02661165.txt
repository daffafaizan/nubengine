    
      Patients will be recruited from diabetes clinics.

      The bio-statistical markers will be: include their living situation (living alone or with
      family/partner); date of T2D diagnosis; current age; glycated haemoglobin (hba1c) blood test;
      body mass index and current pharmacological therapy. This data will be collected from the
      Diabetes Clinic to contextualize the qualitative data. These measurements will reveal how
      well a participant is managing their T2D.

      The Biographic Narrative Interpretive Method (BNIM) will involve interviews with eight
      participants. Each participant will have at least 2 and possibly 3 interviews at a location
      of their choice. The data will undergo thematic analysis, which will be interpreted.

      The results will be used to encourage clinicians to consider the spirituality of people with
      T2D when planning their care, thus giving holistic treatment.
