      as follows:

        -  Screening Period (up to 28 days): determination of eligibility and discontinuation of
           antiparkinsonian disease medications other than levodopa-carbidopa immediate release
           (LC-oral) prior to nasojejunal (N-J) tube placement.

        -  N-J Test Period (2 to 14 days): first hospitalization period, Baseline assessments,
           placement of N-J tube, and optimization of levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel (LCIG)
           treatment via N-J tube and infusion pump (participant was hospitalized for N-J tube
           placement but hospitalization was not required for entire duration of LCIG treatment
           optimization).

        -  PEG-J Period (12 weeks): second hospitalization period; placement of PEG-J tube; further
           optimization of LCIG treatment.
