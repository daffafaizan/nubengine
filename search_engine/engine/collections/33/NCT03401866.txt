      in response to a stated need by federal agencies (FDA, NCI) for standardization of imaging
      endpoints, including perfusion-weighted MRI, in multi-center clinical trials of GBM
      therapies. Through use of stereotactic methodologies that have been used to demonstrate that
      rCBV(relative cerebral blood flow) and FTB(fractional tumor burden) measures made by the
      consensus DSC-MRI protocol are concordant with tissue histology, this multi-site trial will
      be the first to validate a consensus DSC-MRI protocol on multiple platforms representing all
      major MRI scanner manufacturers. The trial also formally compares two contrast agent dosing
      schemes proposed in the consensus protocol, a single-dose BTIP-compliant scheme and a
      double-dose scheme. Such a comparison has never been tested in patients before, and addresses
      a longstanding controversy regarding contrast agent administration and dosing for DSC-MRI.
      Successful validation of the consensus DSC-MRI protocol will likely shift clinical practice
      paradigms. To date, the widespread adoption of DSC-MRI has been limited by inconsistent
      published methodologies, rCBV thresholds, and impact on clinical decision making. This trial
      seeks to improve confidence in DSCMRI methodology as it will foster its adoption for
      multicenter trials, facilitating the development and testing of novel therapeutic agents and
      treatment strategies for GBM, and shift clinical practice paradigms by providing strong
      evidence to support the inclusion of DSC-MRI in established response assessment criteria
      (i.e., modified RANO).
