      on the outcome of assisted reproduction techniques. In those studies, the dose and
      administration time of GnRHa are inconsistent. Single administration on third day after
      embryo transfer and multiple dose injection during luteal phase are the most common way. The
      GnRHa included Triptorelin 0.1mg, Leuprorelin 1mg and Buserelin 600ug et al. The exact
      underlying mechanism is still not clear, although it has been hypothesized that GnRH agonist
      either supports the corpus luteum function by inducing LH secretion by the pituitary
      gonadotrophin cells or stimulates the endometrium GnRH receptors . Tesarik et al.postulated a
      direct effect of GnRH agonist on the embryo, evidenced by increased Î²-HCG secretion.

      Currently, available data suggest that inadvertent administration of a GnRH agonist during a
      conception cycle is not accompanied by an increased risk of birth defects. On the basis of
      the currently strong available evidence, it appears that GnRH agonist supplementation during
      luteal phase significantly improve the outcome of ART treatment. Most of the former
      researches focused only on fresh embryo transfer in IVF/ICSI cycles. In one prospective
      controlled study, a single dose of Triptorelin 0.1mg was administrated 6 days after ICSI in
      oocyte donor cycles and the implantation rate was improved significantly.GnRH agonist
      administration at the time of implantation enhances embryo developmental potential, probably
      by a direct effect on the embryo.
