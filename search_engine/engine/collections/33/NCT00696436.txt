      population ages, the prevalence of hypertension will continue to increase if broad and
      effective preventive measures are not implemented. According to the World Health
      Organization, hypertension is the most common attributable cause of preventable death in
      developed nations, as uncontrolled hypertension greatly increases the risk of cardiovascular
      disease, cerebrovascular disease, and renal failure. Despite the availability of
      antihypertensive treatments, hypertension remains inadequately controlled: only about
      one-third of patients successfully maintain control.

      A major component of blood pressure regulation is the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.
      This is a system of hormone-mediated feedback interactions that result in the relaxation or
      constriction of blood vessels in response to various stimuli. Angiotensin II, a polypeptide
      hormone, is formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin-converting
      enzyme as part of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Angiotensin II is the principal
      pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and has multiple effects on the
      cardiovascular system and on electrolyte homeostasis.

      TAK-491 (azilsartan medoxomil) is an angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist currently
      being tested as a treatment for essential hypertension.

      Study participation is anticipated to be about 10 weeks. Multiple procedures will occur at
      each visit which may include fasting, blood collection, urine collection, physical
      examinations, electrocardiograms and ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. Outside of the
      study center, participants will be required wear an ambulatory blood pressure monitoring
      device at 24 hour intervals.
