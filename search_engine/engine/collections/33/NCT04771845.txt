      had received TMS for any reason in the clinic over a 12-year period. Of 236 patients
      receiving TMS, 59 patients with AD and 14 with MCI satisfied study criteria and were compared
      to controls from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC). Neurocognitive outcomes
      were compared between magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and electroencephalogram (EEG)-grid
      guided TMS in patients. Tolerability data was reviewed for all patients.
