           medical history review, performance status, physical exam, blood tests.

        -  If the participant's first computed tomography (CT) or bone scan at the time of
           screening showed evidence of cancer, CT and bone scans will be repeated on Day 1 of
           treatment cycles 4, 7 and 10.

        -  Participants will be in this research study for about 12 months.
