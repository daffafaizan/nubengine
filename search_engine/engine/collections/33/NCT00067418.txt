      use in distinguishing gliomas and metastatic tumor cells from surrounding white matter.
      Optical spectroscopy has the potential to provide immediate and accurate diagnostic
      information about the nature and quantity of neoplastic cells, in a minimally-or non-invasive
      fashion. We propose to use a new method of optical spectroscopy, polarized light-scattering
      spectroscopy (LSS), which permits discrimination of malignant cancer cells from normal brain
      cells by virtue of alterations in the cytoplasmic and nuclear ratios of these cells.

      Patients suspected of having, or with prior biopsy proof of, a WHO grade II-IV central
      nervous system (CNS) glial tumor(s); those with metastatic brain tumor; or patients with
      medically-refractory temporal lobe epilepsy with a presumed hippocampal source of seizures,
      who are seen in the Surgical Neurology Branch, NINDS, will be considered for entry into this
      study. Tissue samples of tumor or normal lateral temporal neocortex resected as part of
      standard care will be collected at surgery and utilized for research.
