      difficult since there are no generally established clinical guidelines based on objective
      data.

      Aim: To investigate the effect of using non-articulated dynamic foot (non-articulating ankle,
      NAA) and dynamic foot with hydraulic ankle (articulating hydraulic ankle, AHA) on functional
      capacity, pain severity, satisfaction level and quality of life (QoL) in high activity
      patients with unilateral transtibial amputation.

      Methods: Forty-two patients with unilateral transtibial traumatic amputation will be
      participated in this cross-sectional study. Functional capacity will be evaluated using the
      six-minute walking test (6MWT). The severity of residual limb pain, sound limb pain and low
      back pain will be evaluated with a 10-point Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). The socket system,
      prosthetic foot and overall prosthesis satisfaction will be evaluated with a 10-point VAS.
      The QoL of each patient will be assessed using the Short Form 36 (SF-36).
