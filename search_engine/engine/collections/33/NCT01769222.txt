      1. To assess the safety of combining intratumoral anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated
      protein 4 (CTLA4) immunotherapy with local radiation therapy in patients with melanoma,
      non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and colorectal carcinoma with a monotherapy ipilimumab safety lead-in.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

        1. To assess the induction of an anti-tumor immune responses using laboratory correlative
           studies.

        2. To determine tumor response rates and duration of response at unirradiated tumor sites
           in patients with advanced malignancies.

        3. To identify putative immunologic biomarkers of tumor response.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I dose-escalation study of ipilimumab, followed by a phase 2 study.
      Only a few subjects participated in the phase 1 portion of this study. The phase 2 portion of
      this study was not conducted.

      Patients receive ipilimumab intratumorally on day 1 and undergo local radiation therapy
      within 48 hours for at least 3 fractions.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4 and 8 weeks, and then
      every 24 weeks for 5 years.
