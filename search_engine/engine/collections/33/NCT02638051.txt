      chemoinfusion with its inherent toxicity. There is a strong demand for a safe and non-toxic
      method of treatment of PCMA. The new technology of modulated electro-hyperthermia (mEHT) has
      proven efficacy in many advanced cancers with minimal side effects and synergy with
      Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). TCM has a long history of application at advanced cancer
      as a symptomatic treatment and enhancer of the general resistance of the organism. Shi Pi
      Decoction is supposed to be the optimum co-treatment of PCMA according to principles of TCM.
      Intraperitoneal chemoinfusion (IPCI) with cisplatin and fluorouracil is a widespread standard
      treatment of PCMA in China. This randomized II phase trial studies efficacy and safety of
      combination of mEHT with TCM in treatment of PCMA versus standard IPCI (CDDP+5FU).
