      information for six months following the subjects' third dose of study vaccine.

      An optional extension study (V503-002 EXT1) will collect safety and immunogenicity
      information through Month 36. Participants enrolled in the 16- to 26-year-old cohort in the
      base study will not be included in EXT1.

      An optional second extension study (V503-002 EXT2) will collect long-term safety and
      immunogenicity information through approximately 10 years. No study vaccine will be
      administered in the extension studies. Participants enrolled in the 16- to 26-year-old cohort
      in the base study will not be included in EXT2.
