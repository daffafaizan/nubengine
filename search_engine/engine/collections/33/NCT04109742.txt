    
      30 subjects ages 8-17y, with biopsy-proven NASH/NAFLD (≤ 730 days prior to registration and a
      NAFLD Activity Score (NAS) of ≥3) and serum ALT at screening ≥ 50 IU/L at enrollment.
      Eligible participants will receive curcumin 500 mg, 1.0 g or placebo for 24 weeks, randomized
      1:1:1. The primary outcome of the study will determine whether 24 weeks of curcumin
      supplementation compared to matching placebo improves measures of nonalcoholic fatty liver
      disease (NAFLD) as determined by relative improvement in serum ALT from baseline. The
      hypothesis is that curcumin will significantly decrease ALT relative to placebo in children
      with NAFLD.
