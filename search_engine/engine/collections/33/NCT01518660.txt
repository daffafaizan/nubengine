      an important tool in the rehabilitation of people with multiple sclerosis (MS).

      Previous studies have reported positive effects of PRT on muscle strength, functional
      capacity, fatigue and quality of life. Also, a possible disease modifying effect has been
      proposed. However, the underlying physiological mechanisms that might explain these
      beneficial effects and the possible effects on disease progression are unresolved.
      Additionally, none of the previous studies has been concerned with the possible impact of MS
      progression type, gender and/or medication.

      The purpose of this randomized, controlled, gender stratified trial is to investigate
      underlying mechanisms possibly explaining the beneficial effects of progressive resistance
      training for people with multiple sclerosis.
