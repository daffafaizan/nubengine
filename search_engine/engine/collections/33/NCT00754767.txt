        -  To evaluate the tolerability and usefulness of the dietary supplement, L-carnitine
           L-tartrate, in the prevention of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy in women
           with metastatic breast cancer.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral L-carnitine L-tartrate twice daily beginning on day 2 of
           the first course of chemotherapy and continuing until after completion of 4 courses of
           chemotherapy.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo twice daily beginning on day 2 of the first course
           of chemotherapy and continuing until after completion of 4 courses of chemotherapy.

      Patients complete questionnaires periodically to assess neuropathy, pain, fatigue, sleep, and
      activities of daily living.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 4 weeks and then every 3 months
      thereafter.
