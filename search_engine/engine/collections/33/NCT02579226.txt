    
      This is a first-time-in-patient (FTIP) study with the nanoparticle formulation of AZD2811
      primarily designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of AZD2811 at increasing doses in
      patients with advanced solid tumours and for whom no standard of care exists.

      The study will be conducted in two parts: Part A dose-escalation and Part B dose-expansion.
      In Part A, the dose-escalation phase, patient enrolment has proceeded according to a 3+3
      design in order to identify the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended Phase 2 dose
      (RP2D). AZD2811 monotherapy has been administered IV to patients with advanced solid tumours
      on Days 1 and 4 of a 28-day cycle in 6 dose levels without any relevant toxicities in the
      first 5 patient cohorts. In Cohort 6 (200 mg), grade 4 asymptomatic neutropenia was observed,
      and a dose-limiting toxicity was observed in 1 patient of the 5 evaluable patients. In Cohort
      7 AZD2811 (200 mg) was given on Day 1 only of a 28-day cycle; in Cohort 8 AZD2811 (200 mg)
      was given on Day 1 only of a 21-day cycle. In Cohort 9, the AZD2811 dose was escalated to 400
      mg on Day 1 every 21 days.

      The Safety Review Committee (SRC) will review the safety and tolerability of AZD2811 for each
      cohort and schedule to determine the next cohorts. The study will also characterize the
      pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of AZD2811 and will explore potential biological activity by
      assessing anti-tumour activity in patients.

      Once the MTD is established, Part B the dose expansion phase will continue to explore PK
      parameters, safety, tolerability, and preliminary anti-tumour activity of the AZD2811 RP2D as
      monotherapy in 21 patients with relapsed/refractory SCLC.
