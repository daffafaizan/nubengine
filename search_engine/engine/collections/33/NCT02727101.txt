      among 12 treatment arms consisting of 6 subjects each with refractory focal epilepsy treated
      with perampanel and one other AED ("PMP+"). Treatment arms will include (1) Perampanel
      +phenobarbital, (2) PMP+valproate, (3) PMP+ lamotrigine, (4) PMP + topiramate, (5) PMP +
      tiagabine, (6) PMP + levetiracetam, (7) PMP + zonisamide, (8) PMP + pregabalin, (9) PMP +
      lacosamide, (10) PMP+ clobazam, (11) PMP + ezogabine; and (12) PMP + eslicarbazepine. Each
      group of 6 will be followed for 12 weeks of baseline observation on baseline medication.
      Seizure frequency will be counted, using subjects' self-reported seizure diaries. PMP will be
      titrated to 8-12 mg/day, with the final dose determined by side effects and tolerability of
      PMP at 8-12 mg/day doses. Titration will occur at the rate of 2 mg/week or two weeks (in
      accordance with FDA labeling), as tolerated. Subjects will be observed for 12 weeks of
      maintenance treatment on the target PMP doses. Seizure frequency will be compared between the
      12 weeks of baseline observation and 12 weeks of maintenance treatment.
