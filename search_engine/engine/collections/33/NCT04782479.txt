      each. For two residents in a team, each sequentially took on the role of a practitioner and
      once as an assistant for tracheal intubations by changing the position of the hand holding
      the tube; one time, the position of the hand holding the tube was placed in the air, and the
      other time, the position of the hand holding the tube was placed on the cheek of the manikin.
      For the assistant role, residents performed stylet removal with two hands. Investigators
      filmed a video of the tube movement while the assistant pulling up the stylet at 1/8x speed.
      While analyzing the captured videos, it was measured how much the tube held by the intubation
      practitioner went in front or how far back during the process of pulling the stylet.
