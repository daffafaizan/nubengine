      for refractive surgery. The presence of significant spherical aberration in the visual system
      results in reduced contrast sensitivity, visual symptoms such as "glare" and "halos," and
      "night myopia" or the induction of myopia under low lighting (larger pupil size). A modified
      Treatment Planning Software (TPS) "VSS-Rx1 OPM software" has been developed that uses a
      modified algorithm (software that designs the LASIK treatment profile) to limit the induction
      of postoperative spherical aberration. Commercially available software used to calculate the
      LASIK treatment profile was used in one eye (active comparator [i.e., control]) and VSS-Rx1
      OPM software was used in the fellow eye (experimental). Subjects were masked to the use of
      either the commercially available or VSS-Rx1 OPM software.
