      （FOXE3）, cg03890877（TWF2）, cg07611000 （EHBP1L1）and cg14391855（RIN1）. The investigators
      evaluate the CpG methylation status of surgical specimens using pyrosequencing and calculate
      their risk score[risk score=(0.0066×PITX1)+(0.0034×FOXE3)-(0.027×TWF2)
      -(0.018×EHBP1L1)-(0.03×RIN1)], risk score ≥-0.1 as assay-defined high risk status and risk
      score<-0.1 as assay-defined low risk status. The investigators randomly assign assay-defined
      high risk patients of stage III ccRCC into intervention group and control group. The
      intervention group should receive adjuvant targeted therapy while the control group deserve
      observation. Primary endpoint is the disease free survival and overall survival.
