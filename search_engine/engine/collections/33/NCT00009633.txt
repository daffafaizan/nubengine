      surviving extremely low birth-weight infants undergo neurodevelopmental, neurosensory and
      functional assessments at 22-26 months corrected age (Infants born prior to July 1, 2012 were
      seen at 18-22 month corrected age). The goal of the study is to identify potential maternal
      and neonatal risk factors that may affect infant neurodevelopment, including:

        -  Evaluating development of motor skills, cognitive skills, language and behavior

        -  Determining mortality and the prevalence of specific medical conditions

        -  Assessing the relationship between growth and neurodevelopmental outcome

        -  Assessing the relationship between the socioeconomic status and developmental outcome

        -  Assessing the use of special support services and early intervention programs by this
           population

        -  Evaluating the need for follow-up at school age.

      The scheduled evaluations collect: demographic information; socioeconomic status; medical
      history; medications; medical equipment required; growth data; a detailed neurologic
      examination; Bayley Scales of Infant Development (mental, motor, infant behavior); Child
      Behavior Checklist.

      A sub-study will assess a reference group comprised of a limited number of healthy term
      infants born in Network centers to meet the following three aims: 1) to avoid potential
      ascertainment biases due to examiner expectations when only extremely preterm or other
      high-risk infants are assessed 2) in the absence of well-developed norms for the Bayley
      Scales, to define thresholds for impairment based on data for a representative sample of
      healthy children born at term in our centers and concurrently assessed by the same examiners
      as for our high-risk infants; and 3) to help identify and address when "drift" occurs over
      time in conducting and scoring Bayley assessments.
