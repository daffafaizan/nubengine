      inflammatory cells, such as mast cells, and fibrous tissue remodeling are associated with
      c-Kit, Lyn and PDGFR kinase signaling pathways; all key targets of masitinib. The objective
      of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of masitinib at 6 mg/kg/day versus
      matched placebo in severe persistent asthma patients that is uncontrolled with oral
      corticosteroids. The primary outcome measure will be severe asthma exacerbation rate over
      duration of the treatment.
