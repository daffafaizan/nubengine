      the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. It competitively binds to the IL-1 receptor, thus
      blocking IL-1 signaling. It is a short-acting agent that requires daily subcutaneous
      administration at 1-2 mg/kg, maximum 100 mg/dose. It has been effective in lowering HbA1c
      (glycated haemoglobin) in T2D (type 2 diabetes) and a randomized trial of anakinra in recent
      onset T1D (type 1 diabetes) is underway in Europe. Overall, anakinra has been used in adults
      and children with a good safety record, for more than 10 years. Infrequent side effects
      include infections, neutropenia, nausea, diarrhea, cardiopulmonary arrest, influenza-like
      symptoms, and production of anti-anakinra antibodies.

      Study Design: A double-blinded placebo-controlled RCT (randomized controlled trial) with 2:1
      allocation (14 active treatment vs. 7 placebo). Anakinra treatment will be given as a bolus
      of 2 mg/kg infused intravenously over 30 minutes followed by infusion of 2 mg/kg/hour for 4
      hours immediately after confirmation of the diagnosis of DKA (diabetic keto-acidosis) and
      when laboratory safety parameters are available (CBC (complete blood count) and pregnancy
      test) and after a consent is obtained. Primary outcomes: Safety and tolerability of anti-IL-1
      treatment (anakinra) during the initial 24 hr period of DKA treatment. Secondary outcomes:
      Optic nerve sheath diameter (cut-off to define cerebral edema: 4.5 mm); Changes in cytokines
      levels during the treatment with anakinra.
