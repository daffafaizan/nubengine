    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess safety and tolerability of unlabeled daratumumab followed by
      64Cu-DOTA-daratumumab positron emission tomography, at each dose level, by evaluation of
      toxicities including: type, frequency, severity, attribution, time course and duration.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Generate initial estimates of the biodistribution of the 64Cu-DOTA-daratumumab and the
      preferred dose of cold antibody.

      II. Determine the dose of pre-administered unlabeled daratumumab that optimizes image quality
      of 64Cu-anti-CD38 (daratumumab)-NHS-DOTA.

      III. Evaluate the sensitivity of 64Cu-anti-CD38 (daratumumab)-NHS-DOTA in detecting lesions
      compared to 18F fludeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography
      (CT) scanning.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive daratumumab intravenously (IV) over 10-45 minutes, and within 6 hours,
      patients receive copper 64Cu-DOTA-daratumumab IV on day 0. Patients undergo PET on days 1 and
      2.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up for 7 days and then at 2 weeks.
