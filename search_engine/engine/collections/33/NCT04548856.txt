      stratified according to the presence or absence of aneurysm rupture in the acute period. The
      stratified patients will be randomized into two groups (100 to the microsurgical clipping
      group and 100 to the endovascular embolization group). Each group will be divided into 2
      subgroups of 50 people each: the first subgroup includes patients in the acute period of
      aneurysm rupture, the second subgroup includes patients with unruptured aneurysms. Patients
      will be followed postoperatively, outcome endpoints will be assessed at discharge, 6 and 12
      months. At discharge and after 6 and 12 months, patients will be assessed clinically using a
      modified Rankin scale (mRS). Cerebral angiography will be performed intraoperatively
      (endovascular group), after surgery (microsurgical group) and 12 months after discharge (both
      groups). Thus, the outcome of surgical treatment, including periprocedural complications and
      mortality, will be assessed both clinically and angiographically.
