    
      Subjects presenting at hospital with suspected UA or NSTEMI and who are likely to undergo
      angiography (ideally within 72 hours) will be assessed for eligibility and consented.
      Suitable subjects will be enrolled and commence treatment with open-label fondaparinux, 2.5
      milligram (mg), subcutaneous (s.c.), once daily. Following angiography subjects indicated for
      PCI and meeting the additional requirements for randomization will be randomised to receive
      one of two dose regimens of UFH either standard dose or low dose immediately prior to the PCI
      procedure. Post-PCI, therapy with fondaparinux (2.5 mg, s.c.) may be resumed at the
      investigator's discretion for up to a maximum of 8 days or hospital discharge, whichever is
      earlier.

      Subjects not indicated for PCI, will continue treatment with fondaparinux, 2.5mg, s.c, once
      daily for up to 8 days or hospital discharge, whichever is earlier.

      All subjects will be followed up for 30 days after randomization/angiography.
