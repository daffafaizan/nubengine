      receptors (CARs) specific for CD147(CD147-CART). CAR-T cells are expanded in culture and
      returned to the patient by hepatic artery infusion at specific cell doses. Four CD147-CART
      doses patient are planned at 1-week intervals. Tumor biopsies will be obtained at the time of
      the initial diagnostic angiogram and during the first infusion session. Serum cytokine level
      and CAR-T cell number will be measured in whole treatment session.
