    
      The study will be conducted in approximately 200 sites in North America, South America,
      Africa, Asia/Pacific, and European countries.

      The study will be conducted in 2 parts, Part A and Part B. In both study parts, participants
      will be randomized to 12 weeks of treatment plus 2 weeks follow-up.

      After screening, eligible participants will be stratified by diabetes (diabetic kidney
      disease [DKD] versus non-diabetes mellitus [non-DM] CKD) and baseline eGFR (below versus
      above 45 mL/min/1.73m^2).

      Participants will be randomized to treatments with 4 arms in Part A and 6 arms in Part B, in
      addition to receiving background local standard of care (SoC) therapy as follows:

      Part A:

        1. Zibotentan Dose A + Dapagliflozin 10 mg once daily.

        2. Zibotentan Dose A once daily.

        3. Dapagliflozin 10 mg once daily.

        4. Placebo once daily.

      Part B:

        1. Zibotentan Dose A + Dapagliflozin 10 mg once daily.

        2. Zibotentan Dose A once daily.

        3. Dapagliflozin 10 mg once daily.

        4. Placebo once daily.

        5. Zibotentan Dose B + Dapagliflozin 10 mg once daily.

        6. Zibotentan Dose C+ Dapagliflozin 10 mg once daily.

      Participants randomized in Part A cannot be randomized in Part B.
