      the disease. These problems lead to reduced intelligibility, which entails a subsequent
      reduction in social participation and overall quality of life. The current study will focus
      on developing and pilot-testing an app to measure the intelligibility of people with PD and
      of healthy controls. In order to test the app's efficacy, speakers will read a set of 50
      sentences that will be embedded in noise for measurement purposes. A group of listeners will
      also transcribe the spoken sentences to correlate their performance to that of the app. The
      ultimate purpose of this investigation is to improve self-monitoring and self-sufficiency in
      people with PD. The study is expected to last 12 months.
