      monitor (CGM) might be if we personalize the sensor calibration algorithm for each
      individual. The calibration algorithm is a mathematical calculation built into the CGM.
      Currently, the CGM asks for a regular blood test (finger stick) measurement twice a day in
      order to make its calibration algorithm more accurate. Our goal is to keep refining the
      calculating ability so that it will provide personalized blood sugar control throughout the
      day for each individual using the sensor with the CGM.
