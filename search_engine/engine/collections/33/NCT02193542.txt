      cesarean delivery. Two main methods are used to achieve these goal: "Regional anesthesia"
      where the mother is given medication through a needle or catheter in her back and the mother
      is kept awake, or "General anesthesia", where the mother is given intravenous medication and
      is kept asleep.

      Regional anesthesia uses a needle to enter a narrow space in the mother's back where
      medications can be given. In some patients, it takes longer to find this target space in the
      back. In emergency situation, however, there is often little time to find this space, and the
      backup method would be the general anesthesia technique.

      If general anesthesia is required, a breathing tube needs to be inserted to help support the
      mother's breathing. In some patients, it is harder to insert the breathing tubes, so knowing
      this in advanced helps anesthesiologists create a safe plan for the patients. A lot of
      research has been done to determine factors that would predict which patients would need more
      time and preparation for general anesthesia and regional anesthesia.

      The purpose of this study is to study how common it is for the pregnant patients who have a
      difficult regional and general anesthesia.
