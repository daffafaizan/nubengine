      intracoronary thrombosis, leading to acute deterioration during percutaneous coronary
      intervention or thrombosis of the device despite therapy. Intracoronary use of abciximab has
      reported favourable results. We randomly assigned 84 patients to intracoronary half abciximab
      bolus (group A) and to standard regimen (group B).
