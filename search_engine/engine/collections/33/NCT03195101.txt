      relationship with the muscle cone which is further classified into anterior and posterior
      orbital tumors. Excision of orbital tumors is considered a challenge for the surgeon. This is
      due to the complex structure of the orbit. The orbital cavity is narrow that does not allow
      adequate exposure. Furthermore, the orbit is full of vital structures which require careful
      manipulation. Many surgical approaches for excision of these tumors have been described.
      These approaches do not allow access to all orbital quadrants. Furthermore, some of these
      approaches are technically difficult, associated with long morbidity and post operative pain
      due to the osteotomy, having high rate of complications or having unacceptable cosmetic
      appearance. Few studies with limited number of patients have used transconjunctival approach
      in management of orbital tumors All patients with orbital tumor will be managed by the
      transconjunctival incisional or excisional biopsy according to the suggested nature of the
      tumor being benign or malignant as well as the site of the tumor using the
      clinicoradiological finding. In case of intraconal tumors, the mass will be approached via
      the transconjunctival approach but if the mass is out of reach via this approach, lateral
      orbitotomy approach will be used as an alternative procedure to perform the predetermined
      decision. This allows detection of the intraconal tumor criteria that could be excised safely
      via this approach
