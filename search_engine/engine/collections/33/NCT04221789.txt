      curable. Patients face many challenges to adhere to treatment and mobile health (mHealth)
      interventions may address these challenges and support patients to complete their treatment.
      We will improve an interactive intervention based on the combined input from patients and TB
      experts and evaluate the intervention's impact on treatment outcomes in a randomized clinical
      trial. Findings have broader implications not only for TB adherence but disease management
      more generally and will improve our understanding of how to support patients in challenging
      treatment regimens.
