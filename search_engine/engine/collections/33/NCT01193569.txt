      ischemic stroke from large vessel thromboembolism in the brain. The target population is a
      stroke cohort with a known infarct volume who presents within 8 hours from symptom onset with
      a NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score >10. Functional outcome as defined by the modified Rankin
      Scale (mRS) of all enrolled patients will be followed for 90 days after the index event. This
      is a prospective, single arm, multi-center trial. Up to 200 patients at up to 30 centers will
      be enrolled in the study. It is anticipated that up to 150 evaluable patients will be needed
      for analysis. The sample size estimate is based on the primary study functional outcome at 90
      days as defined by a mRS of 0-2. Assuming that this observational study will have as outcome
      of 25% (37/150) mRS 0-2 at day 90, the expected two-sided exact binomial confidence interval
      is (18%, 32%). This sample size is adequate to estimate the mRS outcome of 0-2 at day 90 for
      the natural history of acute ischemic stroke.
