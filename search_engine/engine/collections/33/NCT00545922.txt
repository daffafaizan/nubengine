      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and clinically significant levels of anxiety or
      depressive symptoms seem to be even more common.Despite the multiple, severe consequences,
      majority of COPD patients with co-morbid anxiety or depression do not seem to receive any
      treatment for the psychological disturbance.

      Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a well-known approach for treating anxiety and
      depression, and data has demonstrated effectiveness of CBT for older individuals with
      anxiety. CBT has also improved exercise tolerance compliance in COPD patients, and pilot
      studies using CBT components have shown effectiveness in improving mental health and
      functional status for patients with COPD.

      Given the increasing number of patients suffering from COPD and the high prevalence of
      anxiety and depression in the population, the current study was designed to examine the
      efficacy of CBT in groups for anxiety and depression in patients with COPD. At present,
      CBT-based interventions focusing on mental health symptoms are not widely available for COPD
      patients, and the potential of CBT for improving emotional well-being is not systematically
      considered in existing treatment alternatives. The study expands the findings from previous
      pilot studies by focusing on COPD patients with clinically significant levels of anxiety and
      depression. The wide breadth of coping skills included in the CBT intervention target
      symptoms of both anxiety and depression, and thus the utility of the intervention for
      managing mental health symptoms is not restricted to any specific DSM-IV diagnosis.
