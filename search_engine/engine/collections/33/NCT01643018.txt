      parallel-group, non-inferiority study conducted in Turkey (4 sites).

      The objective of this trial is to show there is no difference in rate of recurrence 2 years
      after laparoscopic as compared to open management of cystic echinococcosis of the liver, by
      at least M (non-inferiority margin). If PLAP/POP: denotes the cure rate in the laparoscopy
      group (LAP) / open group (OP), then the following two-sided test problem is assessed:

      H0: POP - PLAP >= M (Open Surgery is superior to Laparoscopic surgery) H1: POP - PLAP < M
      (Laparoscopic surgery is not inferior to open surgery)
