      cause of primary medical care and the highest cause of disability in the entire world. This
      pathology is normally slight to moderate in the majority of cases, meaning that the
      therapeutical treatment tends to be conservative and thus the interest in increasing the
      range of non-invasive therapeutic possibilities is available.

      Reflex Locomotion or Vojta Therapy began being used in 1959 for the rehabilitation of
      children with motor alterations and infants with a risk of cerebral palsy. Years later it was
      successfully applied to adults with neurological and motor alteration problems. Until now,
      there have been no studies on its use in pathologies of the spine and, in particular at a
      lumbar level.

      A pre-/ post-intervention examination will be performed to obtain an objective clinical
      analysis (measurements of pain, disability, functionality and joint movement), by means of
      simple questionnaires completed by the patient (VAS scale, Oswestry and Roland-Morris
      questionnaires) and exploration techniques (Lasègue manoeuvre, Schöber test, fingertips to
      floor test and walking on heels and toes).
