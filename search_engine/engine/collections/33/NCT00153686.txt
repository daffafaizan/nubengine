      recurrent hospitalization and extensive investigations. Mesenteric angiogram is one of the
      standard radiological investigations for GIB of obscure origin, and its diagnostic yield
      ranged from 40-80%. Capsule endoscopy (CE) is a newly available investigation for small bowel
      examination, especially in bleeding of obscure origin. The diagnostic yield is particularly
      high in patients with ongoing bleeding. This is a prospective randomized study to compare the
      diagnostic yield of mesenteric angiogram with CE in patients with overt GIB of obscure
      origin. The results will help to define the optimal management strategy for this group of
      patients.
