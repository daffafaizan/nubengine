      are compared to a control group of healthy subjects The protocol has 2 sessions. During the
      first session, After determining the parameters of stimulation (stimulated target : part of
      the left motor cortex responsible for the contraction of the right first dorsal interosseous
      muscle ; Activity Motor Threshold (AMT) ; Intensity of Stimulation providing a Motor Evoked
      Potential (MEP) with an Amplitude of 1mV (MEP 1mV)), a Baseline consisting of 15 MEP
      (intensity MEP 1mV) is measured. Then each subjet receive a TBS protocol (cTBS or iTBS)
      (intensity of stimulation 80% of AMT). After receiving the stimulation, sets containing 10
      MEP are regularly measured by each subject.

      During a second session, the same protocol is done again with the other TBS stimulation (cTBS
      or iTBS) the subject didn't get during the first session.

      A neuronavigation device is used to determine precisely the area of stimulation.
