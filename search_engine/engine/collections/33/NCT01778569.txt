      process in cardiometabolic diseases (CMD) such atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD),
      dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, diabetes and obesity. However, mechanistic links between
      inflammation and these disease states in humans remain poorly understood. In this study, we
      propose to utilize psoriasis, a common, chronic inflammatory T-cell skin disease associated
      with increased CVD and CMD as a model to understand the effect of chronic inflammation on
      these diseases states. We will conduct a prospective cohort study to understand the effect of
      chronic inflammation on vascular and metabolic disease at the NIH Clinical Center.
      Furthermore, we will initiate a large scale collection of blood and skin from extramural
      sites to facilitate discovery of pathways involved in inflammatory modulation of CVD and CMD
