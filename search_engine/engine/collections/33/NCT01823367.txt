      who gave birth to babies 9 pounds or greater, or who have prediabetes who are thus at very
      high risk for developing diabetes, and by virtue of their GDM/prediabetes, their children are
      also at high risk. Because of the genetic components involved, all children born by a woman
      afflicted with gestational diabetes mellitus or prediabetes have elevated risk of developing
      Type 2 Diabetes. This first intervention builds upon the evidence-based curriculum used in
      the DPP and incorporates into the curriculum detailed education regarding ways to help their
      children adopt healthier lifestyle behaviors. It will be delivered in groups of mothers only
      at community sites using trained laypeople. The second intervention will use the same parent
      curriculum, but adds a group program for children that teach them (directly) strategies for
      eating better and increasing physical activity. This program will be delivered to both
      mothers and children in separate groups. The group sessions will take place at the same time
      and in the same location by a trained facilitator.
