        -  To identify head and neck squamous cell cancer patients who will benefit from treatment
           with the EGFR inhibitors (i.e., erlotinib hydrochloride, gefitinib, and cetuximab) and
           VEGF inhibitor (i.e., bevacizumab), based on predictive proteomic profiles in patient
           blood samples.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Blood samples are analyzed for proteomic profile to determine good and bad prognoses in
      patients treated with or without EGFR inhibitors and/or a VEGF inhibitor.
