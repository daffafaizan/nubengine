      treatment modality for treatment of skeletal open bite in adult patients. However, it was
      proved that mandibular posterior teeth extrusion take place during the treatment which
      results in reduction in the amount of open. bite closure. Therefore, the aim of our study is
      to compare in a randomized clinical trial methodology between maxillary posterior
      dento-alveolar intrusion and combined maxillary and mandibular posterior dento-alveolar
      intrusion in terms of anterior open bite closure.
