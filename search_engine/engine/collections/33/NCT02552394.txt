      prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA). Background data demonstrate that mAb Hu-J591 doses
      as low as 20 mg may lead to a decrease in CTCs and that doses up to 300 mg are safe. With a
      goal of establishing less frequent, potentially more convenient and cost-effective future
      therapy, the investigators propose a single-center, open-label, dose de-escalation study to
      determine the effect of mAb Hu-J591 on circulating tumor cells in subjects with metastatic
      PC. Four dose levels are planned with a minimum of 6 and maximum of 24 subject enrollment
      starting with a single infusion of 300 mg of mAb Hu-J591.

      In the initial phase of the study a cohort of 6 subjects will receive 300 mg of mAb Hu-J591
      and blood samples will be collected pre and post-infusion for the detection of CTCs, PSA and
      to assess hematological toxicity at screening, baseline, week 1, week 4, week 8, and week 12.
      In addition, patients will receive a dose of 89Zr-DFO-huJ591 (5 mCi) 2-4 weeks prior to
      treatment and will undergo 89Zr-DFO-huJ591 PET imaging 1-3 weeks pre-treatment (optional) as
      well as repeat 89Zr-DFO-huJ591 infusion (5 mCi) at 11 weeks and PET/CT imaging at 12 weeks
      (optional).

      If less than four subjects respond by dropping their CTC counts from more than or equal to 5
      CTCs/7.5 mL whole blood to less than 5 CTCs/7.5 mL whole blood in the initial cohort, the
      trial will be ended at this dose. If four or more subjects respond, an additional 6 subjects
      will be accrued to the second dose level (200 mg). The same decision rule will be applied to
      evaluate two additional lower dose levels (100 mg, 50 mg) with 6 subjects enrolled in each
      cohort. Imaging studies will be performed prior to treatment at screening and at 3 months or
      as clinically indicated to assess disease response.

      Subjects who tolerate the initial infusion well (< grade 2 toxicities) may be re-treated
      every 3 months (12 weeks) at the same dose-level until progression.
