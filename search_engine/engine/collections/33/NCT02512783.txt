      choice for procedural sedation in both children and adults. Despite its many advantages,
      Propofol is associated with a burning sensation during injection. Propofol pain begins within
      the first few seconds after administration and often lasts approximately 10-20 seconds until
      the patient is asleep. Lidocaine is often used in an attempt to reduce Propofol injection
      pain, but neither its delivery mode nor concentration has been standardized.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of premedication with 1% Lidocaine in
      decreasing the burning sensation caused by intravenous Propofol.

      This is a double blind, randomized, controlled study. The sedationist performing the sedation
      procedure will inject the appropriate amount of either a 1% Lidocaine solution or a placebo
      before the administration of Propofol. A research staff will observe the patient
      simultaneously with the induction of Propofol to determine the patient's pain level, as
      measured by the FLACC scale.
