      surgeries completed by Dr. Egol or Dr. Tejwani will be done without the device, "free hand"
      technique. Each arm of the study will contain 29 patients. Patients who consent to
      participation will be enrolled in the study and placed in the correct arm based on who their
      surgeon is. Demographic and injury data will be collected. Intra-operatively, control
      patients will receive the SOC procedure. Device arm patients will have the distal targeting
      device used in their procedure, but the implant, will not be different than SOC.
