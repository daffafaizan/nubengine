      and lung CT studies in small airways intrinsic obstruction, emphysema, and asthma. Current
      investigators have demonstrated that despite the presence of normal routine spirometry
      including normal FEV1(L), FVC (L), and FEV1/FVC% that unsuspected small airways obstruction,
      and emphysema can be detected. This has been achieved by presence of isolated abnormal
      expiratory airflow limitation at low lung volumes on the maximal expiratory flow volume
      curves. This includes abnormal expiratory airflow at 75% and 80% expired lung volume. Current
      investigators believe investigators will be able to detect unsuspected small airways
      intrinsic obstruction, and peripheral airway bronchiectasis proven by lung CT, in patients
      with cystic fibrosis despite presence of pre bronchodilator normal routine spirometry.
