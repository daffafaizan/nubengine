        -  Study the curative potential of high-dose cyclophosphamide and total-body irradiation
           followed by rescue with bone marrow from volunteer HLA-matched donors in patients with a
           variety of hematologic malignancies and bone marrow failure states.

        -  Study the toxic effects associated with matched unrelated bone marrow transplantation in
           this patient population.

        -  Participate in collaborative research studies with the National Marrow Donor Program.

      OUTLINE: All patients receive myeloablative therapy with high-dose cyclophosphamide and total
      body irradiation over 4 days; patients with severe aplastic anemia also receive antithymocyte
      globulin. Patients then undergo allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. Filgrastim (G-CSF) is
      given after transplant to accelerate engraftment. Sargramostim (GM-CSF) may be given in case
      of graft failure.

      All patients receive graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) prophylaxis with tacrolimus,
      methotrexate, and gamma globulin. Established GVHD is treated with corticosteroids and, as
      necessary, antithymocyte globulin.

      Patients are followed at 100 days, 6 months, and 1 year after transplant, then annually
      thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10 patients per year will be accrued for this study over 5
      years.
