    
      The primary objective is to assess the humoral and cellular immune response of the VAX102
      vaccine delivered IM and SC in a prime-boost regimen at dose levels 1 µg or 2 µg in healthy
      adults against the influenza A virus M2e antigen after each vaccination. The magnitude and
      quality of the M2e-specific B and T cells will be measured. B cell responses will be
      evaluated on pre-dose Days 0, 28 and post-dose Days 7, 35, 42 and 60. T cell responses will
      be measured on pre-dose Days 0, 28 and post-dose Days 14, 42 and 60. IgG M2e antibody will be
      measured on Days 0, 7, 14, 28, 35. 42 and 60. The secondary objective is to assess the
      safety, reactogenicity, and tolerability of the VAX102 vaccine delivered IM or SC at dose
      levels 1 µg or 2 µg, in a prime-boost dosing regimen, in healthy adults 18-49 years of age,
      inclusive.
