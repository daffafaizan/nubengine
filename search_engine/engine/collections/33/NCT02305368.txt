    
      A fragment of colon tumors will be taken from a specimen or a cold biopsy, tissue from
      patients diagnosed with colon carcinoma metastatic (stage 4). In parallel and systematically:
      analysis by the pathologist of a histological section.

        -  Culturing the cells obtained from the tumor by Oncomedics fragment in a defined medium
           and provided for enriching tumor cells compared to stromal cells.

        -  Maintaining the cells in culture for 7 days.

        -  Effects of conventional chemotherapy (corresponding to protocols) on these cells for 72
           hours (growth chambers) by Oncomedics (chimio-oncogramme).

        -  For each chemotherapy tested, measuring the proportion of dead cells / total cells.

        -  Retained by Oncomedics results, not given to the nursing team. The patient will be
           treated and followed up in the usual way.

        -  At the end of the study, comparing the in vitro results (chimio-oncogramme) to the
           patient's response to (x) the same (s) chemotherapy (s).
