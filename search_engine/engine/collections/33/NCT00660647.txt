      possible with methotrexate and steroids However, this treatment algorithm, will only bring
      one third of the patients into remission and cannot stop progressive, persistent joint
      damage. The possible benefits and risks of adding adalimumab to this conventional treatment
      algorithm is unknown.

      The aim of the study is to clarify the possible benefits of adding adalimumab an
      anti-TNF-alfa inhibitor versus placebo to the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis patients, who
      are treated very early and given methotrexate and intraarticular triamcinolone hexacetonide.
      Efficacy will be evaluated by DAS 28, ACR 20/50/70, HAQ, progressive changes in X-ray, MRI
      and DXA-scans.

      Adverse events will also be registered.
