      hypoglycemia-associated autonomic failure (HAAF, impaired awareness). There is almost no
      information investigating the contribution of HAAF as a risk factor for hypoglycemia in
      hospitalized patients. Our central aim is to develop a validated inpatient hypoglycemic
      symptom score model to examine HAAF and its correlation with cognitive dysfunction,
      re-hospitalization rates, inpatient morbidity and mortality.

      This will be a prospective non-blinded study performed in a tertiary care center that will
      include non-critically insulin treated patients with Type 1 and 2 Diabetes. We will identify
      patients who have experienced moderate hypoglycemia (40-70 mg/dl) or severe hypoglycemia (<
      40 mg/dl) within the prior 24 hours by daily generated computerized reports. Participants
      will be asked to complete a Hypoglycemia Symptom Scores Questionnaire and cognitive testing
      within 24-36 hours post event. Participants will be contacted at 6 and 12 months following
      the index hospitalization to obtain information regarding recurrent episodes of hypoglycemia,
      need for re-hospitalization, and occurrence of any new diabetes related complications.
