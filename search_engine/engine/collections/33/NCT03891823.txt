    
      Primary Objective To compare the effectiveness of treatment with MitraClip to medical therapy
      in improving left ventricular remodelling (indexed left ventricular end-diastolic
      volume,(LVEDVi)) and functional capacity (distance walked on a 6MWT) at 12 months, in
      patients with moderate functional mitral regurgitation Secondary Objectives

        -  To evaluate the effects of MitraClip and medical therapy on change from baseline in
           mitral regurgitation severity at 12 months

        -  To evaluate the effects of MitraClip and medical therapy on change from baseline in
           quality of life at 12 months Exploratory Objectives To evaluate the effects of MitraClip
           and medical therapy on functional class, biomarkers, clinical events, parameters of
           physical activity, echocardiographic parameters and health economic assessments.
