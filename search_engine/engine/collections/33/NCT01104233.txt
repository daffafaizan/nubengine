      superelasticity alloys covered with polyurethane polyamide, and a thin silicone rubber
      membrane that is attached to the outer rim of the two rings. If the two rings are pulled
      apart, the device assumes a cylindrical shape. The outer diameter of each flexible ring is 12
      cm, and this device can be used for minilaparotomy wounds between 5 and 9cm long.
