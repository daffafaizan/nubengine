      0-1 years. Data collection included anthropometric measurements, blood sampling, body
      composition, bone measurements and physical performance measurements. Nutritional intake was
      recorded for seven consecutive days in order to evaluate nutrient intakes using an
      appropriate software and habitual physical activity was measured for the same days using
      accelerometers. Pubertal stage determined by Tanner scale. All measurements were made only
      once at the beginning of school year.
