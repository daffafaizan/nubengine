      are randomized to two groups, intervention and control. Both groups receive standard
      radiotherapy, which is currently the gold standard of care for such patients. The
      intervention group will also receive a vertebroplasty [single or multiple level(s)], while
      the control group will receive a simulated vertebroplasty, where local anesthesia and gentle
      hand manipulation will be used but the vertebra will not be accessed. The primary outcome is
      pain relief, though other factors such as quality of life and pain medications will also be
      evaluated.

      There will be an interim analysis after half of the patients have been treated with a
      follow-up of 3 months. In the analysis, comparisons will be made between the two groups and
      each patient's individual progress will also be analyzed.
