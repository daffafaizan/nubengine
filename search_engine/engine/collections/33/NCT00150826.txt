    
      A prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, comparative trial evaluating the effects of
      ACE inhibition on microvascular function in women with coronary flow reserve limitations and
      chest discomfort. Women who are enrolled in the WISE study can be enrolled into this
      ancillary study if they meet the study criteria. Women not enrolled in the WISE study can
      also be entered into this ancillary study as long as they too meet the study criteria. After
      WISE evaluations including symptom assessment using the Seattle Angina Questionnaire (SAQ)
      and documented reduced coronary blood flow reserve (<3.0 velocity), patients will be
      randomized to double-blind placebo or quinapril (started at 40 mg/d and titrated to 80 mg/d
      by the end of the first week). After treatment on the maximum tolerated dose for 16 weeks,
      patients will be reevaluated with coronary angiogram with coronary flow reserve measurements
      and assessment of angina using the SAQ.
