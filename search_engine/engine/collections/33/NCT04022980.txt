      containing induction chemotherapy in older (â‰¥ 65 years old) patients with previously
      untreated primary CNS lymphoma. Stage 1 is designed to evaluate the safety of nivolumab
      consolidation. We plan to use 3+3 design and start at the FDA approved single agent dose of
      nivolumab 480 mg intravenously every 4 weeks. Stage 2 is designed to evaluate the safety as
      well as efficacy of nivolumab consolidation after HD-MTX containing induction chemotherapy in
      an expansion cohort.
