      intervention for years in a wide variety of applications. Individuals with neck and shoulder
      pain represent a significant segment of the pain population seeking relief. However, there is
      a paucity of data from quality studies published in mainstream peer-reviewed journals
      supporting the effectiveness of this intervention. No well-designed prospective, randomized,
      controlled trials investigating the efficacy or effectiveness of this intervention in
      patients with chronic neck and shoulder pain have been reported. The need for such work is
      becoming increasingly important considering the progressively greater demands for
      evidence-based medicine to justify reimbursement for care.
