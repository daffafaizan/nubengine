      limited. In developing societies, there are often no protocols in intensive care. There are
      no teams again during intensive care. All work is done by physicians and other health
      workers. This may adversely affect health care workers. Intensive care science is new. The
      training first started in 2013. The newly graduated heavy-duty specialists can work where
      they do not want. The workload of the health workers working in the intensive care unit is
      high. We wanted to investigate burnout on healthcare workers in Turkey.
