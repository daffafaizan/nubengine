      source of subjects which may participate in a genotype guided investigation as to the
      predictability of response based on genotype. Response endpoints relate to lipid parameters
      and other variables of interest to cardiovascular endpoints. Subjects with genotypes of
      interest would then be enrolled into a short term clinical trial evaluating their response to
      fenofibrate based on their genetic profile ascertained from the screening phase.
