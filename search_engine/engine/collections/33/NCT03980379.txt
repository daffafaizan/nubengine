      evaluate the pharmacokinetic, safety and efficacy of 304 injection compared with rituximab
      injection. To avoid the impact of tumor burden on pharmacokinetics, this study will be
      conducted in CD20 positive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients who have achieved CR/CRu
      status and have not yet deteriorated or relapsed. All patients will be randomly averagely
      entered into the experimental group and the control group.
