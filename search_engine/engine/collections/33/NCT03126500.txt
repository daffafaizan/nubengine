      discharge, which has negative impact on post-hospital outcomes. In a cross-sectional analysis
      in malnourished, geriatric patients we will evaluate frailty-status and functional status
      using objective and subjective methods at hospital discharge. Moreover, we will investigate
      the association between nutritional Status and frailty, sarcopenia, quality of life and
      fatigue.
