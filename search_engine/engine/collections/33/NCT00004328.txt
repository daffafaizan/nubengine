      electrolytes and markers of extracellular volume are determined at baseline. A trial diet is
      then prescribed, with adjustments made to achieve a steady state with normal serum
      electrolytes. Exercise tolerance and muscle function are evaluated at steady state.

      Sodium and potassium are sequentially manipulated with diet, enalapril, and polystyrene
      sulfonate. Exercise tolerance is evaluated during each diet period.

      A treatment plan to maintain electrolyte balance is developed. The patient is followed
      monthly for 3 to 6 months, then every 3 months for up to 3 years.
