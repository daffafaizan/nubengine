      comparing Ferguson hemorrhoidectomy and THD in terms of recurrence rates at one-year. All
      subjects will already be scheduled for either Ferguson or THD hemorrhoidectomy, the surgery
      is NOT part of the research. Although a randomized study would control for variation among
      surgeons, this study design provides the best patient safety since the surgeons will perform
      the technique they do most frequently. Variability in the patient population will be managed
      with a conservative sample size, which allows for a multivariate analysis of the sample
      populations if any confounding variables are noted during initial data analyses. In addition,
      the variability will be minimized with stringent and detailed inclusion/exclusion criteria in
      terms of hemorrhoidal disease. Patients will be enrolled and followed for one year.
      Participating surgeons will be credentialed and each participating surgeon will enroll up to
      ten consecutive patients.

      The primary endpoint of this study is to compare Ferguson hemorrhoidectomy and THD in terms
      of recurrence rates at one-year. Recurrence is defined as prolapsing internal hemorrhoids at
      physical examination performed by a colorectal surgeon.
