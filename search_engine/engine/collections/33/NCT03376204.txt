      Recent findings suggest that pain can play an important role in terms of physical activity
      limitation in respiratory patients. Nevertheless, pain mechanisms and their clinical impact
      in patients with bronchiectasis have not been investigated yet. The objective of the
      observational study is to determine the somatosensorial profile in order to assess the
      presence of central pain mechanisms in patients with bronchiectasis.

      Methodology:

      Repeated-measures prospective cross-sectional study. A sample of patients diagnosed with
      bronchiectasis will be recruited and matched by age and sex with healthy controls. Pressure
      pain thresholds (PPTs), conditioned pain modulation (CPM) and referral pain will be assessed
      before and after the Incremental Shuttle Walking test (ISW). Levels of physical activity will
      be assessed using accelerometry during a 7-days period. Sleep quality (Pittsburgh sleep
      quality test), level of catastrophizing (Pain Catastrophizing Scale), level of sensitization
      (Central Sensitization Inventory) and level of anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and
      Depression) will be assessed. The assessments will be done twice: 1) at baseline; and 2) at 6
      months follow-up period.
