      myocardial infarction (MI) at 18 months post-surgery. Research has shown that peri-operative
      interventions may improve outcomes for high-risk patients. Cardiac bio-markers may be used to
      identify these high-risk patients, in particular pre- and post-operative NT-proBNP.

      Mahla found that by comparing surgery outcomes with NT-proBNP concentrations
      peri-operatively, high-risk patients could be identified and subsequent therapeutic decisions
      could be made to minimise adverse outcomes.

      Van Kimmenade evaluated patients with acute heart failure and found that galectin-3 (Gal-3)
      was the best predictor of 60-day mortality compared with NT-proBNP and apelin (another
      cardiac marker), whereas NT-proBNP was the most useful for diagnosing HF. The authors also
      found that the combination of both markers (Gal-3 and NT-proBNP) have an even higher
      predictive value for outcome.

      The predictive role of troponin I (cTnI) has been observed in a paper by Bursi et al. (2005)
      where patients undergoing elective major vascular surgery were stratified using the American
      College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines and followed up over a
      period of 24 months. Patients in every group with an elevated post-operative cTnI (â‰¥100ng/L)
      were at greater risk of either MI or death.

      The successful identification of high-risk patients can go on to have interventional
      risk-reducing pharmacological, therapeutic, diagnostic, or observational measures.

      Prevention of cardiovascular events, particular for an aging population, can have positive
      impact on both the patient and society as a whole as it may result in patients maintaining
      their independence, avoiding major illness, avoiding nursing home care and living longer.
