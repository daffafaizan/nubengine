      common entity. Moreover, current treatment options are largely ineffective and do not change
      the natural course of the disease. Pre-clinical evidence supports somatostatin receptors
      expression in the lung of patients with IPF. Recently new PET tracers (Somatostatin analogues
      labelled with 68Gallium), specifically binding to somatostatin receptors, have been developed
      and are used in neuroendocrine tumours clinical trials.

      Aim of the present study is to evaluate the role of 68Ga-DOTA-NOC PET/CT in patients with
      idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, in particular in patients with IPF/UIP and in cases with NSIP,
      that are characterized by a more indolent progression. PET/CT data will be compared with HRCT
      findings for the early detection of fibrotic areas and to non-invasively assess somatostatin
      receptors expression at lung level in these patients, with potential therapeutic
      implications. Moreover, the SUVmax (maximum standardized uptake value) will be analyzed in
      comparison with disease site and extension on HRCT.
