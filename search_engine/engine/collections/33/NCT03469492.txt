      their insulin treatment regimens as reflected by lower baseline brain intracellular fructose
      levels and higher intracellular glutathione levels. Furthermore, following longer-term
      improved glycemic control, patients may also have down-regulation of the pathway as reflected
      by decreased production of intracellular fructose in response to hyperglycemic clamp.
