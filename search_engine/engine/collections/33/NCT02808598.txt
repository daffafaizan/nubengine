      The purpose of this study is to test a program designed to increase African American and
      Hispanic American women's scientific literacy, knowledge of clinical trials, and to
      facilitate breast cancer clinical trial participation.

      A validation study was also conducted to validate several measures for the Hispanic American
      and African American populations.

      The experimental group watched an education program concerning breast cancer clinical trials
      while the control group watched an education program on neighborhood safety.

      To examine willingness to participate in research was assessed by a post-intervention
      invitation to complete a sleep diary.
