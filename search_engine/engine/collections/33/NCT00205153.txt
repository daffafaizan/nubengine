      pharmacists and technicians attended a 7-hour TEAM training program on BP monitoring, JNC 7
      guidelines, and specially designed tools for assessing and improving medication adherence,
      lifestyle, patient scheduling and retention, and collaboration with physicians. Intervention
      teams received specially designed tools, automatic BP monitors, and furniture for setting up
      and implementing a blood pressure clinic at their pharmacy. Staff from control pharmacies
      received printed information only and provided "usual care". Outcomes will be determined by
      blinded data collectors who will re-check patients' BPs and administer follow-up surveys
      after 6 and 12 months. Researchers also will survey pharmacy staff and review pharmacy
      records to determine changes in refill adherence and prescribing.
