    
      Background:

        -  Most men diagnosed with prostate cancer will present with intermediate or high-risk
           disease, and many develop castrate resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) as curative
           strategies are often unsuccessful

        -  Treatment options typically involve radical prostatectomy (RP) or radiation therapy (RT)
           in combination with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT)

        -  PET imaging based on prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA), including use of the
           radiotracer DCFPyL, which binds PSMA, has emerged as a sensitive modality to detect
           localized and metastatic prostate cancer

        -  It is unknown how androgen-targeted therapy affects expression of the androgen-
           regulated PSMA gene, FOLH1, and 18F -DCFPyL-PET/CT sensitivity; and, the correlation
           between response on 18F -DCFPyL-PET/CT imaging and clinical response needs further
           evaluation

        -  The use of highly effective androgen pathway inhibitors enzalutamide and abiraterone
           offers an opportunity to understand the characteristics of 18F -DCFPyL-PET imaging
           during treatment while potentially improving the cure rate of men with potentially
           lethal localized prostate cancer

        -  There remains a great need for improved techniques to determine mechanisms of treatment
           response and resistance

      Objectives:

      - To test the feasibility of 18F -DCFPyL-PET/CT for the localization of prostate cancer
      before, during, and after pre-operative treatment with ADT, enzalutamide, and
      abiraterone/prednisone in patients negative for metastatic disease

      Eligibility:

        -  Pathologic diagnosis of castration-sensitive prostate cancer with intermediate- or high-
           risk features and no evidence of metastases beyond N1 on conventional imaging

        -  Candidates for radical prostatectomy

        -  Testosterone levels greater than or equal to 100 ng/dL

        -  ECOG PS 0-1

        -  Men age greater than or equal to 18 years

      Design:

        -  Patients will be treated with ADT, enzalutamide, and abiraterone/prednisone for 6
           months, followed by standard of care radical prostatectomy (RP)

        -  18F-DCFPyL-PET/CT and mpMRI scans prior to treatment, during months 3-5 and after 6
           months of treatment

        -  Prostate tumor biopsy (MR/US-guided) samples for research analyses at baseline and after
           mid-treatment imaging (post-month 2)

        -  It is anticipated that approximately 1.5 to 2 years may be required for accrual of up to
           25 evaluable subjects.
