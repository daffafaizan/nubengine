    
      Pilot study for testing feasibility of cross sectional integrative exposure study.

      Strategy : Exposure assessment of young children to PFAS with simultaneous measurement of
      internal (serum) and external doses (diet, indoor environment: contamination data and human
      exposure factors; quantity ingested and breathed).

      Expected outcomes :

      Assessment of feasibility to obtain:

        -  original data on children's body burden

        -  original contamination data for food, water, air and dust ;

        -  Matching of these data to identify main sources and pathways of exposure.
