      been available and used for the treatment of chronic pain in Europe since late 2011. Clinical
      practice and pre/post market studies have shown that stimulation of the DRG can significantly
      reduce chronic intractable pain of various aetiologies. However, there are no studies as yet
      specifically investigating the application of DRG stimulation in the treatment of chronic
      pain affecting the upper limbs. Furthermore, there are very few studies of SCS generally, in
      an upper limb pain population, despite this being a group often referred for and treated with
      SCS in tertiary, interventional pain practices. Due to several limitations of traditional SCS
      systems, chiefly concerning the stability of stimulation induced paraesthesia, DRG
      stimulation is being increasingly utilised in its place for this condition.
