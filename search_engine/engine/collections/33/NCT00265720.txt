      African Americans continue to be disproportionately affected by this disease. The Colorectal
      Cancer Screening Intervention Trial (CCSIT) is designed to test and expand a public health
      intervention that combines social marketing and community-coalition building efforts.

      The purpose of this study is to 1) evaluate the effects of three different approaches on
      knowledge, attitudes and beliefs (KABs) about colorectal cancer; 2) to examine the effects of
      three different approaches to adherence to screening guidelines and 3) to evaluate the
      independent role of setting on screening practices.

      Participants age 50 and over are recruited from churches, clinics and senior sites which
      allows us to examine the impact of setting on participant recruitment and changes to KAB. Pre
      and post questionnaires are administered to determine the knowledge attitudes and behaviors
      (KAB) related to screening and to measure psychosocial parameters (self-esteem, perceived
      stress and social support). These persons are randomized into one of four groups, the control
      group and three intervention arms: (1) one-on-one counseling sessions, (2) small group
      educational sessions and (3) financial incentives interventions where out of pocket cost for
      screening is reimbursed. The counseling and educational interventions incorporate the Health
      Belief Model and Social Learning Theory.
