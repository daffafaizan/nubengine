      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/phase II recommended dose and describe
      toxicities related to PD-0332991 (palbociclib isethionate) in children with retinoblastoma
      protein 1 (Rb1) positive recurrent, progressive or refractory primary central nervous system
      (CNS) tumors.

      II. To determine plasma pharmacokinetics of PD-0332991 in children with Rb1positive
      recurrent, progressive or refractory primary CNS tumors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To record preliminary evidence of efficacy of PD-0332991 in children with recurrent CNS
      tumors.

      II. To evaluate cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)4/6, cyclin D1-3, Ink4a-ARF copy-number
      variations in available tumor tissue by array comparative, genomic hybridization (aCGH).

      III. To explore the potential relationships between the pharmacokinetics of PD-0332991 and
      pharmacodynamic response (e.g. percentage change in absolute neutrophil count [ANC], platelet
      counts).

      IV. To explore the pharmacogenetic polymorphisms in PD-0332991 metabolizing enzymes and
      transporters and relate these polymorphisms to PD-0332991 pharmacokinetics.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive palbociclib isethionate orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21. Treatment
      repeats every 4 weeks for 26 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.
