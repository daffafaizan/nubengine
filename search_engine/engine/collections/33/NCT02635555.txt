    
      Study design is prospective, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled.

      Patients presenting for elective cesarean section under neuraxial block and meeting inclusion
      criteria will be randomized to two groups:

      Group 1: Fixed dose group: Bupivacaine 12 mg, Fentanyl 15 mcg, Morphine 100 mcg Group 2:
      Height and weight adjusted bupivacaine dose, fentanyl 15 mcg, morphine 100 mcg Patients are
      fasted as per Canadian guidelines prior to the procedure. All patients have an IV cannula
      inserted,baseline vitals recorded and routine blood work checked prior to blockade. Routine
      monitoring (as per Canadian Anesthesia Society (CAS) guidelines) occur during and after the
      procedure. This includes pulse oximetry (SpO2), ECG and non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP).
      NIBP monitoring occurs every two minutes for the first 20 minutes post spinal and every 5
      minutes thereafter. Oxygen via Hudson mask or nasal prongs is available if required.

      Spinal anesthetic is performed with standard doses of drugs and the level of sensory block is
      tested with ice. Motor block is tested with Bromage scale just before prepping and draping.
      Once deemed adequate, surgery begins. During surgery, phenylephrine/ephedrine is given to
      maintain blood pressure as necessary. After surgery, patients are monitored in a recovery
      area until fit to be transferred to their rooms. If patient reports extreme discomfort or
      sharp pain during the surgery,conversion to general anesthetic is as per the discretion of
      the attending anesthesiologist.
