      undergo BPDLL and 12 twelve patients with DM 2 and BMI 40-50 kg/m2 will undergo LSG. The
      patients will be evaluated before and 1, 3 and 12 months after surgery with an oral glucose
      tolerance test. The investigators aim to investigate the effects of surgery on diabetes
      resolution, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and also on fasting, and glucose-stimulated insulin,
      glucagon, ghrelin, peptide-YY and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) responses during during an
      oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Resolution of diabetes mellitus will be evaluated
      according to the criteria of American Diabetes Association with an OGTT. The effects on
      appetite and satiety will be also evaluated with the use of visual analog scores.
