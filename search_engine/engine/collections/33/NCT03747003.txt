      HIV-infected men in order to characterize hypogonadism by assessing circulating total
      testosterone with either Liquid Chromatography tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) or
      chemiluminescent immunoassay. Furthermore, secondary aim is to assess the erectile function
      through the use of validated questionnaires (International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF)
