      between urban foodscape and food styles in Montpellier Metropole (France).

      JArDinS consists of a pretest-posttest quasi-experimental research and includes an
      experimental group of new gardeners starting gardening in a community garden in Montpellier
      and a control group comprising participants from a survey on food behaviors undertaken as
      part of SURFOOD-Foodscapes project. Participants will be surveyed at enrollment and 12 months
