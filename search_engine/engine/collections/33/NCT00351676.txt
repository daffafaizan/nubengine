    
      The overall goal of the COLLABORATE study is to improve processes of care and patient
      outcomes by optimizing drug therapy via a hospital pharmacy practice model that integrates
      clinical pharmacists into the patient care team.

      The intervention consists of a clinical pharmacist assigned to the patient care team for the
      purpose of providing proactive clinical pharmacy services. The study pharmacist will be
      available during normal office hours 5 days per week to provide clarification of the
      patient's medication history, identify and resolve actual and potential patient specific drug
      related problems/issues, participate in patient care rounds, provide drug information to the
      patient care team, provide patient education and discharge medication counselling, and
      provide physician and/or nursing staff education. The anticipated pharmacist to patient ratio
      is approximately 1:20.

      Control patients will receive usual care. Usual care consists of reactive clinical pharmacy
      services (i.e. drug related issues identified as orders are received, or by patient profile
      review) provided by a ward based, not team based, clinical pharmacist.
