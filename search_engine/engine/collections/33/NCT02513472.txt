      combination with pembrolizumab. Approximately 6 participants may be enrolled in the Phase 1b
      part of the study. The Phase 2 part will evaluate the tumor objective response rate (ORR)
      when treated with eribulin mesylate in combination with pembrolizumab in all participants and
      will also evaluate ORR in stratum 2 participants and compare with the historical response
      rate of pembrolizumab monotherapy 10 percent (%) in participants with mTNBC previously
      treated with >=1 line of prior chemotherapy in the metastatic setting. Approximately 170
      mTNBC participants (including participants in Phase 1b who are on RP2D level) will be
      enrolled in Phase 2.
