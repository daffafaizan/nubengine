      antihypertensive therapy on new onset atrial fibrillation and clinical outcomes in septic
      shock. The two cohorts will be septic shock patients that were: 1) not on either a chronic
      β-blocker or angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor (ACE inhibitor) or 2) on a chronic
      β-blocker, on chronic ACE-Inhibitor, or on both chronic β-blocker and ACE-inhibitor
