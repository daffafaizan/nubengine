      expense of proteins and glucose. Partly this shift in metabolism is caused by increasing GH
      secretion, but exactly how growth hormone exerts these effects remains to be further
      investigated.

      10 healthy lean young men are studied at 4 different occasions in a randomized single-blinded
      cross-over study. 1: after 12 hours of fasting + GH bolus, 2: after 36 hours of fasting + GH
      bolus, 3: after 36 hours + saline, 4: after 36 hours of fasting + Somavert.

      Aim:

        -  to study the signal transduction in muscle and fat tissue

        -  to study the metabolism during fasting

        -  to study the intrahepatic fat content using magnetic resonance techniques
