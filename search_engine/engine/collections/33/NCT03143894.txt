      quality of life and productivity in breast cancer survivors. Transcranial direct current
      stimulation (tDCS) has been shown to improve both fatigue and cognition. Here tDCS will be
      used in a randomized, sham-controlled, double-blind, cross-over trial in women who have
      finished treatment of breast cancer and who report persistent fatigue.

      Participants will complete measures of fatigue and cognition before and after five
      consecutive days of active or sham tDCS then complete questionnaires by phone one week later.
      Participants will return about one month later for another five days of participation,
      followed by another brief study phone call the following week.
