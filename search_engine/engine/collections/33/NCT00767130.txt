      increasingly aggressive usage and dosage of statins. Their main clinically relevant safety
      risk is statin-induced myopathy (SIM) evidenced as a constellation of neuromuscular side
      effects (NMSE) that include myalgias (muscle aches, cramps, weakness) and myositis (monitored
      by elevation of serum creatine kinase [CK] activity). NMSEs are disabling to 3-20% of
      patients on statins, require alteration of therapy, and reduce compliance. NMSEs vary in
      extent between drugs and from patient to patient. We will develop a novel product termed SIM
      PhyzioTypeâ„¢ system to provide clinicians with individualized information for each patient on
      the safest statin drug among atorvastatin, simvastatin, and rosuvastatin, the 3 most
      prescribed statins. The PhyzioType consists of a multi-SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism)
      ensemble that, interpreted with a biomathematical algorithm, predicts drug response. We have
      developed a prototype PhyzioType system incorporating predictive models for myalgia, serum CK
      activity, and LDLc reduction for atorvastatin and simvastatin patients. We will recruit to
      obtain 250 patients treated with each drug and use existing clinical records to characterize
      their NMSE and LDLc responses. We will use physiogenomic analysis to identify those SNPs that
      differentiate the risk of NMSEs among the 3 statins and combine them into the SIM PhyzioType
      system. This work will also contribute to the pharmacology of SIM and unravel new
      pharmaceutical targets. We will create and validate the SIM PhyzioType system with clinically
      useful prediction of NMSEs and potency for each of the 3 statins. In Phase III a prospective
      trial is planned for FDA approval of the SIM PhyzioType product.
