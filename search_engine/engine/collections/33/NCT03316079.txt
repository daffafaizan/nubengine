    
      Controlled randomized, cross-over, single blind trial conducted at University Hospital of
      Bordeaux (France).

      Inclusion criteria: Patients (>18 yo) intubated [internal diameter (ID) 7 to 8], sedated
      [Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS) -3 to -5], connected to IMV at least 48 h and
      expected IMV of at least 24h.

      Exclusion criteria: Lung disease or pulmonary parenchyma damage, respiratory inspired
      fraction of oxygen (FiO2) >60% and/or positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) > 10
      centimetres of water (cmH2O) and/or hemodynamic instability (mean arterial pressure (MAP) <
      65 millimetres of mercury (mmHg) although use of vasopressors] , hemofiltered patients
      through a central jugular catheter, patients on strict dorsal decubitus by medical
      prescription, and high respiratory infectious risk.

      Design: All patients will receive CPT followed by ETS twice daily. However, patients will
      randomly receive in one of the sessions an additional treatment of MI-E before ETS. MI-E
      treatment consists in 4 series of 5 in-expiratory cycles at +/- 40 cmH2O, 3 and 2 sec of
      inspiratory-expiratory time and 1 sec pause between cycles.

      Variables: Mucus clearance will be assessed through wet volume of suctioned sputum through a
      suction catheter connected to a sterile collector container. Pulmonary mechanics will be
      measured before, after and 1 h post-intervention through a pneumotachograph (PNT). Peak
      expiratory flow (PEF) generated by MI-E will be continuously measured through a PNT.
      Hemodynamic measurements will be recorded before, after and 1 h post-intervention.
