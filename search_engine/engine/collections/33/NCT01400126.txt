      the plasma level of CRP, IL-6 ; to improve the response to anemia to erythropoietin therapy ;
      to promote better nutrition as evidenced by increase in plasma albumin value , estimated dry
      body weight, midarm muscle circumference and urea-nitrogen appearance rate; to reduce plasma
      level of Î²2-microglobulin and pentosidine ; to dely carpal tunnel syndrome ; to slow the loss
      of residual renal function; and to lower cardiovascular morbidity.The aim of this study is to
      prospectively evaluate the effect of dialysis performed with ultra-pure water (UPW)in
      comparison with dialysis with the use of conventional water system. Patients enrolled into
      this study will be evaluated at initial period of one month treated with conventional water
      system (-30 to 0 days). Then water system will be switched to ultra-pure water system with
      the use of filter added to the dialysis machine (Gambro). After switching to UPW system the
      patients will be followed for a period of one year (days 0-365). Primary end point will be
      change in CRP. Additional parameters: Blood pressure, adverse events during dialysis,
      hemoglobin levels and white-blood cell counts.
