      inflammatory stimuli and becomes apparent by elevated levels of biochemical markers such as
      CRP, IL-6, cellular activation markers etc. Chronic inflammation is linked to clinical signs
      and symptoms and cardiovascular mortality in dialysis patients. Inflamed dialysis patients
      show impaired response to erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESA) related to reduced iron
      utilization (functional iron deficiency) and elevated CRP levels are associated with a
      greater need for ESA to meet hemoglobin targets. If absolute iron deficiency can been
      excluded, EPO resistance is likely related to 'inflammatory block'.

      The high molecular permeability of the Theralite high cut-off membrane allows for significant
      clearance of cytokines and other pro-inflammatory solutes by hemodialysis as shown in
      previous trials with high cut-off dialyzers. The study therefore aims to demonstrate that
      Theralite dialysis is effective in reducing chronic inflammation in ESRD patients, thereby
      improving EPO responsiveness. If this can be demonstrated, application of Theralite
      hemodialysis may reduce morbidity and mortality in the long term in ESRD patients.
