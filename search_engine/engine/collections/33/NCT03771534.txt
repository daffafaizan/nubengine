      useful as a diagnostic test to more accurately detect TGA patients with poor vs. good
      neonatal intracardiac mixing of blood, based on the in-utero response to oxygen exposure.
      Acute maternal oxygen administration will transiently increase the fetal oxygen levels to
      those reached at birth with spontaneous breathing, thus simulating conditions that will
      naturally occur at the time of birth. Echocardiogram and MRI will be used to examine the
      effects on the fetal circulation. The prenatal findings will then be compared to the neonatal
      presentation.

      The investigators postulate that conditions that predispose newborns to acute neonatal
      compromise will be detectable and distinguishable prior to birth by echocardiography, MRI, or
      by combining the findings of both exams.
