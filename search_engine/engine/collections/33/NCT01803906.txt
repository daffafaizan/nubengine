      know that there are about 1,300 genes responsible for mitochondrial function. Thus, there are
      a lot of mutated genes to be discovered out there. Currently, most patients with suspected or
      known mitochondrial disorders do not have genetic confirmation of the disease.

      The goal of this project is to perform biochemical and DNA analysis on tissue samples of
      patients with mitochondrial disorders to find new genes that might be involved in
      mitochondrial dysfunction.

      Leftover patient tissue samples will be obtained for analysis from within the Columbia
      Presbyterian Medical Center. Left over patient samples may also be sent from outside the
      institution. This is not a "first-step" in the diagnostic process, but rather an option for
      evaluation in patient samples for which no known diagnosis or genetic confirmation has been
      made.

      The research laboratory does not guarantee that a sample will be analyzed. Sample analysis is
      performed according to research interest. If they choose, patients can be contacted should
      laboratory findings provide insight into their disease.
