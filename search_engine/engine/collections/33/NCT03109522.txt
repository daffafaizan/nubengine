      breast cancer (BC). Surgery for BC includes axillary surgery with either sentinel lymph node
      biopsy (SLNB) or axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). Lymphedema occurs due to removal or
      disruption of lymphatic drainage of the arm that overlaps with drainage of the breast. The
      risk of lymphedema increases significantly with adjuvant radiation. Axillary reverse mapping
      (ARM) is a technique where blue dye is injected into the upper arm at surgery, allowing
      direct visualization of arm lymphatics and nodes during either SLNB or ALND. This allows
      preservation of arm lymphatics unless there is suspicion of metastatic disease in ARM
      lymphatics or if the ARM node is/are also the sentinel lymph node. Studies to date have
      largely been observational cohort studies, and mainly with low risk patients undergoing SLNB
      only. There is only one published randomized controlled trial, and this included only
      patients undergoing modified radical mastectomy.Our proposal is a prospective randomized
      pilot study. The study population includes patients undergoing axillary surgery (SLNB with
      mastectomy or ALND with either BCS or mastectomy or completion ALND after positive SLNB). The
      intervention group will undergo ARM; the control will undergo standard surgical treatment.
      Both groups will undergo standardized baseline and postoperative arm measurements and
      patients will complete symptom and quality of life questionnaires. The purpose is to
      determine the feasibility of the ARM technique, its accuracy in identifying and sparing arm
      lymphatics, and its ability to reduce the risk of lymphedema.
