    
      This is a phase 3b, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, double-dummy,
      study of the efficacy and safety of apremilast, etanercept, and placebo, in adults with
      moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.

      250 participants will be randomized 1:1:1 to the three treatment groups. All subjects will
      receive both tablets and injections through Week 16.

      The study will consist of four phases:

        -  Screening Phase - up to 35 days

        -  Double-blind Placebo-controlled Phase - Weeks 0-16

        -  Apremilast Extension Phase - Weeks 16-104

        -  Post-treatment Observational Follow-up Phase

      During the double-blind, placebo-controlled phase, subjects will receive treatment with one
      of the following:

        -  apremilast (APR) 30 mg tablets orally twice a day (BID) plus once weekly (QW)
           evaluator/subject-blinded subcutaneous (SC) saline (placebo) injections (1 mL x 2
           injections SC), or

        -  etanercept (ETN) 50 mg evaluator/subject-blinded subcutaneous (SC) once weekly (QW)
           injections (2 x 25 mg) plus placebo tablets orally twice a day (BID), or

        -  placebo tablets and evaluator/subject-blinded subcutaneous (SC) saline (placebo)
           injections.

      All subjects will be asked to participate in a 4-week Post-treatment Observational Follow-up
      Phase either upon completion of the study or upon discontinuation of investigational product
      for those subjects who terminate the study early.
