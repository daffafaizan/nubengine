    
      This study will explore the following objectives:

        1. To assess if the event-free survival at one-year post-transplant for research
           participants with high-risk hematologic malignancies can be improved following HAPLO
           hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) using a graft depleted of CD3+ cells ex vivo
           and a reduced intensity-conditioning regimen.

      Secondary objectives:

        1. To estimate the one-year overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) for
           research participants who receive this study treatment.

        2. To estimate the cumulative incidence of relapse for research participants who receive
           this study treatment.

        3. To estimate the rate of overall grade III-IV acute GVHD, and the rate and severity of
           chronic GVHD in research participants.

        4. To estimate the incidence of non-hematologic regimen-related toxicity and
           regimen-related mortality in the first 100 days post-transplant.

      Exploratory objectives:

        1. To explore the biologic significance of soluble interleukin-2 receptor and immunologic
           state [quantitative lymphocyte studies, V beta spectratyping, T-cell receptor excision
           circles (TREC) assay] to predict the development of acute and chronic GVHD in these
           research participants.

        2. To measure the pharmacokinetics of Campath-1H in pediatric HAPLO HSCT recipients

      NOTE: This protocol originally used muromonab (OKT3) in the conditioning regimen to prepare
      participants for haploidentical HCT. After muromonab became unavailable from the manufacturer
      in 2010, muromonab was replaced by alemtuzumab (Campath-1H) for use in subsequent
      participants.
