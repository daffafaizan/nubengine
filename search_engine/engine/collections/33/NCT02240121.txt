    
      RECD3125 is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter, multiregional,
      52-week study to assess the efficacy and safety of rifaximin DR tablets for the induction of
      clinical remission and endoscopic response at 16 weeks followed by clinical and endoscopic
      remission after 52 weeks of continuous therapy in participants with active moderate Crohn's
      disease.

      Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 allocation to rifaximin or placebo at the beginning
      of the treatment period and will maintain treatment assignment throughout the duration of the
      study. Ileocolonoscopy will be performed on all participants at baseline, between Weeks 16
      and 17 (end of the Induction Phase), and following completion of the 36-week Long Term
      Treatment Phase (Week 52).
