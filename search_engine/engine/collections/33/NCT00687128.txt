      aerobic exercise versus non-aerobic (stretching) exercise on direct measurements of insulin
      resistance and variables associated with the metabolic syndrome. This 6-month intervention
      will be followed by an additional 6-month follow-up period during which subjects will be
      encouraged to maintain their exercise regimen (along with their prescribed diet) but without
      scheduled supervision. Behavioral variables associated with adherence will be analyzed along
      with changes in the above physiological variables.
