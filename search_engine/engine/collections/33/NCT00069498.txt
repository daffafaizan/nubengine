      significant numbers of activated memory T lymphocytes, it is a prime site for HIV infection
      and amplification. Mucosal T cells are extremely vulnerable to HIV infection due, in part, to
      a marked increase in CCR5 co-receptors. Understanding the impact of HIV on the
      gastrointestinal-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) is essential and may provide insight into
      the profound drop in mucosal lymphocytes during early infection, persistence of tissue viral
      replication in the setting of undetectable plasma viral activity, and compartmentalization of
      HIV.

      Pre-clinical studies have demonstrated that the mucosal compartment in HIV uninfected
      individuals is characterized by features which enhance vulnerability to HIV infection
      compared to blood. Once infected, the mucosal response to HIV is inflammation. This study
      will further evaluate the inflammatory response of mucosal tissue to HIV by examining the
      effect of the anti-inflammatory drug 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) on the gut mucosa.

      Participants in this study will be randomly assigned to receive either 5-ASA or placebo.
      Participants will be enrolled in the study for 8 weeks; participants may then elect to
      continue on 5-ASA for an additional 16 weeks. Participants will have four screening visits in
      the month prior to beginning the study and four study visits during the 8-week study.
      Assessments will include medical interviews and physical exams, sigmoidoscopy with mucosal
      biopsy, and blood tests.
