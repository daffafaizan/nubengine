      study. Each patient underwent complete ophthalmologic examination. Blood was obtained from
      each patient for testing the endocrine functions and determination of a panel of
      autoantibodies to the following: Side-chain cleavage enzyme (SSC), Aromatic L-amino acid
      decarboxylase (AADC), Tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH),Tyrosine hydroxylase ( TH), 17
      α-hydroxylase (17α-OH), Cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2), 21-hydroxylase (21-OH), Potassium
      channel regulatory protein (KCNRG), Tyrosine phosphatase-like protein IA-2 (IA-2), Glutamic
      acid decarboxylase 65 (GAD65), NACT Leucine-Rich-Repeat-Protein 5 (NALP5), and Interleukin
      (IL) 22.
