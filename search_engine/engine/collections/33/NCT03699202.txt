      adult outpatients with RSV infection. Approximately 160 eligible patients who have been
      recently diagnosed with RSV infection are planned to be enrolled into the study. Symptom
      scores of patients before and after treatment will be evaluated. Meanwhile, nasopharyngeal
      samples and blood samples will be collected for virological and pharmacokinetics evaluations.
      The evaluation of the safety and tolerability will include AE/SAE, vital signs, physical
      examination, laboratory examination and 12-lead ECGs. The total study duration for each
      patient will be 20 days.
