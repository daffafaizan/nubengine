    
      To investigate whether tranexamic acid (TXA) reduces perioperative blood loss and transfusion
      requirement in pediatric patients with secondary scoliosis undergoing posterior spinal
      fusion.In addition determination of the optimal TXA dosing for perioperative reduction of
      blood loss and transfusion requirement as well as to evaluate use of thromboelastography
      (TEG) as a measure of coagulation and fibrinolysis in pediatric patients with secondary
      scoliosis undergoing posterior spinal fusion (this may help guide blood product therapy).

      The investigation will determine the effects of TXA on the TEG profile and whether
      plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) level affects bleeding and transfusion requirement
      during scoliosis surgery. Finally to investigate whether PAI-1 level affects bleeding in
      response to TXA during scoliosis surgery.
