      not less effective than the active comparator (Klean-Prep with Dulcolax), with regards to the
      overall quality of bowel preparation in subjects undergoing colonoscopy. It was designed to
      measure the number of subjects whose colons are cleansed successfully.

      The primary efficacy endpoint is the percentage of subjects that achieve excellent or good
      cleansing (success rate) in the Aronchick Scale.

      The secondary efficacy variables include:

        1. Proportion of successes (excellent, good, or fair) by individual colon segment
           (ascending, transverse, descending), which are assessed with the Ottawa scale6.

        2. Mean bowel preparation score assessed with Ottawa Scale by adding points for the
           cleansing of three parts of colon and points for amount of fluid in the bowel.

        3. Percentage of subject's responses to the acceptability and tolerability

      Safety was assessed at each clinic visit by evaluation of the following variables:

        1. Percentage of subjects occurred solicited event (nausea, vomiting, chest pain and
           dizziness) during the preparation.

        2. Percentage of subjects with treatment-emergent adverse events during the study period.
