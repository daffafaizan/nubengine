    
      This double-blind placebo-controlled pilot study will assess the use of low dose naltrexone
      (LDN) and NAD+ for the treatment of patients with post-COVID-19 syndrome (long-COVID-19).

      Patients with a positive test for SARS-CoV-2 1-4 months before enrollment will be included.
      Subjects should have self diagnosed post-COVID19 syndrome and experiencing persistent fatigue
      since positive test. Patients will be screened using the fatigue survey and cases with a
      moderate to severe score will be included.

      Patients will receive LDN and NAD+ treatment or a corresponding placebo tablet and patch
      (control group) for 12 weeks. In this study, fatigue and quality of life will be assessed
      using validated surveys. Surveys will be conducted at baseline (at the time of enrollments,
      before treatment), and at 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks. The improvement of scores from baseline
      levels will be assessed.
