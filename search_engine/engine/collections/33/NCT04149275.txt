    
      Primary Objectives:

      â€¢ To estimate the proportion of patients with recurrent carcinosarcoma, who survive
      progression-free for at least 6 months, treated with cabozantinib + nivolumab + ipilimumab in
      the second-line and beyond setting (per iRECIST).

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To evaluate time to progression (Time Frame: From the date the patient received the
           first study treatment dose until the date of first documented progression, assessed up
           to 2 years). Progression Free Survival (PFS) according to iRECIST.

        -  To determine the nature and degree of toxicity of cabozantinib + nivolumab + ipilimumab
           in this cohort of patients. Toxicity according to CTCAE v4.03

        -  To estimate the overall survival (OS) of patients with carcinosarcoma treated with
           cabozantinib + nivolumab + ipilimumab

      Exploratory Objectives:

        -  To determine expression of biomarkers, which will include PD-L1 and MET expression by
           IHC, MSI status by NGS, and other relevant potential biomarkers.

        -  To determine whether these marker expression levels alone or in combination are
           associated with response, PFS, and/or overall survival.
