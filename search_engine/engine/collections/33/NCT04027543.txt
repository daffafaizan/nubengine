      better than surgery alone in patients with resectable oesophageal carcinoma, but higher
      quality evidence is needed as new findings have emerged regarding this issue.Previous
      evidence-based findings and the current guidelines have not established a survival advantage
      of NCRT over NCT or an acceptable safety profile of the addition of radiotherapy to NCT;
      whether NCRT or NCT is more effective for the treatment of adenocarcinoma or squamous cell
      carcinoma of the oesophagus is unclear.This study aims to provide comprehensive efficacy and
      safety profiles of NCRT versus NCT versus surgery alone in resectable oesophageal carcinoma.
