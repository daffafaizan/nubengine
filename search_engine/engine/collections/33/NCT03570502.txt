      assisted by radiofrequency energy (RF) have been used, both in experimental studies and in
      clinical trials, in order to try to reduce the POPF rate. One of these devices is the
      Coolinside®, which is approved for this indication and is currently used in selected cases,
      at the Hospital del Mar, among other centers.

      Although there are several published studies based on similar technology, the existing
      publications on the use of Coolinside® in the pancreas have been made in rat and pig animal
      models. In particular, the most recent study published by Dorcaratto et al. compares the
      Coolinside device vs. the mechanical stapler in porcine model when performing distal
      pancreatectomies. The results suggest that the Coolinside device was more efficient in the
      control of the POPF than the stapler with a POPF index of 12% vs. 36%.

      Therefore, this study aims to obtain more clinical evidence about the use of Coolinside in
      pancreatic resections within a clinical context.
