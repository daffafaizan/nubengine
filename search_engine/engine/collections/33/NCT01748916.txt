      carrot and tomato carotenoids. Previously, vitamin A deposition in rat livers was studied,
      showing that carotenoid bioavailability from papaya is higher than from spinach, parsley and
      carrots. Detailed knowledge about human carotenoid absorption and conversion from papaya
      fruit compared to other food sources is still lacking.
