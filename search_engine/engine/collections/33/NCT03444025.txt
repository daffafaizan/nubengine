      some selected early cases followed by surgery with or without adjuvant radiotherapy. NACT is
      aimed to induce pathologic complete response (pCR) in tumor and lymph nodes, pCR is proofed
      to be a surrogate and reliable predictive factor of survival rates in TNBC. This study will
      evaluate the effect of adding LHRH analogue, goserelin, to the standard neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy. Following completion of neoadjuvant therapy, patients will undergo breast
      conservative surgery or mastectomy. Post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy axillary staging will be
      required, but the choice of the procedure will be at the physician's discretion.
      Postoperative radiation therapy will be given at the physician's discretion. The use of
      partial breast irradiation techniques will not be allowed. The primary endpoint will be the
      rate of pathologic complete response. The secondary endpoints will be 3-year-disease free
      survival, clinical response and toxicity. Exploratory endpoints will be correlation of the
      LHRH receptor expression level with the pCR. The sample size for the trial will be 180
      patients accrued over a period of 2 years. Definitive analysis of the primary endpoints is
      expected at year 3.
