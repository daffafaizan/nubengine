      to one's community, are an important part of a culture of health. Meaningful experiences in
      civic engagement and community connectedness are transformative for young people - especially
      for youth from marginalized backgrounds, who often feel voiceless and excluded from
      decision-making in civic and social institutions. Theories and correlational evidence point
      to positive associations between civic engagement (e.g., volunteering, voting, and feelings
      of civic empowerment) and better mental, physical, and behavioral health and wellbeing.
      Meaningful civic engagement experiences may have an especially powerful effect on health and
      wellbeing for those from traditionally marginalized backgrounds. However, causal pathways
      between civic interventions, civic outcomes, and health and wellbeing outcomes among are not
      firmly established. Further, how civic engagement and sense of community affect health and
      wellbeing outcomes are unknown, and questions remain about for whom these effects may be
      especially beneficial. In this study, we ask whether an established civic intervention called
      Generation Citizen affects civic engagement and sense of community, and subsequently affects
      health and wellbeing among youth. To build on these observational findings, the study team
      will: (a) examine the causal links between youth civic engagement and sense of community and
      health, and (b) test whether an established school-based, civic engagement intervention can
      affect individual health and wellbeing and equity outcomes.
