      may also reduce albuminuria in patients with Type 2 diabetes; effects which occur without
      significantly modifying heart rate or body weight. While preclinical studies have
      demonstrated that DPP-4 inhibition acutely increases urinary sodium excretion in addition to
      other favorable renal effects (anti-inflammatory, anti-proteinuric), few studies have
      examined the renal effects of DPP-4 inhibition either acutely or following short-term therapy
      in humans with type 2 diabetes. Considering the world-wide prevalence of Type 2 diabetes and
      the increasing use of DPP-4 inhibitors amongst patients, it is important to ascertain
      potential non-glycemic effects of DPP-4 inhibitors including those within the kidney.

      Study Objectives: To determine effect(s) of DPP-4 inhibition on tubular sodium handling,
      renal hemodynamics, and renal function.

      Study Design: double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, Phase IV.

      Study Patients: 32 patients with Type 2 Diabetes and Systolic Hypertension (SBP 120-160
      mmHg).

      Endpoints: Fractional excretion of sodium, renal function (measured GFR), renal hemodynamics
      (effective renal plasma flow, filtration fraction, renal blood flow, renal vascular
      resistance), systemic hemodynamics (non-invasive cardiac monitoring), plasma neurohormones,
      urinary vasoactive mediators, markers of free radical stress.
