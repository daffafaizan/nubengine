      is endoscopic dilations. However, 30 to 40% of these strictures recur despite rigorous
      dilations. Although a consensus definition does not exist, a stricture is typically termed as
      a refractory benign esophageal stricture (RBES), when there is a failure to maintain luminal
      patency after at least 5 endoscopic dilations.

      Patients with RBES are extremely difficult to manage and the current armamentarium includes
      repeated endoscopic dilations, corticosteroid or mitomycin C injections, incisional therapy,
      and/ or temporary stent placement. These procedures are costly, their efficacy can be
      short-lived, and are associated with great burden both for the patient and clinician.

      Esophageal self -dilation therapy (ESDT) is where the patient learns to pass a polyvinyl
      dilator orally on a routine basis. In past, smaller studies, ESDT appears to be effective for
      RBES, reducing the number of endoscopic dilations from an average of 21.7 to an average of 1.
