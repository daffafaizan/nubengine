      within these centers will follow a common protocol established and validated in March 2016 on
      the basis of international recommendations and summaries of the characteristics produced for
      each drug. Additional blood samples will be taken for the biobanking. Depending on the case,
      a small skin biopsy will be carried out to analyze the cardiovascular response of in vitro
      immunotherapy using a reprogramming model of fibroblasts in hiPSC hiPSC (human induced
      Pluripotent Stem cells)-cardiomyocytes.
