        -  Determine the therapeutic activity of paclitaxel in patients with locally advanced,
           metastatic, or recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva.

        -  Determine the objective response rate and duration of response in these patients treated
           with this drug.

        -  Determine the acute side effects of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for a
      maximum of 10 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 9 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 16-29 patients will be accrued for this study.
