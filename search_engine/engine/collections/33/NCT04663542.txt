    
      This prospective randomized controlled clinical study is designed to compare the treatment
      outcomes of different immobilization times by dividing the patients into four groups-A, B, C,
      and D-based on the amount of immobilization time (0, 2, 4, and 6 weeks, respectively) that
      include a similar rehabilitation protocol. The inclusion criteria are patients with an acute
      closed single-legged complete Achilles tendon rupture, and an age of 18 to 60 years. The
      exclusion criteria are patients with prior Achilles tendon rupture or other situations that
      affect their lower limb functions or tendon healing (e.g., autoimmune disease, diabetes
      mellitus, systemic corticosteroid treatment). Other exclusion criteria are an inability to
      complete our suture technique (e.g., the distance from the rupture site to the Achilles
      tendon insertion is less than 3.5 cm), or those without rehabilitation or follow-up outcomes.
      All patients will be treated surgically with the same suture technique and undergo a similar
      rehabilitation protocol after the brace is removed.
