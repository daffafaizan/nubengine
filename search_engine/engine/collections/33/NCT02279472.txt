      recruited. Anterior segment optical coherence tomography images captured before and after
      laser peripheral iridotomy will be analysed to provide objective and reproducible
      quantification of anterior segment biometric parameters.The outcomes can provide useful
      information for clinical strategies in the treatment and management of pathology related to
      angle closure.
