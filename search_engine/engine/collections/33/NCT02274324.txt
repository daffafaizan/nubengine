    
      A prospective single-blind-crossover study in patients with PD regularly treated with
      DuodopaÂ® (LICG) in which three different diets will be given. Diet A: Low fat western diet -
      traditional low-fat Western diet; a normal diet according to the recommendations of health
      organizations in which proteins consumed throughout the day, high-protein meal at noon and in
      the evening.

      Diet B: Equal protein redistribution diet (EPRD) - proteins consumption is controlled and
      equally distributed over six meals throughout the day to minimize motor fluctuations.

      Diet C: Protein redistribution diet (PRD) in which proteins are consumed in the morning prior
      to connection to the pump and in the evening after disconnecting from the . Carbohydrates and
      fats will be consumed during the day.

      Following recruitment and study initiation patients will consume diet A for 3 weeks. Patients
      will then be randomized into either diet B or diet C for 3 additional weeks. At completion of
      this period patients will consume diet A for 2 weeks ("wash-out" period) and will then be
      "crosseovered" to get the third diet (B or C).
