      pediatric cancer, and carries a risk of cardiotoxicity. Over the long term, children who
      receive these therapies have an increased risk of heart failure and early cardiovascular
      death. However, current strategies for identifying patients who are at risk prior to the
      development of significant changes in heart function are limited. This study will focus on
      imaging markers of cardiac injury and dysfunction with the goal of developing improved
      diagnostic tests and treatment strategies.

      Cardiac shape, function, and tissue characteristics will be examined using cardiac MRI data
      in combination with standard cardiac assessments (by echocardiography, electrocardiograms,
      and cardiac MRI) to assess the cardiotoxic effects of cancer therapy. Analyses will be
      performed in a cross-sectional cohort of adolescents and young adults with a history of
      childhood cancer.
