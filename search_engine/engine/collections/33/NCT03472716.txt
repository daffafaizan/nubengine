      the fourth cause of death by cancer in France. The diagnosis is often realized when the
      disease is at an advanced stage because of its delayed clinical expression. Only 20% of the
      patients are diagnosed at a stage enabling a tumour resection.

      Scientists discovered a protein playing a key role: the βig-h3 protein. In mouse models, this
      protein is present in several stages of the tumorigenesis. A mutation of the gene Kras leads
      to the development of PANin (Pancreatic Intraepithelial Neoplasia) type precancerous lesions.
      The βig-h3 protein is early and highly expressed in the stroma around these lesions and in
      the pancreatic adenocarcinoma stroma. Moreover, studies showed that protein neutralization
      leads to a tumour size reduction by increasing the CD8+anti-tumor activity.

      This protein is detected in the blood serum of patients suffering from a pancreatic
      adenocarcinoma. So, this protein which is secreted by the extracellular matrix could be a
      predictive marker for the pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

      In this prospective, multicentric non-interventional study, it is anticipated to recruit 80
      patients (20 per TNM/UICC stage).

      Included patients will undergo two samples: A blood sample (5 ml) and a tumour sample
      (surgical exeresis piece or tumour tissue obtained for the initial diagnosis). In case of
      relapse, new samples will be performed.
