      groups of 10-14 participants. Each session comprise education about healthy diet,
      psychoeducation and discussions.

      The web-based group counselling program offers informative weight management system with
      peer-based conversation possibility. Three groups of 10-14 participants who gather together
      for three nurse-lead sessions in the weeks 0, 5, and 12. The web-based program can be used
      for a year.

      The web-based personal counselling program offers informative weight management system with
      conversation possibility with the nurse for 12 weeks. Altogether 37 participants are enrolled
      and they can use the web-based weight management system for one year.

      In each intervention arm, intervention and counselling provided by the study nurses last for
      three months. Among all participants, weight loss, cardiometabolic data, information of
      lifestyle and quality of life will be measured at baseline, after the nurse-lead intervention
