      evaluate the ability of the ClearRingâ„¢ to improve BPH symptoms while conforming to safety of
      the procedure.

      In the proposed study the implants will be inserted by a dedicated delivery system with the
      aid of resectoscope. Electrical current will be administered by off-the-shelf CE Mark
      diathermy that passes through the system to cut and pave the ring course.

      The proper positioning of the implants will be evaluated by cystoscopy or TRUS and following
      implant positioning the device will be withdrawn.

      The delivery tool, the implants, resectoscope and the diathermy equipment will be supplied by
      ProArc Ltd.
