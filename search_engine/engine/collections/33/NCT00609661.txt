      culminate in organ failure and death. Current literature has demonstrated that adult stem
      cells (ASCs) are mobilized into peripheral circulation as a heterogeneous population of cells
      following tissue injury. The significance of this heterogeneity has not yet been defined.
      Other studies have shown ASCs augment tissue repair under appropriate conditions. This
      proposal will begin to elucidate the mechanism of ASC activation, mobilization and
      localization to sites of injury. This study will use flow cytometry to identify subsets of
      ASCs mobilized in response to tissue injury and compare this response to the patient's
      demographics, comorbidities, in hospital morbidities, and mortality. Patients with thermal
      burns will be used as a model of tissue injury given the quantity of tissue injured and the
      robust signal generated from this injury. ASCs are currently being investigated as adjuncts
      to tissue repair involving a host of tissues, including cardiac, neural, and renal. The
      identification of a specific subset of ASCs selectively mobilized in response to tissue
      injury would alter all studies involving ASCs in tissue repair and necessitate the
      identification and targeting of subsets selectively mobilized in response to injury to each
      particular tissue.
