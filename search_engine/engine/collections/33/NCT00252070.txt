      activity can improve physical function and pain management. Most existing programs focus on
      improving flexibility and balance. Less attention has been paid to conditioning and overall
      functional fitness. To address some of these concerns, this study will develop, evaluate, and
      implement a non-aquatic physical activity program to increase health-related functional
      fitness in community-dwelling adults with arthritis. Specific goals are:

        1. To develop a systematic and progressive program (FEPA: Functional Exercise for Persons
           with Arthritis) that integrates muscular and aerobic conditioning, balance and
           trunk/pelvic stabilization exercises emphasizing joint-protective, multi-plane movement
           patterns that mimic those used in everyday activities.

        2. Implement the FEPA program in an ethnically diverse, low SES community sample of older
           adults with arthritis.

        3. Conduct process, outcomes and impact evaluations to assess the effectiveness of the FEPA
           program for increasing short- and immediate-term health and functional fitness outcomes.

        4. Evaluate the sustainability of the FEPA program through a program logic model process
           and identify inputs, activities and outputs that contribute to successful program
           implementation and the building of community capacity to support long-term program
           maintenance.
