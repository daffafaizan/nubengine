      I. To determine the feasibility of measuring tumor intratumoral pressures in vivo using a
      commercially available, sterile, single use, cardiovascular catheter device.

      II. To determine the feasibility of measuring tumor intratumoral stiffness in vivo using a
      commercially available shear wave elastography with ultrasound.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the relationship of tumor pressure, stiffness, and fibrosis.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients scheduled for an ultrasound-guided tumor biopsy undergo stiffness assessment of the
      tumor with shear wave elastography over 2 minutes and pressure measurements of the tumor
      using a Millar Mikro-tip catheter before and after the biopsy is collected.

      After completion of the study, patients are followed up at 24-48 hours and at 30 days.
