      The primary objective of the study is to compare the progression-free survival of two
      treatment regimens:

      Taxotere速 30 mg/m2 IV on Days 1 and 8, combined with carboplatin AUC 6 IV on Day 1, repeated
      every 21 days for 6 cycles or until disease progression. (A patient who has completed 6
      cycles of treatment and who has achieved a partial response or stable disease may either
      continue or stop treatment at the investigator's discretion.)

      Versus

      Taxotere速 30 mg/m2 IV on Days 1 and 8, repeated every 21 days up to 6 cycles or until disease
      progression. Followed by carboplatin (AUC 6) IV every 21 days if the patient does not achieve
      a complete response or has disease progression on Taxotere速. A patient who has achieved a
      complete response on Taxotere速 will be followed until the subsequent recurrence at which time
      she will then receive single-agent carboplatin. Carboplatin treatment will be discontinued if
      the patient has completed 6 cycles of treatment and has achieved a complete response or has
      disease progression. (A patient who has completed 6 cycles of carboplatin treatment and who
      has achieved a partial response or stable disease may either continue or stop treatment at
      the investigator's discretion.)

      Secondary Objectives

      The secondary objectives of the study are to compare the objective response rates (defined as
      a complete response plus partial response), duration of tumor response, median survival, QOL
      and safety in patients treated with the two regimens described above.
