    
      The 18 patients will be placed into 6 sub-groups sequentially as they are enrolled. All
      patients will receive a maximum of 30,000 pulses in their treatment course, as tolerated. The
      first group will receive daily sessions, similar to standard rTMS treatment. Each of the
      remaining groups will be set to receive more frequent sessions/day in decreasing numbers of
      days on a graduated schedule while holding the total number of pulses for each patient's
      treatment course at 30,000 pulses. in addition, the investigators will recruit one healthy
      volunteer to test fMRI server data transfer and analysis. This healthy volunteer will not
      receive rTMS.

      Primary Objectives

      The primary objectives of this study are to assess: 1) the feasibility of enrollment (number
      of patients who enroll divided by the number of patients approached), 2) study retention
      (number of patients completing the study divided by the number enrolled), and 3) AE/SE
      profile of the treatment at each protocol level and 4) patient experience in the study across
      the sample and within the sub-groups.

      Secondary Objectives

      The secondary objectives of this study are to: 1) evaluate daily changes in symptoms of
      depression and mental status; 2) evaluate fMRI changes in the LDLPFC after treatment; 3)
      evaluate post-treatment and 3-month changes in depression symptoms, global function, mental
      status, verbal memory.
