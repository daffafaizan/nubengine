      (COX-2), will effectively inhibit the enzymatic activity in all tissues sampled after oral
      administration of celecoxib for 7 days preoperatively. One hundred twenty patients (120)
      undergoing standard surgical resection for the treatment of primary colorectal adenomas or
      carcinomas would be randomized to celecoxib or placebo given for 7 days prior to operation.
      Peripheral blood will be drawn prior to drug or placebo administration, and then morning of
      operation. At the time of definitive resection of the specimen, normal intestinal mucosa and
      primary tumor would be harvested and immediately snap frozen at -80 degrees. Levels of COX-2
      activity (prostaglandin production) as well as expression of COX-2 and other markers (matrix
      metalloproteinases(MMPs), tissue inhibitors of MMPs (TIMPs), cell adhesion and cell cycle
      control molecules will be evaluated in normal mucosa and primary tumor compared between
      celecoxib and placebo treated patients.
