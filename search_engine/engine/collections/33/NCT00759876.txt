      in the United States. The study will enroll up to 38 participants with nonsense mutation
      Duchenne muscular dystrophy who participated in a previous Phase 2a study of ataluren
      (Protocol Number PTC124-GD-004-DMD [NCT00264888]). Participants will receive study drug 3
      times per day (at breakfast, lunch, and dinner) for approximately 96 weeks (approximately 2
      years). Study assessments will be performed at clinic visits during screening, every 6 weeks
      for the first 24 weeks, and then every 12 weeks until the end of the study. Additional safety
      laboratory testing, which may be performed at the investigational site or at an accredited
      local laboratory or clinic, is required every 3 weeks for the first 24 weeks and then every 6
      weeks from Week 24 to Week 48. Participants will have a biceps muscle biopsy before ataluren
      treatment and again after 24 weeks of ataluren treatment to evaluate changes in muscle
      dystrophin expression. An evaluation of the effects of ataluren on corticosteroid
      pharmacokinetics will be performed. Associated with this ataluren clinical trial is a
      substudy that will use magnetic resonance evaluations to assess changes in the composition of
      muscles of the legs.
