           stem and progenitor cells

        -  Immunosuppression is the definitive treatment of patients with acquired aplastic anemia
           who are not candidates for immediate hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

        -  Horse ATG combined with the calcineurin inhibitor, cyclosporine (CsA), remains standard
           as first-line immunosuppressive therapy (IST).

        -  Hematologic responses to transfusion independence occur in about two thirds of patients
           with standard IST and in 80-90% of patients treated with IST in combination with the
           growth factor eltrombopag.

        -  About 30% to 40% of patients relapse after discontinuation of cyclosporine. Many achieve
           disease control after the reinitiation of CSA, but remain CSA dependent indefinitely.

        -  Evidence from mouse models of bone marrow failure indicates that conversion from
           cyclosporine to the mTOR inhibitor, sirolimus (SRL), results in immune tolerance which
           can endure the eventual withdrawal of SRL.

        -  We hypothesize that CSA to SRL conversion will significantly decrease the relapse rate
           after immunosuppressive therapy for acquired aplastic anemia.

        -  This study will investigate the safety and efficacy of SRL for preventing relapse in
           patients previously treated with IST who remain on CSA. The primary endpoint is rate of
           relapse at 2 years following conversion from CSA to SRL, versus stopping CSA.

        -  Biological sampling of peripheral blood and bone marrow aspirates during treatment will
           be used to investigate changes to lymphocyte phenotypes and cytokine profiles.
