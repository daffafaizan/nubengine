      identifying complications from surgical abortions through follow-up phone calls. Key
      questions include, what is our complication-detection rate from these phone calls? How many
      patients are contacted? How many attempts are made and how much effort is expended by staff
      in routine follow-up practices? Additionally, the research would attempt to answer the
      question, is there any way to predict problems or complications? This study will help to
      determine if excessive resources and time are being expended on follow-up phone method to
      detect complications.

      This study will consist of a retrospective chart review identifying the outcome of follow-up
      phone calls after an induced abortion.
