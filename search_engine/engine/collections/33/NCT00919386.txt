      looking at factors to improve stent related symptoms, but few have used a validated
      questionnaire to assess these symptoms affect on quality of life.We plan to prospectively
      randomize patients to three separate techniques such as (a) direct measurement,(b) patient
      height, and (c) a standardized formula for the determination of stent size. Using a validated
      questionnaire, the Ureteral Stent Symptoms Questionnaire (USSQ), we will assess whether there
      is a difference in outcome measures such as patient quality of life, need for pain
      medications and anticholinergics, and in postoperative symptoms based on one of these
      techniques. The USSQ was developed by Joshi et al to assess the impact of health-related
      quality of life issues related to ureteral stents. Data from USSQ questionnaire will be
      collected 7-10 days post-operatively as well as 4 weeks post-op and then this will be
      aggregated for our outcome measures to determine which method of stent size give better
      outcomes.
