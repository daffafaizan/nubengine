      before or on admission. In order to identify MRSA nasal acquisition while on the ward, all
      patients who were negative before surgery were re-screened every 7 days until discharge. The
      inclusion criteria for screening were patients undergoing inflammatory bowel disease surgery
      on ward A, and those undergoing major hepato-biliary-pancreatic surgery on ward B.
      Investigators classified enrolled patients into preoperative MRSA nasal carriage,
      postoperative nasal acquisition in patients who were negative for PCR assay before surgery,
      and non-nasal MRSA carriage during hospitalization. Development of postoperative infections
      caused by MRSA was assessed according to the nasal MRSA carriage status. MRSA infections rate
      was also compared between the 2-years of the intervention period and the previous 2-year
      control period on each ward.

      Control measures in identified MRSA carriers consisted of contact precautions, antibiotic
      prophylaxis with a single dose of vancomycin 1g in addition to cephalosporins, and topical
      decolonization of MRSA (application of 2% mupirocin ointment twice daily to nares for 5 days
      and a bath with 4% chlorhexidine daily for 3-5 days). Although contact precautions were used
      when caring for MRSA-colonized patients, isolation/cohorting was not routinely practiced.
