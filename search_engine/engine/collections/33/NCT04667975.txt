    
      This open label, multi center, first-in-human study consists of 2parts.

      -Part 1: The dose is increased according to the prescribed dose escalation schedule.

      Dose escalation proceeds until the maximum tolerated dose(MTD) is reached. Dose-limiting
      toxicity (DLT) is evaluated after completing cycle 1 administration for all subjects enrolled
      for each dose group in order to determine whether to proceed to the next level. all matters
      related to dose escalation are subject to the decision of the SRC. If DLT occurs in two
      subjects during the first dose level process, the dose level reset by the SRC is reflected
      and study protocol amendment procedure is followed accordingly. Following completion of the
      DLT evaluation of the planned dose level in this study, the SRC reviews the outcome of the
      evaluation and determines whether to set additional dosing or proceed to PART 2 (Dose
      expansion).

      -Part 2: In Part 2, the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of the CKD-702 Inj. determined in
      Part 1 is set as the treatment dose, and the dose must be administered with the same
      administration methods as Part 1, repeating cycles.
