      tumors to temozolomide treatment in patients with progressive disease during or after
      procarbazine/lomustine/vincristine (PCV) chemotherapy. II. Determine the feasibility and
      toxicity of temozolomide chemotherapy following PVC chemotherapy in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open label, multicenter trial. Temozolomide is administered orally on
      days 1-5 of each 4-week course; treatment continues for a maximum of 12 courses. Patients are
      followed every 2 months for the first 6 months and then every 3 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 16-29 patients will be accrued for this study.
