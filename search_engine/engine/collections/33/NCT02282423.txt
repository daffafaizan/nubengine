      differently to exercise as compared with insulin sensitive individuals at the skeletal muscle
      and gene expression level. The study has four aims including testing if MZF1, NFKB1, RELA,
      SP1/KLF and EGRI expression responses are outside of the normal range in insulin resistant
      individuals and how insulin resistance changes the cell biosynthesis process/ post
      translational modifications. It also aims to define the response of MiRNAs in healthy and
      insulin resistant individuals and determine if treatment with Gemfibrozil inhibits
      transcription processes.
