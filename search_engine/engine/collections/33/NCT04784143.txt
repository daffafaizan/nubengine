      three active MDMA-assisted therapy sessions in U.S. military veterans with at least moderate
      chronic PTSD treated in an outpatient VA treatment clinic. The study will be conducted in up
      to 60 participants. Prior to the randomized portion of the study, each therapist pair team
      will treat one participant under the 3-session model, and one participant under the 2-session
      model. In total, 8 participants will be treated under this proof of principle therapist
      training lead-in. A 120 mg dose of MDMA, followed by a supplemental dose (60 mg) unless
      contraindicated, is administered during the treatment period with manualized psychotherapy in
      2 or 3 open-label monthly Experimental Sessions. This ~ 8-12-week Treatment Period includes
      three Preparatory Sessions prior to the first MDMA-assisted session. During the treatment
      period, each Experimental Session is followed by three Integrative Sessions of non-drug
      therapy. The Primary Outcome measure, the change in CAPS-5 from Baseline, is assessed by a
      centralized, blinded Independent Rater (IR) pool at post-treatment for each group.
