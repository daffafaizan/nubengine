      cells. When cancer does develop antigen-specific immune (T) cells are still present in the
      blood but are either not responding or are not effective. Vaccines stimulate these T cells to
      respond and kill cancer cells.

      ACIT-1 is designed to stimulate tumour antigen-specific T cells to respond and kill cancer
      cells.
