    
      The experimental FES-PET/CT is required to be completed 0 to 30 days prior to initiation of
      first-line endocrine therapy for metastatic ER+ breast cancer. Labs and correlative
      radiology, as directed per clinical care, are required within 60 days prior to FES-PET/CT;
      and FDG-PET/CT is required within 60 days before the FES-PET/CT. Follow-up will comprise 24
      months of standard practice treatment and follow up.

      Visit 1: Patients will have at least one visit with investigator (or investigator designee)
      prior to the study to review clinical history and prior treatment of primary breast cancer,
      and to explain the study. Correlative radiology studies including CT, MRI, or bone scan as
      per institutional routine clinical care, and any clinically-directed laboratory tests
      performed as part of metastatic staging must be performed within 60 days of the FES-PET/CT.

      Visit 2: The patient will have a clinically-directed FDG-PET/CT as part of metastatic
      staging. The FDG-PET/CT will usually be obtained within 60 days prior to the FES-PET/CT. It
      may be done up to 30 days before the FES-PET/CT if there has been no endocrine therapy for
      metastatic disease started before the FES-PET/CT. The FDG-PET/CT and FES-PET/CT cannot be
      performed on the same day due to the half-life of F-18. The FDG-PET/CT may be done as a
      research scan, if the patient is unable to obtain a clinically-directed FDG-PET/CT as part of
      their clinical care or within 60 days of FES PET/CT. The research FDG-PET/CT, in this
      instance, will be identical in procedure to the institution's clinical FDG-PET/CT. The blood
      glucose level will be < 200 mg/dl, before FDG injection, which is institutional standard
      clinical protocol. The following additional patient data will be obtained: histological
      diagnosis of primary and/or metastatic disease, date of diagnosis of primary and metastatic
      disease, gender, height, weight (for BMI), ECOG score, and prior adjuvant and metastatic
      treatment regimens used.

      Visit 3 - Day of FES PET/CT: The patient will have an intravenous line placed typically in
      the hand or arm opposite to the known primary breast cancer, FES will be given by 2 minute
      infusion, and the dose administered will be approximately 6mCi +/- 20%. After approximately
      60+/- 10 minutes of uptake time, the patient will be positioned supine in the PET/CT scanner
      for standard whole body PET/CT scan from the skull base to mid-thigh. This scan will take
      approximately 20-30 min. If there are any breast lesions, a higher resolution PEM study of
      the breast/s may be obtained which make take approximately an additional 30-60 min.

      A blood sample to be obtained, just before the FES injection, and submitted for hormonal
      analysis (estradiol and sex hormone binding globulin).

      Visit 4-Day of Reproducibility FES-PET/CT: The test re-test FES-PET/CT will need to be
      performed at least 24 hours after the first FES-PET/CT and no later than 10 days following
      the initial FES study, and it can be done at any time after the FDG-PET/CT. The second
      FES-PET/CT study must be performed on the same scanner as the first FES-PET/CT and the
      imaging protocol described in Visit 3 should be closely followed. If there are any breast
      lesions, a higher resolution PEM study may be obtained which make take approximately an
      additional 30 min.

      Visit 5-Week 1 to 4 after first FES-PET/CT: Patients will start endocrine therapy in the
      period from 0 to 30 days post FES-PET/CT, as per clinical standard.
