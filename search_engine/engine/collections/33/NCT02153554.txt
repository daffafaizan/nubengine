      officials of the 22 family commissioners in Medellin. The objective of these trainings is to
      standardize procedures in order that women do not feel re-victimized and can forward
      complaints. Since the training will be done in phases in 2014 and there is willingness of
      relevant stakeholders to generate a random order on which commissioners the training is first
      performed, it can be done a cluster randomized trial.

      We will require all 22 commissioners to be randomly assigned into two groups, one treatment
      and one control. To implement it is intended to:

        -  Conduct a baseline survey amongst women who used the services of the commissionaires
           between June and Septmber 2013, completed the process of care and signed informed
           consent.

        -  Training of a randomly chosen set of 11 commissioners will take place between June and
           September 2014.

        -  Conduct an endline survey amongst women who used the services of any of the 22
           commissionaires between June and September 2014, completed the process of care and
           signed informed consent.

      Women will be contacted through the commissioners. Women who have completed the process of
      care will be ask whether they want to participate in the study. If they agree, their contact
      details will transfer to the investigators for the survey to be conducted. This process would
      be conducted twice for baseline information before beginning the training, and for endline,
      once half of the first 11 commissioners have been trained.
