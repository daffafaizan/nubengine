    
      Background and Rationale: Degenerative pathologies of the lumbar spine including degenerative
      disc disease, spondylosis and spondylolisthesis are the leading indications for lumbar
      interbody fusion (LIF) among low back pain patients. Prosidyan's Fibergraft is a bioactive
      synthetic bone graft substitute that is ultraporous and made from bioactive glass fibers. The
      proposed study will be an analysis of clinical outcomes among patients who underwent lumbar
      interbody fusion augmented with Prosidyan Fibergraft by a single surgeon.

      Objective(s):

      PRIMARY: To assess the fusion rate in this retrospective cohort at 12 months
      post-operatively.

      SECONDARY:

        -  To report and analyze trends (if any) among diagnosis, number of levels, approach (TLIF,
           LIF or ALIF) and fusion status.

        -  To assess pain and functional health changes pre to post-operatively. SAFTEY: To report
           the rate of surgical adverse events and subsequent surgeries at the operative level.

      Study design: Retrospective chart review with prospective data collection.

      Procedures: Patients will be screened by retrospective chart review. Eligible patients will
      be contacted and asked to participate. Consenting patients will answer questionnaires and
      undergo a CT lumbar scan.

      Study Product / Intervention: The device under investigation is Prosidyan Fibergraft.
      However, since study subjects are retrospectively enrolled, they will have received the
      device before entering the study.
