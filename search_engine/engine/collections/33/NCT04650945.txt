      patients included in the study will be followed by a trained clinical diabetes specialist and
      a trained study nurse (study personnel) for glucose management during their hospitalization.
      All patients included in the study will receive a Freestyle Libre isCGM. The patients will be
      randomized to control (blinded isCGM glucose values to patient and study personnel and POC
      (point-of-care) plasma glucose will be used for adjusting diabetes treatment) or intervention
      (isCGM blood glucose values will be used to aid with glucose management during the
      hospitalization). The study personnel will work with the patient's care team.
