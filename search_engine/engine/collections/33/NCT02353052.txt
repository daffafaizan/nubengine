           Fudan University Zhongshan Hospital from 2007 January to 2012 December were collected.
           By reviewing the HE slides, GIST was evaluated by 12 indicators, NIH scheme and WHO
           standard. Accomplish the gene sequencing of KIT, PDGFRA, B-raf, and SDH. Follow up the
           patients about their treatment and prognosis. Analyze and compare the advantages and
           disadvantages of the histomorphology indicators, NIH scheme, and WHO standard.

        2. Organize the first prospective cohort study of GIST individualized treatment based on
           the histomorphology. Obtain the evidence of histological assessment for GIST by
           following up patients for 3 years.

        3. Establish an evaluation criteria based on the morphology of GIST. Make objective
           evaluations about GIST tumor size, tumor location and gene mutation status in the
           prognosis estimate. Make rules to effectively guide individualized treatment of GIST.
