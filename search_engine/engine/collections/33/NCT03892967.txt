      whether systematically assessing patient reported outcomes for sleep disturbance, pain,
      anxiety, depression, and fatigue among patients with solid and liquid malignancies and using
      these data to increase the frequency of guideline-concordant care by: 1) reporting these data
      to their clinical teams, 2) providing patients with needs-matched symptom self-management
      education, and 3) suggesting evidence-based symptom management strategies to their care teams
      improves patients' quality of life, symptoms, and adherence to cancer treatment, while
      reducing their unplanned use of healthcare resources. This population-based trial uses a
      cluster-randomized, stepped wedge design to evaluate the full population of patients managed
      within Mayo Clinic Midwest medical oncology practices irrespective of cancer type or stage.
