    
      A monocentre, post CE-mark, randomized clinical trial will be conducted at the University of
      Cologne, Department of Orthopedics and Trauma Surgery.

      Male or female subjects, 18 years and above, undergoing hip, knee or spinal surgery with an
      expected hospital stay for 4 days or more will be included in the trial. Individual trial
      duration will be for 7 days (follow-up).

      Two hundred subjects will be included in the trial, i.e. 100 subjects per arm. The treatment
      arm (either new or standard wound dressing) will be assigned by randomization stratified by
      type of surgery (i.e. hip, knee or spine).

      AEs/ADEs/unexpected events with the device may be documented by relevant photos at time. All
      photos shall include a sticker marked with subject code, visit number/date and time.
