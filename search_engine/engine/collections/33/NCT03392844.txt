      which can contribute to insufficient and poor quality sleep and related poor child and family
      functioning. The Beds for Kids program provides beds and bedding to disadvantaged children in
      Philadelphia, and has been found to positively impact parent-reported child sleep in a
      previous pilot study. However, there is a need to determine the impact of the Beds for Kids
      program on objectively assessed child sleep, as well as on daily child behavior and caregiver
      functioning (mood and sleep). The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the impact
      of provision of a child bed through the Beds for Kids program on objectively measured child
      sleep, and on daily child behavioral functioning and caregiver functioning over a 14-day
      period for preschool-aged children. This is a randomized controlled trial (RCT).
      Caregiver-child dyads will be assigned to the intervention group, in which they receive a bed
      through the Beds for Kids program after a 7-day period, or to the waitlist control group, in
      which they receive a bed after a 14-day period. The primary study outcome is the difference
      between study conditions in actigraph-derived and caregiver-reported child sleep (bedtime,
      bedtime variability, sleep quality, night wakings, total sleep duration) for days 7 to 14
      (bed vs control), as well as compared to baseline. Thus, this is a mixed between (bed vs
      waitlist) and within (days 1-7 vs days 8-14) group design.
