      treatment), randomized (the treatment is assigned by chance), placebo-controlled (one of the
      study treatments is inactive), single-dose, 3-way cross over study (all volunteers will
      receive each of the 3 treatments but in a different order) in healthy Chinese volunteers.
      Volunteers will be assigned to 1 of 3 treatment sequence groups (ABC, BCA, or CAB). The
      treatment sequence will be decided by randomization. Treatment A will be a single oral (by
      mouth) dose of 100 mg of canagliflozin. Treatment B will be a single oral dose of 300 mg of
      canagliflozin. Treatment C will be a single oral dose of placebo (inactive medication). Each
      treatment will be given during a treatment period of 5 days duration; each treatment period
      will be separated by a washout period (a time period with no medication) of at least 10 days.
      Canagliflozin is currently being investigated for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus
      (T2DM).
