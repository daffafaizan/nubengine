      majority of tools used to assess unplanned pregnancy planning have not been validated.
      Recently the London Measure of Unplanned Pregnancy (LMUP) has been developed and validated.
      The LMUP had been found to be valid and reproducible, but has not been studied outside of the
      United Kingdom. If we are able to validate this measure in a U.S. population, its use in
      studies will improve the quality of data about family planning in U.S. women.
