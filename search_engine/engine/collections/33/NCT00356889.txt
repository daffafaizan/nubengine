      I. Evaluate the objective response rate in patients with metastatic or unresectable
      cholangiocarcinoma treated with bevacizumab and erlotinib hydrochloride.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate time to progression in these patients.

      II. Evaluate overall and progression-free survival of these patients.

      III. Evaluate the adverse events associated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is an
      open-label, multicenter study.

      Patients receive bevacizumab intravenously (IV) over 30-90 minutes on days 1 and 15 and oral
      erlotinib hydrochloride daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of
      unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically for up to 3 years.
