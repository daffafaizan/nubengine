      Ionotropic glutamate receptors are ligand-gated ion channels responsible for most of the
      excitatory neurotransmission in the mammalian central nervous system (CNS). Based on
      pharmacology, they have been grouped into three subtypes-NMDA, AMPA and kainate. In recent
      years it has become apparent that the receptors do not function alone, but in the company of
      auxiliary proteins that regulate their activity [1]. Some of these have been shown to
      modulate AMPA receptor trafficking, gating and pharmacology and are classified as
      transmembrane AMPA receptor regulatory proteins, or TARPs ( >=-2, >=-3, >=-4, >=-5, >=-7, and
      >=-8). Genetic data indicate a possible role of TARPs in schizophrenia, depression, epilepsy,
      neuropathic pain, and bipolar disorder [1]. In a preclinical collaboration with Eli Lilly, we
      developed a promising radioligand, 18F-TARP252 to image TARP >=-8 using positron emission
      tomography (PET).

      This protocol covers three phases:

        -  Phase 1: kinetic brain imaging to quantify TARP >=-8 in brain relative to concurrent
           measurement of the parent radioligand in arterial plasma;

        -  Phase 2: if 18F-TARP252 is successful in Phase 1, we will estimate the
           radiation-absorbed doses by performing whole body imaging;

        -  Phase 3: test-retest analysis of brain binding relative to concurrent measurement of the
           parent radioligand in arterial plasma.

      Study Population

      Healthy adult female and male volunteers (n=22, ages 18 - 55) will undergo brain imaging. An
      additional eight healthy volunteers will undergo whole body dosimetry analysis.

      Design

      For quantification of TARP >=-8, 22 healthy controls will have brain PET imaging using
      18F-TARP252 and an arterial line. Some of them will have a test-retest scan. Eight additional
      subjects will have a whole body PET scan for dosimetry. For dosimetry, no arterial line will
      be used.

      Outcome Measures

      To assess quantitation of TARP >=-8 with 18F-TARP252, we will primarily use two outcome
      measures: the identifiability and time stability of distribution volume calculated with
      compartmental modeling. In test-retest study, we will calculate the retest variability. We
      will assess whole-body biodistribution and dosimetry of 18F-TARP252 by calculating doses to
      organs and effective dose to the body.
