      from the Ziekenhuis Oost-Limburg cohort will be contacted by phone 6 months after admission
      at the ICU. Patients will be asked to participate in a study surrounding long term symptoms
      of COVID-19. When consent is given by the patiÃ«nt, the experimenter will conduct a short
      questionnaire over the phone with the patient or relative that is present at the time of the
      call. If the participant is fluent in Dutch, the experimenter will ask permission to visit
      their home to conduct more testing.
