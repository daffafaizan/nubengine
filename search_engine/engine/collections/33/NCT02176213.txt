    
      This is an open label, single center, phase II study of a combination of pomalidomide, daily
      low dose oral cyclophosphamide, and dexamethasone in patients with relapsed/refractory
      multiple myeloma. The three oral drugs will be given in 28-day cycles: Pomalidomide 4 mg
      daily x 21 days; cyclophosphamide 50 mg BID x 21 days; and dexamethasone 40 mg weekly x 3 (20
      mg weekly if the patient aged ≥ 75 years old). Subjects meeting eligibility criteria with ANC
      < 1000/µL and platelet count < 50,000/µL will start at dose level -1 of both pomalidomide (3
      mg daily) and cyclophosphamide (50 mg daily). G-CSF and platelet transfusion support is
      permitted if needed.

      Dose reduction for hematologic toxicity will begin with cyclophosphamide and then
      subsequently alternate with pomalidomide until a subject cannot tolerate dose level -2 of
      both agents - in which case subject would come off study. If subject has 2 or more concurrent
      toxicities that are potentially attributable to both agents (e.g. hematologic toxicity) then
      dose modification guidelines will be followed with dose reduction being done sequentially
      with one agent at a time, unless in the opinion of the investigator, both agents required
      concurrent dose reduction.
