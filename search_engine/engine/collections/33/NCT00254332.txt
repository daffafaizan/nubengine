      proliferation of a "memory" T-cell in the context of Th2-type cytokine profile and suppressed
      cytotoxic T-cell (CTL) immunity. T-regulatory (T-regs) cells may be important in CTCL in the
      setting of immunotherapy. Removal of T-regs would result in enhanced immune responses in
      vitro, which may translate into augmentation of the anti-tumor immune response and durable
      clinical responses in vivo. We propose to evaluate effects of ONTAK on the T-reg cell subset
      in patients undergoing routine therapy with ONTAK. We will evaluate T-reg subsets in
      peripheral blood and tumor tissues from the patients both phenotypically using multi-color
      FACS analysis and confocal microscopy, and functionally in MLRs and ELISpot assays with
      baseline, day 5 and 19 blood samples in up to four cycles.
