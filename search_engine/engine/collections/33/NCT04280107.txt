      anterior to the mastoid process. Patients who have ESP or styloid chain calcification are
      usually asymptomatic, only 4% are symptomatic. Symptoms vary as different syndromes which
      related affected anatomic structures by calcified process or ligament. Temporomandibular
      Dysfunction (TMD) describe the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disfunction that divided three
      branches according to temporomandibular joint's disc status: non-displacement (ND),
      displacement with reduction (DWR) and displacement without reduction (DWoR). Since orofacial
      pain shows similar features in both ESP or styloid chain calcification and TMD, it is
      possible to confuse and misdiagnosis both of these clinical conditions. This study aimed to
      investigate the length and calcification pattern of the styloid process in patients with TMD
      diagnosis.
