      to 70 investigational sites in the United States and Australia. Patients will be randomized
      (1:1) to receive the SJM Portico Transcatheter Heart Valve and Delivery Systems (Portico) or
      any FDA-approved, commercially-available Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR)
      System. The randomized cohort will be tested for two co-primary endpoints at 30 days (primary
      safety endpoint) and 1 year (primary effectiveness endpoint). At the time of the primary
      randomized cohort analysis, the risk cohorts will be combined and analysis will be conducted
      on the intention-to-treat (n=750) population.

      The FlexNav Delivery System study will be conducted as a separate arm of the PORTICO IDE
      trial and will include up to 200 high or extreme risk subjects; including a minimum of 100
      analysis subjects. The study will characterize the safety of the next-generation Portico
      Delivery System ("FlexNavâ„¢ Delivery System"). The primary analysis cohort will include
      FlexNav analysis subjects.

      The IDE Valve-in-Valve registry will enroll up to 100 high or extreme risk subjects with a
      failed surgical bioprosthesis who are eligible to receive a Portico Transcatheter Heart
      Valve.

      All subjects enrolled in the PORTICO pivotal IDE trial will undergo follow-up at baseline,
      peri- and post-procedure, at discharge or 7 days post-procedure (whichever comes first), 30
      days, 6 months, 12-months and then annually through 5-years.
