      the pt will receive Oxaliplatin IV. This treatment cycle is repeated approximately every 28
      days. Subsequent treatment cycle dosages are based on toxicity diaries and lab work results.
      CT scans are repeated every 2 treatment cycles. Continuation in the study is dependent upon
      tumor response.
