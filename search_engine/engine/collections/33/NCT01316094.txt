      renal impairment who have inadequate glycemic control on an exercise program and stable diet,
      or one oral hypoglycemic agent.

      The severity of the reduction in renal function in each subject will be classified according
      to the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) estimated using the Japanese GFR estimation equation.
      Subjects will start with a screening period, followed by a single-blind placebo run-in
      period, and will be randomized to the ASP1941 groups or the placebo group at a ratio of 2:1.
      For randomization, subjects will be stratified according to the severity of the reduction in
      renal function. In a treatment period, subject will receive study drug or placebo for 24
      weeks under double-blind conditions.

      At 24 week, subjects who are willing to continue participation in the study will receive
      study drug for another 28 weeks in an open label condition. ASP1941 can be increased. After
      completion of the study drug administration, a follow-up period will be provided.
