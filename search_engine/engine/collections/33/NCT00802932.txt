      metallic markers placed at the time of their last breast surgery (either lumpectomy or
      re-excision for margins) by the surgeon and are permanent. They will undergo routine 3D
      CT-based treatment planning and will receive routine radiation treatment to the whole breast
      or partial breast as determined by the treating physician. Daily images of the breast will be
      obtained throughout treatment using the online portal imaging system. These images will be
      analyzed for the daily position of the metallic markers and compared across the entire course
      of treatment to determine the stability of metallic markers placement and to assess their
      efficacy as positioning devices for image guided radiation therapy.
