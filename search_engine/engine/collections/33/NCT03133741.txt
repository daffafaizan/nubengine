    
      Aim: To evaluate the role of GIPR signalling in postprandial physiology, including bone and
      glucose homeostasis, using a naturally occurring GIP fragment (GIP-A), which antagonises the
      GIPR.

      Eighteen healthy men (age 18-70 years, BMI 19-35 kg/m2) with normal kidney and liver
      parameters and haemoglobin levels and no first-degree relatives with type 2 diabetes will be
      included in a randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled cross-over study. Study consists
      of four study days with concomitant infusions of A) GIP-A, B) GLP-1 receptor antagonist
      Exendin[9-39], C) GIP-A + Exendin[9-39], or D) saline (placebo).
