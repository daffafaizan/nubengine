      and effectiveness of a telehealth Group Behavioral Activation Therapy (GBAT) for autistic
      adults. GBAT is intended to help adults manage stress, anxiety, down moods, and anger.
      Similar programs have been shown to be effective in other contexts but has not yet been used
      for autistic adults or delivered via telehealth. Because this is a new intervention, the
      investigators are interested in learning 1) whether GBAT can be done with autistic adults
      (feasibility), 2) what autistic adults think about GBAT (acceptability), and 3) whether GBAT
      is effective for helping autistic adults cope with their feelings. Results from this study
      will be used to inform adaptation to the intervention and planning for future studies to
      further explore its effectiveness. For this initial feasibility study, 8 autistic adults
      (18-40 years old) with VIQ and NVIQ>85, reading composite at least 6th grade level and
      elevated symptoms of depression, anxiety or anger will be recruited.
