      it is expressed on a wide range of malignancies including myeloid malignancies. LeY-targeted
      CAR-T in myeloid malignancies had been explored and showed good efficiency in the treatment
      of myeloid malignancies. This trial is designed and conducted to test the safety and
      effectiveness of LeY-targeted CAR-T.
