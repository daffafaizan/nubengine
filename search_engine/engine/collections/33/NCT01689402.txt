      (tumor or vascular malformations) in acute patients admitted with intracerebral hemorrhage
      (ICH). Today MRI-scan is normally done 3-4 weeks after symptom onset but very little is known
      about the early use of MRI to detect underlying pathology. This would allow an early
      intervension and less uncertainty for the patients.

      We further want to investigate the metabolic penumbra-zone surrounding the hematoma. It is
      the current perception in the litterature that this zone represent a metabolic zone marked by
      apoptosis and inflammation rather than ischemia.

      We are planning to:

      When patients arrive in our stroke department they will within 7 hours be subject to MRI scan
      with the protocoled sequences. Standard sequences: Axial T2, axial DWI, Sagittal T1, T2 flair
      og axial GRE-sequence.

      Susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI)

      Chemical Shift Imaging (CSI) multivoxel spectroscopi

      Post contrast 3D box reconstruction

      After 8 weeks the patients are subject to another MRI-Scan in accordance with the standard
      clinical guideline to rule out underlying pathology.

      After 3 month the patients are seen in the outpatient-clinic to follow-up evaluation.

      To sum up the purpose of this present study is to conduct a pilot investigation of MRI in the
      early evaluation of ICH-patients. Second it is our intension to use multivoxel magnetic
      resonance spectroscopy to study the metabolic penumbra-zone surrounding the ICH.
