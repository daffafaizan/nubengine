      congenital ichthyosis are genotype-dependent, such that clinical standards of care can be
      tailored to the genetic diagnoses. Definition of clinical groups based upon phenotype may
      also provide useful predictors of outcome. Information gained from this study will provide
      the basis for the development of rational standards of care for the future management of
      children with congenital ichthyosis.
