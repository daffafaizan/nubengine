      oral-motor dysfunction or neurodevelopmental abnormalities. Despite significant social and
      physical detriment from sialorrhea, an effective and safe treatment remains elusive.

      The investigator's objective is to study the effect of sublingual ipratropium (an
      anticholinergic aerosol spray) on sialorrhea in the pediatric population

      Method: A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled cross-over trial of sublingual
      ipratropium bromide application in pediatric patients with inappropriate drooling. Patients
      are recruited from the sialorrhea clinic and informed consent is obtained. Patients are
      randomized to receive ipratropium bromide, 1- 2 metered doses (sprays) of active drug (21
      micrograms per metered dose) or matching placebo, every 6 hours up to a maximum of 4 times
      per day, in a double-blind, cross-over design using randomization tables. Total treatment
      length is two weeks for each limb of the study with a 2 week washout period. The primary
      outcome measure is the reporting of sialorrhea using a validated scales. Secondary outcome
      includes global assessment of treatment, patient satisfaction, and adverse effects.
