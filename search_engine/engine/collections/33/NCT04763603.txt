      recruited for additional imaging. Pre-operative PA/US and 3D MR imaging will be conducted.
      Two patient groups are designed to allow performance assessment with respect to anatomy,
      i.e., penetration depth; One with favourable anatomy (i.e. superficial carotids, proximal
      plaques and low bifurcation), the other with no anatomical considerations. For in-vivo
      verification of the morphology and mechanical properties obtained with PA/US imaging, the
      pre-operative data will be compared to the MR data (imaging-imaging verification). Since the
      patient is operated on, endarterectomy specimens are available for histo-pathological
      examination and in-vitro testing for verification purposes: the excised tissue will be (snap
      freeze with liquid Nitrogen) transported to TUE in Eindhoven for in-vitro validation
      (imaging-histology verification). Paris patients will undergo surgery and tissues will be
      transferred to Eindhoven for in vitro mechanical testing. Because of the transfer (-80 Â°C),
      the rate of success for in vitro testing is expected to be smaller, around 40% (i.e. 12
      subjects). Nevertheless, the power of the global analysis will be increased.
