      Especially, procalcitonin test has been reported to be helpful in differentiating bacterial
      pneumonia from viral pneumonia, acute exacerbations of interstitial pneumonitis or chronic
      obstructive lung disease. However, it is not known whether procalcitonin test can help
      distinguish bacterial pneumonia from non-bacterial pneumonia such as radiation pneumonitis or
      chemotherapy-induced pneumonitis in patients with cancer.

      The aim of this prospective cohort study is to observe the clinical benefits of procalcitonin
      test for differentiation of the cause of pneumonia in patients with cancer.
