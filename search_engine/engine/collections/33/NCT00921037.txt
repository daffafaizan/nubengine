      genetic defects. The mode of inheritance is autosomal dominant and affects a gene (NF1),
      which is responsible for the production of the tumor suppressor protein neurofibromin. The
      consequence is an uninhibited expansion of neural tissue which leads amongst others to
      cosmetic disfigurement of the patients. In comparison to the plexiform neurofibromas the
      cutaneous tumors do not undergo malignant transformation.

      Excision and CO2 laser vaporisation were established as standard treatment but cause
      unattractive scars.

      In one operation more than 500 neurofibromas can be removed with an Erbium: YAG laser (2940
      nm). The tumors are dissected by shooting holes into the skin and vaporising the
      neurofibromas in-between or underneath. Specimen are harvested after Er: YAG-, CO2 - and
      electrosurgical treatment to evaluate the difference of thermal necrosis histologically and
      photographs are taken to assess the cosmetic results.
