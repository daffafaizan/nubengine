      management:

        1. Provide Support Person with core behavioral strategies, hands-on training, and tools
           directed at specific roles in supporting diabetes management (e.g. how to support action
           planning and medication adherence).

        2. Teach Support Person how to deliver support in ways that will empower patients and not
           sabotage support efforts (e.g. empathetic and autonomy-supportive communication).

        3. Teach Support Person ways to boost patient engagement in healthcare (e.g. how to support
           healthcare visit preparation and participatory communication with providers).

      CHWs will deliver FAM-ACT through Support Person-focused group DSME sessions plus Support
      Person-focused care management sessions to Patient-Support Person dyads at an urban federally
      qualified health center. When situationally appropriate, the care management sessions will be
      conducted by phone/video call or using a HIPAA-compliant online video-conferencing platform.
      268 patients with type 2 diabetes and either poor glycemic or blood pressure control will be
      randomized together with a member or friend (known as a Support Person) to receive either
      FAM-ACT or more traditional CHW-led patient-focused DSME/CM over 12 months.
