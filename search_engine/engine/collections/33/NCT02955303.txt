      'Maccabi Healthcare Services' by family physicians and geriatric physician of 'Maccabi
      Healthcare Services Central District'. The majority of TECH protocol training will take place
      in the participants' home as self-practice. The assessment and weekly group meetings will
      take place at clinics of Maccabi Healthcare Services in the Central District. A Helsinki
      approval (#2016009) has already been obtained. Participants will receive information
      regarding the study and if eligible will sign a consent form, undergo the screening and then
      the pre-intervention assessments. Then they will receive the TECH protocol, and following the
      intervention a second assessment will be performed.
