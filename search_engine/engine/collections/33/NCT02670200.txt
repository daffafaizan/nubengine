      two different care services (MAC-CBT® vs. psycho-educational support program). Participants
      are cancer patients who have been advised by their treating oncologists, family doctors or
      psychotherapists on the online support. All patients are randomized, based on the information
      the referring physician give about type of tumor, treatment status, prognosis and
      psychosocial factors. Initial will be done an extensive psychometric survey. The MAC-CBT®
      group receives an intervention program based on ten modules, in which the aspects of
      Mindfulness, Acceptance and Commitment in detail are included to start a process-oriented
      self-treatment with regular feedback by the individually assigned psychologists through the
      internet-portal and email and through live contacts (via video-telephony). The control group
      will have access to six modules with a psychoeducational support program, which is also
      constructed according to the MAC principle. Both groups can use crisis modules (in case of
      pain, psychological crisis, fear of dying) without access restriction. The control group,
      upon completion of 6 weeks (for each module one week) can switch to active treatment arm.
      Input and output results are determined using validated survey instruments. Randomisation is
      done by a physician not involved in the further course of the evaluation.
