      patients with neurological autoimmune disease, including multiple sclerosis, neuromyelitis
      optica, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, acute inflammatory demyelinating
      polyradiculoneuropathy (Guillain-Barr√©-Syndrom) or autoimmune encephalitis. This prospective
      controlled monocentric observational study of patients treated with either tryptophan IA or
      PE in cases of autoimmune neurological therapy refractory disease was performed between 2016
      and 2019. The main outcome parameter for efficiency was clinical improvement after completion
      of treatment with PE/IA. Symptoms were assessed before the first and after the last IA/PE. In
      total, all patients receive 5 treatments. As patients with various neurological autoimmune
      diseases were included in the study, the overall treatment response was categorized
      descriptively as improvement or no improvement of symptoms.
