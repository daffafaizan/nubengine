      propofol appears to be promising regarding a low incidence of laryngospasm. Compared with a
      sevoflurane-based anesthesia, the incidence was found to be significantly lower, but there is
      a high incidence of other reflex responses, such as coughing and expiration reflexes. The use
      of lidocaine has been advocated to reduce the incidence of laryngospasm in anesthetized
      children. However, based on clinical studies its effectiveness in the prevention or
      attenuation of laryngospasm is controversial.

      In a previous work using a established stimulation model (stimulating the laryngeal mucosa
      with a small amount of distilled water under direct fiberbronchoscopic observation), we
      observed a risk reduction of 60% of laryngospasm 2min. after the application of 2mg/kg bolus
      of lidocaine. This effect had already diminished after 10 min.

      The laryngeal reflex responses differ largely in children anesthetized with either
      inhalational anesthetics or with propofol. The impact iv administered lidocaine on laryngeal
      and respiratory reflex responses in children anesthetized with propofol has not been
      assessed, although this combination might result in a profound suppression of laryngeal
      reflex responses.
