      tranexamic acid: bolus of 10 mg/kg thirty minutes before resection followed by infusion of 1
      mg/kg/h intraoperatively and for 24 h postoperatively. Control Group C: an equal volume of
      saline. The study drug was prepared by an anesthesiologist not involved in the patient
      management and data collection. The anesthetic technique will be standardized. Serum
      hemoglobin was measured before and after surgery. The volume of the irrigation fluid,
      resected prostate weight and duration of resection were recorded.
