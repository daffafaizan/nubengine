      and lymphomas are the most common ones among them. Acute lymphoblastic lymphoma (ALL) is the
      most common childhood cancer and 78% of leukemia's reported to be ALL. During medical
      treatment children with leukemia are at risk of neuromuscular and musculoskeletal
      complications such as reduced ankle range of motion, reduced muscle strength, gross and fine
      motor performance impairment, decreased energy consumption, osteonecrosis and osteoporosis.
      These conditions can develop as a result of cancer or its treatment. These neuromuscular and
      musculoskeletal complications can affect dynamic balance, endurance and quality of life of
      the children. Childhood cancers have negative effects on sleep; sleep complaints can develop
      with the diagnosis and continue even after recovery period.The aim of this study is to
      identify the status of sleep, fatigue, and quality of life in children with various types of
      cancer and to examine the relationship between these conditions. In addition, families will
      be assessed about their children's conditions and satisfaction with the health care they
      receive.The general situation of children will be determined according to findings from this
      study.
