    
      This is a randomised, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled parallel group study in
      adult pat ients, suffering from acute viral pharyngitis and throat pain of at least moderate
      intensity.

      The whole study will last for up to 4 days, on each of test days patients will take one
      lozenge cont aining Ambroxol hydrochlorid 20 mg/ or placebo/ or benzocaine lozenge 3 mg up to
      6 lozenges per day.

      Using Patient Diaries the assessment of tolerability and efficacy by the patient will be
      obtained.

      Study Hypothesis:

      The primary hypothesis to be tested is the test of superiority of ambroxol 20 mg in
      comparison to placebo. If and only if the corresponding test of superiority to placebo is
      statistically significant, the hypothesis of non-inferiority of am broxol 20 mg in comparison
      to benzocaine 3 mg will be tested.

      Comparison(s):

      For the primary comparison the placebo lozenges will be used, for the secondary comparison
      the benzocaine 3 mg lozenges will be used.
