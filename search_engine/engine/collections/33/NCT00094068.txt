      quantify regional cerebral blood flow (CBF). It has been shown that cerebral perfusion in
      patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) is reduced, particularly in the grey matter. However,
      preliminary data in a small number of male secondary progressive (SP) MS patients with
      erectile dysfunction suggests that sildenafil citrate (ViagraÂ® (Registered Trademark)) helps
      to increase grey matter perfusion. The purpose of this study is to extend these findings to
      male MS patients without erectile dysfunction and female MS patients by comparing CBF
      measures of MS patients of both sexes, to age and gender-matched healthy controls. CBF will
      be measured before and one hour after taking sildenafil citrate.
