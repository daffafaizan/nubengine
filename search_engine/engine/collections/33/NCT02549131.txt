      have a BMI of 40 or greater. The participants will be randomized to receiving skin closure
      with subcuticular sutures or surgical staples if they undergo cesarean section. Either
      technique is currently standard of care. Participants who end up undergoing cesarean section
      will be included in the final data analysis. The participants will be followed for wound
      complication in the first 6 weeks post operatively. Wound complication will be defined as
      wound disruption or infection within 6 weeks post operatively.

      Design and Project Type This study is a randomized controlled trial. At the study facility,
      in 2012 and 2013, over 300 cesarean sections were performed each year in women with BMI of 40
      or greater. Based on this, the investigators expect the duration of the study to be 2 years.
      Randomization and data collection will be completed on 420 women.

      Description of Intervention Two interventions will be used in this project: subcuticular
      suture and surgical staples. The subcuticular suture will be the size and type of suture
      chosen by the surgeon at the time of cesarean. The surgical staples will be the standard
      staples used on the labor and delivery unit.
