      groups. The experimental group will undergo the combined application of intraperitoneal
      irrigation with clindamycin (600mg) and gentamicin (240 mg) solution in 250 ml of normal
      saline, fascial closure with Triclosan-impregnated polyglactin suture and application of
      mupirocin ointment over the skin staples, in addition to the standard care measures. The
      control group undergo only the standard care measures, including decontamination of the skin
      during surgery with chlorhexidine alcohol solution, administration of systemic antibiotic
      prophylaxis and application of thermal blanket to avoid hypothermia. In the control group,
      the fascial closure will be performed with a polyglactin suture (without Triclosan
      impregnation).

      Incisional surgical-site infection will be investigated.
