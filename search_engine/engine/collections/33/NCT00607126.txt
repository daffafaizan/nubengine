      one of two treatment arms. Subjects in the Lokomat arm trained on the Lokomat with a
      supervising physical therapist for 20-30 minutes/session 3 times/week. The Lokomat is a
      robotic exoskeleton which enables the subject to step on a moving treadmill. Subjects were
      suspended in a harness while in the Lokomat with full to partial body weight support as
      needed. After the training in the Lokomat, they practiced overground walking for 10 minutes.

      The other treatment arm had subjects engage in resistance training with weights and
      resistance elastic bands matched to the Lokomat group for intensity, duration and frequency.
      they did not practice overground walking.

      Primary outcome measure was speed to accomplish 25' timed walk.
