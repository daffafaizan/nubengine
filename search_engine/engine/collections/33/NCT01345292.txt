      trial. Approximately 246 generally healthy adults meeting the necessary inclusion/exclusion
      criteria will be enrolled so that 210 subjects (70 per group) would reasonably be expected to
      complete the study. Subjects will have their oral soft/hard tissues assessed and will be
      evaluated for sensitivity levels at Screening (Visit 1), Baseline (Visit 2), Visit 3 at Week
      2 and Visit 4 at Week 4. During the first two weeks of the study, subjects will be instructed
      to brush their teeth for one minute in their usual manner, twice daily, using the provided
      standard fluoride toothpaste. Subjects will return for the Baseline exam and, upon
      qualification with entry criteria, will be assigned to one of three treatment groups.
      Qualified subjects will be instructed to brush their teeth two times daily for one minute in
      their usual manner using the provided toothpaste (standard fluoride toothpaste or 5%
      potassium nitrate toothpaste). Subjects assigned to the mouthrinse group will be instructed
      to rinse twice daily, after brushing, with the provided mouthrinse for 60 seconds using 10
      ml, for 4 consecutive weeks.
