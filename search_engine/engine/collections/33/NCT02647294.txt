      randomly allocated for the treatment with n-3 PUFA (3.6 g/day) or placebo for 12 months. At
      the beginning and at the end of the study basic clinical and anthropometric data will be
      recorded and the following parameters will be tested:

      panel of biochemistry and liver function tests: triglycerides, cholesterol, HDLcholesterol,
      LDL-cholesterol, glucose, insulin, serum bilirubin, liver tests, thyroid hormones, bile acids
      and their metabolites, albumin, total protein.

      Bioactive metabolites, Inflammatory markers Non-invasive serum markers of liver fibrosis and
      steatohepatitis. Hyaluronic acid, NAFLD fibrosis score, cytokeratine-18 fragments.
      Ultrasonography with non-invasive measurement of fibrosis and steatosis, magnetic resonance
      spectroscopy for visceral and liver fat determination.
