      half of ED patients with chest pain are admitted to the hospital to undergo further testing.
      Despite high testing rates, less than 1 in 10 patients with chest pain are ultimately
      diagnosed with an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) at estimated annual cost of $13 billion.
      Current care patterns for acute chest pain fail to focus health system resources, such as
      hospitalization and cardiac testing, on patients most likely to benefit.

      The HEART Pathway, which combines a clinical decision aid, with two serial troponin
      measurements, has been developed to identify patients with chest pain who can safely be
      discharged without objective cardiac testing (stress testing or angiography). Prior
      retrospective and observational studies have established that use of the HEART Pathway
      reduces cardiac testing by >20%, while maintaining an acceptably low adverse event rate. We
      now seek to integrate the HEART Pathway into "real-world" clinical settings to determine
      effectiveness.

      The goal of this proposal is to build a transformative collaboration bridging the gap between
      research, education, and health systems operations to more effectively and efficiently
      provide patient care. The vanguard for this collaboration seeks to improve quality of care
      for patients with acute chest pain by integrating the HEART Pathway into cardiovascular care
      delivery at Wake Forest Baptist Health (WFBH). This project will build on our prior work and
      provide a model for using the education and operational strengths of US academic medical
      centers to disseminate initiatives to improve care delivery.
