      including methods of support that are easily implemented and targeted at caregivers who can
      not access multicomponent interventions. The current intervention examines the efficacy of
      one such approach: expressive writing (EW).

      We are examining the efficacy of EW, in terms of its ability to reduce stress, enhance
      cognition, and improve well-being, by comparing it to two control conditions: objective
      writing about how caregivers spend their time (time management; TM) and objective writing
      about non-personal historical events (history writing; HW).
