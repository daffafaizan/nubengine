      effectiveness of any prescription opioid risk mitigation strategies. Furthermore, due to
      ambiguity in some of the CDCG recommendations and the challenging nature of the
      patient-provider opioid conversation, the success of the CDCG may hinge on the manner in
      which it is implemented in individual care settings. Thus it is unclear what the true effect
      of the CDCG will be. The investigators believe that for the CDCG to have the greatest
      likelihood of achieving its goals of improving prescription opioid safety without causing
      unintended effects (e.g. exacerbation of pain, disruption of other aspects of care), its
      recommendations will need to be skillfully communicated. Furthermore, because of this "human
      element"and other sources of variability, documenting the effectiveness of the CDCG will
      require standardization of implementation. The overarching plan for TOWER is to develop and
      test an algorithmic version of the CDCG tailored for a specific primary care setting, the HIV
      primary care clinic. This CDCG intervention incorporates communication and implementation
      strategies tailored for the HIV primary care setting, and enabled with technology (an app for
      use by patients and EMR tools for providers). Achieving this goal has involved soliciting
      input from the HIV community using the method of Public Deliberation (PD) in the setting of
      two Citizen' s Panels, each with ~22 HIV-infected participants and lasting one day; and using
      the information obtained from the deliberative process to inform the development of the CDCG
      intervention. The investigators now plan to test the CDCG intervention for feasibility.
