    
      -  Patients scheduled for potentially cardiotoxic chemotherapy would receive a baseline
           echocardiogram as per standard protocol which should be covered by the routine insurance

        -  Follow-up with an extra echocardiogram for research purposes would be performed after 2
           cycles of that chemotherapy - supplied by the study

        -  Clinical assessment at 3 to 6 months including repeat echocardiography as per standard
           care with the research question as whether any differences in strain pattern between
           pre-chemo and post 2 cycles studies all identify patients who are more likely to have
           cardiac issues later.

        -  Patients will have standard of care visits at 3 month, 6 month and 12 month and will be
           evaluated for cardiac status and survival.

        -  Patient records will be reviewed at 5 years to check cardiac status and survival.
