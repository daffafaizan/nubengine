      childhood. However, much of the improvement in survival has been made in low stage and
      localized disease. Of significance is the fact that the improvements have come in up-front
      remission rates without translation into significantly high event-free survival(EFS) or
      overall survival (OS). This is despite the fact that these tumors as a whole are largely
      chemotherapy responsive.

      Recent advances in the understanding of the biology of hematopoeitic stem cells have driven
      the design of treatment regimens that allow for dose intensification without unacceptable
      hematologic toxicity. Protocol development has focused on active agents that have a broad
      range between hematologic and non-hematologic toxicities. This study uses a double autologous
      peripheral blood stem cell rescue (PBSC) following dose-intensive chemotherapy for the
      treatment of high-risk pediatric solid tumors. This study utilizes PBSC to limit the risk of
      tumor cell contamination while retaining prompt hematologic recovery from these highly
      intensified treatments.
