      shown to be effective for treating depression. Currently the biological and psychological
      mechanisms of action of attention training for major depression disorder are unknown. The
      objective of the current study is to improve the investigator's understanding of the
      mechanisms of attention training interventions for depression.

      Research participants will include approximately 165 individuals with major depressive
      disorder randomized to one of three types of attention training programs. Before and after
      intervention participants will complete a number of biological assessments including MRI,
      EEG, behavioral tasks, and questionnaires. The study will be completed across three visits:
      (1) a screening visit; (2) data collection session 1; and (3) data collection session 2.
