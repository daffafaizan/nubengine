      failure. EC-MPS is thought to be the key drug preventing both cellular and antibody mediated
      rejections. Several studies have shown that recipients receiving an optimal dose of EC-MPS
      have fewer antibody mediated rejections and may require a lower dose of calcineurin
      inhibitors and/or corticosteroids thus reducing side effects and extending graft survival.
