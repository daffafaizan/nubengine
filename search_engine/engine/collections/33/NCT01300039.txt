      preventing calcium oxalate stones. Intestinal colonization by OF is associated with reduced
      urinary oxalate excretion. Exposure to antibiotics may be an important factor contributing to
      variable rates of colonization. This is the first prospective study to evaluate the effect of
      antibiotics on OF colonization.

      Design, setting, participants, & measurements: The effect of antibiotics on OF colonization
      was compared in 2 groups: a group receiving antibiotics for gastric infection with
      Helicobacter pylori (HP) and a group without HP that not receiving antibiotics. OF
      colonization in stool was detected by oxalate degradation at baseline and after 1 and 6
      months.
