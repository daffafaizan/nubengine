    
      This trial is a randomized, longitudinal study of medical marijuana (MM) that will: (1)
      characterize the impact of MM on indices of addiction, such as CUD, escalation of use,
      tolerance, and withdrawal among those who stop using, (2) assess, via dosing diaries, the
      effect of MM use patterns on use of other medications, and perception of underlying disease
      symptomatology, (3) characterize the impact of MM on neurocognitive performance, including
      executive function, memory, attention, and decision-making and (4) examine evidence for
      impact of MM on brain structure and function. This study will enroll 200 adults with no prior
      history of CUD or heavy marijuana use, who express interest in using MM to treat pain,
      insomnia, anxiety, and/or depression. Participants will be randomly assigned to either an
      active MM arm (n = 100), or to a waitlist control arm (WLC) (n = 100). Participants will be
      assessed at baseline, regularly for 3 months, and at a 6-month and 12-month follow-up for MM
      use behaviors, development of CUD, perception of disease symptomatology, and neurocognitive
      performance. Urine collected at each visit will be assessed with quantitative assays. MRI
      scans will be collected to longitudinally investigate possible brain changes associated with
      MM use.
