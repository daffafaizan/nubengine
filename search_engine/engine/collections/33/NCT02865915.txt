      with a progestin challenge) will be used to better characterize the study population. A
      Treatment Period of 28 weeks' duration will follow the Lead-in Period. Then, an 8-week
      Follow-up Period (i.e., no study drug) will be used to assess the durability of effects of
      MLE4901. The study duration will be approximately 48 weeks (11 months) per subject
