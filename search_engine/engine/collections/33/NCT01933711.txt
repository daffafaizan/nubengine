      cell lymphoma were randomized to either observation or maintenance therapy with rituximab
      (375 mg/m2) administered every 3 months for 2 years. Both pts after first line therapy and
      pts after relapse treatment were included in the study. Pts with aggressive lymphoma were
      enrolled if they had achieved a complete response (CR) after initial treatment. Pts with
      aggressive lymphoma with residual tumor mass underwent positron emission tomography (PET) and
      qualified for randomization if this examination showed no signs of tumor activity. Pts with
      mantle cell lymphoma were eligible for the study if at least a partial response (PR) was
      achieved. Primary endpoint of the study was progression free survival (PFS), secondary
      endpoints were time to progression (TTP), overall survival (OS) and response to treatment.
      Differences between PFS and OS were analysed using the logrank test and the proportional
      hazard model of Cox. TTP was analyzed using a competing risk model with death as competing
      event.
