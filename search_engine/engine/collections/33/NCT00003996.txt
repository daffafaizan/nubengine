      prior to and during radiotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed high grade glioblastoma
      multiforme. II. Assess the toxicities of this treatment regimen in this patient population.
      III. Assess fatigue, depression, and excessive daytime somnolence in terms of incidence,
      duration, and relation to age, tumor type, tumor site, cancer therapy, and symptoms in this
      patient population. IV. Evaluate the quality of life of these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive pre-irradiation chemotherapy consisting of carmustine IV over 1
      hour on days 1-3 and oral etoposide on days 1-21 and 29-49 immediately followed by cisplatin
      IV over 1-2 hours on days 1-3 and 29-31. Treatment repeats every 8 weeks for 2 courses.
      Patients receive concurrent cranial radiotherapy daily over 8 weeks during course 2. Patients
      then receive carmustine IV over 1-2 hours every 8 weeks for 4 courses. Treatment continues in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Quality of life is assessed
      before the study, prior to each treatment course, every 4 months for 1 year, every 6 months
      for 4 years, and then annually for 5 years. Patients are followed every 4 months for 1 year,
      every 6 months for 4 years, annually for 5 years, and then for survival.
