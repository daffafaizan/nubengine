      groups: 0.3 μg/kg intravenous injection s-ketamin; 0.5 μg/kg intravenous injection s-ketamin;
      2 μg/kg intranasal s-ketamin group; 1 μg/kg intranasal s-ketamin + 1 μg/kg intranasal
      dexmedetomidine group; 0.5 μg/kg intranasal s-ketamin + 2 μg/kg intranasal dexmedetomidine
      group.

      The modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety Scale (m-YPAS) was used to assess preoperative anxiety
      at 1, 5, 10, 20, and 30min after premedication. A 4-point emotional state score was used to
      evaluate participators when they were separated from their parents and their response to
      intravenous cannulation or facemask application. Agitation scores (Pediatric Anesthesia
      Emergence Delirium [PAED] scale) and POV was assessed in the postanesthetic care unit (PACU).
      Times to endotracheal tube or laryngeal mask airway removal, discharge from the PACU, and
      patients' satisfaction degree were also assessed.
