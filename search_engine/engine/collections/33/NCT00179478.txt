      immediately following a first clinical demyelinating event in high risk patients (i.e. those
      with at least 2 asymptomatic white matter lesions on cranial MR imaging > 3 mm in diameter or
      ovoid) delayed the development of clinical definite Multiple Sclerosis (CDMS)(as defined by a
      second, clinically verifiable attack involving another part of the central nervous system)
      over 2 years of observation and significantly decreased the development of new or enlarging
      white matter lesions on MRI over 18 months (see reference). The current study is a long term
      extension of a cohort of CHAMPS study site and participants. The three main aims of the study
      are as follows:

        1. To determine the long term neurological outcome in patients treated with interferon beta
           1a (AVONEX) from onset of a first clinical demyelinating event

        2. To determine if immediate initiation of AVONEX therapy (the CHAMPS Avonex treatment
           group) confers long term benefits compared to delayed initiation of therapy (the CHAMPS
           placebo group) on the rate of development of CDMS, annualized relapse rates, the
           development of permanent disability and MR measures of disease activity and progression.

        3. To determine predictors of long term disease activity and disability in patients
           following a first clinical demyelinating event
