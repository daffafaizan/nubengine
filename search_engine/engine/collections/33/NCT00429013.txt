      suitable way, paraplegic subject by a lingual electric stimulation.

      Two A and B study groups of paraplegic subjects will be built-up in a randomized way. Under
      standardized conditions, the A study group subject will modify his usual behavior by using
      the cosmetically acceptable interface to get back information for moving his chest in a
      suitable way in order to correct identified maxima of pressure at the seat/skin interface.
      Under the same conditions but without the developed device, the B study group subject will
      have an usual behavior.

      The analysis of the different behavior in these two groups will enable to evaluate, in an
      objective way, the potential interest of this new medical device for the prevention of
      pressure ulcer.
