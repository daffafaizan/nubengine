      combination therapies with different or complementary mechanisms of action . Data suggest
      that open triple therapy incorporating LAMA with ICS / LABA combination products administered
      through different delivery devices may be beneficial for improving pulmonary function in
      patients with COPD. However, there is little evidence of the effect of triple therapy on
      pulmonary function and the incidence of exacerbations in COPD patients.
