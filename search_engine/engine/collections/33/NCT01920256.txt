      variety of remote communications. Thus far regular monitoring and treatment adjustments by
      remote communications have not yet been fully integrated into endocrine practice in a
      scalable fashion that can be readily disseminated. The PI proposes to test a new endocrine
      model care clinic for high-risk patients with type 2 diabetes that employs regular
      communications initiated by the provider, based on a tailored individual plan. Frequent
      monitoring and interventions will reinforce attainment of prespecified therapy goals, enhance
      patient engagement, and allow a significant decrease in the frequency of outpatient visits.
      In turn, the clinic will be able to accommodate more patients with type 2 diabetes than
      traditional endocrine clinics. Data management and day-to-day clinic operation will be
      computerized with technology that has been developed by the institution. The project is
      highly significant since it proposes a new model of endocrine care for high-risk patients
      with type 2 diabetes that may improved disease outcome in more patients and reduce medical
      expenses.
