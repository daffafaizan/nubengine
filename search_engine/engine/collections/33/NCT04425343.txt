      TM Total DNA (version 2.0) (Cat No: M501DP100) according to the manufacturer's instruction.
      All the samples were assessed for DNA quantification using spectrophotometry and further
      quantified using the fluorometric method. This was performed using DeNovix DS-11 FX
      (DeNovix). Further to the DNA quantification, assessment of DNA integrity was resolved on a
      0.8% agarose gel with ethidium bromide. For NGS library preparation, all the samples
      underwent PCR amplification of the 16S rRNA gene in the isolated bacterial DNA. The primers
      used had targeted in the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. The full length primer sequences,
      using standard IUPAC nucleotide nomenclature, to follow the protocol targeting this region
      are:
