      nasal immunizations composed of a hybrid protein antigen from M. tuberculosis virus mixed
      with a toxoid adjuvant, causes untoward adverse reactions when administered to healthy adult
      volunteers. Both subjects who have not received BCG and subjects who have already received
      BCG will be enrolled. An initial evaluation of immune responses to the vaccine will also be
      undertaken using flow cytometry to enumerate antigen specific IFNg containing T cells;
      ELISPOT to determine IFNg secreting antigen specific T cells; serology and nasal wash
      antibody.
