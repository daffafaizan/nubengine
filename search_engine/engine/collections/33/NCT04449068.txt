      globus pallidus internus (GPi) to selected, treatment-refractory patients with TS. On
      average, three to four patients undergo surgery every year. Even though a first follow-up of
      the STIC cohort up to four years post-op indicates ongoing improvement of tic severity, many
      questions remains regarding the efficacy of GPi DBS in TS. These questions include frequent
      comorbidities of TS, quality of life, evolution of medication and stimulation parameters, as
      well as neuropsychological functioning. Therefore, the investigator proposes to evaluate all
      patients undergoing GPi DBS for TS to be evaluated comprehensively pre-operatively and once
      yearly after surgery until reaching the 5-year mark. The investigator team hopes these data
      may help to plan for future international multicenter trials, and provide indications on
      prognostic factors concerning response to GPi DBS in TS.
