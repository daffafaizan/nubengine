      I. To evaluate the overall response rate (ORR) at 4 months of ibrutinib plus rituximab and
      lenalidomide in elderly patients with newly-diagnosed, untreated mantle cell lymphoma (MCL).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the toxicity profile of the combination of ibrutinib plus rituximab and
      lenalidomide in newly diagnosed, untreated MCL.

      II. To estimate the overall response rate (ORR); (partial response [PR] or better), the
      response duration (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS), time to progression (TTP) and
      overall survival (OS). Clinical benefit response [(CBR) = marginal response (MR) + ORR] will
      also be evaluated.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Correlative studies will be aimed at confirming the mechanism of action of the combination
      and to identify predictors of response or resistance to therapy.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants receive ibrutinib orally (PO) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Participants also receive rituximab
      intravenously (IV) on days 1, 8, 15 and 22 in course 1 and 2, on day 1 of course 3-8, and
      then on day 1 of every other 28-day course, lenalidomide PO on days 1-21, and dexamethasone
      PO weekly. Treatment with rituximab repeats every 28 days for 2 years, with lenalidomide for
      1 year, and with dexamethasone for up to 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up at 30 days, every 3 months
      for 1 year, and every 6 months thereafter.
