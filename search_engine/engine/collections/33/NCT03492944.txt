      contrast agent (Lumason; Bracco Diagnostics) in pediatric and adult Crohn's disease patients
      undergoing either MR enterography (MRE, or MRI of the bowel) or CT enterography (CTE, or CT
      of the bowel). In April 2016, Lumason was FDA approved for intravenous administration and
      imaging of the liver in children. Imaging of the bowel will employ an identical
      administration method to that described for liver imaging, but the ultrasound transducer will
      be placed over the affected intestines as opposed to liver.
