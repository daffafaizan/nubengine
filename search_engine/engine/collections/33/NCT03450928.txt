      achalasia, based on technical developments from NOTES (natural orifice translumenal surgery).
      The technique includes the incision of the mucosa in the esophageal body, the submucosal
      dissection of the distal esophagus and the creation of a submucosal tunnel in the distal
      esophagus and proximal gastric body, and the esophageal myotomy. The procedure is performed
      transorally, using a flexible endoscope.

      In published series, a 12cm-POEM is usually performed. Surgical myotomy is typically shorter,
      being protracted for about 8cm. The clinical efficacy of POEM and surgical myotomy is more
      likely to be similar according to the most recent published series.

      In this randomized controlled trial (non-inferiority trial) we evaluate the outcomes of POEM
      according to the length of the esophageal myotomy.

      Patients with type I and II achalasia will be randomly assigned to one of the two groups,
      long--myotomy (LM) and short--myotomy (SM).

      Patients in the LM-group will receive a 12cm-long POEM (including 3cm on the stomach); in the
      SM-group patients will undergo a POEM extended for 7 cm (including 3cm on the stomach).

      During follow-up, High Resolution Manometry (HRM), Esophageal pH-monitoring study and
      Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) will be regularly performed and symptoms assessed with the
      use of the Eckardt score (ECKs).

      The main hypothesis is that the results of a SM are not inferior to the results of a LM.
      Calculated sample size is 200 patients
