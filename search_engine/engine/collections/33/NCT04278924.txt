      people who have primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). This study will evaluate the safety
      and biologic activity of TAK-079 or matching placebo in combination with stable ITP
      background therapy.

      The study will enroll approximately 54 patients. In Part A of the study, participants will be
      randomly assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the three treatment groups.
      Those who received placebo in this period will have the choice to receive study drug after a
      safety follow-up period and will be randomized to one of the two open-label TAK-079 treatment
      arms.

      In Part B participants will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups. Those who
      received placebo in this period will have the choice to receive study drug after a safety
      follow-up period in a single open-label TAK-079 treatment arm.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted worldwide. All participants will be followed for at
      least 8 weeks in a safety follow-up period after the 8 weeks of treatment.
