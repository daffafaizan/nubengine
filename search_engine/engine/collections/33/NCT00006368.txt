      recurrent malignant neoplasms that prove positive for somatostatin receptors. II. Determine
      the safety and lifetime serious adverse event profile of this regimen in these patients. II.
      Determine the antitumor effect and the effect of repeated administrations on the renal
      excretion pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation, multicenter study. Patients undergo octreotide
      scintigraphy to determine the location of somatostatin receptors. Patients then receive
      yttrium Y 90-SMT 487 IV over 15 minutes on day 1. Treatment continues every 6 weeks for up to
      4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6
      patients each are entered on course I (vertical dose escalation) and courses II, III, and IV
      (horizontal dose escalation). Cohorts receive escalating doses of yttrium Y 90-SMT 487 until
      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. MTDs are determined for a single course and
      for 4 courses. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which no more than 2 of 6
      patients experience dose limiting toxicities. Results of course I determine the dosage of
      subsequent courses. Patients are evaluated on days 2 and 7, and at weeks 4 and 6, following
      each injection of yttrium Y 90-SMT 487. Patients are followed at 12 and 18 months and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 20 patients will be accrued for this study.
