      variable extent, at a variable range of time points. Microorganisms may be protected from
      disinfectants by production of thick masses of cells and extracellular materials, or
      biofilms. Moreover, antiseptics should not lead to dysbiosis after use. Dysbiosis is a
      negative change in the microbiome of a particular skin or mucosal region. The Human
      Microbiome project showed, that every area has a specific microbiota in which the human host
      lives with an abundance of commensal, synergistic, and potentially pathogenic microorganisms.
      Antiseptics with efficacy gaps and resistance may induce such dysbiosis, especially after
      prolonged use.

      It is envisaged that twelve healthy volunteers will complete the study. Each healthy
      volunteer will rinse with the test product according to a developed protocol, between
      established wash out periods.

      The ability of the test product (1% Betadine® PVP-I based mouth wash and gargle) compared to
      the reference products (0.2% Chlor-Rinse™ Chlorhexidine based mouth wash (No alcohol) and
      Normal saline gargle) to reduce resident and transient microflora will be assessed. The mouth
      wash products will also be assessed for their ability to maintain and/or restore balanced
      microflora.
