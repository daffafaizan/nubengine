    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the detection rates of gallium 68-labeled PSMA-11 ([68]Ga-PSMA-11) PET/CT and
      fluciclovine F18 (Axumin) PET/CT for the identification of tumor location(s), by patient and
      region based analysis.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Detection rate on a per-patient basis of (68)Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT and Axumin PET/CT,
      stratified by prostate-specific antigen (PSA) value (0.2 - < 0.5; 0.5 - < 1.0; 1.0 - < 2.0).

      II. Sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) on a per-patient basis, of (68)Ga-PSMA-11
      PET/CT and Axumin PET/CT for the detection of tumor location(s), confirmed by
      histopathology/biopsy and/or clinical and conventional imaging follow-up.

      III. Agreement among the readers, separate for (68)Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT versus Axumin PET/CT.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants receive (68)Ga-PSMA-11 intravenously (IV) and 60-90 minutes later, undergo
      PET/CT imaging over 3 hours. Participants also undergo best standard of care Axumin PET/CT
      within 2 weeks before or after (68)Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT.

      After completion of the PET/CT scan, participants are followed up between 1 and 3 days and up
      to 12 months.
