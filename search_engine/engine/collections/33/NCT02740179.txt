      with no known history of cardiovascular disease. Eplerenone is a mineralocorticoid receptor
      antagonist, which can block aldosterone activation. This medication is approved by the FDA
      for high blood pressure and heart failure. This study aims to investigate the effect of
      eplerenone on other measures of cardiovascular disease in HIV. Using PET, MRI, and CT imaging
      technology, this study will evaluate whether eplerenone can improve coronary flow reserve and
      myocardial inflammation/fibrosis, in addition to atherosclerotic plaque build-up among the
      HIV population. The study also includes teaching on lifestyle modification to promote a
      healthy diet and exercise program.There are 3 overnight visits in addition to safety visits.
