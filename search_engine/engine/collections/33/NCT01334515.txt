    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of sargramostim (GM-CSF) and isotretinoin given in
      combination with hu14.18-IL-2 (hu14.18-IL2 fusion protein), as a test of feasibility for a
      future Phase III study.

      II. To evaluate the anti-tumor activity of hu14.18-IL2 given in combination with GM-CSF and
      isotretinoin in patients with recurrent or refractory neuroblastoma with disease measurable
      by standard radiographic criteria (stratum-1).

      III. To evaluate the anti-tumor activity of hu14.18-IL2 given in combination with GM-CSF and
      isotretinoin in patients with recurrent or refractory neuroblastoma evaluable only by meta
      iodo benzyl guanidine I 123 (MIBG) scintigraphy and/or bone marrow histology (stratum-2).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the disease burden of stratum-2 patients by semi-quantitative assessment of
      bone marrow and MIBG scintigraphy and determine whether there is an association between lower
      disease burden and response to hu14.18-IL2.

      II. To assess molecular parameters of response (reverse-transcriptase (RT) polymerase chain
      reaction (PCR)) for patients meeting complete response (CR) criteria.

      III. To evaluate the immunologic activation induced in vivo by hu14.18-IL2. IV. To determine
      the induction of anti-hu14.18-IL2 antibody by treatment with hu14.18-IL2.

      V. To test for associations between tumor response versus immune activation and
      anti-hu14.18-IL2 activity, and between measurements of toxicity versus immune activation and
      anti-hu14.18-IL2 activity.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to measurable disease
      (disease measurable by standard radiographic criteria [stratum-1] vs disease evaluable only
      by meta iodo benzyl guanidine I 123 (MIBG) and/or bone marrow histology [stratum-2]).

      Patients receive sargramostim subcutaneously (SC [preferred]) or IV over 2 hours on days 1-2
      and 8-14, hu14.18-IL2 fusion protein IV over 4 hours on days 4-6, and isotretinoin orally
      (PO) twice daily on days 11-24. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 4-10 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients in stratum-1 who achieve
      stable disease (SD) after course 4 are removed from protocol therapy. Patients in stratum-2
      who achieve SD after course 4 receive 2 additional courses of study treatment. Patients may
      undergo blood and bone marrow sample collection periodically for correlative studies.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year, every
      6 months for 2 years, and then yearly for 2 years.
