      well-recognized problems of patient compliance. Injection of depot corticosteroids into
      sub-Tenon's capsule is an established method of treating various ocular inflammatory
      diseases. Its prolonged therapeutic effect has provided the ophthalmologist with an
      alternative tool for the treatment of different diseases that may be extended to the surgical
      arena to modulate postoperative inflammation.

      The use of topical antibiotic agents poses unique and challenging hurdles for drug delivery,
      especially because recent reports have suggested that the incidence of endophthalmitis may be
      increasing. Exploiting the permeability of the sclera, subconjunctival routes may offer a
      more promising alternative for enhanced drug delivery and tissue targeting compared with
      topical routes. In theory, the combination of an antibiotic with a steroid in a
      controlled-release system delivered transscleral could be feasible after cataract surgery to
      achieve several clinical objectives, i.e., eliminate topical medications, enhance patient
      compliance, improve drug bioavailability, and protect the patient from infection.
