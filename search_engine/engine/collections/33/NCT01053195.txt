      and two rural counties of Huangdao and Jiaonan, covering 1.94 million of people living in 512
      urban communities and 1128 rural natural villages. There are 637000 households in the
      targeting districts.

      In the first 3-years (2005-2008) we have focused on preparing educational materials, health
      promotion, distributing the project materials, training health professionals, establishing
      the project networks, identifying high-risk individuals etc., while from 2008-2011 we will
      transfer our working emphasis on lifestyle intervention to those with high-risk for diabetes.

      According to the data collected in 2006, about 456288 individuals aged 35 years or older are
      estimated to have a risk score >=14. We estimate that at least 65% of the non-diabetic
      high-risk individuals (n=242112) will be identified and referred to one of the 600 community
      clinics for lifestyle counseling and intervention.

      Lifestyle intervention includes individual and group counseling sessions organised by the
      community doctors in a real life setting. The intervals of the counseling sessions depend on
      the glucose levels of the high-risk individuals, every three months for those having impaired
      fasting glucose or/and impaired glucose tolerance and every six months for those with normal
      glucose levels but with high risk score. At the end of the project, the cost-effectiveness of
      the community-based intervention will be evaluated.
