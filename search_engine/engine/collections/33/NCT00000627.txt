      triazole antifungal agent that has been used successfully in the treatment of experimental
      histoplasmosis in animals, but has not been completely evaluated in patients for this use. It
      has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for certain other fungal infections.
      Nevertheless, physicians are prescribing it to their patients with histoplasmosis. This is a
      pilot study to examine the role of fluconazole for treating histoplasmosis in AIDS patients.

      At least 40 patients with AIDS and an initial episode of disseminated histoplasmosis are
      selected for the study. Patients receive fluconazole for a total of 12 weeks. Patients who
      are unable to take the drug orally may receive it intravenously until oral administration is
      possible. Patients are evaluated at weeks 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12. Patients who are doing well
      without evidence of clinical failure or dose-limiting toxicity are permitted to continue
      maintenance therapy to prevent relapse at a reduced dose for an additional 12 months; those
      who relapse on the reduced dose are permitted to receive re-induction with a higher dose.
