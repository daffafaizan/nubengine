      non-interventional study to evaluate the degree of compliance at PETHEMA centres in Spain
      with the clinical practice guidelines proposed by the Spanish Myeloma Group for the treatment
      of relapsed and refractory MM with POMCIDEX.

      In this study, all patients will be included retrospectively who met the inclusion criteria
      for the GEM clinical practice guidelines and who were treated with POMCIDEX. The period of
      retrospective data collection will be from 01/01/2015 to 01/04/2018.

      The period of data collection for the study includes a maximum period of three months to
      allow each centre to collect the necessary clinical and demographic data for each patient in
      order to fulfill the different study objectives. Patient data will be anonymized and recorded
      in the electronic Case Report Form (eCRF) using the RedCap platform. Afterward, data
      cleansing and verification will be carried out on all data recorded by the study
      investigators. This procedure will be carried out in the six months after database lock.

      Once the process of recording and verification of patient data is complete, extraction and
      statistical analysis of the data will be carried out.
