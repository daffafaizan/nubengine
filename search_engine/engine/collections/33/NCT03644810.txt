      population and is considered an important factor to account for in rehabilitation. The
      ability to dampen pain via endogenous pain modulatory mechanisms is likewise known to be
      reduced in musculoskeletal pain conditions.

      Studies utilizing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have demonstrated that the
      supraspinal areas involved in pain-related cognitive processing to a great extent overlap
      with those involved in endogenous pain modulation. Therefore, it is plausible that factors
      such as pain catastrophizing thoughts may affect the nervous systems ability to dampen pain.

      Chronic low back pain is the single clinical problem with the biggest impact in the modern
      society. Previous studies have demonstrated that pain catastrophizing and reduced endogenous
      pain inhibition are part of the clinical picture. However, previous studies have never
      investigated a potential relationship between these two factors.
