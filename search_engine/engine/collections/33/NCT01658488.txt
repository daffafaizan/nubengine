      scheduled to be between menses.

      You will then be assigned to eat regular rice dishes or rice dishes fortified with iron for
      the two-week period. The assignment to the rice group will be made randomly (like flipping a
      coin). Your chance of being in either rice group will be 50:50. You will be given 14 frozen
      rice meals in styrofoam containers to take home. You will be expected to eat two rice dishes
      per day for the next study week and to bring the empty containers to your next study visit.
