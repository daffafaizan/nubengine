      gemcitabine in the treatment of locally advanced transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder.
      Patients will be stratified based on extent of disease. Patients with T3, N0 disease will
      receive 3 cycles of chemotherapy and then proceed to cystectomy. Patients with T4 disease or
      any patient with N1-3 disease will receive 3 cycles of therapy followed by assessment of
      response. Patients with evidence of response will then receive an additional three cycles of
      therapy with reassessment of resectability after cycles #6. Correlative Studies: Tumor
      specimens obtained at initial biopsy will be assayed for expression of p53, Rb and p21.
