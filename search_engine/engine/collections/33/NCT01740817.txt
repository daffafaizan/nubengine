      insulin sensitivity. A group of 30 subjects aged 18-60 years old, lean (BMI < 26 kg/m2)
      normal glucose tolerant subjects without a family history of type 2 diabetes will receive a
      lipid or saline infusion. The subjects will be randomly assigned to first receive either a 48
      hour long lipid or saline infusion. Approximately 4-6 weeks later subjects will return to
      undergo another study (if, in the first study they received lipid, on the second study they
      will receive saline, and vice versa). A near-equal number of women and men will be included
      in each group.
