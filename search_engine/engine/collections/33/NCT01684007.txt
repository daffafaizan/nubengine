      the operative visit for each eye, and up to 4 postoperative visits (each eye examined at Day
      1-2, with binocular visits at Day 30 and Day 90 after the second implantation). The second
      implantation will occur between 1 and 45 days of the first. If the first eye is not implanted
      during surgery, the second eye is not eligible. lf both eyes are not implanted with the
      assigned IOL, the subject will be followed for safety evaluation.
