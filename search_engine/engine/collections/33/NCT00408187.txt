      physical and mental well being. The most common form of psoriasis is plaque psoriasis.
      Targeted treatments in psoriasis have been reported recently, yet ciclosporin, a calcineurin
      inhibitor (CNi) remains one of the treatments which has the greatest efficacy. Voclosporin
      represents the possibility of a calcineurin inhibitor which is not only as efficacious as
      ciclosporin A, but also has an improved toxicity profile.
