    
      Bronchiectasis is a chronic disorder of the major bronchi and bronchioles characterized by
      permanent dilation, microbial infection, a persistent inflammatory response with the release
      of immune mediators and microbial toxins leading to destruction. The origin of bronchiectasis
      varies, but the presence of microbial infection and a persistent inflammatory response is
      typical of the disease. The chronic nature of the infection and the associated considerable
      morbidity provides the rationale for using aerosolized antibiotics for the treatment of
      bronchiectasis patients.

      This is a study of safety and efficacy of combined administration of nebulized tobramycin
      compared with systemic administration alone in patients with Bronchiectasis in acute
      exacerbation of Bronchiectasis. Study subjects will be randomized to receive either study
      drug or placebo by inhalation via a nebulizer. Each subject will complete 14 days of daily
      dosing.

      Clinical laboratory parameters,clinical adverse events and pulmonary function will be
      evaluated for all study subjects in order to determine the qualitative and quantitative
      safety and efficacy of nebulized tobramycin.
