      NFPA to control tumor re-growth as adjuvant therapy after neurosurgery and whether
      pasireotide is capable of normalizing the prolactin levels in patients with prolactinomas
      resistant to cabergoline; to assess the mRNA levels of dopamine receptor type 2 (DR2) and
      SSTR1-5 and their protein expression; to evaluate the in vitro hormonal response to
      cabergoline, octreotide and pasireotide; and to determine whether the mRNA DR2/SSTR1-5 and/or
      protein expression and/or in vitro hormonal response to cabergoline, octreotide and
      pasireotide correlates with the in vivo response to the former and to the last one. With this
      data the investigators intend to establish if the mRNA analysis and/or protein expression in
      NFPA and resistant prolactinomas might be predictive or foretelling factors concerning drug
      treatment in patients with this kind of pituitary tumors and also evaluate if there is any
      response in vitro or in vivo to the treatment with pasireotide in NFPA and resistant
      prolactinomas and with cabergoline in NFPA.
