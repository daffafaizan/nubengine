      individual's responsiveness to internal cues of physiological hunger and satiety; this
      phenomenon is known as interoceptive awareness and has been shown to be lower in individuals
      with overweight or obesity. Mindfulness training may improve interoceptive awareness and thus
      may facilitate more effective regulation of eating through increased sensitivity to cues of
      hunger and fullness. Mindful eating programs have been shown to increase interoceptive
      awareness of hunger and satiety cues and decrease weight in individuals with obesity.
      Although these programs are effective, they involve lengthy group sessions, require
      extensively trained staff, and are not widely available outside of clinical research. Thus,
      the reach and impact of these programs are limited.

      The present study developed and tested a brief mindful eating intervention inspired by
      Kristeller & Wolever's (2010) Mindfulness-Based Eating Awareness Training program to increase
      interoceptive awareness in individuals with overweight and obesity as a means to increase
      mindful and intuitive eating, reduce overeating and facilitate weight loss. The program
      consisted of 9 weekly 10-15 minute sessions structured around one simple evidence-based
      mindful eating exercise, and was delivered to adult (ages 18-67) employees from a Canadian
      university.
