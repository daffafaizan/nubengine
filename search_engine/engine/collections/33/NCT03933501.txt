      SRP plus placebo, and the SRP+AM group (n = 12), which received SRP and 375mg amoxicillin
      plus 250 mg metronidazole for 7 days, the FMUD group (n = 12), which received FMUD plus
      placebo, and the FMUD+AM group (n = 12), which received FMUD and 375mg amoxicillin plus 250
      mg metronidazole for 7 days. The following clinical outcomes were tested: plaque and bleeding
      on probing indices, pocket probing depth (PD), relative gingival margin position (GMP), and
      relative clinical attachment level (CAL). The total amount of Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg),
      Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (Aa), Tannerella forsythia (Tf), and gingival
      crevicular fluid (GCF) concentration of interleukin (IL)-10 and IL-1b were also determined.
      All clinical, microbiological, and immunological parameters were assessed at baseline and at
      3 and 6 months post-therapy. The ANOVA/Tukey test was used for statistical analysis (a = 5%).
