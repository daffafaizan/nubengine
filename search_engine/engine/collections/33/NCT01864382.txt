      common after stroke. These patients show a significant decrease in the performance level of
      the trunk, compared to healthy individuals of the same age and sex and present asymmetry of
      the trunk and pelvis.

      Sitting involves the ability to achieve a variety of objects that are in and out of arm's
      length, as personal daily activities, showering, going to the bathroom and dressing. These
      arm movements, triggering postural adjustments in the muscles of the trunk and lower
      extremities, which anticipated the movement always precede the active movement. This
      anticipative control can be altered in subjects with stroke.

      The trunk seems particularly important for balance, as stabilizes the pelvis and spine. Dean
      et al, (1997; 2007) and Ibrahimi (2010) showed a beneficial effect on functional scope of
      practice tasks, sitting in variables dynamic sitting balance, load weight of the affected
      side and standing. Also in the studies of Howe (2005); Verheyden (2009); Saeys
      (2011);Karthikbabu (2011) and Kumar (2011) with specific exercises for the trunk, favorable
      outcomes were obtained compared with standard treatment. However, these studies with few
      patients and without any monitoring, it needs to be confirmed (what is this study intended)
