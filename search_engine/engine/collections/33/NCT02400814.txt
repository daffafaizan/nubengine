    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine which administration schedule of MPDL3280A (anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody
      MPDL3280A) and stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SAR) will be most promising to move
      forward to a phase II trial based on safety and objective response rate.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To define the safety and toxicity profile of MPDL3280A plus SAR using Common Terminology
      Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4 (v4).

      II. Radiographic response rates by immure-related Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
      Tumors (irRECIST).

      III. Progression free survival using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)
      1.1 and irRECIST.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Conduct correlative immunologic endpoints.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 3 arms.

      ARM I (CONCURRENT COHORT): Patients receive anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody MPDL3280A
      intravenously (IV) over 30-60 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning on day 1 of course 1, patients
      also undergo SAR 2-3 times per week (with a minimum of 40 hours and a maximum of 96 hours
      between fractions) over 1.5-2 weeks for a total of 5 fractions.

      ARM II (INDUCTION COHORT): Patients receive anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody MPDL3280A IV over
      30-60 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Beginning on day 1 of course 3, patients also undergo SAR 2-3 times
      per week (with a minimum of 40 hours and a maximum of 96 hours between fractions) over 1.5-2
      weeks for a total of 5 fractions.

      ARM III (SEQUENTIAL COHORT): Patients undergo SAR 2-3 times per week (with a minimum of 40
      hours and a maximum of 96 hours between fractions) over 1.5-2 weeks for a total of 5
      fractions beginning on day 1 of course 1. After completion of SAR (beginning on day 1 of
      course 2), patients receive anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody MPDL3280A IV over 30-60 minutes on
      day 1. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.
