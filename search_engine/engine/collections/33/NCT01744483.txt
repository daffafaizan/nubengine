      feasibility of performing a large, randomized, comparative effectiveness trial of two
      specially designed airway tubes (endotracheal tubes; ETTs) for the prevention of
      ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Modification of the material and design of the ETT
      cuff that is positioned in the trachea, and/or continuous aspiration of subglottic secretions
      through an extra port positioned between the tube cuff and the vocal chords may prevent
      leakage of contaminated secretions around the cuff and thereby reduce the risk of VAP. The
      investigators are planning a phase III, randomized, controlled trial comparing the
      effectiveness of a polyurethane-cuffed endotracheal tube (PUC-ETT), a polyurethane-cuffed
      tube that also allows continuous aspiration of subglottic secretions (PUC-CASS-ETT), and a
      conventional, polyvinylchloride-cuffed endotracheal tube (PVC-ETT) in mechanically ventilated
      patients with respiratory failure. Prior to initiating the Phase III trial, a smaller pilot
      study is necessary in order to establish feasibility and to gather data on endpoints in order
      to establish enrollment rates and project sample size for the definitive trial. For the
      purposes of planning, a surrogate for VAP, bacterial colonization of the trachea will be
      assessed from daily quantitative cultures to allow estimation of effect size for the two
      study devices. VAP will be diagnosed using objective criteria, based on cultures from
      bronchoalveolar lavage. The safety profile of the tubes will be evaluated using a
      multi-faceted approach, including short-term objective measures of laryngeal dysfunction and
      long-term subjective and objective assessment of upper airway problems via phone interview
      post-hospital discharge, and recording of device-related adverse events.
