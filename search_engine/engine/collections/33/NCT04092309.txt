    
      The purpose of the present study is to investigate the effect of ACE inhibitors and the
      sacubitril-valsartan complex in bone marrow transplant patients in preventing cardiotoxicity
      when administered immediately after transplantation.

      The effect of medication will be studied in detail:

      i) in global longitudinal strain of left ventricle (GLS), ii) in the volume change of the
      right and the left ventricle, through the cardiac cycle using 3D echocardiography, iii) in
      the Myocardial Work Index (MWI) of the left ventricle, with a strain -pressure curve study
      iv) in the 4D strain of the left atrium, v) in elastic properties of aorta (pulse wave
      velocity (PWV), central systolic pressure (CSBP-mmHg) and augmentation index (Aix%), vii) in
      permeability of glycocalyx and viii) in serum biomarker values, namely troponin I high
      sensitivity and atrial natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP).
