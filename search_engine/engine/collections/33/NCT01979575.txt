    
      This is a single site, prospective, non-blinded, non-randomized, non-interventional study
      designed to evaluate the hemodynamic and cardiovascular effects of the steep Trendelenburg
      position on non-invasive or minimally invasive monitors used in the operating room during
      surgical procedures requiring this patient position.

      SPECIFIC AIMS: 1) Observe the hemodynamic and cardiovascular changes associated with the
      change from the supine to the steep Trendelenburg position. 2) Observe the hemodynamic and
      cardiovascular changes during intra-abdominal insufflation used during laparoscopic surgical
      procedures.

      HYPOTHESIS: Hemodynamic and cardiovascular changes during alterations in position from supine
      to steep Trendelenburg and intra-abdominal insufflation measured by non-invasive and
      minimally invasive monitors will correlate with transthoracic echocardiographic measurements.
