    
      The 3-Step Workout for Life program is designed to help older adults improve muscle strength
      and apply the improved muscle strength to perform activities of daily living. The 10-week
      workout consists of single-joint resistance exercise, multiple-joint resistance exercise, and
      activities of daily living exercise. Participants will exercise in small groups in a
      community room as well as one-on-one with the fitness staff in their home. The community
      fitness staff will learn the 3-Step Workout for Life program from the University partner and
      deliver the program.
