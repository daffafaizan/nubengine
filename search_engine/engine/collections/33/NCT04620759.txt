    
      The objectives of this double-blind, placebo-controlled study are to test the hypotheses that
      a single high (25 mg) oral dose of psilocybin will lead to enduring reductions in depressive
      symptoms (as measured by the clinician-rated grid version of the Hamilton Depression Rating
      Scale, or GRID-HAMD) and amount of drinking (as measured using the Time Line Follow Back, or
      TLFB, procedure) compared to placebo in patients with co-occurring MDD and AUD. 90 male and
      female volunteers who are between the ages of 21 and 65 years old and who meet Diagnostic and
      Statistical Manual, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) criteria for MDD and AUD will be recruited from the
      community and complete all study procedures. Volunteers will be randomized to one of two
      study arms (psilocybin [N=45] or placebo [N=45]), and will complete a drug administration
      session paired with a brief Motivational Interviewing intervention for alcohol use.
      Volunteers will undergo assessments of depression and alcohol use before and after treatment.
      After primary endpoints are measured, all volunteers will receive a second, unblinded
      intervention with a single high dose of psilocybin (25 mg) to test a secondary hypothesis
      that two doses of psilocybin are more effective in treating MDD with co-occurring AUD than a
      single dose.
