      disorder (SPD) will be evaluated and, if symptomatic for the disease, will be randomized to
      one of the arms: intervention arm with 2 booster sessions of cognitive behavioral therapy in
      online format; active control arm, in which individuals will watch videos with quality of
      life orientation. Patients included in this study are coming from a brazilian clinical trial
      conducted between the years of 2014 and 2018, in wich patients with SPD were treated with a
      cognitive behavioral treatment protocol in individual or group formats, resulting in
      improvement of SPD symptoms and comorbid anxiety and depression. Before the intervention,
      individuals will be evaluated by a psychiatrist, to assess SPD and comorbid symptoms
      severity, thru the application of some instruments to assess SPD, anxiety, depression and
      emotional regulation. Also, the CRISIS questionnaire, about the impact of COVID-19 in mental
      health, will be applied. After the interventions, the instruments will be applied again, by
      the same evaluator, wich is blinded to the type of intervention that the patient received.
