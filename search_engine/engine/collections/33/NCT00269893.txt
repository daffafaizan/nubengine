    
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study evaluating the
      efficacy and safety of abciximab, an anti-platelet therapy, in patients undergoing high risk
      coronary angioplasty. The primary outcomes of the study include any of the following: the
      number of deaths from any cause, or myocardial infarctions and recurrent ischemic events
      requiring urgent intervention (e.g., repeat angioplasty, coronary artery bypass surgery,
      intracoronary stent placement, or intra-aortic balloon pump).

      Patients receive an abciximab bolus, abciximab bolus plus infusion, or placebo.
