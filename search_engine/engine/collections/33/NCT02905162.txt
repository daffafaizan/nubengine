      Correctional Facility, Kamwala Remand Centre, and Chainama Correctional Facility and Kabwe
      Correctional Complex. HIV care retention, mortality and changes in CD4 count and HIV-1 viral
      load at 6 month post-release information will be obtained from the SmartCare database.

      Validated psychometric instruments will be used to assess AUD prevalence and alcohol use
      severity pre-incarceration, at release and about 3 to 6 months post-release. Using
      mixed-methods, effects of AUDs on retention in care at 3 and/or 6 months post-release will be
      estimated.

      Sub-group analyses among HIV-infected individuals on ART and those enrolled in care but not
      yet on ART (i.e. pre-ART) will enable assessment of AUD effects on biological markers of HIV
      disease control and progression.

      The Behavioural Model for Vulnerable Populations, and validated psychometric instruments,
      questionnaires, and in-depth interviews, factors beyond AUDs that may influence post-release
      retention in HIV care will be evaluated. Finally, preferred and relevant program elements for
      a future prisoner transitional HIV care pilot will be examined by conducting in-depth
      interviews with a purposive sample of approximately 26 HIV-infected releasees and leaders
      from the Zambian government and prominent implementing partner organizations, as well as
      focus group discussions with frontline prison officers, health workers, and representatives
      of leading civil society organizations in Zambia.
