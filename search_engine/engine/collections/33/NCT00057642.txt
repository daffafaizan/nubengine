      underutilize mental health services relative to their own mental health needs. Cultural
      factors are important causes of underutilization. To date, however, attempts to boost
      utilization by improving the cultural congruence of psychiatric services have not focused on
      retaining Hispanics in antidepressant therapy.

      Motivational Interviewing (MI) is a time-limited psychotherapy that has successfully improved
      treatment retention among patients with dually diagnosed substance abuse and psychiatric
      disorders. During Phase I of this study, MI is adapted for use as an adjunctive therapy with
      antidepressant treatment and culturally adapted to Hispanic participants. In Phase II,
      participants receive sertraline for 12 weeks and participate in four sessions of MI therapy
      as a supplementary intervention designed to encourage treatment retention. Participants who
      are intolerant to sertraline or have an inadequate response by Week 6 are switched to
      venlafaxine ER while continuing to receive MI and to complete study assessments. A follow-up
      interview is conducted 6 months after the termination of treatment.
