    
      This is a prospective, multi-center, non-randomized, observational registry study of patients
      with myocarditis that undergo CMR examination. Information of other cardiac imagings and
      clinical outcomes are also prospectively collected in the database. This project will
      establish a prospective registry of 200 patients with myocarditis in 5 sites with follow-ups
      of up to 5 years.

      The aim of the project will be as following:

        1. To investigate myocardial tissue features and functional changes in patients with
           myocarditis.

        2. To identify CMR-derived indices that are associated with adverse clinical outcomes.

        3. To compare CMR with other alternative cardiac imaging modalities (i.e., echocardiography
           or SPECT) on prognostic prediction in patients with myocarditis.
