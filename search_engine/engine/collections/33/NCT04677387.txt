    
      This is a prospective pilot RCT that will evaluate the impact of naloxone communication
      training (Nalox-Comm) on 120 pharmacists' naloxone dispensing behaviors (primary outcome).
      Data will be collected at baseline, immediately after training is completed, and at 3-month
      follow up. Data sources include pharmacy records (for naloxone dispensing), simulated patient
      observations (to rate quality of communication), and survey data (for self-reports of
      knowledge and self-efficacy).
