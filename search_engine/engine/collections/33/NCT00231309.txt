    
      This study is a single-arm, non-randomized trial. Patients meeting the criteria for this
      study will be entered sequentially until completion or closure of the study. Early stopping
      rules will be employed to ascertain whether an unacceptable rate of toxicity
      (non-engraftment, and/or acute GvHD) occurs.

      Patients will be prepared for transplant through the administration of one of the following
      conditioning regimen based on his/her primary disease:

      5.1 Total body irradiation 1200 rads in 6 fractionated doses and high dose chemotherapy,
      including etoposide and cyclophosphamide.

      5.2 High dose chemotherapy with busulfan and cyclophosphamide. 5.2.1 Patients who are not
      candidates for TBI will receive chemotherapy-based conditioning regimen.

      5.3 Post transplant immunosuppression prophylaxis against acute GVHD will include
      cyclosporine and methotrexate.

      5.4 Donor will receive 3 daily G-CSF injections (starting on day -3) prior to marrow harvest.
      The injections may be initiated by the donor's primary physician prior to donor's arrival
      here, or by BMT service at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta.

      5.5 Patients will receive daily G-CSF injections (5 mcg/kg) starting from day+5 post
      transplant.
