      aims to explore the utility of a series of questions asking about views of research from the
      perspective of minority and economically disadvantaged research participants. Cognitive
      interviews will be conducted in English and Spanish with 10 participants of the NIAMS CHC at
      the Upper Cardozo Clinic in Washington DC. The interviewer will ask participants about their
      own experiences as well as some hypothetical research studies. Questionnaires will ask
      participants about their general views of the clinical research, perceived risks and benefits
      of research, alternatives to participation, the limits of what they would be willing to
      accept in research and types of research or research procedures they might perceive as
      unfair.
