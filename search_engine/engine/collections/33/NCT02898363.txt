      department of Hérault (20,000 PWIDs) during the four-year period preceding the intervention.
      Investigators will cross the data of social network of PWIDs (CREAI Languedoc Roussillon)
      which covers nearly 90% of PWIDs living in this area, and the Hérault Cancer Registry.
      Second, during a two-year information program, physicians, mainly general practitioners,
      carers in and outside institutions, associations and families will be informed on cancer
      frequency, on cancer particularities and on cancer detection in PWIDs by the mean of
      documents, mails and e-mails, meetings and a website providing all available useful
      information on cancer in PWIDs. Third, characteristics of tumors observed during the three
      years after the beginning of the intervention will be statistically compared to the
      corresponding tumors before the intervention. This will be done especially for colon cancer
      and breast cancer using the TNM stage and the used therapeutic means. On the basis of the
      first part of the study, if a significant difference on stage at diagnosis and treatment is
      observed compared to the general population, other tumors will also be included in the
      comparison, if relevant.
