      other is the new method of NIRS - near infrared spectroscopy in patients with critical limb
      ischemia (CLI) undergoing invasive treatment (surgical or endovascular).

      The NIRS probe has been used to measure tissue oxygenation in the cerebral circulation up to
      now. While TCPO2 is the established method for measuring tissue oxygenation in patients with
      CLI to evaluate the potential for wound healing.
