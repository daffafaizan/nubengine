      far less than that of mechanical ventilation, antibiotics and other medical treatment, the
      use of parenteral nutrition, etc., and it is often not until the premature infants are enough
      mature and stable, or even before discharge that the caregivers pay attention to the problem
      of oral feeding. At this time, the corrected gestational age of premature infants is almost
      36 weeks, but in fact the study shows that preterm infants have the ability of self feeding
      when they are about 32 weeks old. And oral feeding is very helpful to improve their
      nutritional status, reduce the use of parenteral nutrition and other forms of enteral
      nutrition, prevent complications and shorten the length of stay. Therefore, this study plans
      to use a new process to promote oral feeding and to verify whether it is feasible to earlier
      attainment of full oral feeding in premature infants.
