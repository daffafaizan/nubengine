      occupational therapy in the treatment of PD using the Revised Self-Report Assessment of
      Functional Visual Performance (R-SRAFVP) as the primary outcome measure. This tool assesses
      33 vision-dependent ADLs ranging from personal care, leisurely activities, clothing
      management, meal preparation, etc. Patients are able to rank their ability to complete these
      tasks as independent, minimally difficult, moderately difficult, greatly difficult, unable,
      or not applicable. This will allow us to capture potential changes in the patient's ability
      to complete vision-specific ADLs following low vision occupational therapy. In addition, we
      will also evaluate quality of life using the Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39), to
      compare this broad outcome measure with the R-SRAFVP.
