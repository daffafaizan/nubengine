      dietary or a dutasteride intervention that they will consume for the first 6 months. After 6
      months, all men will have a combined intervention of dutasteride and diet to complete
      follow-up of 12 months. This will allow us to study interactive effects.

      Dietary intervention consists on a high w-3 long-chain fatty acids diet without supplement
      and to reduce intake of saturated and trans fatty acids.

      Prostatic biopsies will be taken at time of diagnosis and at 6 and 12 months after the
      beginning of the study. Blood will be drawn before each prostate biopsy session and urine
      will be collected before each prostate biopsy and after digital rectal examination.
