      acute coronary syndromes (ACS), acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF), warfarin
      intoxication, acute pulmonary edema, acute aortic dissection, chest pain, pulmonary embolism
      and syncope will be included. There will be not exclusion criteria. The inclusion criteria
      will be followed by definition of each illness described in recent guidelines. Investigators
      estimated annually over than 500 cases with ACS/chest pain, 300 cases of ADHF, 200 cases of
      aortic dissection, 200 of pulmonary embolism, 200 cases of warfarin intoxication, 100 cases
      of syncope and 150 of acute pulmonary edema. Clinical data, electrocardiographic and
      echocardiographic findings, laboratory results and prognosis will be related. Routine of
      treatment will be defined by each center. The analysis includes minimum, medium and maximum
      values. Variables will be adjusted according with each diagnosis and all data will be
      included using the REDCap digital data entry. Probabilities will be determined by logistic
      regression and will be considered significate when p < 0.005. Prospectively, investigators
      will use the Cox model to calculate associations.
