    
      This study is designed as a prospective pilot study of women presenting to the Urogynecology
      clinic with urgency urinary incontinence symptoms who are offered treatment with a standard
      of care anticholinergic medication for six weeks. The patient will be asked to provide a
      clean catch urine sample and blood draw. Study participants will fill out a Urinary Distress
      Inventory-6 (UDI-6) questionnaire at baseline and keep a bladder diary before starting the
      anticholinergic medication.

      The urine will be assessed by enhanced urine cultures and DNA sequencing for urinary
      microbiome along with inflammatory mediators in the urine. Inflammatory mediators in both the
      blood and urine will be measured using immuonenzyme assays.

      Measurements for microbiome will be repeated for all patients at 6 weeks. Baseline urinary
      symptoms at enrollment and variation of symptoms after 6 weeks of anticholinergic treatment
      will be assessed using the UDI-6 questionnaire and a bladder diary.
