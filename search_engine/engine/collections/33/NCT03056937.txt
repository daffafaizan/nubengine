      individuals with metabolic syndrome. Interestingly, bariatric surgery attenuates the
      peripheral metaboreflex. Obese individuals have impaired inspiratory muscle function, which
      can be reversed by the reduction in body weight. Therefore, bariatric surgery could attenuate
      inspiratory metaboreflex in metabolically healthy obese individuals and obese individuals
      with metabolic syndrome. Objectives: To investigate the effects of bariatric surgery on
      inspiratory metaboreflex in metabolically healthy obese individuals and in obese patients
      with metabolic syndrome. Patients and Methods: A sample comprising of 15 obese subjects with
      metabolic syndrome, 15 obese subjects without metabolic syndrome and 15 healthy nonobese
      individuals. These subjects will be submitted to pulmonary function, respiratory muscle
      strength, inspiratory muscle resistance, exercise tolerance, quality of life, autonomic
      cardiovascular control and the inspiratory metaboreflex evaluation. The evaluations performed
      in obese patients with and without metabolic syndrome pre-surgery will be repeated 6 months
      after bariatric surgery.
