      and environmental factors serve as disease triggers. Many studies have indicated that
      alterations in the gut microbiota are important environmental factors in the development of
      inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Investigators systematically performed a comparative
      analysis of the gut microbiota in GD patients and healthy controls before and found that gut
      microbiota changed between GD patients and healthy controls.But there are few articles on the
      relationship between intestinal microbiota and drug treatment of GD, so Investigators
      explored the relationship between intestinal microflora and methimazole treatment for GD.
