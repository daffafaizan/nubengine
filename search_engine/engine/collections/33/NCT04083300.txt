      cancer survivors. This may in turn lead to more late effects and many have to deal with
      long-term consequences of the disease and its' treatment. Returning to everyday life and to
      work is often an important part of returning to normal life for cancer survivors. There is
      increasing knowledge concerning late effects, but there is still lack of knowledge concerning
      the life of those experiencing late effects. There is a need for more knowledge about late
      effects' impact on the return to work prosess, physical activity and quality of life over
      time. Both quantitative and qualitative methods will be utilized. Standardized questionnaires
      will provide information on the effect of the intervention over time, in addition to quality
      of life over time. Sensewear armband will provide information about their physical activity
      over time. Official register data from the Norwegian Labour and Welfare Administration (the
      NAV administration) will provide us information about the work- and benefit situation through
      the whole follow-up period of 6-8 years. The register data include information about type of
      social benefits (sick-leave benefit, work assessment allowance (WAA), disability pension,
      unemployment benefit and retirement pension), as well as information about occupation, income
      and sick leave diagnosis. Focus group interviews will give us insight in the cancer survivors
      own experiences with quality of life over time, the transition from the specialist health
      services to the primary health care and the follow-up in the municipalities.
