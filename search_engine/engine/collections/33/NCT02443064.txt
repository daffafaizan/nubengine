    
      Study design:

      A multi-center, non-controlled, open-labeled observational study

      Research objectives

      Primary objective:

      To explore the PK/PD target value (AUIC) of vancomycin in the treatment of MRSA septicemia
      and endocarditis in Chinese patients.

      Secondary objective:

      To detect the therapeutic efficacy and safety of vancomycin in the treatment of MRSA
      septicemia and endocarditis in Chinese patients.

      To exam the relationship between the Cmin of vancomycin and its efficacy in the treatment to
      MRSA septicemia and endocarditis.

      To explore the relationship between MRSA molecular type and vancomycin therapeutic efficacy

      Medicine and administration

      Drug:

      Vancomycin

      Dosing:

      15~20 mg/kg, IV, q 12~8h (or 1 g, IV, q12~8h) for adult patient with normal renal function;
      Dosage should be adjusted by blood creatinine clearance in patients with impaired renal
      function; Administration routeï¼š 1~2 h/ dosing, IV

      Drug combination:

      Drug combination is not recommended for patients with simple MRSA infection; Rifampicin can
      be combined in case of MRSA artificial valve endocarditis; Anti-G- antibacterial agents can
      be combined in case of concurrent G- bacterial infections.

      Duration:

      Septicemia: 2~4 weeks Endocarditis: 6~8 weeks
