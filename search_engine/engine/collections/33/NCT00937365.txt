      United States it is thought of as a normal constituent of pregnancy. However, in Europe low
      back pain associated with pregnancy is treated. In the United States pregnancy-related low
      back pain is thought to resolve with birth. However about 1/3 of women who experience
      pregnancy-related low back pain continue to experience back pain for one year postpartum.
      Those women whose low back pain persists into the postpartum period are more at risk of
      experiencing comorbidities such as postpartum depression.

      In the extrauterine life maternal pain limits a mother's ability to securely attach with her
      child. Furthermore, interpretation of pain intensity is influenced by the type of attachment
      the individual has with her parents. Little is known how maternal pain may influence
      intrauterine attachment. Similarly, heart rate variability is influenced by pain and by
      spinal manipulation in non-pregnant populations. However, normal non-pregnant patterns of
      heart rate variability are altered during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy, and
      little is known about why this happens or what this means.
