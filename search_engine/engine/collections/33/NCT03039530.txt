      attachment, parenting, and the development and health of her children. The negative effects
      of PPD on offspring can include an increased risk of insecure attachment, poorer cognitive,
      language, and behavioral development, as well as an increased risk of emotion regulatory
      problems. To determine if PHNs can effectively deliver group CBT for PPD that is superior to
      postnatal care as usual, the investigators will proceed with a randomized controlled trial
      (RCT). Women in the treatment group will attend a 9-week group CBT intervention delivered by
      trained PHNs. Those in the control group will receive standard postnatal care.

      This RCT will compare the effects of group CBT to postnatal care as usual on maternal
      depression, anxiety, mother-infant attachment, parenting, healthcare utilization and social
      support, as well as infant development, emotion regulation, and healthcare utilization
