      result in improved glucose utilization, altered insulin signaling and decreased inflammatory
      responses. We propose to examine the impact of molecular DAG species accumulation on glucose
      utilization, insulin signaling and inflammation in skeletal muscle from morbidly obese
      subjects before/after 10% weight loss facilitated by Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB). We will
      compare these results to those from a control, normal weight cohort

      The detected differences in DAG molecular species, insulin action, inflammatory responses
      between normal and obese subjects (before/after weight loss) will emphasize pathways
      coordinately altered as a consequence of adiposity and RYGB surgery. The primary endpoints
      for this study will be: Insulin sensitivity (glucose Rd, insulin levels, DAG mass, DAG
      species amounts).Secondary endpoints will be: FFA levels, inflammatory cytokine production,
      and insulin signaling in skeletal muscle.
