      valgus with increased intermetatarsal angles treated with a proximal open wedge osteotomy
      with LPS system versus proximal wedge osteotomy? Is there a difference in surgical times or
      surgeon procedure preference in the treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe
      hallux valgus with increased intermetatarsal angles treated with a proximal open wedge
      osteotomy with LPS system versus proximal wedge osteotomy? Is there a difference in
      complication rates of adult patients with moderate to severe hallux valgus with increased
      intermetatarsal angles treated with a proximal open wedge osteotomy with LPS system versus
      proximal wedge osteotomy?
