      microbiome composition in obese/pre-diabetic adolescents after glucose ingestion, followed by
      an oral fat tolerance test on a separate visit. Lipoprotein abnormalities and intestinal
      biomarkers, post-lipid ingestion, will also be evaluated. The primary aim is to assess the
      role of inflammation in insulin resistant conditions (i.e., obesity and pre-diabetes) and the
      subsequent development of disease, such as type 2 diabetes (T2D) and cardiovascular disease
      (CVD), in the adolescent population.
