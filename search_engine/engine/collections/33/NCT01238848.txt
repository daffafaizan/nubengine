      regarding its treatment. Hypertonic saline has been proposed as useful treatment in these
      children, bur information is still controversial.

      The aim is to asses that using Nebulized Hypertonic Saline with bronchodilators (albuterol)
      may reduce the days of hospitalization and improve clinical outcomes in patients with acute
      bronchiolitis, compared with using Normal Saline with albuterol.
