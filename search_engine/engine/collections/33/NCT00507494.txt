      a risk factor for graft dysfunction, graft loss and increased mortality of patients.
      Inflammatory reactions within the graft and proteinuria are considered as pathogenetic
      mechanisms.

      Recent studies indicated that pioglitazone might have beneficial effects on the urinary
      protein excretion of type 2 diabetic patients with diabetic nephropathy and was able to
      reduce systemic inflammation.

      This lead to the hypothesis that pioglitazone could improve proteinuria of kidney transplant
      patients with diabetes.

      transplant recipients in a cross over study.
