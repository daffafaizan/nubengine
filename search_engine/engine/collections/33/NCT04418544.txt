      Analysis (VFA) Algorithm developed by Soniphi can screen for the COVID-19 condition from
      voice recordings. Patients eligible for the study are those being tested for COVID-19 based
      on molecular diagnostic testing of specimens obtained by nasal or nasopharyngeal swab.

      No clinical decisions will be based on the recordings. The results of the algorithm analysis
      will not be made available to the subjects or their healthcare providers during or after the
      study.
