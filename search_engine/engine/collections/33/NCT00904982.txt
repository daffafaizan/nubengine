    
      Eligible subjects will be enrolled in one of the 4 arms of the RCT and followed for 6 months,
      with the primary outcome of out-of-range INRs. Subjects will be given a Med-eMonitor to
      connect to their home phone line. For all subjects, these will be used to measure daily
      adherence. Subjects in the incentive group will be eligible for a daily lottery prize only
      if, prior to the lottery being resolved, their adherence device has registered adherence to
      their prescribed warfarin regimen. Subjects in the MM group will have the reminder/feedback
      features of the Med-eMonitor turned on to provide reminders to take their warfarin as
      prescribed and standardized messages that will be used to provide feedback in response to
      their adherence. Subjects in the combined group will be exposed to both the lottery and the
      activated Med-eMonitor. This trial is a randomized controlled trial.

      Both men and women who are at least 18 years of age and have been prescribed anticoagulation
      medication are eligible to participate.
