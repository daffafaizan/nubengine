      morphine consumption in patients underwent VATS surgery with ICNB was calculated. The mean
      cumulative morphine consumption was 15Â±8 mg of patients underwent VATS with ICNB. We assume
      the difference between ICNB and ESPB group reach 5 mg and aim for a power of 95 % and a risk
      of 0.05 for a type-1 error, at least 42 for each group needing to be recruited. 50 patients
      for each group, total 100 patients will be collected to avoid dropouts. Patient will be
      allocated to one of the trial groups using a computer-generated random number table once the
      consent was approved. First group is ICNB group and the second group is ESPB group.

      The general anesthesia agents, induction process and routine care are the same for both
      groups. Once aforementioned routine cares are done, the patient will be turn into lateral
      decubitus position. Echo-guided ESP block will be performed after patients are turned into
      lateral decubitus position in ESP group; on the other side, local anesthetics will be
      injected at incision site and intrathoracic intercostal nerve block will be performed in ICNB
      group right after the surgeon makes the incision site and get into chest cavity.

      Pain score (VAS) and cumulative morphine consumption will be recorded in PACU, postoperative
      24H, 48H, and before discharge. Recovery condition will be evaluated via QoR-15 questionnaire
      in postoperative 24H, furthermore, we will follow up the patient's pain and recovery status 3
      months after the operation. After collecting above data, the effect of ESP group and ICNB
      group on acute pain relieve, chronic pain control and recovery enhancement will be evaluated.
