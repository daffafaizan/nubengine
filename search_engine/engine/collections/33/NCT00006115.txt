      followed by irinotecan, leucovorin calcium, and fluorouracil in terms of progression free
      survival in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. II. Evaluate these treatment regimens
      in terms of overall survival, response rate, toxicity, and quality of life in this patient
      population.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive 4 courses of oxaliplatin IV and
      leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours on day 1 followed by fluorouracil IV continuously over 46
      hours. Following the initial 4 courses of therapy, patients receive 4 courses of irinotecan
      IV over 30-90 minutes and leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours on day 1 followed by
      fluorouracil IV continuously over 46 hours. Courses repeat every 2 weeks in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Quality of life is assessed every 8 weeks.
      Patients are followed every 3 months until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-39 patients will be accrued for this study over 12 months.
