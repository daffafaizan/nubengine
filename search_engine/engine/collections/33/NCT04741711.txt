      A. To assess the effect of therapeutic management guided by pulmonary ultrasound and inferior
      vena cava assessment on the risk of cardiovascular death and hospitalization for heart
      failure at 30 days.

      B. Describe the proportion of ultrasound congestion (pulmonary and inferior vena cava data)
      in patients free from clinical congestion at baseline in the intervention group and in all
      patients at D30 visit.

      C. Evaluate the association of ultrasound congestion (pulmonary and inferior vena cava
      assessment) with serum concentrations of natriuretic peptides at baseline and D30 visit.

      D. Evaluate the association of variations in ultrasound congestion (pulmonary and evaluation
      of the inferior vena cava) and variations in natriuretic peptides between baseline and D30
      visit.

      E. Compare the proportion of ultrasound and clinical congestion in patients in the
      intervention group and in the control group at baseline and on D30 visit.
