    
      Note: The study will utilize an adaptive study design with an interim analysis at 40
      volunteers (20 v 20) with the possibility of adding an additional 20 volunteers to the study
      (10 v 10) if the criteria for futility or clear effect are not met.

      The criteria are; stop and reject null hypothesis if t > 2.490 and stop and accept null
      hypothesis if t < 1.033. If the t falls between these values an additional 20 volunteers (10
      v10) will be recruited. The decision to stop or additional volunteers will be based on the
      incretin effect (primary outcome).
