      and allergic reactions that occur during oral desensitization to foods and will enhance the
      development of oral tolerance in patients with severe milk allergy. Once desensitized to
      milk, children will be able to tolerate milk in a Double Blind Placebo Controlled Food
      Challenge.

      The study will also evaluate whether Xolair provides a robust durability of tolerance once
      administration of Xolair is terminated. We will examine the specific immunological mechanisms
      that mediate oral tolerance in children undergoing oral milk desensitization

      The trial will be conducted in three parts: (1) pre-treatment with Xolair for 8 weeks, (2)
      oral desensitization to cow's milk from weeks 9-16 and continued treatment with Xolair for 8
      weeks, and (3) double blind placebo controlled food challenge to milk.
