      I. To evaluate the efficacy of single agent selinexor as measured by progression free
      survival (PFS) in patients with relapsed chemotherapy-sensitive small cell lung cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the objective tumor response rate and disease control rate as determined by
      radiographic response.

      II. To evaluate the overall survival (OS) in patients with relapsed small cell lung cancer.

      III. To evaluate safety and tolerability of single agent selinexor in these patient
      populations.

      IV. Comparison between each patient's time to progression (TTP) on selinexor with the TTP of
      his/her previous therapy(ies).

      V. To evaluate correlative endpoints including tumor biopsy and analysis of secreted factors,
      leukocyte ribonucleic acid (RNA) analysis.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Analysis of secreted factors (nerve growth factor [NGF], brain-derived neurotrophic factor
      [BDNF]).

      II. Tumor biopsy (baseline and cycle 2).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive selinexor orally (PO) twice weekly. Courses repeat every 21 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up monthly for 3 months, every 3
      months for 1 year, and then every 6 months thereafter.
