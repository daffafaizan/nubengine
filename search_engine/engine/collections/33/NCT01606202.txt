      to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of GW-1000-02 in central neuropathic pain
      associated with spinal cord injury. Patients were screened to determine eligibility and
      completed a seven to 21 day baseline period. Patients then returned to the centre for
      assessment, randomisation and initial dosing. Visits occurred at the end of treatment week
      one and at the end of the study (treatment week three) or upon withdrawal. Throughout the
      study, patients were permitted to take paracetamol as escape analgesic to relieve
      breakthrough pain. Patients in this study could elect to be screened for an open label
      extension study of GW-1000-02.
