      than 90% of esophageal cancer is squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). The incidence of esophageal
      cancer is ranked sixth and the mortality rate ranks fourth in China. At present, the
      first-line treatment of advanced esophageal cancer is mainly based on the combination of
      paclitaxel, cisplatin and fluorouracil. After the failure of first-line treatment, there is
      no standard second-line treatment. The investigators designed a multicenter, single-arm,
      open-label phase â…¡ clinical trial of anlotinib combined with sindilimab as second-line
      treatment for advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC).
