      rapid induction of necrosis followed by neutrophil-mediated, antibody-dependent cellular
      cytotoxicity (ADCC) of residual lesion. As the ingenol mebutate infiltrates the cell
      membrane, it increases intracellular Ca2+ concentration which leads to mitochondrial swelling
      and disruption of mitochondrial membrane within hours. The release of intra-mitochondrial
      Ca2+ into the cytoplasm leads to depletion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and a rapid
      induction of cell death by necrosis. This process occurs within 1 hour of application, which
      explains why the treatment period requires only 2 or 3 days of treatment. As the next phase,
      the cellular necrosis is accompanied by a robust inflammatory response through the release of
      proinflammatory cytokines from skin cells and tumor cells undergoing necrosis. The release of
      these proinflammatory cytokines into the dysplastic cells mediates the process of neutrophil
      recruitment through paracrine signaling and activation of endothelial cells. Here, the
      neutrophil mediated ADCC occurs, where activated neutrophils attach to the fragment,
      crystallized (Fc) parts of antibodies of dysplastic cells and destroys the residual
      dysplastic epidermal cells. In this way, the ingenol mebutate eradicates any residual tumor
      cells and prevents recurrence of actinic keratosis.As described above, the rapid effect and
      dual mechanism of action of ingenol mebutate gel allows not only a short-course therapy (2 or
      3 days of application) for the elimination of actinic keratosis but also, the benefit for
      eradication of any residual lesions preventing the recurrence and the progression of AK into
      squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).
