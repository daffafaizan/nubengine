    
      The study is intended as a pilot observational study for evaluation of a new risk scoring
      method, CADScor System, is relevant for assessment of CAD in the DB2-patient.

      The primary end point will be to document that the hypothesis of combining the CADScor System
      measure with other patient profile data will increase the accuracy of the method for
      determination of risk of presence of CAD.

      The secondary endpoint will be to show that a receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC)
      of > 80% for correct determination of presence of CAD will be achieved.

      The further objective of the study will be to confirm the relevance of performing a large
      scale study with equivalent objectives.

      As controls in the study will be applied CT angiography, CT-calcium and resting and drug
      induced CT-scintigraphy.

      It is assumed that 15-20 of enrolled patients in the study will suffer from CAD.
