      cause pain and anxiety for patients. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of
      use of music and stress ball to reduce pain and anxiety during lithotripsy. This was a single
      center parallel-randomized controlled trial. The study sample consisted of a total of 120
      patients who applied to lithotripsy unit of urology clinic in a training and research
      hospital in Turkey between April and September 2014. The patients were randomly divided into
      three groups. The patients in group-I (control group) were not interfered, while group-II was
      given stress ball into their palms in order to squeeze and group-III was listened to the
      music chosen by themselves with a headset during the lithotripsy procedure. Data were
      collected using the Patient Information Form, Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), and State Trait
      Anxiety Inventory (STAI-SA).
